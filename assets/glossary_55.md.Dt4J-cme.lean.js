Anything he writes is first class. It is very educational and informative."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's work has given me a totally new and very positive impression of Harry Truman and his accomplishments. McCuillough paints him as a man of great honesty who recognizes his duty, then does it with dedication and persistence. Anyone who is interested in how American policy played in the post-WWII world will benefit greatly from this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I have always regarded Mr Truman as one of the truly great presidents of the Twentieth Century and Mr McCullough's opus has brought him to life. From the early days in Missouri to the tumult of World War II Mr McCullough's narrative shows that rarest of creatures - an honest politican. Truman did not shy away from the tough decisions from dropping the A bomb, recognising the State of Israel or sacking General MacArthur all made without regard to the personal consequences always for the national interest.Love him or hate him Give 'em Hell Harry comes vividly to life through the pages of this book. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to study mid-Twentieth Century history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite the length of the book, I have actually read it twice. It is a well-organized biography of an excellent man. McCullough's writing style is impressive without any signs of pretentiousness."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having just finished McCullough's biography of John Adams, I thought I would next read the other book for which he won a Pulitzer Prize, \\"Truman.\\" I have had a certain admiration for Truman since reading Merle Miller's \\"Plain Speaking\\" and remembering newspaper stories of him out walking reporters in Independence in the 1960s. I recommend this book for any fan of American history who wants to learn about one of the greatest presidents of the 20th century. As president, his proposals or decisions continued to affect life in the US long afterward - the Atomic Age, Containment, civil rights, the CIA, universal health care, intervention in Southeast Asia...As he did in \\"John Adams,\\" McCullough clearly shows admiration for his subject as a man and president. The book is extensively researched and documented. McCullough spent several years reviewing documents, interviewing relatives, friends, former staff and contemporaries. He was even able to review the infamous Merle Miller interview tapes. The book is filled with many \\"inside\\" conversations and details giving color to the major and minor decisions and turning points in Truman's life and career.I found, however, that the overall story was less compelling than John Adams. As interested as I was in learning about Truman, his early life and how he made his major decisions as president, there were points where the reading dragged. It may have been details that were not really important to the story or unanswered questions. For example, after JFK's funeral, Truman and Eisenhower talked for an hour in Blair House. There is no mention of what they talked about. Was it because there was no record made by anyone? Was it the final stage of the reconciliation between the two that McCullough mentioned late in the book? I think that it is important, but McCullough does not elaborate.After reading \\"Truman,\\" I find Truman more of a paradox. He held himself to the highest standards, but tolerated less than scrupulous behavior from his appointments, many times at a high cost to his public image. He was from an inherently conservative small town, but he embraced a liberal political philosophy beyond the \\"New Deal.\\" He like to say that he was a country boy and that he never wanted to be president, but relished in the attention that the presidency brought him."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Great read, I would reccomend this book to any student of history. Truman the man, was one of the great men of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Another great effort by McCullough who ranks among our greatest historians. To be honest, I avoided this book for some time just because of the size of it; and I didn't really think President Truman warranted that type of treatment. But McCullough's books are always a pleasure.While McCullough often seems to be a little too pro Truman, the book is like Truman, fair and to the point. The book takes Truman from his early days in Missouri to the Senate, the White House and beyond into retirement.We get a close up view of the decision to drop the atomic bomb in World War II, implement the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift, and fire Gen. Douglas McArthur. So much of what happened during the Cold War, was the result of policies and decisions made during the Truman presidency.The book is huge, and I am actually a little puzzled that the publishers did not elect to publish in two parts - the first ending with Truman being catapulted (totally unprepared) to the White House and the second dealing with his Presidency and beyond. But in fairness, both halves of the book are terrific."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I found this book to be excellent. The author brought to life a president whom I knew little about. It is not by accident that this book won the Pulitzer prize. It is a long book almost 1,000 pages but brings to life a magnificent American. It also brings to life the people who were his friends and enemies: Dean Acheson, Douglas McArthur, Ike Eisenhower, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin. The amount of research the author had to do to compose this book is incredible. It also was very enlightening in understanding all the challenging issues Truman had to face during his presidency.It was well worth the time in reading."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Writing a complementary review is the least I could do for Mr. McCullough, who reportedly researched Truman for 10 years before finishing his book. Thinking more deeply into this, can you believe you can get 10 years of a man's labor for 11.21$ (on the amazon kindle)????.Truman is an outstanding book, an absolute Tour de Force, similar in scope and power to other recently written biographies, \\"Team of Rivals,\\" by Doris Kearns Goodwin (which also won the Pulitzer prize) and \\"Snowball,\\" by Alice Schroeder.The book's greatest strength is the depth of research done...that shows how a young man, a farmer, without a college degree, but with tremendous integrity, rises to president of the United States...a book which covers a vast amount of terrifically interesting American history during, especially, the period of WWII, from the unique perspective of Harry Truman. An ancient Chinese curse reads, \\"may you live in interesting times.\\" Well, Truman was the president in some very, very interesting times..."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a massive biography that is all-encompassing yet intimate, shrewd yet warm, history-laden yet immensely entertaining. All the well-deserved praise and Truman's accomplishments have been detailed below, so I will just discuss how much I was able to appreciate it. First you have the man himself; Truman was a simple man who was anything but, and a man who was derided for not being a college-educated intellectual, yet had the precious sagacity that led America through its most challenging times near the end of WWII and the Korean War. If this were a novel he would be an unbelievable protagonist- here he is a powerful yet incredibly accessible man elevated to greatness through circumstance and his God-given good heart and common sense. It was this Missouri-bred humility which earned the respect of Stalin and Churchill, and led to a stunning victory in 1948. Next is McCullough's writing style, which here is particularly engaging; major world events like the atom bomb, the Berlin Airlift, and the Potsdam Conference are mixed in with human stories of Truman being subservient to his world-weary wife, or writing a condemnatory letter to a journalist who panned his daughter's opera performance. Another fascinating aspect of this book is the insane series of events which Truman had to face during his time in office, and how when all was said and done he never stopped being an American hero for so many of us. The overall effect here is of deep reverence to a major historical figure, told through a masterpiece of scholarship. This is a must for anyone interested in the art of biography and especially for those with even a passing interest in American/world history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's biography of our 33rd president is a riveting portrait of a common man thrust into the most powerful position in the world, and triumphing brilliantly. As always, McCullough brings his considerable skills as an historian and storyteller to his subject, making \\"Truman\\" a wonderful read from beginning to end.Truman's humble origins as a Missouri farmer are brought to life, as is his honorable service as an artillery captain in World War I. McCullough accurately presents Truman's involvement with the corrupt Pendergast machine and his continued loyalty to Tom Pendergast ever after the boss' conviction for corruption. Truman's career in the senate and his unexpected selection by FDR to be his running mate in 1944 play out like supreme political drama, especially McCullough's presentation of the Democratic conventions of the era.But its Truman's assumption of the presidency upon FDR's death that makes the reader hold his breath. Truman's still-controversial decision to drop the atomic bomb, his overseeing of the Marshall Plan, and his perseverance through the Berlin blockade and the beginning of the Cold War, all in his first term, makes for fascinating reading. Truman's bid for reelection in 1948 is equally fascinating as no one at the time thought he had a chance against the Republican nominee, Thomas Dewey. McCullough examines Truman's actions during his second term including the Korean War, the Soviet attainment of atomic weapons, the 'loss' of China, and his dealings with problematical cabinet members. The final chapters dealing with Truman's later years are poignant and equally fascinating.I had the privilege to hear Mr. McCullough speak at my graduation this last May shortly after finishing \\"Truman\\". The author's wisdom to learn the lessons of history is something that I, graduating with a Masters degree in history, could really appreciate. This book is a great place to begin learning those important lessons."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Haven't finished the book yet, but am enjoying every evening read. Good insight into politics.

However, the binding was exceptionally poor. Given the 1,100+ pages of the book, this paperback needs to be bound in a different fashion.

And Truman wins an Oscar, Tony, and Emmy all at once"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"After spending pretty much the course of the summer reading David McCullough's immense biography of Harry S. Truman, I must say that was time well spent. For the first time, I have a largely intact understanding of not only Truman's life and times, but of the forces and events that shaped him and the United States as well. Though Truman's term as president ended the year I was born, the decisions and actions taken by our 33rd president and his staff have reverberated throughout my own life.One need not pile on with any more plaudits or adjectives for the author or his biography for at this point I think everything has been stated. But what is most striking to me is just how much the world has changed since Truman's presidency and how our current crop of politicians are even more vile and odious than the worst of the lot in Truman's day. Reading about a man who strove to achieve the greater good rather than let his decisions be tempered by political motivations proved both startling and refreshing.McCullough may have burnished Truman's character with a bit more shine and polish than fitting the man himself, but he does not neglect Truman's flaws or humanity, which, in turn, makes this book more compelling. The vivid, memorable characters who play key roles in the story of Truman infuse this historical account with energy and realism and also elevate Truman's character and person. The details contained in this book, both their quantity and quality, require close attention and rereading, a testament to Mr. McCullough's tireless sleuthing and attention.Let's hope for everyone's sake that a similarly powerful, elegant biography of an American president will someday appear to take its place on the shelf beside this one."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Mr. McCullough's portrayal of Harry S. Truman (the S doesn't stand for anything) is nothing less of spectacular. A real American Dream story; growing up in the midwest in a modest, hardworking family, fighting in WWI as a commander of his MO outfit, to a real &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. The author takes you through his trials (bankruptcy), his annointment into the volatile world of Washington Politics, and ultimately through to the White House. There he dealt with the bomb, White House remodeling, Tom Dewey, and the Korean Conflict.David also takes a good look at Truman's policies from the beginning with his County seat, right on up to his Presidential Adminstration. Truman cemented his place in history with the bomb, and The Marshall Plan. He survived an assasination attempt, detested Hoover, and was the reason why there are pension plans for ex-presidents.The personal aspect of Truman's life doesn't go unnoticed. The undying loyalty he had to &quot;The Boss&quot;, his wife Bess, their daughter Margaret, and his mother, was tenderly and respectfully written about. This was proven when, he'd gotten to Washington, he was lead to a hotel room. Upon opening the door and finding a naked blonde woman on the bed, he turned an about face that would have done his old army commander proud.A must read. Whether you're reading about Presidential Biography, The Bomb, 20th Century politics, or you live in Missouri, put this in your collection. Give 'em hell."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough has written a brilliant and thoroughly researched portrait of a common man, who proved to be anything but common. McCullough captures the true essence of Harry S. Truman in this moving rendition of the man's life.Truman was at the center of some of the most important issues of the twentieth century, including the decision to drop two atomic bombs to end the war with Japan, the Marshall Plan, the Fair Deal, civil rights, medicare, Korea (yes this turned out to be very important at the time, even though many thought it was a mistake), the Berlin airlift, the recognition of Israel, the United Nations, NATO, and so much more. No wonder the man as president has been recognized as one of the great presidents of all time. He did so much in his nearly eight years in office.Truman was truly a man of character, and before I read this book, I really didn't know much about him or his background. I only knew he had made the decision to drop the atom bomb on Japan and that he began the Korean war in which my father fought. I had no idea what kind of man he was: principled, kind, defiant, forthright, headstrong and loyal to a fault. He was also a decisive leader at a time when a decisive leader was desperately needed. And what was so striking to me, is how the the presidency never changed the man from his modest beginnings. Truman was one of a kind. A great American story of hard work and perseverance.I have to mention here that I read some of the one or two star comments, which thankfully they're not much of, but I had to laugh when someone had the ignorant audacity to state that McCullough's portrait of Truman was too one-sided, too subjective and there was not enough objectivity. Either that person doesn't have very good reading comprehension skills or never read the book, because I thought McCullough's rendering of Truman was very far reaching, very objective and showed the man's greatness and his flaws, through the eyes of his good friends and his enemies.In sum, I really loved this biography and the thousand pages went by very quickly for me.

There is no mention of any of the nine official Pearl Harbor attack tribunals occurring while Truman was Senator, Vice President, and President. While this information may not shine a completely positive light on Truman's involvement, omission is still curious. Consider the following:1. Senator Truman's Committee had jurisdiction over inadequate wiretap laws, which J. Edgar Hoover argued was a reason that the FBI's Hawaii wiretaps did not prevent the attack--a charge Senator Truman leveled at Hoover and the FBI.2. Vice Presidential candidate Truman authored an article for the August 26, 1944 Collier's magazine inferring that the Pearl Harbor commanders, Admiral Kimmel and General Short, were not on speaking terms. Admiral Kimmel taking exception to this \\"infamous lie\\" wrote a letter to Truman about his article to which Kimmel received no reply. Truman chose instead to respond via the press asserting the truth of his article, which nonetheless was being secretly refuted by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board (APHB). Many letters are quoted in this work, but not this one:280 Bronxville Road,Bronxville 8, N. Y.August 20, 1944Senator Harry S. Truman,Senate Office Building,Washington, D. C.My dear Senator Truman,In an article appearing under your name in Collier's Magazine of August 26, 1944, you have made false statements concerning my conduct as Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor prior to the Japanese attack.Your innuendo that General Short and I were not on speaking terms is not true. Your statements alleging failure to cooperate and coordinate our efforts are equally false. General Short and I, as well as our subordinates, coordinated the efforts of our commands in close, friendly, personal and official relationships.The real story of the Pearl Harbor attack and the events preceding it has never been publicly told. This has not been my decision. For more than two and a half years I have been anxious to have the American people know all the facts.The Roberts Report, upon which you rely, does not contain the basic truths of the Pearl Harbor Catastrophe. This is evident from the fact that no official action has ever been taken upon the basis of that Report. The Congress of the United States, of which you are a Member, has recognized the inadequacy of the Roberts Report by directing that the War and Navy Departments undertake a full investigation of the Pearl Harbor disaster.Until I am afforded a hearing in open court, it is grossly unjust to repeat false charges against me, when, by official action, I have been persistently denied an opportunity to defend myself publicly.I suggest that until such time as complete disclosure is made of the facts about Pearl Harbor, you refrain from repeating charges based on evidence that has never met the test of public scrutiny.I ask for nothing more than an end to untruths, and half truths about this matter, until the entire story is given to our people, who, I am convinced, will be amazed by the truth.I am releasing this letter to the press in the belief that the historic American sense of fair play will approve this action.Very truly yours/s/ H. E. KimmelRear Admiral, U.S.N. (Ret.)3. As President, Truman received the report of the APHB, which styled the famous American Note/Ultimatum of November 26, 1941 to Japan, as the \\"document that touched the button that started the war.\\" The Note was first written by Soviet spy Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Truman promoted White to head the International Monetary Fund over the objections of J. Edgar Hoover, who had evidence that White was a spy. Truman even tried to claim that the FBI wanted White promoted so as not to interfere with the FBI's spy investigation of White. An explanation that Hoover denied and publicly refused to let stand. Indeed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan would later write that Truman was \\"almost willfully obtuse,\\" i.e., unobservant, about the threat of Soviet espionage.Also as President, Truman ordered all government employees to volunteer relevant and material information to the Joint Congressional Committee (JCC) investigating the Pearl Harbor attack to include cryptographic material. Truman had to have known that his order was ignored. Truman later selected the Chairman of the JCC as his running mate in 1948.4. As Senator, Vice President, and President, Truman was effusive praising General Marshall, especially Marshall's integrity. No mention is made of Marshall's contribution to the Pearl Harbor disaster, or to Marshall's obvious dissembling before four Pearl Harbor investigations. Marshall's champion, Col. Henry Clausen, would later write that Marshall perjured himself and suborned perjury of his staff before the APHB.

While I knew a great deal about Truman before listening to this audiobook, I really felt that I needed to know more.David McCollough's treatment of Truman is friendly, but not overly rosy. The audiobook version I listened to was abridged. I assume that the areas that were not focused upon in the abridged edition are more fleshed out in the unabridged edition. (Note: this abridgement was not sloppily done - I didn't even notice it was abridged until about 3/4 of the way through the book - it just seemed like he was glossing over the activities of the New Deal Congress rather quicker than normal)Areas of particular focus in the abridged edition include Truman's family background and childhood. His World War I experiences, early political jobs, his association with Kansas City machine politics, Bess (of course!), his mother, how he was chosen to be Vice the decision to drop the atomic bombs, the Korean War, the decision to fire MacArthur and eulogies for Truman.The printed version of this book includes pictures, I am sure, which is a disadvantage of the audio version. However, that deficiency is more than made up for by the inclusion of real audiotaped quotes from Truman himself when possible. It is one thing to see a picture of Harry Truman, it is quite another to hear sections of his speeches in Truman's own voice - the way most Americans did at the time when they were delivered. It gives you a different sense of the man. A section of MacArthur's \\"Old Soldiers Fade Away\\" speech is also included, to the detriment of MacArthur, in my opinion. He sounds very snobbish and patrician. When compared to Truman, it makes you root for the Man from Independence all the more.A second strength of the audiobook is that it is read by the author himself. McCollough has a voice that I envy and enjoy to hear and he makes even the most slowest portions of the book flow by quickly and easily.I give this one a grade of A+.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I admit, I read this book not because I was fascinated with President Truman, but because I have enjoyed other books by McCullough.

And he is able to do it largely through the words of Harry Truman himself. McCullough's impressive narrative style, analytical ability, and superb research also helps to make this book an excellent read. This book, however, is long (1000 pages). But it hardly felt that way. I was entertained the whole way through and always looked forward to free time to read some more. The characters, events, and places were all real, and I had to sometimes remind myself that this is a work of non-fiction. When I picked up the book I felt as if I was transported to another time and place before my generation, a time and place that I learned to respect more thanks to this book. I was pulled into this book, that's how powerful this book is, and I now feel like a close friend of Harry Truman. I experienced the dialogue, significance, and weight of the decisions made by the Truman administration in his almost eight years in office. My admiration for President Truman, his humbleness, and his desire to do what is right grew tremendously throughout this book. This is research and historical storytelling at its best."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is so much more than the tale of the united States greatest President, it is an example of a man who was not born to be great but nonetheless was exceptional. Harry Truman was born in a very simple town to very simple, but extremely hardworking parents. I don't mean to imply that they were stupid, because they most certainly were not, they we just not caught up in much more than farming. Harry was smart and funny and sweet as a child but was no push over. He grew to me a man of convictions and the willingness to fight for those principles even if it meant his life.Harry Truman is an example for all of us in how to conduct ourselves and to never let our humble beginnings limit out desires or our potential. he worked hard, he read and he studied, but more than that he had a way of making up his mind and sticking with his gut feelings.When I read this book I only admired Harry Truman the President of the United States, but after reading this book I learned to care for Harry S. Truman the man.This book is a beautiful and uplifting biography of someone who truly deserves to have his story told, and their aren't man of those.In this day and age where, and the political climate we are in now, this book, and more importantly this man, is essential to read. Harry Truman, right or wrong, accepted responsibility and spoke plainly and honestly to the American public. It is refreshing and exhilirating compared to the politicians of today, in both parties. Reading this book actually made me believe, or want to believe, in the goodness of people who enter public service. Nowadays I wonder how many politics see this as public service? Harry Truman did. That is what makes this man worth reading about.Read this book and you will love life and respect the human potential just that much more."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The amazing thing about this book is that if it weren't a biography, I'd have dismissed it as too unbelievable and clicheed. Then again, maybe that's just a sympton of the times, where being a character seems to resonate more than having character.While I would agree that more could have been made of the dichotomy between his own personal integrity versus the corruption of many of those who backed him, I heartily disagree with those who would dismiss this as mere propaganda or sentimentality. All of Truman's many flaws are readily on display; McCullough does not gloss them over, but instead uses them as foils to the positive traits, and asks us to understand them together in our judgement of the man. The problem of balance comes about from the fact that, because so much of the material is based on Truman's own writings, his view of people (I nearly said characters) tend to be portrayed as fact, when I suspect the truth of it was far more complex. That he was right about Marshall and McCarthy is beyond doubt; Eisenhower, Wallace, Stevenson, and the rest, however, seem to have been shortchanged.While it is my personal belief that history has validated much of Truman's policy decisions, and this book often says as much, it would be a mistake for anyone to view this as a stand-alone work. While it is comprehensive as a biography, it is not so as a history or analysis of policy. The decisions he made - and the consequences thereof - are presented as how they reflect Truman's character and personality, and not the reverse. While this book is essential in understanding the developments of the Marshall Plan, Korean War, etc., it is by no means ABOUT these topics, and it would be a mistake to evaluate history on the basis of this book alone."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I just finished this awesome endeavor by McCullough. I had always admired Harry Truman (even though I am a conservative Republican) for being such a descisive President. McCullough underscores this facet of Truman's personality and highlights the loyalty, dependability, and dedication to the country that tipified his Presidency and his life. This book truly made me wish that Mr. Truman were running for President in 2000!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a terrific reality check for Americans as they move into an election year. While his era was not so long ago, it is impossible to imagine a President today being elected with Truman's CV.What is all the more amazing about this story is that his times were as complex, even more difficult, than today. After being on the job as Vice President for only a little more than 3 months, Roosevelt's (not completely unexpected) demise promoted Truman to the Presidency just as the leaders of the allied alliance were to meet in Potsdam. While there, the first nuclear bomb was tested. A few weeks after that, the Japanese surrendered. With the war over, all America went on strike (or so it seemed at the time). That crisis resolved, the UK melted down and de-colonization went into full swing. It just went on and on.I was surprised to learn that the 1948 election cost both parties, in total, less than $5 million. Was it really Joesph McCarthy who was the first to coin the phrase &quot;world wide web&quot; in 1951 to describe the communist conspiracy &quot;spun in Moscow&quot;?McCullough's contribution is that he put Truman in perspective. Based on what McCullough writes, it is surprising that more Americans do not consider Truman the most successful President ever.This is a well-written biography, and one that I would recommend highly."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As a small boy (age 12) Douglas MacArthur was a hero that I admired above most living men. When President Truman fired him I decided to hate Truman for the rest of my life. MacArthur came through San Francisco in an open car, one of many in a long line of official vehicles, and I was thrilled to find a spot atop a nearby tree along San Jose Avenue where I could see him \\"close up\\" as he passed by. High School and College history helped soften my disdain for President Truman but I found nothing in his life that caused me to assign him any true respect.If you read this book, you'll get to know Harry S. Truman as if he were a neighbor. You may not like him any more, or any less, but you'll know him much better. You may even, as I did, find good reason to respect the man himself."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As a republican thru and thru I came to this book with a HUGE bias against Trumann, namely that I remembered him being one of Jimmy Carter's hero's! However I was taking a long drive so I took the book on tape and WOW! David McCullough certainly demonstraits why he won the Pulizer Prize by taking a man I was inclined to dislike, who social politics I totally disagreed with and got me not only interested in the man but liking him.Harry as an officer in WWI was delightfully insightful.His rise in machine politics was fascinating proving, even to this reader, that sometimes good men do rise in machine systems.Harry's personal commitment to people who had stood by him even when politically costly showed much about his character.There seems little question that the Truman Commission contributed mightily to the war effort not so much in what it exposed but in the fear it inspired and hence the encouragement it gave to government contractors to do a good and honest job.The late presidential years were eclipsed by world events, so his inovations and refurbashment of the White House got little play but his contribution in perserving the structure cannot be understated.Truman was a man, a leader, a president besought with problems and difficulties as well as bad luck and some very poor choices. His popularity was very low by the time he left office, but history, at least David McCullough's has been kind to him.A very satisfying read on nearly every level"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"In many ways, the overused phrase \\"The Genuine Article\\" perfectly describes Harry Truman. It might as well have been coined for him. From his plain and unheralded upbringing to his even-keeled handling of the most powerful office in the land, Harry Truman was real. He was not a product of wealth or political nepotism, and he never forgot where he came from.This apt phrase can also be applied to this Pulitzer Prize-winning treatment of Truman given by the masterful David McCullough. Always shying away from hyperbole and resisting hagiography, McCullough has crafted an account of the life of a man who was consistenly underrated and oft forgotten.Truman was comfortable in the underdog position, and he gained much of his confidence from being judged as \\"too weak\\" throughout numerous endeavors in his life. He surrounded himself with people he trusted, and he never made a secret of those he did not trust. This type of openness is a rarity these days in politics, and is sorely missed. However, McCullough also makes it clear that the \\"cracker barrel plain\\" image of Truman was by no means conclusive. As with all great human beings, Truman had many sides, and few truly understood these different dimensions. It is truly fascinating to see a man who was consistent in his beliefs and actions both publicly and privately, and yet still maintained an ability to have so many differing thoughts and sides. His dedication to his lifelong partner and wife, Bess, is heartwarming and very rare in politics. She was considered his utmost advisor, in policy and privacy. He even resorted to publicly calling her \\"The Boss\\" in his famous train campaign (until she told him she would no longer be going by that name).McCullough also sheds light upon the amazing friendship and partnership between Truman and Dean Acheson. More than an advisor, Acheson was truly a friend to Truman, and this relationship lasted long after they both left Washington. Particularly fascinating are the letters exchanged between the two men very late in their lives, discussing a wide variety of topics, including fatherhood, travel, and of course, politics. The relationship is also interesting because the two men could not have been more different, stylistically and temperamentally.If \\"Mornings on Horseback\\" is not a definitive biography of Teddy Roosevelt's entire life or career, \\"Truman\\" is about as definitive and conclusive as could possibly be. Running around 1000 pages, this book is massive, but the story is so intriguing that the incredible length becomes an asset instead of a hindrance. You simply want the story to keep going, and much of this is due to the remarkable story itself, and much is due to the effective job done by McCullough. He brings each character alive, and reveals each situation and incident with adroit aplomb.The amazing thing about Harry Truman is that he morphed from a reluctant Vice President into an even more reluctant President, and finally into an elected victor. His passion, integrity and ability are all given ample space in this book. His vigor and physical health are examined and shown to have been great attributes to Truman in his exhausting position. Of course, this biography doesn't shy away from the controversies surrounding the man either, mainly focusing on his everlasting ties to the Pendergast labor machine in Missouri. But, to his credit, and despite all the bad press Truman received for it, he never forgot a friend, including Pendergast. Whether this was loyalty or corruption is for the reader to decide.There are far too many incidents and turning points to mention, and taken as a whole, this book is an amazing accomplishment that chronicles a life full of amazing accomplishments. This is well worth the invested time, and in style and detail still remains the standard by which all Presidential biographies should be judged."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was assigned to read a book of of a very long bibliography for my AP History class. Books of all eras, topics, and lengths were on the extensive list. Why would an already busy high school junior choose a 1000+ page book, you ask? To this day, I still cannot tell you why I did. I knew zilch about Harry Truman before cracking open the collosal book, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made. McCullough's indepth look at the President not only gives the reader facts about our leader in this turbulent time in American History, but at the man from Missouri, and his climb from a small farmer to one of the most influential decision-makers the world has ever seen. McCullough's portrayal of Truman as a caring, yet sometimes hot-tempered man kept me enthralled late into the night. (Often past my bed time.) Truman is a must-buy for any history lover, and, after reading it, may make you have a new favorite President as it did for me.\\"To the best of my ability.\\" - Harry S. Truman"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman by David McCullough is a biography of one of our most extraordinary Presidents, Ol' Give 'Em Hell Harry, the man who said, \\" the buck stops here.\\" Harry S. Truman, who's humble start in rule Missouri, with hard work, determination, and circumstance landed in the Oval Office of the White House.This is a tale of a man, told warmly with feeling. A story of a man who walked in the shadow of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a man who had to make a choice to use the Atomic Bomb, a man who proved himself, a man of uncommon vitality and strength of character. Reading this book, one gets to know Harry Truman, you feel emotion and see insight as the author sets the story and writes a telling tale.Harry Truman a man who married later in life because he didn't have the money. His work on the farm gave him strength and dogged optimism in the face of defeat, but much more was to come for Harry. Facing responsibilities such as had weighed on no man ever before and setting American politics and diplomacy, Harry Truman was treading a new age.The author has mastered Truman in this book, as no other has to date, and it shows throughout this book. This is the life of Harry Truman complete with all of the supporting characters as well... Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, his wife Bess Wallace Truman, General George Marshall, Joseph McCarthy and Dean Acheson. Harry Truman was responsible for the Truman Doctrine, NATO, the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan, but fired General Douglas MacArthur. \\"Truman,\\" shows Harry Truman to be complex, thoughtful, peppery when he needed to be and plainspoken.I really enjoyed reading this biography... like a grandfather telling a story that happened in his lifetime... with understanding and thoughtfulness."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S. Truman did not graduate from college. He failed at every business he ever entered. He didn't marry his wife unti his mid-30's because he felt he could not support her. He entered politics more as a way to earn a living than for any other reason. He owed his political career to the corrupt Pendergast Machine in St. Louis yet was scrupulously honest. Despite such humble beginnings, Truman rose to the Presidency and became one of the greatest in American history. By way of full disclosure I will reveal that I am a big admirer of Harry Truman. So is David McCullough and it shows in this excellent biography. While the book is a little slow as it covers Truman's early life (which was actually quite dull and ordinary) It picks up steam as Truman rises from local judge to Missouri Senator to Vice President and then to the residency on Roosevelt's death. It is here that the book really comes to life because the era of the Truman presidency, from 4/45 through 12/52 was one of the liveliest and most remarkable eras in the 20th century. Upon taking office, Truman had to face decisions relating to the ending of the war. Although Germany surrendered within weeks, Japan was far from finished and the invasion was being planned. When Truman was told the atomic bomb was available and could end the war immediately, he never hesitated to order its use. McCullough makes a strong argument that this decision was not only justified but essentially unopposed by all relevant figures within the government. Truman's plainspoken folksiness comes through such as the time at the Potstdam conference when Soviet foreign minister Molotov, a Stalin lackey, told Truman no one had ever spoken to him like that in his entire life. \\"Keep your agreements and you won't be spoken to like that.\\" Truman retorted. The rest of Truman's presidency was filled with momentous events and decisions. These include the breakdown of the wartime alliance and the beginning of the cold war with its first battle being the Soviet blockade of Berlin,the momentous creation of the Marshall Plan, and the formation of NATO. Truman's first term concluded with his decision that the U.S. would support the partition of Palestine thereby creating the state of Israel. In insisting on this position, Truman opposed the position of the entire State Department, including George Marshall, a man he admired more than any other. Marshall threatened to resign over this issue. Truman refused to let him.Of course the remarkable 48 election is chronicled in the book including Truman's insistence that the Party Platform include a civil rights plank, something Roosevelt would never agree to.It led to the walkout of the southern delagation. Finally, Truman's second term was consumed by the Korean War, including his conflict with Douglas McArthur. Truman's flaws are not whitewashed yet this author is a clear admirer and properly so in my opinion. In today's world where political courage seems non-existent, Truman is an example we can all look back on with admiration. He made his mistakes but always did what he thought was right and never had any regrets. The nation is lucky he became vice-president in 1944 and McCullough's excellent book which won a Pulitzer Prize is a must read. His writing is straightforward but every fact is meticulously documented. There is no made up dialogue or imagined scenes ala Edmund Morris. All fans of American history must read this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough worked 10 years on the research and writing of this comprehensive biography of America's president during the end of World War Two and our first leader during the crucial post-war period and the beginning of the Cold War, winning a highly deserved Pulitzer Prize for his effort. The breadth of McCullough's research was so thorough and his presentation so affecting that the reader concludes by feeling that he or she knew Harry Truman personally.McCullough traces Truman's roots in rural Missouri. He cites as a Truman milestone the World War One period when a bookish young man with notably poor vision distinguished himself as Captain of a National Guard unit. Ultimately Truman would rise to become a county judge. From there it was on to the U.S. Senate, the vice-presidency, and the assumption of the presidency upon Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death. McCullough reveals Truman's strong independence and unflinching courage. He had been a protege of Missouri political boss Tom Pendergast, who ultimately spent time in prison and was a highly controversial figure. When Pendergast died Truman attended his funeral, despite advice to the contrary, explaining that the former boss had always been helpful to him and that their relationship was absent of even a taint of corruption. Truman was tapped by FDR for the vice-presidency after achieving national attention as an independent investigator who uncovered government waste in chairing the Truman Committee.A major element of Truman's storybook life was what pundits refer to as the greatest upset in presidential politics, the incumbent president's stunning victory over Governor Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. McCullough colorfully recounts the train stop toward the end of Truman's whistlestop campaign when adviser Clark Clifford left the train and bought the latest news magazines, which carried predictions of leading political experts throughout the country. When a crestfallen Clifford observed that every political writer consulted predicted a Dewey victory, the adviser sought to keep the news from Truman, who shrewdly recognized what his adviser was doing. Instead of becoming gloomy or upset, Truman, after reading the predictions, replied crisply, &quot;I never thought those guys knew what they were talking about.&quot; Truman's confidence proved infectious as he scored a brilliant victory, proving the so-called experts wrong. McCullough captures Truman's uniqueness and stern mettle. Under his administration the UN came into being, NATO was created, the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan became reality, the U.S. headed a UN coalition fighting Communist aggression in Korea, and the Berlin Airlift was successfully achieved. It was a period of abundant foreign policy accomplishments achieved under the plain spoken man from Independence, Missouri."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It takes a charming schmoozer like Bill Clinton to make us fully appreciate the common man wisdom and character of Harry Truman.Truman had greatness thrust upon him, only he handled it a whole lot better than did Gerald Ford. Nothing and everything prepared him for the presidency, be it the &quot;failed&quot; haberdashery back home or his record of not losing a single man in his unit in World War II. Or his fights against corruption while having risen from one of the more corrupt political machines.Having written some excellent earlier historic works, McCullough moved to a higher level with this great book. It is both intricate and facile, detailed and friendly, historic and familiar. The reader can't help but develop an appreciation for the subject and the author."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I actually cried while reading this book. Harry S Truman comes alive on these pages and I found myself wondering &quot;why don't they make them like this anymore?&quot;. What a wonderful, strong man. Truly a President to respect. This book was a fascinating page turner. Probably the best biography I've ever read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The second Greatest President of the 20th Century and the Greatest Political Biography. One word describes both: Truman.Truman the man embodied all that is good in American politics - providing leadership both domestically and internationally when both were in desperate need for it and a personal life that exuded decency and integrity.Truman the book, by David McCulloch validates Emerson's maxim that &quot;There is no history, only biography&quot;. Incredibly well crafted, McCulloch's book at times reads like a novel. A well-deserved recepient of the Pulitzer Prize, &quot;Truman&quot; is a great read for even non-history buffs."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"While this is not a myth-creating book, you will find it impossible to read this biography and come away as anything less than a fan of a decent man who did his best under difficult circumstances. I have always respected McCullough's research and attention to detail, but this book is also just a cracking good read.Many have been brought up - perhaps by the educationocracy that still worships at the altar of Marxism and FDR - with the caricature of Harry Truman as a bumbler selected for his insignificance who fell into office and then screwed it up. He has also been portrayed in pro-military circles as the personification of foolish political interference in military matters; yet with his experience in World War I he had as much military experience in the most brutal conflict on record as any prior or subsequent President except those few who were career military men. FDR, by contrast, winner of the greatest war this nation ever fought, had no military service except as Secretary of a peacetime Navy, and as one of the richest men in America was hardly in a position to sincerely understand the problems of regular people.We all know of the Truman-Dewey polling fiasco, his decision to use the atom bomb, and probably of his conflict with MacArthur. But unless you are a history buff of that era, you do not know of his reluctant climb through the party machine, his financial dependence on his parents-in-law, his valiant service in the short but ugly experience of World War I, his creation of and service on the committee for overseeing waste and abuse during World War II, and Bess Truman's total unsupportiveness in his White House years. McCullough does not gloss over any of this, and indeed it is these experiences perhaps that shape Truman's character (something that many of our recent politicians lack utterly).Those of us who are accustomed to the imperial Presidencies, and the strange but never-investigated accrual of wealth by politicians of all classes who come into office as middle-class and leave office as multi-millionaires, will be astounded to learn that when he completed his term as President, he just went home to Independence and lived more or less on the financial edge, with a minimal pension after a lifetime in public service, and he was politically persecuted for the rest of his life by the Republicans because he was all that was left of the FDR administration that had persecuted THEM, and by the Democrats because he was all that was left of the FDR administration yet he was not FDR.Truman was a plain-spoken person who never lost track of his farming roots. For this reason the Eastern aristocracy looked down on him, even as they were embracing the principles of Marxism, and in the scholastic presses (which until recently were based almost exclusively in Boston and New York) he was denigrated because he was not the demigod Roosevelt (who as we now know was mostly a caricature himself by 1940). And since 1970 or so he has been overlooked by Republicans because they were not in search of a Democratic role model, and by today's anti-American Democrats because he inconveniently seemed to be quite sincere in actually believing in truth, justice and the American way.Perhaps the status of limitations for political correctness is about 50 years. In that case, now is the time to read McCullough's balanced portrait of a great American."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is the best biography I've ever read, and I've read many. My favorite part of the book is its lessons in leadership and decisionmaking. Truman walked up to the worst kinds of problems, faced them squarely, sought advice from his advisors, thought carefully, and then made prompt decisions based on the merits as he saw them. He knew he might occasionally err, but he was paid to decide, and once he decided he never looked back. He moved on to the next problem. No agonizing, no focus groups."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"To one who was a teen-ager in Texas during the Truman years and thus was taught how poor a President and man he was, this was a truly inspirational story of what a real man and President should be. He was probably the last really fine person to have held that office, with the likely exception of Dwight Eisenhower. McCullough, of course, is a surpassingly entertaining and thorough biographer."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I am neither a fan of history nor biographies, but this book blew me away. Don't be intimidated by its size; every page is worth it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough's strength is as a story teller. My favorites are his describing Truman's work on the Truman Committee, which vaulted HST to national prominence; detailing Truman's dash through the Capitol to learn of FDR's death; and re-creating the smoke-filled rooms in Chicago in 1944 where the party bosses anointed Truman as FDR's running mate and certain successor.McCullough clearly loves his subject and the breadth of this labor of love evokes Dumas Malone's six volume biography of Thomas Jefferson. Neither Malone nor McCullough has many negative words for his subject. McCullough offers some fair criticism of Truman--his indifference in selecting his running mate in 1948, his caving to Republican pressure on the loyalty oath, and his selection of Johnson as secretary of defense--an aberration in an otherwise luminous foreign policy team.McCullough sees Truman as the embodiment of 19th Century virtues of honesty, determination, modesty, and integrity and a personal vindication of government of the people. In so focusing on Truman's character, McCullough gives short shrift to the fundamental changes in the presidency over which Truman presided.This void is nicely filled by Robert Ferrel's &quot;Harry S. Truman,&quot; which lacks McCullough's narrative sweep. As much as I enjoyed McCullough's work, I regret that it completely overshadowed Professor Ferrel's analytically more satisfying work. Those interested in understanding Truman in historical context will benefit from Ferrel's careful and insightful scholarship."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"From the earliest pages of this gargantuan work, it is clear that David McCullough likes his suject. While this might be considered a venal sin in today's cynical iconoclast culture, the author somehow manges to support his admiration in this wonderful biography. McCullough's Truman is an ambitious but ethical human being, wrought with many of the faults which plague us all. What sets Truman apart was his ability to rise above adversity and ultimately truimph against overwhelming odds. McCullough has been accused of presenting a biased view of the former president, but a thorough reading of the text exhonerates both the author and his subject. Truman is presented as a descendent of that hardworking and sturdy pioneer class which has become the stuff of our folklore. When compared with the media-savvy and poll-obsessed politician of today's political scene, Truman is seen as a breath of fresh air. Moreover, even though McCullough's praise sometimes becomes cloying at times, Truman's positive qualities are more than confirmed by those who knew him best. If it is hard these days to imagine an honest politician, McCullough does a credible job of backing up Truman's reputation with proper documentation. Even when confronted with Truman's many faults, such as his political-machine beginnings, his border-state racism, and his unbridled opinions of others, Truman's virtues clearly outweigh his faults, as does this biography."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"In the middle of WW2, when Harry Truman becamepresident, people wondered how such an ordinaryman could ever become president: \\"If Harry Truman can be president,so could my next door neighbor. \\".But as David McCulloughs wonderful Truman biographyexplains - there is absolutely nothing wrong abouta \\"common man\\" becoming president. QuotingSenator Adlai Stevenson: \\"The 'lesson' of Trumans life,was a lesson about ourselves. An object lesson inthe vitality of popular government; an example ofthe society to yield up, from the unremarkable origins,the most remarkable man\\".From sunday school and own reading of the BibleHarry Truman knew many passages by heart:\\"Ye are the salt of the Earth.. Let your light so shinebefore men, that they may seee your good works.\\"and prayers like:\\"Oh! Almighty and Everlasting God, creator of heaven,Earth and Universe:Help me to be, to think, to act what is right, because it is right,make me truthful, honest and honerable in all things;make me intellectually honest for the sake of right andhonor and without thought of reward to me. Give methe ability to be charitable, forgiving and patient withmy fellowmen - help me to understand their motives andtheir shortcomings - even as Thou understandestmine! Amen.\\"What is more - for what we can gather from McCulloughsbiography - Harry Truman actually believed and lived by these words.Combined with his midwestern belief in the valuesof the farmer - Following Thomas Jefferson beliefin a nation of farmers - In Harry Trumans words: \\".. as long as a countryis one of that kind, people are independentand make better citizens. When it is made up offactories and large cities, it soon becomes depressedand makes classes among people. \\".- he was placed in a world that was anythingbut simple. But a world that was in absolute needof his values and judgement.Trouble never far away. His wife Bess' father killshimself age 43, by putting a gun to his head, leaving behind4 children.

Leaving him broke and strapped for money for 20 years,Eventually he enters politics - settles as a local Missouri judge,when fortune offers him to run as a US senator - a race which he surprisingly wins 2 times. And in 1944 Chicago Convention democratic bosses selects Truman as Vp candidate. Ambassadorships and postermasterjobs etc. promised around to make the deal go through.However corrupt some of this might seem - somehowit doesn't cling to the man who is then elected VP -but escapes intact.So much so as when asked about his feelings about thecurrent president Roosevelt - Harry Truman answers(obviously not in public) that he has onlyone objection - that he lies.When Roosevelt dies an old man age 63. Trumantakes over - a young man of 60. With the remarkto reporters : \\"Boys if you pray, pray for me now.\\".With WW2 still on he offers the 48 presidency to Eisenhower.But still he is the one to make the decisions.And he does nuke Japan - making historiansremember that he did use the \\"n-word\\" and wasnot respectful towards chinese back home in Missouri.Still, in Trumans mind that was the only way to stopthe war in east without another million dead american soldiers.And he was happy about the decision.With the Berlin crisis, Korean war there was no lack of problems.And yet reporters remark that everyday \\"is a mothersday in White House under Truman\\" with a president who neverfails to call back to see how things are back home on the farm.Against all odds he is re-elected president in 48.With the backing of fellow democrats Lauren Bacall,Humphrey Bogart and Ronald Reagan (later to become a republican).standing for a government for the people andagainst special interest.When MacArthur threathens to go for all out war with the chinesein Korea he is fired by Truman, telling the worldthat civilian leadership is above military leadership.He is always well composed - when assassins from Puerto Ricotries to kill him and all leading newspapersare certain that he will loose. Except when a musiccritic says his singing daughter is no good. Then he explodes.Making the picture perfect of Harry the man, who becamepresident.A real person.Personally I was amazed when I visited his home inIndependence, Missouri in 2002 - that it was actually the homeof Harry Truman the president.

I especially like the fact that he spoke to former Secret Service agents Floyd Boring, James Rowley, and Gerard McCann (I also spoke to the first two and contacted the last, who has since died).[...]"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A good solid read on HST and his rise to the Presidency. It just goes to show that America will always produce the right man for the job when the chips are down. Mr. McCullough does a good solid job on telling the story about the Man from Independence. I especially like his section on how after many Failures, Harry finds his place with the Pendergast Machine without losing his honor. If you want a good read on Harry then this is a good palce to start."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"What a fantastic book! When I first picked it up I knew almost nothing about Harry S Truman. I was initially a bit intimidated by the length, but was encouraged to read it by friends and family who also loved it. Am I glad I did! Reading this book has given me such respect and admiration for one of our country's greatest presidents. David McCullough gives a compelling account of Truman's life, from his boyhood, to his outstanding service in World War I, to the opening of a haberdashery, to the start of his political career. McCullough uses all sorts of sources, including some of the many thousands of letters Truman wrote to his wife. McCullough gives you a sense not only for Truman's public life and persona, but for his extraordinary character and heart.This book is a long book - some 1,000 pages - but it is well worth the read. I was so engrossed in the story that I finished it within 3 days. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I came away admiring Mr. Truman for his ability to work very hard at the tasks he felt were his to do; for his integrity at critical times (such as the decision not to carry the Korean Warn into China); and for his appreciation of history and the constitution.I also enjoyed the theme in the book contrasting the opinion of the press about Mr. Truman and the reality of the man. News media are so ever present in our daily lives (in the gym, at the airport, in restaurants) that we forget that news editors are *highly* fallible. This theme recurs so often in the book (\\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\" being only one of many mis-predictions and mis-estimations) I gather it was intended. The man certainly was much greater than many measures taken of him at the time.I do hope Mr. McCullough will produce another biography soon."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A typical McCullough read. He makes history exciting, interesting, and personal. Harry Truman comes to life in this book and you fell like you've lived through the era. It's a great way to learn about American history. I wish I'd had his books to read when taking American history in high school. He makes it so fascinating and memorable by giving you all those insights into the personal lives and thoughts of the historical figures. One of his best works and you get a lot for your money."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I heard of the name of David Mccullough in the past as a writer, but was never inclined to check out his books. Just recently while perusing the news channels his name was discussed as a fascinating author so with my interest peaking, at the first opportunity I went and purchased a copy of Truman. From start to finish I haven't been disappointed. With more than a thousand pages it's like two volumes in one. Majority of the pages are filled with quotes from Truman. It's like having the subject speak for himself. I brought John Adams and Brave Companions by the same author afterwards."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough writes the best, most throughly researched books I have ever read. I have only read Truman and John Adams. I intend to read all of his works."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The alternative title here should read, \\"Why Didn't I Read This Years Ago, Too?\\" 'Cause like the Martin Gilbert biography of Churchill (\\"Churchill: A Life\\"), it's massive (1000 pages). Plus the subject of McCullough approaches the stature of the man revealed by Gilbert.Harry Truman brought Lincoln to mind for me, as both Presidents embody the very meaning of \\"integrity.\\" Yes, Mr. Truman had his human failings but, unlike some Presidents I have known, I'm left with absolutely no doubt that #33 performed his often thankless/always grueling task to the best of his ability--and Mr. Truman was a man of considerable ability."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I have read most of McCullough's books, and so I knew that after reading this I would understand Harry S. Truman more deeply than I ever had. What I didn't know what was that I would learn so much about 20th century American history. McCullough is a great story-teller. His use of historical details to recreate the man and the times is magnificent. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I never really got Truman until I read this book. He was a man driven by principles who sought integrity from all he dealt with. The rise to Presidency was by chance. He was given the VP slot because of his popularity from recent Senate inquiries into overbilling from US contractors in WWII.He was the right person at the right time. He was not liked by others in the adminstration when he came to power, but be won them over with his style of leadership. Would another had the guts to use the BOMB to end WWII? As hard as the decision was for Truman, he made it and stood behind it.I have a deeper appreciation for the man after reading the book. I always love McCullough's work - it reads in a linear fashion."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I read this book because I had run out of book and this one was lying around. Rarely I have I been so fortunate to stumble upon one of the most uplifting books that I have ever read.It's length of 900 pages can be intimidating but is well worth the journey. David McCullough is as superb a historian as Steven Ambrose or any other in recent memory. His research is apparent as he shows how Truman's upbringing as a farmer in rural Missouri, his service in World War I and subsequent failed business ventures all combined to prepare him for being president during some of the most important and trying years in our nation's history.If ever there is a man to give one faith in the American dream that any man can become president, it would be Harry Truman. But what impressed me the most was his immense character and humility that we wish for, but seldom find in our politicians.I did not fully appreciate his presidency until I read this book. The decisions he made have affected our lives to this day - the dropping of the atomic bomb, the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift and aid to Greece and Turkey (the that three of which arguably saved Europe and democracy in much of the world) and the Korean War.One would do well to study the character and live of Harry Truman for he is certainly one of the greatest unsung presidents or leaders I know of."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Perhaps this book was a little too detailed, making it a little long. There are some things that are repeated, probably for the sake of organizing different parts of his life but then some things spilled into others and McCullough decided to re-articulate some details. Overall, a great book, you learn American history and a lot about Truman and the world."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S Truman was an unlikely a giant of the American experience as any man or woman could be. Having lead a remarkably ordinary life, first as a haberdasher, then as a local Missouri politician, President Truman makes his latent rise to the office of Commander-in-Chief after the death of FDR.The presidency of Harry Truman was dominated by dramatic issues such as; he dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, established anti-Communism as the bedrock of American foreign policy (the policy of \\"containment\\" as authored by George Keenan, Dean Acheson, and John McCloy, and sent U.S. troops into the Korean War. In this winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize,David McCullough makes a strong case that history has vidicated the difficult decisions that this great man made, often in the face of the most bitter of partisan opposition.I did not know much about Harry Truman, either as a man or as a President. But after reading this tome, I came away with a profound respect for this \\"plain-spoken\\" man who had far more depth and class than he was given credit for, prior to the release of this book.McCullough's writing style is superb; his research is impeccable, he neither fawns, nor muckrakes. He writes in a way that the book almost sounds like a first person narrative in that he opens a door that allows you to \\"live\\" the book as you read it.McCullough will go down as one of the eminent historians of our time."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough is an outstanding author. President Truman was the original honest man. He deserves more respect when comparing him to many other presidents. I was a girl during World War II, and didn't appreciate what a fine president Truman was until I read this book. Loved it. I know President Truman loved his wife, Bess, but in reading the book, I felt Bess should have spent more time in Washington helping her husband instead of running home to Missouri."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Both Truman and Macarthur were right. The military must be answerable to civilian authority. However since that time we've had five &#34;limited&#34; wars. Except for the first Iraq war, they've all been disasters."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I gained a new perspective about President Truman and learned a great deal about that time in our history. Sadley I was never able to learn these things in school."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book has been on my bucket list for a long time, but I was reluctant to lug it around. When Kindle put it on sale recently, I decided it was time to read it, and am so glad I did. It was an amazing story about an under-rated man who proved to be up to an incredibly difficult task. While McCullough included the virtues and the flaws of Truman, it was evident that he admired him. I would like to think there was no bias and Truman refreshingly did put country before political expediency. I generally read novels, but have read most of McCullough's books (he hooked me with John Adams ) and was not disappointed with this one. At times I thought McCullough went into too much detail, but the man, the time, and the wonderful writing held my interest throughout ."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a good overview of the personality dynamics of both men during this time in our history. Love to read about historical events in the context of my or my families lives. Helps we understand what they experienced at different times in their lives."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough does an excellent job on his biographies of historical presidents. I love this book. I bought it for my nephew and had to have one for myself."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a great book. I highly recommend it. The author, David McCullough, is a great writer. I highly recommendthe other book he wrote about John Adams."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A comprehensive book. All you need to know about this overall great president (but there could be too much information for some readers). President Truman had to make some of the toughest decisions any president had ever faced. And most of them in time proved to be correct. But his judgement about Stalin's Russia was flawed. He lacked the clear-eyed understanding of Stalin's intentions in Eastern Europe that Winston Churchill had. As a consequence America did not stand up to Stalin's aggression in time. An early robust response from America, perhaps, could have preserved freedom for at least some Eastern European countries. And who knows, it might have prevented the Korean War."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Very much enjoyed reading this book on whom I thought was a great President. He was. McCullough's writing is excellent.Truman faced a lot of crises and handled them very well.Despite length, the book was a page turner for me. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in History"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A great story with considerable resonance with today's politics and a fun read as well. Truman was clearly the right person to carry forward FDR's policies."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It's been a little while since I read a book by Mr. McCullough and, somehow, I had forgotten what a great storyteller he is. In his largest biography, Mr. McCullough brings you closer to mirroring his subject than any other writer I have yet read. His subject: Harry S. Truman, America's greatest common-man president. Starting with the tale of his grandparents' trials in mid-19th century Missouri, Truman covers a vast timeline in a masterful way. Mr. McCullough's choice of tales always adds color to what can also easily be told in a very dry, textbook manner. And when he gets into Truman's life proper, you will not be disappointed. Nearly everything of Truman's life, career, and presidency is covered and in style and words that will make the near 1,000 page narrative seem half that length (that and the fact that, like all of his books, Mr. McCullough uses rather large print). In nearly every way, this is a near-perfect presidential biography. Of course, I say nearly because there were two things that were left out that I was rather shocked were: the National Security Act of 1947 and the NATO treaty. Mr. McCullough doesn't give any analysis of the former, just noting that Truman pushed for it and it happened. The latter is given a 1-2 page summary of its coming about, but nothing a reader will find insightful. These two acts changed the distribution and use of military power in Washington and in the world and the fact that they are, essentially, left out is stunning for a historian and biographer of Mr. McCullough's caliber. Still, this oversight doesn't change my 5-star rating one bit and every fan of Truman and/or of Mr. McCullough should pick this up."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"These comments are for the audio cassette version of \\"Truman\\" by David McCullough copyright 1994 by Simon & Schuster and the author. The audio book consists of 4 cassette tapes and total run time of 6 hours. David McCullough reads which, in my oppinion, adds considerably to the pleasure of listening to these tapes. Author McCullough has an exceptional reading voice. His pacing, tone and inflections to convey emotions are right on for this material.I thought I had a good working knowledge of Harry Truman but my knowledge was primarily his presidential years. McCullough spend a good deal of time discussing his upbringing, family roots and WWI experiences - new and welcomed data for this reader.One aspect of this audio book that makes it an exceptional listening experience is the inclusion of excerpts from Truman's Presidential addresses to Congress and important speeches. You actually experience a \\"you are there\\" feeling when hearing Truman's actual words during key events of his Presidency.A final note on audiocassettes books. I write these comments in 2011 so that makes these tapes 17 years old. I have no idea how long audio recording will last but these four tapes played without any mechanical problems and the audio was excellent. I paid a dollar for this item at a used book store. So if you have a tape player you can save some money and enjoy lots of great audio for small dollars I in fact ALL my dollars are small these days."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is one of my all time favorite history books!You will not be disappointed by this author or the story he tells."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"No complaints from me, it arrived on time and in the condition described. I would buy from them again without question."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Amazingly detailed----1100 pages!Well written and very interesting to read.In several instances HST is treated too kindly and not believably.This particularly true in the description of Truman's long-standingrelationship to the Pendergast machine.Overly sympathetic."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As someone who disagrees with many of Truman's domestic policies and would've had a hard time voting for him, it is nevertheless impossible not to be moved and impressed by David McCullough's cradle-to-grave biography of the 33rd President of the United States (or 32nd, as Truman would've insisted, as he refused to count Grover Cleavland twice) -- and for those who suggest that McCullough is too soft on Truman, it bears observing that, as the last 'regular American' to sit in the Oval Office (to say nothing of the last President to be wholly unconcerned with his image, as television did not arrive on the scene until the latter part of his administration), there is no respect in which Truman's story is not fantastic in both the literal figurative sense of the word, even if you don't approve of a single decision he made in the White House.True to form, McCullough knows just how to lace his anecdotes with facts, figures, and primary sources so as to fool you into thinking that you are reading a novel. McCullough remains among the most accessible of modern historians, but he does not do so at the expense of quality; nor does he bludgeon you over the head with his own judgments, which are relatively few and typically based on a referee's sense of fair play or else a simple analysis of Truman's intentions as they relate to the outcome of the decision of the day. Among these are the context of Truman's 'loyalty program' as a precursor to McCarthyism and the occasions where Truman's personal feelings (with which McCullough is often empathetic, if not sympathetic) interfered with his judgment, particularly in the selection, retention, or dismissal of cabinet members, and, of course, General Douglas MacArthur. These lapses define many of Truman's weaker moments, but doesn't it make sense that the 'everyman' President should suffer from the same shortcomings as, well, everybody else?As a historical perspective, 'Truman' is notable for McCullough's ability to frame the questions of the day in the terms those who had to answer them faced; the author assiduously avoids hind-sight moralizing and is thus able to transmit the accurate, historical scope of problems like the Korean War, Communism in government, and, of course, the use of the atomic bomb. A great deal of effort is dedicated to the process by which Truman arrived at many of his conclusions, typically in the form of letters to or interviews with his cabinet members, many of whom were critical in Truman's problem-solving mechanism. One of the biography's most powerful revelations is the stark contrast between McCullough's depiction of how decisions were made in 1945 with the modern process with which the reader is familiar. Some of this is certainly the pervasive sense that 'things were better years ago, though McCullough's portrayal is complete enough that one can be relieved at the demise of the political machines and bosses of the 1930s and 1940s while still pining for a politician as unconcerned with his own image as was Harry S. Truman, such as the time when, in an abortive attempt to film a television retrospective on his major decisions, when it was pointed out to Truman that he had three different ties in three different takes and shouldn't they re-shoot a couple of them, he replied that if, when he was discussing Korea, the viewer was paying attention to his tie, he had already lost them. This simple refusal contrasts to the modern 24-hour news cycle that seems exclusively dedicated to Truman's tie in some other incarnation.Truman's early years and the depictions of his parents and grandparents move more slowly than the 'page-turner' sections such as the use of the atomic bomb, but appreciating the picture of early 20th century Missouri life and Truman's own regard for history will pay dividends in the final section of the book, in which Truman energetically (if sometimes awkwardly) embraces his return to life as 'Mr. Truman' after he leaves the White House in 1953. Nearly all of Truman's professional life was in politics, and his reverence for the Office of the President makes his post-Presidential life simultaneously heroic and pathetic, though pathetic in the 'full of pathos' sense and not at all pitiable. Despite Truman's love for Cincinnatus and the idea of returning to private life, his dedication to his memoirs and especially the Truman Library was all-consuming; McCullough reports he was in his office at the Truman Library 'six and a half days a week for nine years' and often arrived before the staff to answer the phone and tell people what the hours were. Truman's zeal for history was as infectious then as McCullough's narration of it is now, and it is hard to feel critical of Truman if he felt 'shattered' by Eisenhower's refusal to call on Truman for counsel as Truman had called on Herbert Hoover.McCullough delivers a captivating picture of a middle-American man with the courage and fortitude to make unpopular and sometimes outright bad decisions when he thought them necessary with little regard for their effect on his own fortunes; yet the real humanity of this book, and of Harry S Truman, is that he needed the regard, if not the approval of his fellow citizens to whom he devoted the greater part of his long life just as he needed to feel that the Office of the President held him in something approaching the esteem in which he held it. Truman was not a larger-than-life figure like Roosevelt or Kennedy, but McCullough accounts for the greatness that came upon this most unlikely and American of Presidents as even more far-reaching and demanding than that of any President before or since."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a GRAND BOOK! David McCullough is a most insightful and perceptive biographer. The underlying sense of all history is very good. A joy to read - don't skip a word."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The author writes well. I was not put off by the length. To learn more about Truman's presidency I suggest reading Clark Clifford's memoir written with Richard Holbrooke, recently deceased."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It has been set. The benchmark for all presidential biographies has been set through these 1,000 pages of McCullough masterpiece. It encompasses the entire life about a simple yet dynamic man. As I read a biography about every president I compare them to this books brilliance and most of them can't even come close to it. It can be a tough read for those not interested so if you want to read a general abridged synopsis of Truman's life I do not recommend this book. However, I would recommend it to everyone else because it is simply the best biography I have read thus far."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough brilliantly brings Truman to life as he woven the 19th century and early 20th century together. Truman's amazing rise to power, was told in simple, clear language, with excellent sources. The cast of characters in Truman's life from Pendergast to FDR to McArthur leapt off the pages.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the man or the times"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough writes sympathetic biographies. Whether it is John Adams or Harry Truman, what you get is a look at the heart of the man as that man interacts with, responds to and general confronts, the issues of his day. As opposed to someone, like... say Pringle in his bio of Theodore Roosevelt, McCullough is not content to let the facts speak for themselves. His desire is to represent the man and this book does that extremely well.I titled the review because: (1) Harry Truman was in fact an \\"American\\" in the traditional sense of the word. When you speak of \\"American values\\", at least up until the seismic shift of the 1960's, Truman distilled them all. Honesty, integrity, loyalty and patriotism governed his life alongside and built upon an implicit faith in humanity and the future. Those things built a great nation. (2) the \\"last great\\" because truly \\"apres moi le deluge\\" applies as well to Truman as to Louis XIV. Eisenhower, JFK, Johnson, Nixon... the spin and the decline are self-evident - at least from a \\"traditional American\\" view.This book is very useful for reminding us what the human animal can be. Truman's politics are not my own. I probably wouldn't have voted for him on all his domestic policies. But there is no doubt I would have enjoyed him as a man and a friend... and what says the most about Truman is... I am pretty sure he would have enjoyed me also.Read it and make your adult kids read it too."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A lot of time has been spent in these user reviews over 1). How long the book is, 2). the author's so-called 'worship' of his subject, 3). the lack of inclusion of important affiliated details concerning his Presidency, i.e Marshall Plan [use a wiki] to name several.The book may have been further cut by say 100 pages, but you can always skip over a part you don't find interesting. In general, the sheer strength of Mr. McCullough's narration is the glue that holds your attention (1776 is another one, more so than President Adams). Many of the author's devices are written with a documentary for TV in mind, but you can sense his love of the printed word first and foremost.Truman was one of the few honest modern politicians ever. He certainly had his faults. But he made up for it by HARD WORK and determination. He was as big a contrast to Roosevelt as you could find, and more moral as well. Yet, he attempted to respect all around him. This surprised Washingtonians who were used to other types of remarks, belittlings, and judgements.The best parts of the book to me are the early years on the farm, the transfer of White House power, and the 1948 election campaign saga.I can recommend this book for a permanent place on your bookshelf without hesitation"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As one has come to expect from a book by David McCullough, this book is thoroughly researched and beautifully written. If you like history/biography you will love this book. I found it well worth the time I spent reading the almost 1000 pages of text. I have read most of David McCullough's books and in my opinion this is one of his best. I think it's the best of all that I have read, but I still have a few to go before I finish them all. I liked it more than \\"John Adams\\" but this is largely because I found Truman to be a much more likable subject.This biography covers the whole of Truman's life, not just his presidency. It actually begins with his grandparents and the area of Missouri in which he was born and raised. It covers his childhood, his service in WWI, his business years after the war, his early political years as a member of the Predergast political machine, his presidential years and the 20 years that he spent after his presidency. Truman is shown to be a man of great character, straight forward, loyal and dedicated to his friends and to the US, over any political advantage that he might gain by being otherwise. He was guided by the simple principle of trying to do what he believed was right and then letting the chips fall as they might. He was largely underrated, but those who knew him, or even interacted with him briefly, came to see that he was not the simple man in a job that was over his head. Rather, he had the moral courage and the determination to lead and to make tough decisions (almost always ones that history has shown to be the correct) and not be swayed by negative public opinion. McCullough makes a strong case for him being one of the most important presidents that the US has ever had, a view shared by most current historians. He was forced to make decisions that set the course for the rest of the 20th century.McCullough clearly loves Truman and you may too when you finish this book. While almost uniformly laudatory of Truman, McCullough does cover the events that are less than complementary. For instance, his tendency to write scathing letters when he was angry (which fortunately for Truman's legacy were almost always just put into his desk draw instead of being sent) and, more importantly, his nationalization of the steel industry, which was deemed unconstitutional. Also, in private Truman used language, which today is considered racist. However, in spite of his southern upbringing, his innate sense of justice and fair play led him to desegregate the US armed forces by executive decree and to put forward civil rights legislation that almost cost him the 1948 election. His civil rights and health care legislation did not pass until many years after his term in office. Nonetheless, was willing to pave the way in spite of the considerable political cost to his presidency."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal! Very hard to put down. While I have questions perhaps about this and that, I sat down at my desk each night and went through the life of President Truman in a few weeks time. I would recommend this to everyone! Mr. McCullough hit another one into the stands! I'm looking into 1776 now! Thank you!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry \\"S\\" Truman is the only president I ever saw in person. My two room school went to see and hear him speak in Dayton, Ohio. I was too young to focus on what he said, but I hold the memory of him walking across the stage in that auditorium and speaking.One reason why I purchased David McCullough's biography \\"TRUMAN\\" is to find out some of the things he said over his life. But my main reason is that having read three other McCullough's books, I know this is going to be a great read.I am not even half way through TRUMAN, but I am writing this based upon my enthusiastic endorsement of anything David McCullough writes. I've always been interested in history, but never had a single teacher who made history come alive and hold my attention, often at the edge of my seat and fighting sleep in order to finish a segment in the book, as does author McCullough.Did you know that the \\"S\\" in Harry S. Truman doesn't stand for any name or anything? It's just an alphabet letter picked. You'll find out why by reading TRUMAN.I'm hardly able to lay TRUMAN down, once I begin reading again. David McCullough introduces you to the real person he writes about. He takes you into their own thoughts and feelings and allows you to view the individual as if you were right there with them, living out the actual experiences; because McCullough goes back to their own personal diary notes, letters, quotations recorded by others; woven in a context of actual life, as recorded by the person themselves and other relatives, friends, business associates, and here, political connections. This, like every David McCullough biography I've read, reads like a novel. The introduction he gives of his subjects puts you right there, and you almost find yourself reaching out your hand to shake hands with them.I'd like to write more, but the house is quiet now and I am drawn to my lazy boy recliner where I can pick up and read more of David McCullough's TRUMAN."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I had very high expectations for this work after reading \`John Adams' years ago. I wasn't disappointed. \`Truman' merits two prizes -the first for a faultless, vivid narrative; and a second for a riveting subject portrayed in the fullness of his time.Far from a partisan tome, it exposes an honest, unaffected man with all his rough edges. It's a story of one familiar with hard work, adversity, failure and success; a man whose drive and curiosity shamed piers with higher education, but never led him to fail to acknowledge modest roots. Judged by his faults, challenges, and accomplishments one cannot but feel lucky he served.Readers should be warned they will need some arm strength for this volume (a 992 page text). More importantly (given the quality), they will wish it was twice as long."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a big and detailed book, not for the faint of heart. But, if you love history and/or politics, this is a book for you. Truman was an unlikely president and this book captures the man's personality, humility, and dignity. Carefully researched and described, the book opens the door to one of our nation's most unique and dinstinguished characters. An epic book about an epic man. Delightful."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I couldn't have been more pleased with this book. I love David McCullough and he never ceases to amaze you with this intimate portrayal of Harry Truman's life. He brings the President to the level of an average man who finds himself in an above-average position. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth look at one of our most interesting Presidents to-date.I have to agree with a previous reviewer: upon reading this, I have such a desire to meet and converse with HST--that's how interesting and honorable he was."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As always, McCullough's narrative sweep is impressive. Truman as a lonely and bookish boy, Truman as a soldier, Truman as a failed businessman are the most interesting parts. When it comes to Truman's presidency, McCullough turns up little new grounds, however. It's the usual conventional wisdom about a guy who made tough decisions that turned out right. Read Perrett's \\"Commander in Chief\\" for a harsher and more surprising evaluation of Truman's decision-making and his monumental blunders."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The book itself was a winner - a gift for my husband. He \\"devoured\\" it. The only disappointment was how cheaply and poorly-bound the paperback was. Even with extreme care, it fell apart within the first 70 pages.

Buy and read this book, but go for a better-bound version unless you like handling it in pieces."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I bought this biography of Truman for my husband for Christmas, and he's been reading it every night since New Year's. He's a fan of McCullough and has loved learning the lesser-known details of Truman's life and his impact on world events."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If my house was on fire this book would be one of the first ones I would try to save from the flames. This book is well researched and written. It is about as thorough and complete as a one volume biography could be. McCullough is a masterful storyteller. I read it when it was first published and reread it a few years ago. I may give it another go after the holidays. I cannot recommend it enough. Buy it in hardcover because you'll want a copy that will endure many readings!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was almost turned off by the size of the book, nearly 1000 pp long! I'm glad I hung in, for McCullough's very human yet deep and comprehensive 'take' on Truman blew me away. It's an accessible book, easy to read and to become involved as the reader lives with Truman through the ups and downs of his political, and personal, life."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman by David McCullough is a MUST read for every present day politician to learn and to see how the most partisan of Democratic Presidents could work with partisan Republicans to coming up with compromises to do what was right for this Nation, a quality sorely missed in our currently elected officials in partisan, grid-locked Washington, D.C. Don't let the size of the book scare you. Mr. McCullough conveys the story of a small-town politican, rooted in middle American values, who proved to be the right man at the right time to succeed the partrician Franklin Roosevelt at his death to lead this country at its most tumultuous period at the end of WWII and the start of the Cold War. It is also the story of the love that the Trumans had for each other as documented through a lifetime of letters to each other. I came away with the desire to learn more about Harry Truman to go visit Independence and Granview, Mo, to walk the streets he did and to visit his home and library. Mr. McCullough truly desired a Pulitzer Prize for his work on Truman."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough reports a history I vaguely remember when a farmer accidently made it into the white house, as my dad would rant. A president who set the course of Russo-American relations for years. Why did Truman impact us so today? He had to heal an injured world, injured much worse than our world is today. He disliked sitting in summit conferences but that was his charm to create healing. Oh if we could only find another farmer to nowadays plant ideals like Truman did. A must read for those who want to understand our current making of history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I like it when a history or biography is written in a way that you don't want to put it down. You are privy to the WWII talks that Truman had with Churchill and Stalin and the reasoning behind dropping the bomb on Japan. It portrays Truman as a more decisive President than Roosevelt. I loved it, so many things I did not know about Truman, quite a gentleman. If only we could have a president like him now, and I am a Republican."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"\\"Truman\\" by David McCullough is perhaps one of the finest and most thorough presidential biographies ever written. At 1000 pages you would think this book would be an arduous read, but with skill rarely seen McCullough is able to progress smoothly and seamlessly. A critic would be hard pressed to find any one part of the book that dragged or seemed out of place. This is probably the defining factor that made \\"Truman\\" so enjoyable. The sense of continuity in the writing reflects the progression of American history witnessed through the life of Harry Truman.The man himself is quite emblematic of the transition from the Victorian era to the modern age of American life. Truman was elected to the highest office in the land for this very reason; he was a man of people, by the people and for the people. He was the very essence of the New Deal and all that meant in giving power back to common Americans and protecting their interests and values. McCullough is able to balance this symbolic aspect of Truman's public life with his personal matters, which reflect the constitution of the man who rose from the humblest of origins to become the leader of the free world.Truman is perhaps most unique in the way he embodies the American dream. There are very few presidents who rose from such humble beginnings as Harry S. Truman. McCullough gives the reader a brief history lesson of life at the Missouri frontier just prior to and during the Civil War in outlining Truman's ancestry. As the best historians do, McCullough is able to reflect a larger reality of an era by focusing on the lives of individuals who came to define it. Truman's grandparents were just such people.As I stated before, the greatest strength of this book was its continuity. It never dwells on one part of Truman's life for an extended period of time. As the reader learns of the rather simple details of Harry's early life on the farm, it also evokes the period before the mass suburbanization of America. This idyllic but tough agrarian existence was interrupted by World War I, which Truman served in with honor as a Captain of artillery. This really made him into a leader and was probably the main reason for notorious Kansas City mayor Pendergast's decision to nominate him as city judge. Truman showed great leadership potential from his service in the army and was \\"chosen\\" by the Kansas City \\"machine\\". This image would dog his early political life. McCullough shows the ambivalence Truman had for such practices. It seems as if Harry never lost control of his values or gave into temptation as many of his associates did, but there always seemed to be shadowy figures in the periphery of his political life. This was probably a reality of the times and Truman rarely apologized for his association with these types of people.Truman then rises to Senator and eventually Vice President on the 1944 Democratic ticket with FDR. His ascension to President in April of 1945 is a featured section along with Potsdam conference and the decision to drop the Atomic bomb. The post war years are excellently written with the increasingly vicious political climate over supposed Communist infiltration of the government, as well with emphasis on Truman's dealing with unions, NATO, The Marshall plan, the Truman Doctrine designed to contain Communism, the 1948 upset reelection victory over Dewey, the Korean war. The book ends with Truman's happy retirement until his death in 1972 at age 88."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A good and complete biography of Truman. David McCullough describes well the political events surrounding the era and his climb to power - which was gradual but well earned. Truman was only two years younger than Roosevelt but in far better health. He was a vastly different person more prone to indiscretions. Even so he survived well in a turbulent era - the end of World War II, taking the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, the commencement of the Cold War, the creation of the state of Israel (where he did waffle) and the Korean War. Truman importantly promoted the U.N.He was not afraid to take decisions, but he could be petulant as in writing to the Washington Post when they dared to criticize his daughter's musical performance at a concert (this was something Roosevelt would never have done).I felt the author devoted too many pages to the 1948 campaign (over 60 pages). Very little was said about Truman's efforts to desegregate the armed forces (how much opposition did this receive?) Also I am somewhat perplexed about Truman's marriage to his wife Bess. He did marry quite late - at 35 - which is unusual in that era. Bess did not spend that much time with him in Washington during his Senate and Presidential years when he could have used the emotional support. Also they resided in her mother's house when in Independence, Missouri. For a strong-willed individual Harry Truman seemed to be dominated by both his wife and mother-in-law.His firing of Douglas MacArthur is well depicted as well as his increasing frustration with Joe McCarthy - where it could be said that it was beneath presidential dignity to deal with such a scoundrel. His friendship with his staff - Clark Clifford, Dean Acheson and the illustrious George Marshall is conveyed. His growing irritation with his successor Eisenhower is interesting.A portrait of a warm and up-front person emerges - plus that of someone who could quickly grasp new situations and evaluate new personalities (with the exception of Josef Stalin - but he was not alone in this). He was expeditious to root out the \\"hangers on\\" of the Roosevelt administration, but did not lose site of the accomplishments of that era."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love reading about American History and this book touches upon the Depression, Civil War, WWI, WWII, Cold War, creation of a Jewish state, the Korean Conflict, and of course Presidents. Some might feel a bit intimdated seeing the book at over 1,000 pages. However, just like having a lot of food in front of you, when its good it goes quick. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast I flew through this book. It reads like a novel. This book kept me very interested the whole time, very rarely did it seem like the story was dragging.After reading this book I am amazed at all that Truman went through and accomplished. I feel he is a very underrated president. I know many have written reviews already so I will simply say I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American History, Presidents, and/or good reads in general."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is the largest, yet best book, I have ever read. McCullough's biography reads more like a novel and keeps you hooked from page 1- 992. I recommend this book to anyone interested in early 20th century American history or presidential history. I did not know much about Truman before reading this book but I enjoyed the book and Truman more and more as each page I read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough is an extraordinary writer whose key strength in writing history is detailing the life of the subject in question, in this case, Harry S. Truman. This is a very substantial book that covers people and events from Truman's grandparents who moved to Missouri from Kentucky in the early to mid 19th Century up through Harry Truman's death in 1972. He ascended to the presidency in 1945 amidst some of the most difficult and challenging days in American history. He would also make some of the most difficult and long lasting decisions of any political leader not only in U.S. history, but in the world.This narrative begins with the establishment of the Truman family in Missouri and Harry's birth in 1884. His childhood, family life, his role on the farm, courtship of Bess Wallace, life in Independence, Missouri and so many other aspects of his early life are very well described. Truman served his country in World War I, serving as a captain in Battery D. He gained immense loyalty from the men who served with him. He returned to Missouri, married Bess, went into business and later was called back to work on his family farm at Grandview.Truman's politics derived from the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian traditions. Truman has been marked by some as a pawn of the political machine in Kansas City run by Tom Pendergast. Truman, however loyal he was to those who helped him advance in political positions, nevertheless maintained his basic character and honesty in dealing with public issues. His first public office was as county judge, which was more of an administrative position, like a county commissioner. Some of his proudest accomplishments included bringing better roads and a new courthouse.Often overlooked as an amateur and political puppet of the Pendergast machine, Truman won a seat as one of Missouri's two U.S. Senators. He proved himself to be a hardworking and diligent public servant, most notably gaining nationwide recognition for his role as chairman of the committee than investigated Defense contracts and the widespread waste and inefficiency involved. Truman was also a reliable supporter of FDR's New Deal legislation, though he never became a close acquaintance of the president's, even when he did become the Vice Presidential candidate for the presidential ticket of 1944. This whole episode of choosing the VP nominee could have been a book in and of itself.Roosevelt's health was clearly in question and declining through 1944. The position of VP could and would have huge implications for the next four years, most of which would turn into the Truman administration. This modest, unpretentious man from Missouri with very little experience in world affairs assumed the office of president less than three months into the fourth Roosevelt term. The amazing thing to me was how quickly he adjusted to his new role and acted so decisively. Truman would prove so many of his critics wrong from here on out.Truman made some of the most difficult decisions of any president. The decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the announcement of what became the Truman Doctrine to fight and contain communism, the Marshall Plan to rebuild and stabilize Europe, U.S. recognition of the new state of Israel, the Berlin airlift, the National Security Act, NATO, the decision to fight in Korea, the firing of MacArthur and more. These are what McCullough focuses on, though not with in-depth analysis you could find in other sources. McCullough sees these larger decisions, mainly concerning foreign affairs, as the defining moments of the Truman Presidency. Unfortunately we only get glimpses of his Fair Deal programs which dealt with many of the major domestic issues like education, better housing, equal rights for blacks and so forth, though not all of these were accomplished during his presidency.Perhaps Truman's greatest personal triumph was his election in his own right as president in 1948. This is covered very well by McCullough. There was something about the man that just never gave in to what others were saying about his chances of winning. This is perhaps what really defined Truman. He was so full of life; he had that vitality and inner strength that makes anyone admire him regardless of whether you always agreed with him or not. McCullough clearly admires Truman and let's face it, it's hard not to, and I admit my bias in Truman's favor as well. McCullough's strength is his ability to bring out the human qualities of the man he focuses on. It is a great talent, some think it irrelevant and unscholarly, but I think it is important.Another great attribute to this book is the inclusion of the many people who were part of Truman's family and inner circle during the White House years. He was loyal to his family and friends, became disappointed with Eisenhower and utterly disliked Nixon, Joe McCarthy and Gen. MacArthur. There are really too many people discussed in this book for me to list. I especially enjoyed reading of his relationship with Gen. George Marshall and Dean Acheson. Truman wasn't perfect, he made mistakes as President, perhaps was too loyal to some people around him and some of his decisions were and remain controversial. But it's a testament to the man that he endured and kept working for the betterment of the American people and world peace. He was a president of and for the common man.There's a lot I'm leaving out, but this is one of the best biographies I've ever read. Some historians classify this type of historiography as merely adhering to the traditional historical interest in great men of the past. Like Truman, I believe individual people can and do make a difference. At the same time, I realize that biographies have weaknesses and can't be the only source of studying past people and events for the serious student of history. I think popular and academic (professional) history can and should be able to coexist and work together to present history to students, scholars, and the wider public. Anyway, McCullough's biography on Truman is a must read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"&quot;Truman&quot; is one of the most enjoyable non-fiction works I have ever read. While some of the below comments express bitterness towards Truman's presidency, they offer nothing to back up their problems. While McCullough generally takes a favorable position towards the president, he backs it up with facts. And don't be fooled: McCullough discusses Truman's weaknesses, faults, and mistakes. To say that the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, creation of NATO, beginnings of civil rights, etc etc, were small or bad initiatives for a president would be a mistake. Read the book and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This magnificent book is just another wonderful writing accomplishment of David McCullough. It never surprises me when I find a book or a topic that I like and it is by this particular author. Mr. McCullough is today's best writer on history and biographies. His book on Truman and opened doors of understanding for me on how politics worked then, and probably continue to work. He writes with knowledge of the personal problems this man had to face in being an ultimately honest and fair person, but one who had to learn how to work within the confines of politics without losing his good qualities. Mr. McCullough also brings to the book an understanding about how many time Harry Truman was placed in situations beyond his control, or was ignored and humiliated because other people assumed he was a hick. FDR's snobbishness towards Truman is not a surprise, I read about it when reading about Los Alamos and the making of the Atom Bomb, but McCullough makes sure we know exactly how bad it was. I almost felt like crying for Truman when people behaved this way towards him and his family, and I am a Republican. This book sincerely made me wish not for a past period of history, but rather for more men and women who prized honesty and integrity beyond the glories of the world. I would wish for people not to underestimate those who choose to keep their lives simple and good, who place their family high on their list of priorities, and who aren't afraid to say what they think in an intelligent manner. This is all of what Truman was, in spite of his faults. Mr. McCullough did an outstanding job of writing in this biography! Karen L. Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry S. Truman, in my opinion, was one of the best Presidents this country has ever had. He made a lot of tough decisions with the philosophy &#34;The Buck Stops Here&#34;. He didn't back down from what he believed was right for America. Even with the dropping of the bombs in WWII, that incident brought many troops back home to their families and sent a clear message to the enemy. He handled the insubordination of Gen. MacArthur the only way he could have. Take him out of his command and show him that he was not in charge of this country. I shudder to think of the American soldiers lives that would have been lost had he been allowed to continue his war efforts. God bless you Harry S. Truman. You brought my dad home to me.

For example, did you know that when Truman was a young &#34;nobody&#34; working as a bank clerk in in Kansas City, he roomed with another &#34;nobody&#34; named &#34;Arthur Eisenhower?&#34; Yes, the brother of you-know-who."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is the book that should be required reading for all biographers prior to beginning any biographical work. McCullough's examination of Truman is a classic and has inspired this reader to since buy and read more books of one of our most fascinating and definitely our most unlikely president.The examination of Truman's early life is really the story of an ordinary American rather than one who turns out to be extraordinary. He goes through the trials and tribulations of the common man and somehow, almost miraculously, ends up in the White House. Because of the ability of Americans to identify with him he is elected in his own right in 1948.McCullough relates how Truman lived the American Dream and it is just an inspirational work that shows us what we as ordinary Americans can achieve with grit, smarts and determination."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having lived a number of years in the &#34;show me&#34; state I particularly enjooyed the early years.

Don't let the size of the book scare you either. Its worth putting the time into. David McCullough writes in a readable manner. None of that academic reading stuff that gives you headaches. Listen, if you are even considering buying it you probably already have a little interest in this topic. Do yourself a favor. Buy this book. You can thank me later. Oh, and...Harry is my new hero."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"You might think it odd that I would call a nearly 1,000 page biography incomplete- particularly after giving it a five-star review- but for all the detail McCullough supplies about Truman's life, he misses some very important details. More about that in a minute.I very nearly did not read this book, as my previous experience with David McCullough's biographyies was his book on John Adams- another very detailed, very well written work that is obvously the work of a man who fell so in love with his subject that it not only blinded McCullough to Adams' flaws, it led him to depict such great men as Franklin and Jefferson as Adams saw them- a vew quite at odds with the portraits painted by other historians.Nonetheless, I went ahead and plunged into this work, and found it far superior to the Adams biography. The picture McCullough paints of Truman clearly shows the admiration McCullough holds his subject in, yet it also includes many of Truman's flaws- his temper, at times, his lack of education in many areas, his poor judgment and downright naiitivity in his dealings with Stalin, and some of his appointments. At the same time it does a great job of showing how Truman's family and business background and his experience in local Missouri politics shaped his later career as president.What's lacking, first and foremost, is any discussion of post-WWI economics, and Truman's roll, and the role of Congress, in shaping the postwar economic system. An ecomist friend, noting that I was reading the book, asked me if there was any discussion of James Byrnes in the book. There is a great deal, but none of it regarding Brynes' role in setting policy, either as FDR's Director of Economic Stabilization or later under Truman. Another important player- Henry Walllace- gets short shrift as well. There is much discussion of the political machincations behind replacing Henry Wallace with Truman in FDR's third run at the presidency, but not enough on exactly what made Walllace both an object of admiration to his supporters and a dangerouslynaiive successor to FDR to his enemies. Also lacking is a real discussion of how Truman, like FDR before him, had no problem in using, and some would argue abusing, the executive powers of his office to threaten both unions and businesses into compliance with his aims.But what McCullough does provide is a superbly constructed narrative that is, I think, more complete, more accurate, and more interesting than any of the previous popular biographies of Truman. It's a first-rate read and an excelllent education for both Truman fans and critics."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If any one individual can be said to exemplify the Missouri attitude of \\"show me\\", President Truman would be that man. The farmer's boy from Independence who couldn't qualify for West Point because of his vision, nonetheless became an effective artillery officer who served with distinction on the Western Front in WWI. Back home in Missouri after the war, he married his true love, then embarked on a career as a local politician. Never flashy or charismatic, he won by being an honest and effective administrator. Never having great ambitions, he was picked as one of 3 candidates for Senator, and was considered a dark horse in the primaries. But through hard campaigning and a lot of personal contact with the public, he won easily. Later, he was again a surprise choice as FDR's VP in the 1944 campaign, when concerns arose over the sitting VP, Henry Wallace. A somewhat reluctant President, Truman based his decision-making on facts and evidence above political expediency, in most matters. This was bound to be unpopular, and his approval rating as he left office in 1953 was quite low. But in the decades since, history has shown him as able to make difficult, unpopular, but necessary determinations which turned out for the best.Once again, David McCollough has given us a thoroughly researched, detailed history. The reader is taken back in time to relive the days of the late 19th century, when a bright farm kid with a lot of gumption was able to make more of himself than his circumstances would have indicated. We get a very detailed look at the young Truman, seeing the qualities developing in him that would serve him well as President. I've also read \\"1776\\" and \\"John Adams\\" and enjoyed both of them as much as I did \\"Truman.\\" Mr McCollough should be considered one of America's national treasures."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Though certainly a commitment to read (over 900 pages), it moves along at a nice pace, while maintaining a flowing, educated language. While McCullough seems to be generally sympathetic to Truman, it does a reasonable job not covering up his warts. It really is too bad that the first years of the cold war are not studied more intensely, as so much happened that shaped later decades worldwide. While you may not agree with all of Truman's decisions, you certainly should admire his effort.The definite biography on Truman for our time, on the merits of scholarship and readability."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a riveting account of Truman's life, revealing all the human elements in the man together with the extraordinary decisions he had to make. One cannot read this account without wishing for more like him in the Oval Office. David McCullough does a superb job!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have read. David McCollough's writing style is superb. I have read parts of this book twice. President Truman was one of the greatest presidents of all time. His humility, honesty, and hard-work should be a lesson and aspiration to all of us. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A truly remarkable, thoroughly enjoyable book! Having read \\"John Adams\\" and \\"1776\\", I was looking forward to reading Truman with great anticipation. This book exceeded my expectations! While reading this book, it seemed as if it were warmly written by a close, caring family friend. No skipping through long passages here. So interesting and informative is McCullough's style of writing,that I wanted to read each and every word he wrote. I now have a greater appreciation for a much under-appreciated president and all the noteworthy and far reaching events of Truman's era. An added note about the large size of the book - I placed a throw pillow on my lap underneath the book - made it more comfortable to read. Since first reading \\"John Adams\\", I've become an enthusiastic fan of David McCullough. I plan to read each and every book he has written!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough does an excellent job of writing a historical, yet interesting and personal biography about Truman. He includes his childhood, WWI experience, failed business venture, Presidency, and retirement years. What I like is his ability to be very historical and accurate, while remaining quite readable. I had a hard time putting this one down.In Truman, you will read about his triumphs and failures. Truman had a reputation for never forgetting a friend. He was famous for his honesty. On the other hand, he had at least one business failure. The very human side of Truman comes out in this bio. Good examples are Truman's quarrels with a music critic regarding his daughter's singing performance, and dealing with Douglas McArthur. Truman had acted as any father would when his daughter was giving a poor review by a music critic. Truman's difficult relationship with McArthur, including his decision to fire him is also discussed.McCullough is currently my favorite biographer. His books seem to be meticulously researched, and his works have a bibliography at the end. If you, like me, enjoyed McCullough's other works, like Path Between the Seas, and Mornings on Horseback, then you will love this one."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was a little scared when this book first arrived. It was huge (almost 1,000 pages of text) and I didn't really know much about Truman so I was affraid I wouldn't be interested. I am happy to say this ended up being an awesome book. McCullough is my new favorite author. After reading this book I feel like Harry Truman is an old friend that I've known my whole life. That is why I love McCullough's work. Once i finished this book someone asked me if Truman was my favorite president. I didn't know what to say. I can't say that I agreed with everything he stood for politically and he messed a few things up while in office but you have to love him for the man that he was and McCullough does a great job of capturing Harry's personality. Don't just buy this book but all of McCullough's books. I have since read 'Mornings on Horseback' and 'John Adam' is on order."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If I were able, I would actually have given \\"Truman\\" four-and-one-half stars instead of five. It's hard to argue with this book's enormous popularity - when it was released in the early 1990's it received generally rave reviews and became the best-selling presidential biography of the decade. And in most respects \\"Truman\\" deserves the praise it has received. David McCullough is a marvelous writer, as anyone who has read his earlier books (such as \\"Mornings on Horseback\\", his splendid account of the early years of Teddy Roosevelt) can testify. McCullough's research of Truman's life is thorough, and his writing style makes it seem as if you are with Truman on every step of his long journey towards the White House. Truman was the unlikeliest of Presidents, and he may be the last \\"non-millioniare,\\" non-college-educated person ever to serve in the Oval Office. Compared to most of our great Presidents (a rank which Truman is now given, thanks in no small part to this book), most of Truman's life was totally ordinary. He was a farmer who scratched for a living, he adored his wife and was completely faithful to her, he had to put up with a demanding and snooty mother-in-law who thought he was never good enough for her daughter (even after he became President!), and he was a failed businessman who constantly worried about paying the bills. Truman's life didn't really take off until he served as an artillery officer in World War One, and he learned that he could effectively command large groups of men and earn their respect. He subsequently entered Kansas City politics, serving as an honest and efficient county judge (county commissioner) in an otherwise corrupt and despised political machine run by Tom Pendergast, the nationally infamous \\"boss\\" of Kansas City. Truman remained fiercely loyal to \\"Boss\\" Pendergast, even after he was sent to prison for various crimes. Truman would display this trait of loyalty time and again, and while in many ways it was admirable, it would also get him into trouble when his friends sometimes turned out not to be as honest and open as he was. I won't recount Truman's life here, as other reviewers have already done so, but I do have one problem with the book, and that is McCullough's favoritism towards Truman. Although some other reviewers have claimed that this book is \\"even-handed\\", I would argue differently. Truman did have his flaws, but McCullough either glances at them and quickly moves on, or he just ignores the criticisms that others have made. One example involves Truman's racial feelings. McCullough does briefly mention that in his youth Truman often spoke negatively of Jews and Blacks, but argues that he \\"made up for it\\" by pushing civil rights for blacks and helping create the nation of Israel as President. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's \\"conversion\\" to these ideals came in an election year (1948), in which he was the underdog and needed all the minority votes he could get. After Truman left the White House he continued to make occasional negative remarks about racial minorities - in the 1950's and 1960's he criticized Martin Luther King and the civil rights marchers in the South as \\"troublemakers\\", a fact which McCullough never mentions. Also, like most pro-Truman biographers, McCullough makes Truman into the feisty but lovable hero of the 1948 presidential election, when Truman shocked the pollsters and experts to defeat the heavily favored Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's campaign was every bit as negative and divisive as those of later Republican candidates (such as Richard Nixon) who have been much-criticized for their \\"dirty\\" campaigns. Truman, as has been proven by numerous letters, memos, and political memoirs, deliberately made personal attacks on Dewey (such as ridiculing Dewey's mustache and comparing it with Hitler's) and hurling wild, unfounded charges (in one speech he came close to comparing Dewey and the Republicans with Hitler and the Nazis, a speech which McCullough doesn't mention). Truman's campaign deliberately played upon the fears and prejudices of Democratic farmers and workers (one of Truman's main points was that Dewey and the Republicans would bring back the Great Depression), just as Republicans such as Nixon would later play upon the fears of Republican voters. In my opinion, had Truman been a Republican candidate he almost certainly would today be strongly criticized for his 1948 campaign, but instead he is given the heroic role by McCullough (Truman's opponent Dewey ran a presidential campaign that was a model of what most voters say they want. He refused to reply to Truman's \\"mudslinging\\", almost never mentioned Truman by name, and gave upbeat, optimistic speeches in which he refrained from personal attacks). In spite of these weaknesses, however, \\"Truman\\" is overall an excellent study of how a \\"common man\\" who was no different from your average \\"next-door neighbor\\" became one of the most important Presidents of the twentieth century. As \\"Truman\\" proves, there is a latent greatness in the average, taxpaying, middle-class American citizen - a fact which should provide encouragement if this nation ever again faces the problems and crises which Truman did. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This huge biography tells the story of a truly remarkable man, who rose from humble origins as a farmer and failed haberdasher - he was the last president not to have gone to college - to enter office at one of the most difficult junctures in the 20C, when the map of the world was being re-shaped after WWII. Though a history buff, he was thrust into power with little preparation and after virtually no contact with FDR, whom he served as VP for only 3 months. That Truman then achieved greatness and made astonishingly wise and shrewd decisions is rightfully the stuff of legend.Unfortunately, though this volume is thick enough to stop a bullet, I was continually diappointed with it. Rather than concentrating on the events that threatened to engulf Truman, McCullough undertakes the task of promoting him as a downhome, commonsensical kinda guy who exemplified some American ideal, i.e. that allowing someone from the heartland to take over government was a really good thing. I found this approach sentimental, defensive, and superficial, like a Ron Howard version of a very complex man.I would have been much happier if the book covered Truman's momentous decisions is greater detail. To mention a few: the use of the atomic bomb in Japan, the defense of Europe against communism (both militarily and economically, in opposition to the isolationism that was creeping back), the beginning of \\"loyalty\\" requirements in the government (and his failure to fight Joe McCarthy), and the Korean War (a \\"limited war\\" that did not seek \\"total victory\\", setting a new precedent). Instead of exploring these with any depth - and they dominated American politics and diplomacy for the next 50 years and even do today - McCullough briefly mentions them and then asserts that Truman pretty much did the \\"right thing\\" in his homespun wisdom and simple faith in himself and the American system. That is not good enough.What we get is a sanitised version of Truman the man, as he coped with these challenges. Unfortunately, I didn't get the feeling that I was learning much about him, except that he was perservering, modest, and naturally wise. You get no real window into his mind and very little of the dirt, except to justify that he somehow grew beyond it (which apparently he did): but he was a machine politician from the notoriously corrupt Pendergast Kansas City, his lack of education may have led him to make some serious misjudgments whose consequences we may never be able to judge. and he showed serious signs of cracking under the stress of it all. In a nutshell, McCullough liked him too much and hence lost the critical distance that a serious biographer needs. This feels almost like a work of propaganda, or a PR effort rather than a genuine work of scholarship.Perhaps the work of Robert Caro has set the bar too high for every biography that follows. Or perhaps McCullough is a reflection of the American self-satisfaction - the softball approach that perpetuates nostalgia for a time that never existed - that so grates on more skeptical Europeans. Alas, I found this biography mediocre, just not meaty enough."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This review echoes many others concerning this book. It simply begs to be read from beginning to end. McCullough provides stunning insight in all periods of not only Trumans life, but the history surrounding it as well by providing pertinent background information that gives the reader a far greater appreciation for the decisions and unbelievable circumstances that influenced this period in history. The former sets this work apart from some others. McCullough sets the record straight regarding later criticisms about Truman's personality, his decisions, his views, as well as about many individuals involved. The author in many instances tells both sides of particularly controversial issues and then drives home the truth by impeccable research and evidence. It isn't an apologetic however, and you get a really great glimpse of a flawed, but good, man that has not yet received his fair due. Plus, and perhaps most importantly, McCullough gives us a birds-eye look at the transition between times of the horse and carriage to atomic weapons. For anyone interested in history (which everyone should be, according to Truman) this is truly a fantastic book. It represents a stunning work of history, and coupled with McCullough's gift of narration, a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is biography the way it should be written, but too often historians are bland and brittle as writers. McCullough writes masterfully and holds the reader throughout 1,000 pages on the life of Harry Truman. This is one of the most superb historical biographies I have ever read because McCullough never stumbles: his research is impeccable, his writing style is enjoyable and his bias is kept at a minimum. Though it's obvious he admires (and perhaps even reveres) Truman, he never verges on hagiography. He balances the portrait with critical examination of his subject as well.McCullough also creates the sense of what it was like to be a farmer in Missouri in the 1920's; the reader can smell the corn, see the hay and feel the searing hear. He also illuminates just how *hard* Truman had to work in those years, the backbreaking labor farmers endured then is detailed throughout these middle chapters. He also never loses sight of the importance of Bess in Harry's story. McCullough reprints many of his love letters to her, which make engrossing reading. He doesn't neglect the private side of this very public man.This is historical biography at its zenith and this will stand as the preeminent Truman biography for many years to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This biography of Truman is one of the best biographies I've read - period. McCullough's writing style is enjoyable, his research exact, and his assessment of Truman fair, even if glowing. While his praise of Truman is undeniable, he also brings out Truman's weaknesses and biases - and there were clear ones.McCullough doesn't try to demonstrate that Truman was a better president than FDR, but reading this book confirmed my suspicions that, given the choice, Truman was a more genuine, efficient, and, in particular, more decisive figure than the man he replaced. Despite his relatively poor communication skills, Truman comes through as the right man at the right time. McCullough shows how Truman was faced with one excruciating decision after another in an uncertain era, and made all the right choices. One shudders to think of how American history could have been much darker had Henry Wallace or James Byrnes, the two men Truman beat out in becoming vice-president, had succeeded FDR."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Two critical means by which to judge an historical work are: 1. Does it inspire you to further research? 2. Does it help you to understand and more effectively participate in the world today? By both these standards, this biography is one of the best I have read.The ingredients are perfect -- a remarkable man leading the world through a time of incredible upheaval and change, when, as he himself said, the world had not caught up morally with their own technology, in the hands of a top flight historian.McCullough has researched his subject in breadth & depth. He presents contemporary and evolving points of view from newspapers, letters to the President from the public, foreign leaders and Truman's own associates, resulting in a truly three-dimensional image. This multi-focal handling is especially important in controversial areas in which opinions changed over time such as the decision to use nuclear weapons or to enter into hostilities against N. Korea.I read a lot of history, espeicially bios, but my secret junk food addiction is Stephen King; when I'm reading a Stephen King book I don't do anything else: I'm late for work because I'm up reading all night, and my friends don't see me. It's a break from the heavy stuff. Never would have guessed a presidential biography could grab me the same way. I want to clone this book so I can loan it to all my friends at once."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an excellent read. The upbeat writing holds attention with ease. Harry Truman comes to life in this suitably long book. Living through some of the fastest changing times in human history Truman's story is interesting of itself. That he became President of the USA and faced the nuclear bomb issue makes for fascinating and touchingly real political drama. The beginning of the cold war has a fresh perspective and complements Daniel Yergin's excellent 'Shattered Peace'. David McCullough is so good at describing people that his views of Churchill, Stalin and many other famous and important people of the day make for fascinating reading. A truly thought provoking read and above all eminently readable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A Pulitzer Prize winning book doesn't need my two cents worth, but in my view, this is an excellent book. I learned or relearned what the Korean War was about. I learned or relearned about Truman's contribution to Civil Rights. I learned or relearned how this country got into the anti-communism frenzy. And also I enjoyed reading about a man, known to be kind, tactful, and considerate, who lost his temper, just like any ordinary person.The further you get into the book, the more important it seems to become. At first it seems endless, but finally you don't want it to end. In that sense, it reminds me a little of Anna Karenin."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough does a superb job of telling Truman's story, a compelling one simply because of the events that unfolded. He is aided by Truman's own words, through his many letters, including several in which he held nothing back. The book is peppered with great quotes.Truman's flaws come through, but so does his tremendous character and his unflinching fidelity to friends, family and principles. The picture is that of a thorough, determined, decision maker. Truman's candor, and often irascible attitude keep the book entertaining. His loyalty to friends like Dean Acheson make it refreshing.I was impressed by McCullough's ability to hold my interest throughout. I seldom drifted, despite thorough treatment of Truman's roots, his role in WWI, his Pendergast ties as a County Judge and Senator, and FDR's last minute choice to name him VP during his final term.The narration breathes life into a presidency which saw the end of WWII, the Berlin airlift, the Marshal Plan, the creation of the UN, McCarthyism, and the advent of the atomic age with Truman's decision to bomb Hiroshima. Often, it felt like all of this occurred just yesterday.Simply a great book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Our family spent our summer vacation in the midwest, and while going through Independence decided to stop at the Harry S Truman home. While there I saw this book, thumbed through it for 10 minutes, and told my wife I had found my Father's Day present.It is simply incredible. McCullough's ten years of research comes through on every page. I was only six when Truman died in '72, yet I feel as though I lived through those times. Many have been the nights that I've gotten to bed well after midnight because I was coming up on a big event, and couldn't bear to wait.The style is powerful and intelligent, and quite objective. McCullough points out the good and the bad together with a very even hand."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman was president during my first 5 years. I grew up in a Republican household and seldom heard a kind word about him. This biography does a good job describing where he came from and what he did. And yes, he just may have seen more change in his life than any other president.I came away believing that he was an honest man who tried, and usually did, a good job of running what had became the most powerful nation in the world during his years of national service.This is a well written biography."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having just turned 30, Truman's presidency had ended long before I was born. Now that I've read Mr. McCullough's book, though, I not only feel as though I know Harry Truman personally, but I've been exposed to a world of political machines, international diplomacy, and high-level political struggles which I otherwise could not have known. By using a combination of descriptive prose, engaging anecdotes, and direct quotations, Mr. McCullough allows his readers to follow the life of Truman with vivid clarity. The length of the book is a benefit. It takes a while to read, so you actually live with Truman in your life for some time (thereby increasing the sense that he is becoming an acquaintance). I only wish that I could thank Mr. McCullough personally for introducing me to Mr. Truman -- a man whom I came to admire greatly. When I neared the end of the book and read of Truman's death, I literally cried at the loss of what had become a friend."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Yes, David McCullough may have liked Truman a little too much. That has a positive and negative side. When a biographer appreciates a person and admires his or her accomplishments, the research and readability of the volume can be enhanced. On the negative side, the biographical work can at times be a bit skewed, presenting heroism or greatness without indicating the faults or humanness of the individual.This is very readable and I must say I enjoyed the book very much. It is also true that the author doesn't delve deeply into issues such as McCarthyism, the dropping of the atom bomb, and other issues he faced which changed the world as we know it. It would have been fascinating to know more about why Truman acted as he did in such situations. I don't necessarily expect biographers to dig up dirt about a subject but readers should at least be given the inside story as much as is knowable.However, I do definitely recommend this book and believe you will find it well written and informative."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I recently completed Truman by David McCullough, which checks in at over 900 pages. I have to admit that I couldn't understand how a book about Harry Truman could possibly take up 900 pages. However I found that I, like many others, underestimated Truman in more ways than one.Harry Truman was certainly not from the mold of highly-educated, affluent, East Coast presidents. Raised in turn of the century Independence, Missouri, Truman was from beginnings that were humble at best. McCullough details his Missouri upbringing and roots in a fair amount of detail. Of particular importance are his relationships with his grandfather, father, and mother. Sharing his father's passion for party politics, the young Truman becomes part of the 'machinery' after a short, yet formative stint in the Army during WWI. Soon thereafter, he begins a long association with the Pendergrast organization of Kansas City that would dog him for the remainder of this political career.The story follows Truman from the local and state level through his rise to the Senate and Vice-Presidency. The fascinating part of the book begins here. As one would expect, any rise to the Oval Office would create notice. Add to that the overshadowing spectre of WW2. But it is really events that followed that made Truman's Presidency. The decision to use the Bomb and keep it in civilian control. The Marshall Plan. The spread of communism throughout the globe. The formation of Israel. The Korean conflict. Even the first hints of something to come in Vietnam. It could be said that every major American foreign policy event of the 2nd half of the 20th century begain during Truman's tenure. Truman fans will say his leadership prevailed during these years. And his detractors will say it was then that he made so many crucial missteps.Careful attention is paid to the other major players of the times and their impact on Truman: Roosevelt, Marshall, Eisenhower, Churchill, and Stalin. In addition, the lesser-known characters who were close to Truman are given fair treatment as well: Pendergrast, Bess Truman, and Dean Acheson, among others.At first glance (and lift) McCullough's work can be a little intimidating. But the pacing of the book is perfect and the structure (short, manageable sections) really frees one to read it quickly and easily. McCullough is clearly a big fan of Truman but does take care to portray the human aspect of Truman, faults and all.I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in Presidential history, 20th century US History, or US foreign policy in the last 60 years. I plan to move on to McCullough's other Pulitzer winner, John Adams very soon."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in American politics. For those not in the privileged classes, it's an inspiring story of how any American can rise to the highest office of the country and, in this case, prove to be a great leader."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As a Frenchman and an ex-journalist I have always been interested in WWI and WWII and the role of America in it. I love history and I have been reading history books since i was a little kid. Books about WWII and the aftermath of it are abundant and I have read a hell of a lot of them.But this one STANDS out as no others can do. It is amazingly comprehensive, detailed, far-stretching and giving the most intelligent knowledge of american society and american politics. I could not keep but reading it late at night and during daytime even at office.The portrait of Truman is really fascinating and this man is so comprehensively depicted and made so loveable in the book that it made me better understand what in Europe we owe to this great President. If anyone wants to undersand what happened in the world at large during the XXth century and to know better America and its people, this book is a must and I would be glad if it were made a compulsory reading for every French students.Truman by McCullough is a &quot;chef d'oeuvre&quot;.Michel Cahier"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is the best biography, and one of the best books, that I have ever read! Even at nearly 1,000 pages, this book is a page-turner. Mr. McCullough makes President Truman come alive. Even though you may know the outcome of important decisions-like the firing of General MacArthur or the decision to enter the Korean War-Mr. McCullough's descriptions have such a dramatic sweep and uncanny vividness that the book reads like a great epic novel. The book pulls you into events so vividly that each scene has a movie-like realism. For example, when Truman meets Churchill and Stalin at Potsdam you can see the entire scene, clearly, in your mind's eye and feel the weight of history on Truman's shoulders. This book also illustrates the great character that Truman possessed. While certainly aware of the political consequences of his decisions, Truman always seemed to deliberate over what was right for the country-not what was expedient for him. For this reason, his popularity, prior to his miracle 1948 re-election, was at an all-time low. Yet even if you disagree with him, you respect him for following his principles. The book also shows that only in America could someone like Truman-a failure at business and farming-rise to the highest office in the land during one of the most dangerous times in U.S. history. Another enlightening aspect of this book is how the author contrasts many of Truman's public statements and seemingly bold attitude with his feelings of inadequacy or indecision as revealed in his letters to his wife and family. This book makes the case that Truman was perhaps our greatest 20th century president. If you saw the HBO special, starring Gary Sinese as Truman, don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Too often, when biographies are written, the human quality of the subject is often forgotten, or at least not emphasized. As a result, at the end of a book, we really do not know the subject very well.Over the course of over 1,000 pages, David McCullough proves not only that Harry Truman was a great human being, but also that being a great human being made him a great president.It is a warm biography, and it skillfully analyses Truman's many failures in the business world, his involvement in a corrupt political machine, and his difficulties as president. Truman's personal qualities also show with his decisions with the atomic bomb (perhpas the hardest decision any president has had to make) and his firing of Douglas MacArthur.Harry Truman was the kind of fellow you admired as a grandfather, the kind of fellow you would want as a teacher or neighbor. But most of all, he deserves respect as a man--and David McCullough fantasticly succeeds in proving this.Also check out his other books, especially &quot;The Johnstown Flood,&quot; his first book, and one of his best."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Once in a while a book makes an indelible impact. For me, David McCullough's biography, Truman, is one of those magnificent books that I will forever cherish. I savored each page, and as I read, I didn't want Harry Truman's extraordinary story of courage and perseverance to end. Beyond his stature as President, Truman was a remarkable human being, striving always to do what was right.From the time he was a boy growing up in Missouri, young Harry S. Truman possessed a determination to work hard and succeed. He may have looked frail and awkward with his thick-lens spectacles, and he may have remembered himself as a \\"sissy\\" due to the fact he was shy and lacked athleticism during his adolescence, but he was well-liked and respected by his peers. He was a voracious, studious reader, and he loved to play the piano. He dreamed of wanting to become a renowned pianist or a famous general. After high school, he wanted to attend West Point, but his poor eyesight barred his acceptance. He went on to work various jobs, always earning high praise from his employers for his strong work ethic and intelligence. Then the Great War compelled him to fulfill what he believed was his duty to serve. At age thirty-five, he did not have to go, but going to war became the formative experience of Truman's life. Elevating himself to the rank of Captain of Battery D in the U.S. Army, the experience of battle on the frontlines changed him forever: gave him the confidence that, indeed, he possessed an innate quality to lead men. He gained the courage not to run from fights; he discovered the courage to inspire.These were traits demanded of him, after the death of Roosevelt, when he was catapulted into the unthinkable scenario of assuming the presidency. Confronted with the challenge of leading the nation through the end of the Second Great War, his choice to use the bomb against Japan was a deeply conscientious decision based on his considerations of the moral ramifications of using or not using an atomic weapon. He chose to use it as the soundest method to ending the war immediately, rather than deciding to expend the lives of potentially millions more, both on the American and Japanese sides, had the continuance of the war required the Allies to take the island of Japan in a military undertaking larger than that of the D-Day operation. During the postwar crisis, when the nuclear age and the rise of communism could have spun history towards apocalyptic disaster, he remained steadfast and optimistic with resolve to rebuff the Soviet advance in Europe by implementing the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the Berlin Airlift, all resounding achievements considering the tension the world teetered on. Aside from Churchill, Truman ranks in the 20th Century as one of the most the altruistic leaders of peace in his efforts to prevent the onslaught of a nuclear war.How Truman pulled out the 1948 election when every political pundit and media source declared him defeated is one of the most inspiring moments to read about in the history of American politics. As an elected president emerging from the shadow of FDR, Truman's agenda and what he stood for are representative of an exemplary leader. He was incorruptible, a man of the highest integrity and honesty. He had a remarkable ability to remain calm, composed, and poised with strength under pressure. And no matter how tough the decisions he had to make, he always fell back on choosing to do what was right, even in regard to the nightmare that transpired in Korea. His leadership was a testament of courage and perseverance to stand firm against communism. He believed with confidence in the triumph of democracy as the guiding force to achieve peace. In a world of trouble and fear, he was unblinking in his determination to steer American and Russia on a path to avoid destruction.Aside from his abilities as a leader, Truman was a model human being. He treated everyone with the same dignity and respect, never acting short or petty with anyone. He was friendly, likeable, cheerful, warmhearted, always smiling, and didn't take himself too seriously. He put his heart in the right place and never gave up on anything he undertook. He was considerate and soft-spoken. He was strong-willed, good-natured, and patient under duress. He had ambition to succeed, but he was always decent and never allowed himself to by misguided by power. He could always be relied upon for the truth, and counted upon to make conscientious decisions in the face of adversity. He was brave, hopeful, undaunted, and indomitable in all his duties. He believed in the cause of the common man and was loyal in wanting to do everything in his power to help those who struggled to make ends meet.McCullough's magisterial work on Truman's life is a tremendous inspiration to read. I love this book and Truman is one of my heroes."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"For a 992 page piece of nonfiction, there are times when this biography reads like a page turner. Because the late forties, early fifties is a time period all but ignored in most public school History classes I was ignorant of many aspects of the Truman presidency, and certainly about his life in general. This tome has cleared up that problem for me!McCullough is obviously a good writer and researcher, one cannot dispute those facts. He is also clearly enamored of his subject, and at times this makes him less critical then perhaps the situation warrants. But the moments where the author's bias detracts from the text are very few and far between. McCullough certainly does not shy away from some of the less desirable aspects of Truman's (and his associates') characters. Thus, that criticism of this text is unfair.The first 200 or so pages are the least interesting of the text, but that is mainly because they are about Truman's uninspired and uninteresting first 30 years of life. Harry S. Truman was a late bloomer! Then the text picks up as Truman starts a family and embarks on a political career. When he is nominated for vice president, the book kicks into high gear. The years of the Truman presidency were some of the most important in the twentieth century and McCullough gives great attention to events such as the conference at Potsdam, dropping the atomic bombs, the Marshall Plan, the beginnings of the Cold War, Truman's exciting reelection, etc.Yet another strength of the text is the cast of characters assembled around Truman. McCullough fleshes out their personalities and lives and at times I felt I was as immersed as Truman must have been in his own life. Names from history books now have personalities and other aspects of humanity attached to them, and thus History takes on a whole new dimension.It is rare that I will sit and read a work of nonfiction for uninterrupted hours at a time, but I found myself doing this numerous times with this text. McCullough knows, and proves, that History at its best is very exciting. This is a biography worthy of its subject. Truman's life incorporated period of immense change in the world (think about what happened from 1884-1972) and this text does an admirable job of catching the spirit and consequences of that rapidly evolving time.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This presidential biography should be used as a model by other historians. Compelling and truly interesting from the moment you first pick it up, at the end of this long read you will feel like you know Harry S. Truman.If you are considering reading a presidential biography, make this your first. If you're an avid reader, add this to the list. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"While the size of this biography is indeed somewhat intimidating, it is clearly one of the best, interesting, and comprehensive studies of Truman. It makes fascinating reading, and while McCullough appears to be a fan of Truman's, he leaves on unsavory traits unrevealed. It is truly one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"\\"Truman\\" is a first class biography of an American Icon. It is a thorough, well written narrative of a classic American life. David McCollough displays a knack for telling a part of the story and moving on so deftly that the vignettes flow on like a river. Born in Western Missouri into a family proud of its Southern heritage, Truman was molded by challenges and opportunities unique to his time and place. A bright boy, Truman was limited first by near sightedness, and later by glasses which he could not afford to lose. After moving into Independence for a quality high school education, he spent much of his early life working as a farmer near Grandview and in banks in Kansas City, where he met Arthur Eisenhower, brother of his successor. .In the army Truman established himself as a leader of men. Like Theodore Roosevelt, Truman would never have been president without his army service. After service in a light artillery battery of the Missouri National Guard, Truman, with several reasons to avoid service in World War I, enlisted and rose to the rank of Captain in Battery D of the Second Battalion, 129th Field Artillery. From training at Camp Donaphan through service in France and return to Kansas City, Truman earned the trust and affection of the men who would form the nucleus of his political support.1919 was a momentous year as Harry married his long time beau, Bess, and, with army buddy, Eddie Jacobson, opened the haberdashery of Truman & Jacobson. Although a hangout for veterans from Battery D, Truman & Jacobson fell victim to the recession and failed in 1922.Even before the haberdashery failed, a lifeboat arrived under the direction of another Battery D brother, Jim Pendergast. Jim, the nephew of Boss Tom Pendergast and machine representative in eastern Jackson County, solicited Truman as the machine candidate for Eastern Judge of the County Court. Not yet the dominant political power, the Pendergasts needed a popular veteran with a clean record in 1922 as badly as Truman needed them. This enabled Truman to run with Pendergast backing, but not as the machine candidate. After two years in office an alliance between a rival Democratic machine and the Republicans handed Truman his only electoral defeat. In 1926 he was elected presiding judge where his political leadership was evident in road construction and a new courthouse, paid for by the bond issues which he introduced.Term limited by tradition, Truman was looking for a job in 1934. After being passed over by Tom Pendergast for a Congressional seat and while considering a future run for governor, Jim the machine backing for the U. S. Senate. Surviving another tough primary race, he won and began his career as the much scorned \\"Senator from Pendergast.\\" Despite the handicaps of his background, Truman gradually won respect from his colleges. The 1940 primary fight against Governor Stork, who he had helped win election in 1936, returned him to the Senate with new respect. Truman distinguished himself through The Truman Committee to Investigate The National Defense Effort. Careful not to repeat the errors of the Civil War Committee On The Conduct Of The War, Truman worked tirelessly to save millions in defense costs.I had often wondered how, among all of the potential candidates for Vice-President, Truman was chosen. The interplay between Roosevelt, Henry Wallace, James Byrnes, Truman and behind the scenes Democratic operatives is one of the most interesting parts of the book. What emerges is a candidate who had gained the confidence of moderate Democrats who saw him as Presidential Timber.The only incident of significance during Truman's short Vice-Presidency showed something about his character. Attendance at the funeral of convicted felon Tom Pendergast demonstrated his strong loyalty to friends.I had known of some of the momentous events of Truman's presidency, but this book shows the nonstop sequence of crises which was thrust upon him. The confrontations at Potsdam, the worry about the development and use of the atomic bomb, the terms of settlement with Japan and the founding of the United Nations were just the beginning. Pent-up industrial unrest unleashed a wave of strikes which confronted the President with labor challenges unparalleled in American history. Soviet pressures in Europe, Jewish-Arab rivalries in Palestine and British financial collapse presented international challenges. The imminent threats which lead to aid to Greece and Turkey and the Marshall Plan are presented better than I have ever seen. The agonies over the Berlin Blockade and Airlift are skillfully told.The many angles of the 1948 election, in which Truman survived challenges to his nomination, defections to the left and right and a strong Republican challenge are deftly woven into a story which you will not want to put down.The 1948 victory was truly a summit from which Truman descended for the rest of his life. The second term during which the White House was restored, NATO established, China \\"lost\\" and Korea invaded was an era of frustration for a president whose hopes of establishing a \\"Fair Deal\\" degenerated into a struggle for survival. Committed to maintaining the gains of the Roosevelt-Truman administrations, Truman's intervention in the 1952 election was depressing as Adlai Stevenson ran away from the Democratic record. Upon his return to Independence, Mr. Citizen learned that he could never be plain old Harry again. His endorsements of Averill Harriman in 1956 and Stuart Symington in 1960 demonstrating his declining influence in party councils.Throughout the story is the ever supportive Bess, who with Margaret, Harry's mother and sister, Mary, provided him with support that would never desert.I have read many biographies, as my Amazon reviews document. This is one of the best. Whether you are a fan of \\"Give \`em Hell Harry\\" or believe that \\"To Err Is Truman\\" this book will help you understand and appreciate Truman in a deeper light."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truly, one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.

These parts of the book are absolutely gripping.I'd give the book as a whole 4 and a half stars. It can get a little dry at other parts, perhaps because of the superb attention to detail of the author, an acceptable vice, perhaps due to the nature of the subject, an unavoidable obstacle. All in all, a highly entertaining and superbly informative read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough has written one of the most remarkable books I've had the pleasure to read (and re-read). It is hard for me to imagine that people feel McCullough is worshipping Truman? I learned as much about his critics (and there were many) as the people that praised him. To suggest that Truman was not a great President and somehow does not rate this kind of attention misses the mark in my opinion. One only has to read how the people that worked for Truman feel about him (Acheson, Marshall, etc.). A great President, maybe not. A great man, absolutely. This book does an excellent job of explaining why Truman was so highly regarded by the people closest to him."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I'm A history buff and find David McCullough's Harry Truman biography interesting. The first half covering his early life and the two wars were fine but I find the account of his political career often slow going and overly detailed. Perhaps this opinion is colored by my lack of respect for the last two administrations in Washington. It is plain to see that Truman's belief in big government planted some seeds that led to our present mess."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book was entirely too long and too detailed.

The dust jacket was a bit tattered, but otherwise it was fine. No markings inside and very clean. I am happy with this purchase,"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book could have benefited from the hand of an editor determined to cut out some of the slower moving passages. I skipped paragraphs and sometimes pages without finding I'd missed anything of consequence when I went back to see if I was being too harsh. Over all it is a good read but probably should have been a 750 page book instead of a thousand. It also tends to defend most of Truman's actions while criticizing those of opposite viewpoints. Truman's devotion to the political machine in his home state begs for more in depth analysis than the author gives it. All in all I reccommend this book but also suggest that other authors be read before forming a definitive conclusion on this complex and interesting person."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This isnt a full book.

Highly recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I admired the book for talking about Truman's friendship with Eddie Jacobson. He and Eddie were business partners in the 1920's and Eddie (a Jewish man) later influenced Truman to help found the modern state of Israel. I am still disappointd as I am also searching for talk about (probably) Truman's other mostly unsung achievement-the firing of Churchill and the birth of modern India and Pakistan. Sadly the book offers nothing about that aspect of Truman's career."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The character of Harry Truman showed through in this book by David McCullough. Although I might not agree with Harry Truman's politics and I certainly cannot admire the era of the political boss, it is clear that Truman rose above this and consistently did what he believed to be in the best interest of the country. He was an honest man. This is unusual in politics and even more unusual in the Democrat Party."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"i have enjoyed my books very much, and the great price, thank you grace"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This was my first David McCullough book, and after reading it, I can safely say it will be my last. It's not that the book is bad - it's not, hence the three stars - but Mr. McCullough's style of history writing is just not my cup of tea, and anyone under forty will probably feel the same way. I can best describe McCullough's style as \\"old school,\\" wherein dates, names, figures, and facts are more important that grand ideas, central themes, and cause-and-effect relationships. There is also a hero-worship component to the old-school historian style, in which every infinitesimal fact about Truman's life is more important to the writer (and thus, the reader) than the external events taking place in the outside world. I somewhat enjoyed this book, but it was incredibly tedious at times. It barely mentioned key historical events, like the Henry Wallace campaign, or Truman's primary loss in 1952. But I know more than I ever cared to know about Truman's mom, dad, father-in-law, mother-in-law, cousins, daughter, wife, brother (Vivian), etc., etc. All in all, the book was okay, but it is the type of history-telling that makes kids' eyes glaze over at nine in the morning, Monday through Friday in schools across America. Anyone who fell in love with history with a new-school teacher, be forewarned - this book is not for us."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I have own this book since it first came out, and to this day, I like to pick it up and read various chapters and times of Harry S Truman. With this book, I feel as if I am standing right next to President Truman at whatever stage of his life and feel like I am there, live and in person.I admit I like David McCullough's style and his detail research. Plus, like me, he is from SW Pennsylvania. But I have read many of Mr McCullough's books and I simply have a hard time putting them down or putting them away. They sit within easy reach of my hands so that I can re-live a part of US history.And those who do not learn from history as destine to re-live it......"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an exceptional biographic work on one of the most important US presidents of the 20th Century. It is a useful narrative not just on Harry Truman personally, but moreso on the critical decisions that were made in the aftermath of World War II that set the stage for the fall of communism fifty years later. Although approaching 1,000 pages in the softcover edition, the narrative definitely piques your interest and sends you back to amazon.com seeking additional works on Truman, George Marshall, and Dwight Eisenhower."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"See all those &quot;Five Star&quot; ratings? There's a reason for it. This is THE biography of biographies. The book is huge and appears to be a daunting task, but McCullough makes reading this book so enjoyable, I finished it in the time it would usually take me to read a book half its length. One great thing about this book is that McCullough does not give anecdotes for the sake of giving anecdotes, he has a definate purpose behind giving each one. It helps the reader to understand Harry Truman the person, what he thought, how he acted. We see Truman's hopes hopes as well as his fears, his strengths as well as his weaknesses. If you're going to read one biography in your life, make it this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I have often heard about this book and the accolades for it are well deserved. Before reading it, I was never particularly interested in Truman. But after I read this immense project, I realized Truman's genius. McCullough details Truman's rise from an ordinary farmer, to WWI officer, to haberdasher, to local judge, to Congressmen, to VP, to President, and ends with a discussion of Truman's active retirement.The book is a beautiful narrative. The writing is exceptional. McCullough is not only capable of bringnig Truman to life but to brilliantly drawnig the historical events and people who inspired Truman and were fortunate enough to live in the same era as him. Although long, this biography is never boring nor dry. I look forward to McCullough's biography on John Adams which is due out in the next couple of years."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I listened to this book on tape while driving across country and I REALLY enjoyed it. A very fascinating story, and it was very well read on tape. I also thought it was neat that they had audio clips of Truman's actual speeches in the book on tape. From what I have &quot;learned&quot; so far in my education, I think the book is accurate. The book has many wonderful anecdotes about Truman."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I had no idea that biographies could be this compelling.

What more can be said about this amazing portrait of the President who participated in the First World War, helped end the Second, stood firm in Korea, and lived through Vietnam?However, the Kindle edition gets only a single star, and only receives it because it's lighter to carry a Kindle than the original tome. The publisher (and Amazon) should be ashamed. The book is riddled with typos, mis-placed punctuation, and even incomplete sentences. When you add the fact that the Kindle edition has a non-functioning index, you will be better served purchasing any other edition of the book--or better yet, check it out of your local library!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"At 1000 pages, the book was a little daunting, so I chose the abridged audio cassettes. David McCullough - renowned historian and narrator for Burns' &quot;The Civil War&quot; - wrote and narrated this audio book and did a splendid job.Truman, possibly the last &quot;common man&quot; president, lived an uncommon life with uncommon courage and accomplishments. He did not want to be vice-president or president, yet answered the calling. On one controversial issue where Truman was taking the high road, an aide commented that &quot;he would rather be right than president&quot;. He responded that &quot;he would rather be anything than president&quot;. How intimidating it must have been to take the reigns from FDR, especially since he had been virtually ignored as vice-president, yet Truman stood up to the test.Through all of his successes, he never forgot who he was or compromised his principles. He stood up to Pendergrass when given his first government post, and his integrity never wavered through the Senate and presidency. He truly realized &quot;the buck stops here&quot; and never eschewed making the big decisions or taking responsibility for them.He remained devoted to his wife, daughter, family and friends. McCullough cites numerous letters to wife Bess and daughter Margaret that provide great insight into the man. With strong self-confidence and no ego to nurse, he surrounded himself with brilliant and loyal men - Marshall, Bradley, Acheson, etc. - which helped him succeed in a crucial and trying time. Despite being surrounded by greatness and powerful people, he was not imtimidated by them, as evidenced by his handling of McArthur and Pendergrass.As much as I enjoyed this audiobook and McCullough's narration, it was much too short, so I guess I better purchase the book after all!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Once again, David McCullough writes a thorough and fascinating story of the 33rd president of the United States. The detailed research McCullough has included in the book shed a very personal light on Harry Truman, pulling the reader into the story and the time and the associated events and individuals. This is yet another great book by David McCullough, who is highly recommended.To those who enjoy David McCullough's writing, another highly recommended book is John Adams. These two books are a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's reading of his book, Truman, was clear, easy to understand, even with our hearing difficulties, and engaging. My husband and I listened to this book during a long car trip, with outside noises, and had no difficulties hearing it. We were captivated by his unbiased and often humourous rendition of this history during a time of our childhood. I sent a second copy to my mother who listened to it repeatedly until she wore it out!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"After reading the author's brilliant biography of John Adams, I decided to tackle his work on Harry Truman. I was not disappointed. This book is every bit the page turner as John Adams. Yet, as good a writer as McCollough may be, it was his subject that shone through the pages. Our accidental President, following in the footsteps of \\"The President,\\" showed all of us what can be achieved by moral courage, hard work, determination, bedrock values, honesty, and integrity. He faced some of the toughest issues (and opposition) ever faced by a President, he called them like he saw them, and never looked back. As he said, the President's job is to make decisions, and he did. I am sure he would cringe at today's world of spin politics, parsing the meaning of the word \\"is,\\" and the total lack of civility that seems to permate public life. Truman was a man of whom this country can and should be proud to have called its President. Sadly, we cannot say that about others who have followed him to the White House."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough single-handedly put Harry Truman back on the map with this masterful book.Harry Truman has never loomed large on the history of US Presidents. After all, he followed one of the most enduring of all leaders--FDR--and was followed by one of the greatest Generals of American history--Dwight Eisenhower. However, in this book, McCullough shows the incredible role that Truman did play in shaping modern American history.Truman was a pioneer in the civil rights movement, becoming one of the first Democrats to begin to turn that into a major issue for the party. He was a plain-spoken man, who held no punches--after all, he was the president who decided to drop the atomic bomb.For all of his complexities, Truman really stands out in this work as someone who really stood up for what he believed in--at all cost. This work serves to elevate Harry Truman to a level that he deserves in American History.It's a wonderful read and incredibly intruiging. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I'm not sure if I can say anything about this book that has not already been said. But it is just a monumental, classic work. You feel like you know Truman personally while reading it. It is unbelievably attentive to detail. This is a consummate biography by a consummate author."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I knew this was going to be a great book when a history professor dismissed it as a book &quot;written for the popular audience by an amateur historian.&quot; And this book went on to win the Pulitzer, while my professor's book has come and gone off the bookshelves, and remains unread because academic historians don't know how to write for anyone but themselves. David McCullough is concerned with only one thing; his reader. He spent the better part of a decade researching Harry Truman, he liked what he found, and he wants to share it with as many readers as possible. And so he wrote this beautifully. His style makes you want to keep reading further, to find out what happens with Harry's life. And no matter how much you think you know about HST, McCullough always finds something new that you didn't know. This may be a thick book, but if anything, when you get to the end, you wish it was longer. You also wish you knew Harry Truman personally, too. This is a biography by which others should be measured against."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough presents his subjects in a way no other biography has done. He makes the subject jump out at you as if he were sitting right next to you. Granted, McCulough has had some great material with Adams and Truman, but the readability of a McCullough is just amazaing.On this trek through time, I used, for the first time, a book on CD. MCullough was the narrator and, like his writing, he is a great narrator. I bought the CD on my way home from New York City, a two and one half hour trip to my home, and found myself driving around my neighborhood to finish the CD's.McCullough presents this simple, but powerful man in a way I have not seen before. Truman, based on McCullough's book, keeps his independent, straightforward attitude during the ending of the most difficult time this country has faced so far, WWII. Truman, faced with the decision to drop the atomic bomb, is a man who can, according to McCullough, make a decision and move on.According to McCullough, Truman does this on both personal and public occassions. With Bess, Truman is beside himself with wanting to marry her. According to McCullogh, he wrties to her and seeks an answer-- I am sure this happens to all those who date today. Bess rejects him, he moves on. Ultimately, Bess sees in Harry a truly great and independent man, but, based on the book, was being pulled in another direction by her mother who didn't believe Harry was good enough for her Bess, even when he was President in an account highlighted by McCullough.In his public affairs, Truman was straightforward as well. WIth Mcarther, according to McCullough, Trumnan decided that the man who was defying the orders of the Commander-n-Chief, deserved a face to face meeting about what the United States was going to do in Korea. Just prior to his trip, according to McCullough, Truman says to his (cousin, I believe), he is going to \\"meet with God.\\" How's that for straightforward! But, my point is that Harry was ordinary and told it like it was and McCullough brings this out so well.For those of you interested, but short on time, like me with three kids, a law practice and an occassional chore around the compound, the books on CD are a great way to \\"read.\\" This was my first, but probably not my last. I would suggest to you, though, that you have to pay attention to the road even if your \\"hands are free.\\""},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I read a lot, and lots of biographies, and this is the best I've ever seen. I was in Africa, on the way to China, when Truman became president, and now I've finally what we were doing and why.Truman was a remarkable man who hid his capacity for greatness until it was needed. McCullough tells the reader why he did what he did. &quot;Truman&quot; even tops McC's bio of John Adams, which is a major accomplishment.But get ready to hear a lot about HST. This is not a volume to be read in an evening or even a week. It's so well written that it would have been easy for me to race through it like a novel, but it deserves much more than that, including some re-reading.I hope it's as much fun for you as it was for me -- and it's on my shelf waiting to give me another start-to-finish two weeks of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"McCullough is the finest writer of his genre today. If the amazing popularity of his John Adams' biography wasn't enough to convince you of his skill, this book certainly will. The research is impeccable, the detail intricate and the style so readable that the nearly 1,000 pages go by in far too short a time. I had read Hamby's Truman and nearly choked on it, but I am glad I gave HST another look, because his story, as told by (an admiring but balanced) McCullough makes a great case for the comment that Harry Truman was exactly the man the Founding Fathers had in mind when they put their faith in the future of our popular government."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Do you have an image of Harry Truman as an ordinary man, a common man who became the accidental president, as a man overwhelmed by the crises of the twentieth century? Do you have the impression that Harry Truman was a dull man and that his life would be too boring to read about? If so, how wrong you would be. David McCullough's biography &quot;Truman&quot; is as detailed and beautifully written a biography as you will find. Here Truman comes alive and steps out of history to reveal the admirably decent, hugely courageous, and impressively competent man that he was. While his early years are interesting, particularly his role in WW I, and while his formative years in politics as part of the Pendergast machine are enlightening in their revelation of how politics in America work, it is in the long discourse on the presidential years that the book becomes totally spell-binding.The Truman presidency took place at a time in history when the world as we know it, the world of the Cold War and the age of possible nuclear holocaust, was becoming a reality. It is utterly fascinating to witness Truman and the men around him struggle with the issues that arose for those who were &quot;present at the creation.&quot; Here is the story of an America intent on bringing home its sons after victory in WW II, only to find itself forced to deal with the birth pangs of a new age and new conflicts. The country that Truman now led was suddenly made aware of its responsibility for the survival of democratic freedom in the world. Faced with this enormous responsibility, Harry Truman stood tall and made the right decisions. As Winston Churchill made clear to President Truman, &quot;you more than any other man have saved Western civilization.&quot;Herein, read about the decision to drop the atomic bomb as well as Truman's determination that it should never be used again. Herein, read about the American concern over the growing domination of eastern Europe by the Soviet Union, the founding of the United Nations, Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey, the creation of the C.I.A, Truman's insistence on civilian control of nuclear weapons, the Marshall plan, the Berlin Airlift, the creation of NATO, the founding of the state of Israel, the creation of the People's Republic of China, the Korean War and the sacking of MacArthur. Read about Truman taking the head of the United Mine Workers Union to court, seizing the steel mills, and the staunch defense of his associates from the attacks of McCarthy. Read about his amazing whistlestop campaign and thrilling victory in the 1948 campaign. And don't forget the almost total rebuilding of the White House that so few people are aware of. It is all here. Never in the twentieth century did a president have to wrestle with so many critical issues, and never did a president serve humanity so wisely.Along with this study of Truman the president we find emerging a vivid portrait of Truman the man. His personal qualities and his role as husband, father, and friend reveal him as a loving, kind, caring, and honest man who valued loyalty and decency. While under attack and low in the opinion polls when he left office, we can only stand amazed at the extent to which his critics and the political right would go for their own partisan purposes. Fortunately, with time, history has a way of correcting the picture of men who are often vilified in their own time by partisan politics. This has certainly been the case with Harry Truman who must be rated near the top, if not at the very top, of a list of the most outstanding presidents of the twentieth century. We speak of Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and Mao as among the giants of the century, but certainly Harry Truman belongs with them. McCullough's book will explain why.In sum, McCullough's book is a must for anyone interested in American history and politics in the twentieth century. It is also rewarding as a study of how a humane and decent man can enter the rough and tumble world of politics and retain his integrity, sense of humor, and honesty. Read it, enjoy it, and contemplate it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I read most of the negative reviews in these pages and I noticed a common theme. Most of these reviewers are accusing McCullough of Truman Worshipping. I frankly question weather some of these reviewers have even read the book, as general as their criticism seems too be. I guess I can't blame them, because this incredibly detailed book of 1,000 pages could be criticized for being overly long.What is unquestionable is that McCullough likes Truman. I heard him say that in his 10 years of research on this book. He never talked too anyone, who knew Truman personally, that had a bad thing to say about him. Reading the book I find numerous times where Truman's questionable actions are documented. The personal failures of his youth and early political career are well covered in the book and yet what is astonishing is that this guy becomes president of the USA. I have come away from reading this book, not worshipping Truman, but better understanding what a complex character he was. Harry really was an unlikely Hero. After reading his book, like McCullough, I couldn't help liking Truman for who he was. I feel I came to that conclusion knowing just about everything there was too know about Harry Truman. Thanks to David Mccullough's hard work!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having read and enjoyed several David McCullough books I was at first intimidated by the 1,000 page size of this tome. But in usual McCullough style it was a real page-turner (for three weeks) and I could not stop except to work and sleep until I had finished. This is a truly intriguing story about Harry S. Truman and his presidency. Numerous other reviews on the site can give you a review of the content and I will not repeat that here but assure you this is a story well worth your time to read. It puts the likes of William Jefferson Clinton to shame. We as Americans could not do much better than to elect the likes of Harry Truman to the highest office of the land. I do not subscribe to the Democratic liberal philosophy and certainly would disagree with much of Harry Truman's &quot;Fair Deal&quot; legislative programs, but indeed he was a great President and even greater American. Do not let the 1,000 page size keep you from enjoying this must read book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Enjoyed McCullough's easy to read and engaging writing style. The personal details on Truman were good and McCullough paints a lovely family man. However, McCullough concentrates mainly on the positive and loving details of \\"good old Harry\\". Reads like a family authorized version through rose colored glasses. Worth reading but one needs to read other books for a more complete picture.The book skips over so much and offers little discussion as to why certain decisions were made. Little detail on how corrupt the Pendergast machine was, yet Harry was very much a part of it. Dewey,his rival for President, did not campaign much but had helped clear up the \\"machine\\" in NY(not mentioned). Skips Harry's part in Yalta, skips why he was not a popular President after he left office and why that was(except for his down home ways). So my review would be fun to read, but beware, not a balanced view."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is an excellent and engaging work. The background starts before the Civil War (War Between the States) in laying the foundation of Truman's family and background - it was enjoyable and a key factor in integrating the features of the man. Overall, the treatment of Truman has strengths and weaknesses but the strengths clearly outweigh the weaknesses.Several things are not touched on in the book were disappointments because they were missing. One must wonder if they were left out because they would mar the good name and image of Truman. The following is not addressed in the biography:1. Truman's role in U.S. Foreign Policy and reconstruction in Japan.2. Truman's role in U.S. Foreign Policy and China, including the Nationalist and Communist civil war.3. Truman's role/opinion of the Rosenberg Trial and the handing of Atomic and Hydrogen bomb secrets to the Russians.4. Truman's accommodations made with J. Edgar Hoover during his second term.5. Truman's involvement and support of setting up spy networks in Eastern Germany and cozy relocation of Nazis to South America.6. Truman's involvement with Juan Peron in his ascension to power as a dictator who established favorable relations with the U.S. in 1948, which remains an area to be explored in history and foreign policy studies generally."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry Truman was in the middle before he was born. His maternal grandparents were slave-holding Unionists in the border state of Missouri in the days before the American Civil War, while his uncle \\"Jim Crow\\" Chiles was a murderous Confederate renegade.Later on, Truman found himself in the middle again, a compromise choice for Vice President pushed into the Oval Office in the closing days of World War II. Truman saw that through to victory, then presided over the beginning of two other wars, the Korean War and the Cold War. \\"Unless Russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language another war is in the making.\\"Truman's greatest victory may have been his re-election bid in 1948, where he ran against not only a strong Republican but fellow Democrats running to his right and left. Denigrated for years after his administration as a middle-class mind thrust to high office, Truman is now hailed as a president of near-great status, in large part because of the stolid, gritty way he held to the middle path.\\"He was not a hero or a magician or a chess player, or an obsession,\\" wrote Mary McGrory in the Washington Star the day after his funeral in 1972. \\"He was a certifiable member of the human race, direct, fallible, and unexpectedly wise when it counted.\\"Another key reason for Truman's high ranking is this biography, published in 1992 and maybe the most celebrated, popular single-volume biography of any president. David McCullough tells a fascinating, detail-packed story that reads much faster than its doorstopper bulk suggests.McCullough lays some myths to rest (Truman was not a member of the Ku Klux Klan; the slogan \\"The Buck Stops Here\\" was on his Oval Office desk for only a short time) while making Truman's story very tactile to the reader, so that even when you know what will happen (Truman will drop the bombs on Japan, he will fire MacArthur) you find yourself pulled along suspensefully by McCullough's unshowy, alive-to-every-twitch prose.It helped that Truman was no glory-seeker and didn't suffer from a giant ego. He didn't like the White House too much, calling it a \\"great white jail.\\" There were no holidays from history for this guy; he buried two press secretaries and scored lower in popularity polls than have either Nixon or George W. Bush (at least as of this writing).McCullough writes sympathetically but not without slavish devotion. He mentions darker aspects of Truman's character, such as his racial insensitivity and his too-trusting attitude regarding some of his friends. But he doesn't lean on them the way Robert Caro would. McCullough faced a challenge in this book Caro never has; he genuinely likes the guy he's writing about. The amazing thing about \\"Truman\\" is the way it shows how one can write a terrific, fluid, captivating biography without constantly needling the subject.\\"I'm not doing this for credit,\\" Truman once said, about the Marshall Plan though it could have been anything. \\"I am doing it because it's right.\\" People like that existed; maybe they still do. Either way, it's good having a record of their existence as great as this."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"At approximately 1,000 pages, the sheer size of this biography might turn some readers away. Despite its length, however, it is never boring. McCullough's account of Harry Truman's life reads like a novel -- I literally could not put it down.The Harry Truman that emerges from this book seems all the more remarkable within the context of the late 20th century politicians. How the public might react to his decisions was usually the last thing on his mind, contrary to political figures today. He made his decisions strictly on the basis of what was best for the country, no matter who agreed with him. He made many decisions that were unpopular at the time (such as firing WWII icon Douglas MacArthur) that proved to be the correct decision. He was also not afraid to speak out on controversial issues of the day such as civil rights, even though the Congress and the majority of the country were not ready to follow his lead. The eventual civil rights legislation enacted in the 1960s showed that Truman was again on the right side of history. If some of our more recent Presidents had Truman's integrity, perhaps we could have been spared things such as Watergate, Iran-Contra and Monica Lewinsky.Thanks in part to the writing style of McCullough and in part to his subject, this is biography at its very best. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Reading the biography Truman by David McCullough is not just a history lesson but a lesson on how to be an American. From very average roots and background, Harry S. Truman became the President of the Greatest Country in the World during a time when he was needed most. What I learned most about the man was that he never gave up, never succumbed to his enemies, was kind to those around him and was loyal to a fault. As President, he honored and respected the position of power that he had and always looked forward to the effect that his decisions might have on the next Presidents.McCullough may not be the best writer or the best historian, but McCullough is best at bringing history to the masses of readers that might not otherwise have read something of this magnitude. It took McCullough ten years to research and write this book; it is easy to tell that McCullough's heart and soul is in this biography. There have been criticisms that McCullough likes his subjects too much and that might be true, but he still lays out the negatives, even if they are not dwelt upon.This book is not just about Truman; it is about the United States from 1884 through 1955. All of the events of that time are told through Truman's eyes and heart. This book examines the lives of regular people because Truman was just a regular American. He may be the last of the civilian politicians.There have been so many reviews of this book that I am sure that nothing I have to say is original, but this book is so good, that I would feel that I was letting down McCullough and Truman without at least putting my two cents in. I wished that I had started reading history and biographies 10-20 years ago, because books like this one are so entertaining and enjoyable and therefore 1000 pages is not daunting in the least. I couldn't wait each day to begin the next few pages of this book. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about America and its recent history as well as learning and coming to know one of the most terrific personalities to inhabit the White Hous"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is far and away the best Presidential biography I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The subject, Harry S. Truman is a likable man who rose to the office of President in an unlikely manner and is the last common man to earn that office. The Biographer is a fabulous storyteller who creates a tapestry of Truman's life that is complex in detail but simply explains his rise and the choices he made along the way.Reaching back to the earliest white Missouri settlers, McCullough mixes together the elements that formed the family into which Truman was born - poor, hardworking farmers whose luck was never good, misfortune piling upon misfortune. From this Truman grew and became self-made time and time again. It always seems that Truman's about to thwarted in life, but instead he's just propelled in a new direction.Things I really like about Truman - he was loyal. He was loyal to his friends to a fault. He was loyal to his country and his family. To his wife whom he adored he was completely faithful. He was humble, wondering always at his good fortune even when his business was crumbling, the farm worthless, and his mother-in-law (who thought he was never good enough for her daughter, even when he was president of the United States of America). He took responsibility. When was the last time we heard the Chief Executive say, \\"I made the decision and I stand by it.\\" Truman stood by his decisions and took responsibility for those under him. The Buck Stopped There.How did he come to prominence? - He joined the army late in life despite horrible eyesight, but he quickly found that men liked him and he could lead them. As an artillery officer he commanded respect from large groups of men. After World War I, he went back to Missouri and attempted to be a businessman, but failed. During that time he caught the attention of local party bosses because of his ability to lead men and influence their decisions, and he earned a spot as a county judge. From there he rose through the corrupt party organization of local boss, Tom Pendergast.He wasn't a wealthy man - ever. He was always worried about paying the bills and even when he was in the White House, he and his wife stuck to a strict budget to make ends meet. Despite his humble circumstances he never sold out his principles for money. He stayed true to himself.Truman was the most progressive president we've had. He proposed universal health care in the 40's. He pushed civil rights legislation, despite his own racism and antisemitism. Under Truman the G.I. Bill came to be, which arguably created the modern middle class in America by improving and not abandoning the veterans.He dropped the bomb. Yes he did. He did it and he took responsibility for it and he believed that it was the right thing to do. That's a point that can be argued ad infinitum. But what he did do is keep the control of nuclear weapons in the hands of civilian authorities. Why? Because it's not a military decision to kill hundreds of thousands of civilians, it's a political one. He was right about that.I could go on, but I won't. It's a startling work of nonfiction and I can't recommend it highly enough.- CV Rick, February 2008"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book is as rich in importance as the subject himself. Truman will be the last of the common-man presidents, and McCullough (an icon himself) presents this in such magnificent style. Truman, with his farm background, surely is the last person who will ever rise to this high office without having gotten a college degree. Great tidbits of relatively unknow elements of the Truman life: No middle name, birth tree, friendships, farmhouse, etc. For so long Truman has been ignored as one of the greatest of Presidents, this changes that image. HST should be in the Top 10...and this book on your \\"To Read List.\\""},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This biography of Harry Truman is about what you would expect from David McCullough--a detailed, massive work, illuminating the character of Truman with detailed documentation. The end result is a book that appears to capture the nature of its subject excellently. On the front inside cover, there is a quotation from a reviewer that speaks to the effectiveness of this book: \\"Perhaps the biggest tribute one can pay a biographer is to say that through him one comes to know his subject almost as though in person.\\" I second that sentiment, after having read the 992 pages of text.One assessment of Truman is telling, and suggests how a common man could become an uncommonly good president. Adlai Stevenson, upon Truman's death, said that Truman was a lesson about all Americans (Page 992): \\"an object lesson in the vitality of popular government; an example of the ability of this society to yield up, from the most unremarkable origins, the most remarkable men.\\"His origins are well detailed by McCullough. The movement of his forebears to Missouri, the struggles of his parents, and his own struggles. In some senses, it is apparent that his role in World War I was a key moment in his life. He came to be a leader--and very effective at that--in an artillery unit. He made fast friends who stayed loyal to him for decades (including a son of one of the leaders of the Pendergast machine in Kansas City). He grew greatly as a consequence of his wartime experience.After the War, as many know, he experienced a series of reverses, including a failed haberdashery business. But he persevered. At one point, the Pendergast Machine turned to him to run for county judge. He won! Thus began his political career. An irony, of course, is that someone who was well reputed for his honesty began his career under the sponsorship of one of the most important (and corrupt) political machines in the country. But the Machine never really forced him into corrupt behavior and supported him pretty steadily thereafter. His rise in politics is outlined, including his run for and election to the United States Senate. It appeared close to impossible for him to have won--but win he did. There is a nice discussion of the efforts to have him become the Vice Presidential nominee of FDR in 1944.From there, of course, his accession to the presidency after Roosevelt's death. The biography does a fine job of outlining his ups and downs, his triumphs (desegregating the Armed Forces, continuation of New Deal agenda, helping end the Second World War) and his failures (nationalizing the steel industry). Korea eroded his support and he ended up with approval ratings similar to George W. Bush.After his presidency ended, he exuded energy as he became an \\"elder statesman\\" of the Democratic Party; he helped develop support to get his presidential library off the ground and completed.All in all, this ranks as one of the finest serious presidential biographies around. If you wish to learn in depth about Truman, this is a good place to begin. It is also a work that is nuanced, pointing out his foibles and flaws as well as his strengths. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I consider myself a fan of history (I like it, but don't know enough and mis-remember even more). David McCullough's books bring to life the stories of our country (and events) in a compelling manner that makes you want more. I eagerly look forward to each of his well researched and \\"human\\" look at what has helped shape the U.S. to where we are today. Each of these should be required reading for middle school & high school students - the conversations they create will bring benefits for our future generations. This is even more true for the biographies as he develops the person which helps explain the why - and not just the what happened. Bravo Mr. McCullough, very well done indeed."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I read this book when I first moved to Independence, MO. I figured it would give me some insight and background into my new hometown. \\"Truman\\" did that and more. I gained a wealth of knowledge about American government and early/mid 20th century history. As a child of the 60's and 70's, I was clueless about much of this history. Now that I know about the Truman doctrine and Marshall plan, I understand how important it is for our nation to reach out and help other nations who want our help. Harry Truman was an ordinary guy who proved that even ordinary guys can accomplish extraordinary things."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman, the biography of President Harry S. Truman, is a book worthy of its Pulitzer Prize. David McCullough is a masterful storyteller and is superb at using seemingly unrelated events in Truman's life to foreshadow his most significant actions. Truman may have become President by an accident of history (the death in office of Franklin Roosevelt), but McCullough's exhaustive research on his subject reveals how well-prepared Truman actually was to assume the office. Truman was often overshadowed by his close association to larger-than-life figures (boss Pendergast in Kansas City, General Douglas MacArthur, and of course, FDR), but the book illustrates Truman's significance in establishing his own place in our history. If Thoreau was correct to observe that \\"books should be read as carefully as they are written\\" then you will want to take the time to digest all that McCullough has written about a figure who became famous for displaying a headline indicating that he lost a Presidential election that he actually won. It will be well worth the effort!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's \\"Truman\\" has won many accolades and awards, chief among them the Pulitzer Prize. After reading this wonderful book from cover-to-cover in less than a week, I'm convinced that this book deserves all of the praise it has received, and more.\\"Truman\\" is the ultimate, complete package in a presidential biography. Even a novice of 20th century history (this writer included) would have a list of important events that he or she would want to read about in a Truman bio. McCullough covers them all, and in detail: the decision to drop the atomic bomb, FDR's death and the transition to the Truman administration, the Potsdam conference, the creation of the United Nations, the Korean War, the firing of MacArthur, the 1948 election, his decision to not run in 1952, etc. McCullough touches all of the bases beautifully.The highest compliment I can think to give McCullough for this book is the sense of balance in his writing and how he brings Truman to life. Mostly absent from this book, thankfully, is the rampant cheerleading and bootlicking that plague other presidential biographies. McCullough isn't a Truman admirer who puts a positive spin on every significant event during Truman's presidency. It's obvious that McCullough thinks highly of Truman, but he grapples with the controversies of Truman without softpeddling, unlike Stephen Ambrose's one-volume \\"Eisenhower: Soldier & President,\\" where Ambrose neglects important events and spends entirely too much time raining down praise on Ike.This thoroughly researched book presents Truman in a fair and balanced manner, and much of that research is based on Truman's diaries. \\"Truman\\" covers the president's bad decisions as well as his good ones, with the president's rationale behind those decisions.I highly recommend this book and I believe it sits high atop the heap of the many available presidential biographies. McCullough is one of America's finest historians. Buy this book, read it, and in the end, be disappointed that it's over."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"The winner of the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1993, this is the standard that all historical biographies should aspire to. This is an inspiring, entertaining and wonderfully readable story (notwithstanding the 992 pages) that truly makes you wish it wouldn't end. The trademark of David McCullough biographies is that you really feel like you know the subject and are a part of his story throughout(Washington Roebling, Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams are subjects that McCullough has brought back to life through his wonderful writing style). Truman's story is no exception as we see him progress from small-town farmboy to the Presidency. This epic starts a little slowly with Truman's childhood and early adult life, but picks up dramatically with his involvement in World War I (where we first see his leadership capabilities) and doesn't let up from there. Post war business failures only seemed to inspire him and his career advances with his recruitment into the Pendergast political machine of Kansas City. Through a number of low-level political jobs, Truman builds his reputation as a &quot;no-nonsense&quot; leader that ultimately gets him elected to the Senate and into the national political arena. This is the point that this book really takes off and offers some of the best writing that I've ever read. Truman's nomination as Vice-President, his attainment of the Oval Office upon FDR's death, the Potsdam peace conference,the Truman Doctrine/Marshall plan and his decision for the use of the Atomic Bomb are chapters that make for really breathtaking reading. The amazing thing is that through all of this McCullough manages to keep the reader on a personal level with Truman and you really feel his tension and emotions through those &quot;heady&quot; times. We seem to learn about what it's like being the President right along with him in his first term and not many biographies can afford that level of intimacy. The 1948 campaign against Thomas Dewey, the development of NATO, the assasination attempt by Puerto Rican nationalists and the progressing involvement and subsequent military campaign in Korea (along with the ultimate firing of Douglas MacArthur) are all highlights of the second half of the book and continue the rich and elegant writing style. Truman's decision not to run in 1952 and his post-Presidency activities right up to his death in 1972 are poignantly covered as the story closes. Personality sketches of such historical legends as Chuchill, Roosevelt, Acheson, Marshall and Eisenhower are fabulous and offer many new perspectives to this phenominally important period of our history. Truman's &quot;give 'em hell&quot; attitude is prevelant throughout, highlighted by the following excerpt...&quot;For a while the mood overall seemed one of a death watch over his Presidency. New poll results showed that only 32% of the people approved of the way he was handling his job; and 43% thought it had been a mistake for the U.S. to go to war in Korea. But polls meant no more to him now than ever before. &quot;How far would Moses have gotten if he'd taken a poll in Egypt?&quot;... Alonzo Hamby, the noted Truman historian, noted in the bibliography of his book &quot;Man of the People&quot; that McCullough's account &quot;was a nicely told story, but episodic and lacking historical perspective&quot;, a critique that, I think indirectly, is McCullough's intent...he doesn't want to just re-tell historical facts with his biographies. His real objective is to tell the human story and fit it into the historical context and he succeeds overwhelmingly. Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I've been a fan of President Truman since I was a teenager thirty years ago. I first began reading about him coincident to my favorite president, Roosevelt. It took time and a few books, but the more I read about Harry Truman, the more I admired. We were suffering through the presidency of Jimmy Carter, who so many compared as a 'common man' to Harry Truman. I soon learned that there was little in common between the two. Though they shared a common distinct and deep sense of morality and right and wrong, Truman was a President who understand the necessity of compromise.Mr. McCullough's book is as straightforward and understandable as his broadcasting. I must confess, I didn't learn anything new about Truman from this book, but I'm not the average reader. It really didn't matter anyway, because the writing is so enjoyable. Truman was an accidental president, and one who so many thought not up to the job. My parents used to tell me about the ridicule and scorn so many had for Truman, rather like the attitude toward Dan Quayle. Time has reversed that, and it's freely acknowledged that anyone would have had a hard time following FDR!Truman's tenacity and focus is nowhere better demonstrated than his relationship with his wife and her family. Being upper-class, Bess's mother never considered Truman worthy of her daughter, even after he reached high public. Bess's lack of political support for her husband is well documented. Her dislike of D.C., manifested by returning to Independence at every possible opportunity, is also well known. Somehow over the course of decades he was accepted into her family, though the Truman residence in Independence was actually the Wallace family home.Time has served to enhance not only Truman's stature but to validate his decisions. While lacking FDR's ability to mobilize and modify America's people, he proved a firm and resolute leader, and one for which right and wrong were more than mere words.This is a tremendous book and would be a terrific introduction to President Truman and his times."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Having finished this biography recently, I am compelled to agree with General George Marshall's assessment of Harry S. Truman, and one that is put in context by the fact that Marshall &quot;never complimented the people with whom he worked. It was not his way.&quot; (pg. 614)Marshall, who rarely attended such events, delivered the following at Harry Truman's birthday party, May 8th, 1948: &quot;The full stature of this man will only be proven by history, but I want to say here and now that there has never been a decision made under this man's administration, affecting policies beyond our shores, that has not been in the best interest of this country. It is not the courage of these decisions that will live, but the integrity of the man.&quot;This book is just simply a masterpiece, about one of the most important leaders of the 20th Century. McCullough cannot receive enough praise for what he's done."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Correction. It is his best work, period. When I visited President Truman's home &amp; gravesite earlier this year, this book came back to me though I read it several years ago. It was a fine reference &amp; provided some background to what I saw in the mueseum. It even provided me with answers to questions our fine mueseum guide didn't have. This may be a definitive biography for an overview of Truman's entire life, as there are fine books on World War II, the Korean War &amp; the election of 1948 (The Last Campaign comes to mind). I felt as if I wanted to send a copy to President Clinton although I suspect he knew of it. The dark days of 1946 &amp; 1994 when the Republicans gained a majority in congress were very similar, as were the come from behind victories of both men in 1948 &amp; 1996. The other reason was for the moral clarity that Truman seemed to have. We have no better example of a man growing into a job. Truman did. Lucky for us."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"There is something for everyone in this excellent biography. Democrats will revel in the last great age of liberalism, with a truly populist president who actually believed government could make life better for the average citizen. Republicans can admire a great man who was a great president, a man wholly matched with the incredible demands of the momentous events he shaped and influenced.McCullough has written a masterpiece, worthy of the attention of anyone who is interested in the history of our country in the middle of the 20th century. I've read many political biographies, and this stands with the very best, both in terms of writer and subject."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I was never a fan of biographies until I read this one. The pacing is great and it's not a bit boring. I plan to read McCullough's other books, especially 1776."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Excellent! Reading this book was like a review of my early life. Many questions I have always had about Truman and why he did what he did were answered completely. Anyone interested in modern American history should read this book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is by far the best biography I have ever read. Massive in size (over 1000 pages), the reader is glided along by McCullough's beautiful prose until Harry seems like one of the family. Swept into power by the death of the glorious Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman said to the press covering his swearing in: \\"Pray for me boys, I feel like the sun, the moon, and all the stars just fell on me...\\" Little did he know that he was to become what historians call a \\"near great\\" president. In this political age where every move made by a political candidate is choreographed by handlers and polsters (Should Hillary appear with Bill or not? Should Rudy say he's pro-choice or dance around it, etc.?), President Truman, once he gained the office, showed no such uncertainty. He gave them hell, and went on to win the 1948 election over highly favored Thomas E. Dewey (\\"a man that looked liked he was rolled out on casters...\\" says one quoted observer). How did he do it? After all, as a boy, he was a dirt-poor farmer in Missouri, although he taught himself to read Greek and Latin historians in their original laguages; later, he was elected county judge with the help of protege political boss Tom Pendergast, but served honorably and with an honesty that eventually led him to the Senate. In the Senate, he served quietly, yet chaired a committee that exposed war production corruption and saved the country millions. In 1944, an ailing Roosevelt ordered him to become his Vice President, although Truman tried his best to decline the honor. Do you get the idea? Harry Truman was NOT like all of us; he was a \\"common man\\", yes, but he rose to uncommon greatness. David McCullogh's wonderful biography takes you along on the journey every step of the way. (I don't want to stop, because I can't say enough about this great read!)."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As a 40-year-old, I never knew Truman nor knew anything of his impact, that is, beyond his decision to use the bomb against Japan. If I were given a test where I had to name the presidents of the 20th-century, I would probably forget Truman -- and Hoover.So, what a tragedy it would be if I neglected McCullogh's Truman, because I did not have time to read the book. Thank God for the audiobook.Unlike the \\"Adams\\" audiobook, the Truman audiobook is abridged. The edits were beautifully handled, so that the \\"story\\" of Truman comes through so eloquently. McCullough, as we all know, is our great American storyteller.Having now learned more about Truman, I have such an admiration of the man - and his presidency - that he must now rank among the Top Three of the 20th century.

Loved the pace and took value in the background that the author offered to help the reader understand the mind-set of Truman when making many of his most important decisions."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"President Truman truly exhibited the work ethic so dear to the hearts of many Americans. Despite many efforts to discredit him with connections to some alleged mob activities, President Truman remained true to his integrity and refrained from character bashing against his detractors so popular today.This was a man who believed in earning his wages, who believed in giving his best efforts in behalf of the people who elected him first to Congress and then to the Presidency without sand-bagging or putting others down for NOT doing what they were elected to do. Recognizing his lack of knowledge in any area, President Truman was humble enough to personally do his homework researching and reading on any given topic so as to become knowledgeable. (Wouldn't that be a nice change in our some politicians today?)It cost him in family time with his beloved wife, Bess and daughter, Margaret.He was not always popular and indeed incurred the anger of many when he fired the arrogant and disrespectful McArthur who for some reason had the regard of others, despite McArthur's elitist attitudes which today would earn him much well-deserved criticism. McArthur thought himself above the average man and thought he could do as he pleased, unaccountable to anyone, including the Commander in Chief! (Who does this sound like -- unaccountable to anyone if you happen to BE the Commander in Chief?)President Truman (another War President), (unlike the current occupant of the White House), was at his post when others took (and today take) time that might better be spent in guiding the country.I thought McCullough did a superb job of presenting this man as a concientious man of integrity, something that we could use today in all walks of life. President Truman was born of simple background who never lost the human touch or ability to identify with the comman man. Anyone who does not personally like Truman would benefit from reading this very readable biography and perhaps come to regard him as a fine president at a very difficult time in our country.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This detailed biography makes excellent reading. Author David McCullough takes a thorough look at the life of Harry S Truman (1884-1972). The book begins with Truman's family upbringing, and proceeds to his young adulthood, military service, failure in business, and early days in politics. Readers see that Truman really enjoyed being in the U.S. Senate, where his popularity, integrity, plus fame from the Truman committee boosted him to the nomination for Vice President in 1944. Taking over as President when Roosevelt died, Truman soon faced gut-wrenching decisions on the UN, Potsdam, the bomb, post war demobilization and the coming Cold War. Then came nationwide strikes, the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, Israel, the Berlin Airlift, the 1948 campaign, Civil Rights, Korea, McCarthyism, etc. The author shows that the pressure seldom eased, and that Truman's courage, wisdom, and diverse reading (despite no formal college education) guided him through. Truman wasn't perfect, but he was pretty good, and he earned the respect of Winston Churchill, plus top-flight advisors like Clark Clifford, Averill Harriman, George Marshall, and Dean Acheson. Finally, the author details Truman's retirement back in Independence, Missouri.This biography is lengthy yet very readable. The author admires Truman, but refuses to gloss over his shortcomings. This is a superb look at a capable leader who was once called the captain with the mighty heart."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is nearly impossible to fully understand the 20th Century without a clear insight to the presidency of Harry S.

I was 7 years old when HST died and my family moved to Missouri four years after his death. From about the middle of the book to the end, I kept thinking how wonderful it would have been to meet or see Mr. Truman. Being from Missouri since the age of ten I found much that was familiar and meaningful. I laughed, gasped and cried throughout the book. I keep telling everyone I know that they must read this book! I am planning a trip this spring to visit Independence with others in my family that have read the book.

He did what he had to do and what had to be done to end the worst war in the history of the planet. He was essentially carrying out the policies of Roosevelt, who died in office. Truman passed the buck when he sent troops to Korea to contain Communism. He fired General Douglas MacArthur, who wanted to nuke the Chinese. Limited war as policy set a precedent for Vietnam. Korea is still a problem. Peaceful reunification is the only solution."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is crystal clear why author David McCullough was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for this 1992 publication of \\"Truman.\\" His meticulous narrative vividly captures the decency, dignity and determination of Harry S. Truman. Moreover, McCullough carefully explains how the farmer from Grandview, Missouri...who never graduated from college, managed to become the thirty-third President of the United States of America.Truman was eulogized as the president who faced the momentous decision of whether to use the atomic bomb, he was praised for the creation of the United Nations, for the Truman Doctrine (to support free peoples), the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, the recognition of Israel, NATO; for committing American forces in Korea and for upholding the principle of civilian control over the military. To this end, it must also be noted that Truman was the first president to recommend Medicare and that he had the courage to take a very strong stand on civil rights.Truman was a man who lived by simple small-town Missouri articles of faith that urged individuals to, \\"say what you mean, mean what you say...keep your word...never get too big for your britches and never forget a friend.\\" McCullough observes that, \\"they were more than words-to-the-wise, they were bedrock, as clearly established, as integral to the way of life, it seemed, as were the very landmarks of the community...not everyone lived up to them, of course, but to Harry it seemed everyone ought to try.\\"McCullough packs this book with an enormous amount of historical and personal information. For instance, Truman was the seventh man to succeed to the office after the death of the President...he was the first U.S.President to visit Mexico...he had a portrait of George Washington and Simon Bolivar in his White House office...he detested corporate greed...he was dedicated to his wife and daughter...he was a terrible speller...he was not an exciting speaker...he once worked in a haberdashery...he was in debt for years...he loved bourbon, he was uncomplicated, open and genuine...and without a doubt he was a great American. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Biographies are often boring, at least for many people I know.This book is not boring. McCullough is a great writer. Although he is in some senses just retelling history, he does tell it well, and that counts for alot. This is a carefully researched true story, but it is not dry reading. The story is usually compelling, keeping you engaged, and making it difficult to put the book down.Another reason for liking the book, of course, might be the subject. It is, after all, a biography, so presumably if you're thinking of reading it, you're interested in knowing more about Truman. And Truman is a compelling character, which makes the story all the more interesting.Many people like to think of Truman as an ordinary man thrust into an important job, a person who then developed into greatness.

For a man who had risen to the top on Missouri's political party (Democrat) machinery and the sudden death of Roosevelt, he proved himself to be formidable in his own right by defeating the heavily favored (perhaps an understatement in itself) Dewey.

I have just recently begun reading ebook versions, and for books of this size, the convenience is a significant enough advantage for me to repeat it -- though I still prefer hardcover for more manageable books of 200 or so pages."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I've read most all David McCullough's books. They are detailed, absorbing, and they move through time and events in a logical, well paced manner.I've never known much about Truman except that he ascended to the presidency when FDR died and he was responsible for dropping the atom bombs on Japan. Wow ! Was I ever missing the \\"rest of the story\\". This book is excellent in all respects.I gained an enormous education about Truman, an enormous amount of respect for him, and a motivation to travel to his Presidential library someday.Any book I've read by McCullough has been excellent and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A Democrat President who increased spending on the military, kept Union Thugs in check, Kept the Soviet Union in check, investigated the Government for Communist sympathizers, finished TWO wars (i.e. World War 2 with Japan and Germany) and was victorious, was unabashedly Patriotic, feared God, read the Bible, went to Church, was instrumental in the birth of Israel, and helped rebuild post war Europe.My Republican friends, read this and (continue to) weep for our nation today. Truman wasn't perfect, and the Korean war wasn't handled well in the court of Public Opinion. But to be transported back in time and realize this was a run of the mill Democrat President for his day, how lucky we would be to have a man like this be our President today. Yes, he wanted liberal programs and such, be he would never dream (according to this Bio) of passing legislation behind the backs of the American People. He truly believed he was helping them, was one of them, and fighting for them. That is why he was up front with them.Maybe our current President should read this too. Pray for our country. President Truman sure did."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A great portrayal of President Truman. This is a very sympathetic portrayal of the man who had the difficult task of following FDR. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Truman, by David McCullough, is what introduced me to this author. McCullough is best known right now for his bestseller, John Adams. He is a very thorough researcher with the rare skill to be able to write history as if it were a novel.Harry Truman has always been one of my favorite presidents, thanks to his humble views and solid performance while serving as an accidental commander in chief. I really respect Truman even more after reading this book, and would recommend it to anyone who would like to learn about a true story of an average person who &quot;someday could grow up to be president&quot; and did-and well at that.Read this book even if you have the slightest interest."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I would like to start by saying that this is not a review, but a recommendation. It may read or sound like a review, but it is not, because what could I possibly say about 'Truman', by David McCullough, that cannot be summed up in one word: Pulitzer.Nothing. Obviously.What I can do is tell you that as someone who grew up in Jackson County, Missouri, (not far from Independence) this book was a revelation. I learned things about the history of Jackson County that I never could have found in any other book. I have driven on roads, played at parks, and been inside buildings that were named for the people who shaped my region's history; People who were heretofore unknown to me entirely. For this information alone, I recommend this book to anyone who has lived in Jackson County or Independence, Missouri.If you have no such affiliation with that particular area, the biography of a simple man who became the most powerful man in the world, and who shaped so much of our nation's history, isn't bad either. Some other reviews here on Amazon.com have stated that this book reads like a Harry Truman love-fest. I do not think that is quite the fair assessment. While McCullough's rendition of history does seem to cast a somewhat glowing light on Truman, who is to say that it is not deserved. I could list the many monumental and significant things that HST accomplished while in public office, but it would a waste of my time. All I can do is recommend that you read this book and have confidence that you will be able to objectively weigh his momentous deeds along with his failures and flaws, and, in the end, give Harry S Truman his rightful place in history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"&quot;Truman&quot; tells the most amazing story about simple Harry S. Truman. David McCullough has done a remarkable job with the style in which the book was written. Not only does the book flow along quickly, but also leaves the eager for more. Soon you find it is three in the morning and you cannot put the book down.McCullough's experience as a historian is shown clear as day with this book. &quot;Truman&quot; is a terrific read for anyone. Be it the history buff or Average Joe citizen. One cannot help but be spellbound with this amazing story of the simple man from Missouri."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This may well be the best biography I've ever read, and it's no coincidence this book won the Pulitzer Prize and caused an upswelling of interest in the late 33rd President after its publication. McCullough does a masterful job in bringing to light an accidental President who nevertheless led the country, and led it well, through a perilous and uncertain time. Both Truman the man and Truman the president receive quality treatment in this fine work."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It took me 6 weeks to finish this book, six enjoyable ones at that. McCullough has a way of making history come alive. I found myself thinking \\"what would Harry S Truman do?\\" in a situation I was in. What shines through in this book is Truman's character and the ability to pick himself off the mat as he often needed to. Not only is this book a great biography about a great man but also an excellent inspirational one as well."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I just re-read Truman for the fourth time since its publication. McCullough does such an extraordinary job of relating not only a fascinating man but also the history of the times he lived in. This book is one of my three favorite biographies: it ranks up there with Martin Gilbert's &quot;Churchill&quot; and Brands' &quot;TR&quot;."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If Truman is not the best biography I've ever read, it is certainly one of them. From start to finish, the book is beautifully written, affectionally rendered, and impressively researched. Although Truman is over a thousand pages, you sometimes feel like you could read a thousand more. Even now, after having read the whole book once, I return to different chapters, reading them once again for the insight they provide. Anyone who cares about American history or enjoys reading biographies will love this book. It's a gem!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough presents an exceptionally well researched and written insight of the development of America from the Civil War to the birth of the Atomic Age through the prism of Harry S. Truman's life. A must read for anyone who wants to understand America today through the insights of its development as embodied in the life of one who helped shape its destiny. Together with The Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant and American Caesar, the biography of Douglas MacArthur, a book for the Millenial Time Capsule."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I want to thank Mr. McCullough for writing this highly objective and informational book. It kept me completely interested; I never wanted to put the book down. When I had finally gotten to the end of the book, I loved and respected Truman, despite his faults and unwise decisions. Thank you. Crystal D. White"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have never know such joy at reading a biography like this and know of no other story that encompasses these events and personalities in quite this way. I believe it is unequaled as an American epic and as a standard for non-fiction. I have read this volume twice and still look forward to living this remarkable life with Harry and Bess again and again. I recommend this book to everyone that I know because it is so rich in the details and joyous in the telling of a great man's life. McCollough has done a service to his country by delivering a biography of a president that is both thorough and heartfelt. I treasure my copy and must tell my friends to purchase their own. Truman is a treasure."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a great book. The author brings history to life. Read several of his books and they are all great."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I bought this book for 25 cents at the local library. Not sure who Truman was or his legacy, I decided to give it a try. I have to admit I have not been able to put it down and now with only 10 pages left, I am a little sad it is over. I have quite a bit of respect for him now. He led a very intresting life. the book was well written with very few boring sections."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Just finished reading this excellent book. The author has put together a frank and well written book on one our most interesting and inspiring presidents. The more you learn about Harry S Truman, the more you like him."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It is fair to say that this book re-introduced Americans to Harry Truman. Largely overshadowed by his predecessor FDR, and his successors Eisenhower and Kennedy, Truman had become a somewhat marginalized figure when this book was published. Fortunately, this book lives up to all of the hype that surrounded it. David McCullough is a master of narrative history, and has used his gift to recreate President Truman and his era. There is more to Truman than his brief vice presidency, decision to drop the bomb and come-from-behind victory in the 1948 election. He emerged from the world of Missouri machine politics, and became a power in the U.S. senate through his relationships with the Democratic leadership both there and in the House. McCullough vividly describes Truman's relationship with his wife Bess, as well as his machine patron, Pendergast. Upon his ascension to the presidency following the death of FDR, McCullough is equally adept in describing his interactions with MacArthur, Marshall and Acheson, and the shaping of American post-war foreign policy. And, of course, he recounts the 1948 reelection campaign, where Give \`Em Hell Harry beat the odds to defeat Thomas Dewey. The book does not gloss over Truman's mistakes or flaws, from his stubborn refusal to denounce Pendergast to his struggles with the Korean War towards the end of his term. This is a wonderful book, worth reading for anyone interested in history. Truman is lucky to have McCullough, and America was lucky to have Truman."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Once again a great work by David McCollough. He really gets into a well articulated history patrticularly with the early days of Harry S Truman's life. The struggles once becoming president really come to life in this book. I have been a David McCullough fan since reading Adam, and continue to enjoy his various historical volumes."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Not much can be said that hasn't been said already. If you don't read another book on Harry S Truman, this is a must read. Anything by David McCullough is a grand read. After reading this book, you'll feel like you have known Truman all your life."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A truly phenomenal book, I couldn't put it down! Truman was a President like few others in his truly down-to-earth personality, outlook and style. I learned much about the first half of the twentieth century and so much about the presidency and what it might look like for someone to be truly presidential. Midway through the book I remarked to my dad that Truman is my all-time favorite Democrat (I being a Republican) and that I wished more Republican politicians were like Harry S. Truman.I feel like any other Presidential biography will have to be measured against this one, and I have a suspicion that most others will fall short. On that note, I look forward to reading McCullough's John Adams later this year."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This correctly illustrates the great character of Harry Truman. The author continues to write well and doesn't disappoint. Harry Truman's story is unique as a president, including incidences such is the atomic bomb at the Korean war. His story is about principles and standing for something."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I ordered this audio book for my mother, who is visually impaired. This was a birthday gift and arrived right on time. She has not listened to the book yet but I know, based on such favorable reviews at Amazon, that she will enjoy it. I have always had great service when ordering through Amazon."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a very good \\"read.\\" It starts a bit slowly, too slowly for me but picks up steam quickly once past the first 30 or so pages. As one reviewer put, it becomes a bit of a page turner.Most readers will find much to like about this book and its in-depth look at Harry Truman the man of personal honor, the patriotic American soldier fighting in France during WWI, the farmer, the failed businessman, the Senator and politician who knew that party loyalty mattered above all else and the man who never forgot his friends or his enemies.Having said all that, Efler's review is worth reading because each of his criticisms are \\"spot on.\\" If you are looking for a well rounded analysis of the world or the US's impact on the world during his presidency, you'll not necessarily be satisfied with this book's coverage.Its depth lies in looking at Harry Truman the man no one wanted or unexpected to be President and, it might be a little more of a hagiograph than some want (although it's not all pretty), there's little that seems factually incorrect.While we can debate whether it should have covered the \\"possible green light\\" given the North Koreans by his State Department, we cannot fault it's deep analysis of Harry...warts and all."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough's \\"Truman\\" is an excellent example of a thorough biography - it not only tells the life story of the subject, it gives the reader the essential background of the subject, the causes and influences of the subject's life, the highs and lows and how these affected the subject, the moments of conflict and resolution for the subject, and the relationship of why the subject is important prior to and up to today. This was all done by McCullough in a very readable style; some may feel that this biography is overly long based on the number of pages, but to cover as much of Truman's life as completely as McCullough did, I was kind of sorry to reach the end of the book. If you like history and/or biographies and would like to read an entertaining book about a great President raised from humble beginnings, this is a terrific book to read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A very well written book about an everyday man who would become the President of the United States and would become respected for his service to his country."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Resisted this book for quite awhile even though I am a DM fan. My apprehensions were unfounded, an excellent read in a time period that I had avoided for some reason, Truman, the man, surprised me,"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It really is the definitive Truman bio, a man whom, ever since I read this, has been an important influence on me. A truly great president, endlessly fascinating and champion of the phrase \\"the buck stops here!\\" - well, the buck stops with this bio, too. Great."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Outstanding read. Provides the reader with a good understanding of the man and his times."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"People tend to forget what a citizen politican looks like. Today our government is littered with career bureaucrats seeking the perks of office and forgetting to legislate in a modest manner. McCulloch paints a forgiving portrait for a once reviled President that, at 1000 pages, is terribly short as a page turner. From Truman's tortured decision to use the atomic bomb (for which he knew so little about) on Japan, to his unpopular decision to release General McArthur, we get a sense of man who took no decision lightly. Truman's character is amply shared with the reader, tracing his humble Missourian roots to an accidental presidency, all marked with the traits of common decency, hard work and intelligence. Today's career politician can learn from this outstanding work."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"As stated by others, this is an absolutely superb effort by McCullough; in my mind by far his best. It ranks with the best biographies I have ever read, and may be at the very top of the list.McCullough paints a comprehensive picture of Harry S. Truman, in which childhood perceptions about family, wartime leadership experience, business failures, and messy Kansas City politics all instill an incredible desire in the man to succeed on his own merits, all leading up to what is probably the climax of the book--the account of the 1948 presidential election. But every portion of this book is eminently enjoyable, and one cannot help, after reading it, to come away with a new appreciation for the Captain With a Mighty Heart."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I never really knew Truman and didn't really expect to like him, but this book shows what a real, down to earth and scrupulously honest man he was that I can't help but love and admire him. I never knew that as a Senator, Truman helped bring a stop to government gouging that many defense contractors were getting away with during WWII. Truman was a ruthless investigator tracking down anyone who was gaining excessive profits off defense contracts as he felt they were vultures robbing our soldiers of much needed supplies by overcharging the government and thus undermining the government's ability to buy more supplies. He also considered any company that made substandard supplies as being un-American as they were sending our \\"boys\\" out without sufficient goods to take care of them on the battlefield.I never knew Truman, the military commander, who was as loyal to his subordinates as they were to him.I never knew Truman the hardworking farmer, Truman the businessman who would rather go bankrupt that fail to pay a bill and the husband who doted on his wife-to-be until middle age when her mother finally consented to their marriage.Truman was a unique man of virtue and honesty. David McCullough did a special favor to all humanity by capturing in one compelling book the incredible life of this simple, yet brilliant man."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This is a fascinating study of Truman's life with its many challenges, many of which resonate with those faced by our president today. I am thoroughly enjoying this book yet the errors in transcription during the digital process are becoming annoying.

I would have liked a little bit more detail on his early political career and his encounters with the mob."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I typically don't like historical books, but this is written with the masterful ability of David McCullough.

A terrific biography of one of this countries great presidents! A must read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I thought it started out a little slow, until I got further into the book.

My favourite author and there is a reason why."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I had no clue who Truman was other than our president.

Truman found himself in the breach of presidential leadership. Therefore, I read \\"Truman\\" to find insight into the decision to use the atomic bomb. Well, I found this insight and so much more. This is an exceptional biography by an equally exceptional biographer. It's almost as if you are in Truman's presence and I so wish I had had the privilege of meeting him and shaking his hand and thanking him for his exceptional, selfless service to our country in those very difficult times. Perhaps I should not have had to read this story. Perhaps I should have known and remembered the magnitude of this great president. I learned so much from David McCullough.However, I find unexplained, the reason for Dwight D. Eisenhower's reprehensible attitude towards both Harry S. Truman (the man and President) and George C. Marshall (the man, the General and the Secretary of State) to require further study. General Marshall had mentored and elevated Eisenhower in his military career. Eisenhower was the most outstanding tactician and logistician that our Armed Forces have ever known. \\"Truman\\" does not mention in any detail Operation Overlord and perhaps the single most successful day (06/06/44) of the war in Europe. Harry Truman obviously admired Eisenhower and had reached out to him to help him become the next President. Why did Eisenhower disrespect both Truman and Marshall? My studies will continue......tagPS This was the first book to have read on the Kindle."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"TRUMAN.

From the history of Truman's ancestors to his unceremonious demise after falling in the bathroom (and everything in-between) we truly get to know Truman and his times.Now days when presidents speak, they merely appear not much more then figureheads spouting rhetoric. In Truman's time presidents were able to speak of and deliberate about the difficult issues at hand. This book tells us the hard work, intelligence, and luck that go into becoming president. Perhaps more important then analyzing his successes and failures as a president, is dissecting the human being known as Harry S. Truman. It is reassuring to know he was a well intentioned, capable and honest man. We could use more like him today."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Harry Truman, long considered an \\"accident of history\\" and one of most overlooked and forgotten Presidents of the 20th Century, is a man who was thrust into a position of prominence in a world of uncertainity and danger. This great man from Missouri helped pave the way for the modern world and 60 years after he ascended to the Presidency, his legacy is stronger than ever. For such a great President however, the historical treatment has been cruelly lax. David McCullough's biography of President Harry S Truman can truly be considered the definitive historical study of both the man and the President.A book rich in detail, McCullough explains how Truman's character was forged on the farms of Missouri, on the battlefield of World War I, and in the haberdashery of the post war that preceded the Great Depression. Truman's upbringing as a man of honor, a man taught the value of hard work and the necessity to pay one's debts and fulfill one's obligations, sheds considerable light on his decisions and actions in the US Senate and in the office of President.McCullough does not overlook or minimilize the flaws of Truman; his considerable temper, his links to Tom Pendergast's political machine, and his typical-of-the-time attitudes towards race are all examined. McCullough makes no excuses for Truman, which is rare in biographies. Instead McCullough shows how these aspects of his character molded him and shaped his future actions and how Truman came to value honor and decency and the virtue of doing the right thing, rather than the popular one.Long in pages, and sometimes overwhelming in detail, McCullough gives Harry S. Truman the historical treatment that he so richly deserves. Excellent reading for any student of history or politics. Well worth the money and time."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"This book sat on my shelf for several years because I wasn't sure Harry Truman was worth the time required to digest a thousand pages. I am very glad that I finally got around to it.This is a very well written work about a most interesting president. The author does an excellent job of getting the reader to know Harry Truman both as a man and as a world leader. The early years are interesting and vital to understanding Truman, but once he ascends to the White House, the story really takes off. Potsdam, the atomic bomb, Korea, the 1948 election and the MacArthur saga all make for superb reading. Better than fiction !! It is also fascinating to learn that when he left office, Truman took himself to the train station and left Washington without a security entourage and without a pension.This is a fine biography of a unique president. Well worth the time!!!"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"We find ourselves, as Americans, sometimes encapsulating and focusing upon only events that are dramatic, overlooking the time before or after. The treatment of the 19th century Indian becomes The Battle of the Little Big Horn. Omaha Beach defines World War II and the '60's are explained by Vietnam.Against an \\"event\\" backdrop, David McCullough launches his magnificent biography of Harry S. Truman, a man who did little. . . except end the war in the Pacific, start the Marshall Plan, The Berlin Airlift, The United Nations, NATO, Korea and a host of other events. He balanced the budget, then went into debt being the first nation ever to give aid to the conquered. Probably, Europe stands today because of Truman's vision.This biography starts in the days of the turn of the century and monitors little Harry growing up in what only one or two generations preceding was the frontier.His service in WW I, his artillery post constantly being bombarded by the Germans, and seeing the unbelievable loss of life no doubt made his subsequent decision twenty seven years later to drop the Atomic Bomb less ambivelant than other non-knowing pundits have stated. Upon his return to Independance, he quipped (as an Artillery Officer) \\"We are no heroes. All the heroes are in the infantry.His dedication to honesty and integrity and his refusal to use his political office for financial gain, are all well chronicled.This is a brilliant biography that reads like a novel and is filled with wisdom, sadness and the victory of the common man.Highly recommended. Five stars. More if you had them."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"If you are going to read a biography on any US President this is the book to read! Harry Truman was an exceptional, ordinary man who has shaped the 21st century as no other. You get to know the man who finished WW II, created the United Nations, defeated Communism and scored the greatest presidential election upset in the history of the United States. Get to know Harry, his family, his cabinet and learn how our country has evolved as a result of his bold decisions. Very well written, the best book I have ever read. Should be mandatory reading for every American."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I first picked up this book after a strong recommendation from someone else who read it. I thought that because of the size of the book, it would prove a daunting task. However, David McCullough's masterful narrative transported me into the time of Harry Truman. I felt like I was right there with him during the many events in his life that ultimately shaped United States politics and policy. McCullough takes Harry Truman the President and illustrates in easy to read form Harry Truman the man - a man that had unwavering character, personal courage and the guts to stand up for what he believed. This is an outstanding account of one of our finest Presidents. I definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in American history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough has mastered the art of writing and this book is a masterpiece. You will learn how Harry Truman a man of simple and honest means becomes one of our nation's greatest leaders.You realise how he never forgets who he is and that knowledge gives him the strength to make the right decisions. Often his decisions could of cost him his political career but he would not let that factor in.Great book and great history."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"and well-balanced. McCullough does a fine job of detailing ALL of Harry Truman, the parts he approves of, the parts he doesn't, and the parts that he may approve of, but others may not, in a well-balanced, evenhanded manner that makes it possible for the reader to determine what they think of Harry Truman, without having to work overhard to filter out the opinion of the author. This is my measure of whether a biography has done its primary job, and this book passes with flying colors. Of course, it doesn't hurt that it also does its secondary job--that of being readable rather than soporific--extremely well.I find it hard to imagine a better biography of Harry Truman."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"An interesting look at the 33rd president of the United States, an ordinary man of the people who shaped history, and this country, with his forthright attitude and convictions.McCullough brings forth the true nature of the man who would be president when the atom bombs were dropped on Japan. He would stand over the creation of the United Nations, the Berlin Airlift, and an Israeli State. He was a man who held out for peace against a warmonger General, who would have invaded China, and could have very possibly been responsible for bringing the USA into a third world war.Truman's decisions were not always popular, but in the long run they were proven to be solid. He was not a man who thrived on fame and recognition; he saw the presidency as a privilege and a job that he would give his all for. A private man with middle class working values he would continue to help the Democratic Party till his dying days.I picked up this book after reading this author's much-acclaimed book titled JOHN ADAMS. I found Truman to be less introspective and personal. It was written more like a history book. There was little mention of the intimacy shared between Harry and Bess, a strong point that brought out the humanity found in the telling of John Adams and Abigail's part in history. I have also been lucky enough to pick up some of the great movies that this author has been a part of writing and producing. He has several works pertaining to the Civil War.

( However, I did not realize it was abridged and I was looking for an unabridged cd set.)"},{"Title":"Truman","review":"At one thousand pages, and being read during the same time as a few others, Truman took me three months to read, but was worth it! I've always been huge fan of McCullough and the way he is able to breath life back into great historical figures. I may not have always agreed with his politics, but he stood firm by what he thought was right, and never allowed the pressure of the press, polls, critics, and fellow polititcians to sway him from serving and doing what he thought was best for the American people. He truly was a man \\"of the people and for the people\\", and was truly like and admired as a person. I have also always admired a man who can stay adoringly loyal to his wife, and treat her with the utmost respect.I found learning about his policies in greater detail not only fascinating, but enlightening. He truly did work hard for the everyday American people,and found the not only the process, but also his mindset as he brought into light The Truman Doctrine, The Marshal Plan, and the new age of atomic energy. An arduous, but fascinating read."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"A biography with over a thousand pages is an intimidating prospect to certain readers. It is time consuming to read such a long book. From a reader who often struggles to maintain interest in longer reads, I might suggest the time consumed by this book is well spent. A biography that is thorough, fast-paced, and moving is tough to come by. Not only is it a great biography, it is among the best book I have read.Having visited the museum and home of Harry Truman last summer, I took a greater interest in his life. David McCullough is said to have written the definitive biography of Truman. While no biography is perfectly complete, this biography must come close. McCullough explores the family origins of Harry Truman and his humble beginnings. While it was his father that paved Truman's way into politics, Truman only seemed to have the markings of a local politician. The Kansas City political machine overlooked him for smaller roles, so senator seemed to be a less likely role. Even less likely was his escalation to the vice presidency, which was known then to be a heartbeat away from the highest office in the land.While many books explore the political side of Truman, this book seems to make a concerted effort to get to known Truman as a person. It forms a moving personal portrait. It also helps to put into perspective low opinion polls of more recent Presidents as Truman dodges the slurs of office in his time. More than any other president of the modern era, Truman was an average man. McCullough succeeds in creating this image."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I've chose this book largely because of the good reviews it received, but wasn't sure what made it different. I found that compared with other biographies, the perceptive and in-depth capture of the character of not only Truman, but those around him who influenced his life most, made this a standout book. The facts are here, but I felt at the end that you really saw the man Truman.My other praise is that this books meticulously builds the context around the controversial decisions Truman made during his presidency.I was especially moved by the portayal of Trumans relationship with his his mother, Bess, Margaret, Marshall and Acheson.My small gripe is the editing towards the end of the book is significantly lower in quality than at the beginning.I'm a fan."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"Wasn't sure what to think of such a large book when I started. Easy read. Great History! I recommend this book all the time."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough at his absolute best. Truman was the kind of man that the framers of the constitution had in mind when they wrote it."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"When it comes to making history not only readable, but intriguing, nobody writes better than David McCullough. Many of his books chronicle people, places or events that don't really seem to stick out as being fascinating. But once you start reading any one of McCullough's books, you are drawn into the subject matter, compelled to read and learn about subjects that you might not otherwise ever read about. You don't simply read a McCullough book. You experience it. My introduction to McCullough's work was in his biography of John Adams, our country's second president and a key figure in the founding of the nation. After finishing this, I quickly devoured 1776, The Great Bridge, and The Johnstown Flood. I would highly recommend each of these books.Like Adams, Harry S. Truman had the misfortune of succeeding a legendary figure. While Adams presided under the shadow of George Washington, Truman had to undergo the scrutiny of an American public who had been led through many great trials by the great Franklin D. Roosevelt. Truman proved that, while he was no FDR, he was certainly his own man and very well capable of holding his own during the many conflicts of his own presidency.In Truman, we are brought into his story well before his birth as McCullough fills us in on the details of his family heritage. We follow Truman through his childhood, his stint as a gallant officer during World War I, his romancing of and subsequent marriage to Bess Wallace, and his rise up and into the political world. McCullough does an excellent job of covering several controversial topics such as the Marshall Plan, the Korean Conflict, the Manhattan Project, McCarthyism, and the firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur without getting bogged down in presenting his own opinions on these matters, instead letting the historical accounts speak for themselves. We are treated to the often exciting, edge-of-your-seat workings of political campaigning, including Truman's first presidential nomination as well as his momentous and astounding defeat of Thomas Dewey.At well over 1,000 pages, Truman is a hefty read. But being already familiar with McCullough's style, I knew it would be a great read and I was not disappointed. Not being a historian nor familiar with this period of U.S. history, I can't speak to the factual accuracy of the book's events. But once again, McCullough does a masterful job of bringing the person off the written page to the point where you feel like you know the person himself. By the end of the book and upon the account of Truman's death, I felt like I had lost a friend. Truman is an excellent biography, an inspirational story and one that will have you keeping late hours just to read one more page."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"I originally came across this book when I listened to the abridged audio version several years ago. Determined to read the book, I bought it and it sat on my shelf for a number of years until I decided to take it as my one book on a trip to Europe. Starting the book before I left, I was half way through it by the time I left. Frankly, it had me hooked.David McCullough clearly deserved the Pulitizer Prize for this book and all the accolades that can be heaped him him for this masterfully written and researched biography.For baby boomers like myself, it is is part a walk down memory lane in terms of reading about people and events that you vaguely remember from newspapers and hearing about as a young person but were too new to be in history books. McCullough gives you the background and the facts as to what really happened. Reading TRUMAN really gave me an insight into the years of the Cold War, the Korean War and to some extent Viet Nam. In addition, its a real insight into the presidency and the every day life of a president.Truman is depicted as warm and human. I for one, really identified with him and his political battles. His life is truly and American story.The book is almost 1000 pages of reading and looks like a real challenge to most readers, but once you start it you will be glad that you took the challenge."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"It takes a bit of courage to start on a 1000 page biography of a lesser known president (relative to Lincoln, Washington, Roosevelt(s)). However, for those of you decide to jump in may find yourself transformed at how you look at politics and America as a whole.David McCullough has been given much (very well deserved) praise for his biography on John Adams. McCullough clearly deserved the attention (and the Pulitzer to boot), but it seems that \\"John Adams\\" has caused his work on Harry S. Truman to be overlooked. This is unfortunate, because in my opinion, Truman is a much more relevant and important that John Adams in today's society.In \\"Truman\\" McCullough paints a masterful (and I mean MASTERFUL) portrait of a small town farmer who found himself not only President of the United States but as one of the most important figures of World History. It really is an unbelievable that a man who worked on his farm until age 34 decided to enlist in the Army during WWI. His fame as an artillery Captain allowed him to enter the world of local politics. From there a few incredible breaks have him in the US Senate as a relative anonymous Senator. World War II allows him to use his military expertise to form the \\"Truman Committee\\" and the oversight of government military spending. An unlikely turn-of-events has him Vice President of the United States to a dying President. Up next....1- The Postdam conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin2- The dropping of the A-bombs in Japan3- The drafting of all the railroad workers into the Army4- Berlin airlift5- Korean war6- Firing of MacArthurTo name a few of the more significant events that this farmer had to face during his presidency.McCullough paints a very vivid a lively man who never forgot the office that he represented, the people he served, or how he was raised. Truman is a model of a politician doing what they think is right and allowing the opinions to fall where they might. McCullough shows that what Truman lacked in polish he made up for in grit and determination.Final Verdict - McCullough's best work - probably one of the best biographies ever written. In addition, we are given an amazing history of the United States from 1910-1955.5 Stars - Must read for anyone who has the courage to tackle such a lengthy book."},{"Title":"Truman","review":"David McCullough is a master biographer.

I can say that I am glad that Kushner took the chance on writing this book. The fact that there are multiple tabs within the books pages to allow me to return to quotes that hit the mark for me is a very good sign.The subtitle to this book is: The Search for Life That Matters. I think we are all spending far too much time and energy trying to achieve goals that are nearly impossible. We all tend to forget that achievable goals are better than reaching for the stars rigth away. Through a series of lessons, quotes, reminders, and simple guidance, Kushner writes a very good book, that was definitely helpful.

Well, the messages and the things I learned from this book is this book can help anybody searching for happiness, direction, acceptance, and purpose in life.I think that Kushner tells stories by using a lot of metaphor and refers to the Bible.

Using my favorite Hebrew Bible text, Ecclesiastes, as a springboard, Rabbi Kushner writes about the \\"ultimate thirst of our souls\\": the need for \\"meaning,\\" for \\"the sense that we have figured out how to live so that our lives matter.\\" Rabbi Kushner offers readers his wisdom -- born out of years of study, struggle and life experience -- about how to live a life that matters."},{"Title":"When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough","review":"READ this BOOK! Rabbi Kushner hits on so many relevant and pertinent topics that you will be amazed how you see yourself in the anedotes and examples used to illustrate Kushner's point. Rabbi Kushner uses the Old Testament story of Ecclesiastes to illustrate how man's search for happiness is eternal and not unique. I could not believe how similar Ecclesiaste's view on life and search for happiness are so similar to my own. I found myself stopping on many occasions and telling my wife \\"READ THIS!\\"I have been on a self-help book crusade for the past several months. Reading a bunch of these books have helped in finding some understanding to the search for happiness I have been after. After each book, I can say one or two of the points explained in the book have made sense and have some good practical applications to dealing with everyday situations that arise in my life. Kushner's book is by the far the best. He gives you straightforward and understandable examples of the negative behavior that conflict in man's search for happiness.From the opening pages Kushner had me! He hits the nail on the head when he says the lines \\"If you ask anybody what is more imporant - work or family? - without a doubt they answer family. But then ask them how much time they spend away from family by putting work ahead of family and making work more important than family obligations.\\" (paraphrased) He has many of these observations that help the reader get some insight into how destructive these behaviors are towards our supposed goal of happiness.

I trip because our world, our universe is already miraculously designed to be perfect and just to witness some of the things and people in it should have us well pleased, but that ain't the case. My mom used to say &quot;God created the heavens and the earth and everything in them and WE have the nerve to be dissatisfied with the heavens and the earth and everything in them...&quot; As an example, look how much money is spent on advertisements and commercials during &quot;events&quot; like the Super Bowl or the Oscars...the money spent on a 15 second spot gets up to the millions. This sensory bombardment is one of the ways this insecurity creeps in--And, for why? The American Dream? To make sure everybody has the opportunity to stay ahead of the game? To flesh out some Madison Ave. photocopy? The questions are--are you really less of a person without this jazz? And why is it such an empty feeling even after we've gotten all we ever imagined wanting?--Most people I know, however, disguise this emptiness with a competitive nature thing akin to the ol' &quot;Nah, nah, na-nah! I've got a new bike and you don't&quot; stance of the neighborhood kids...are we that spoiled? And what happens when that emptiness returns after we can't find anyone to compete with? Do we look within or do we look for new competitors...? Don't get me wrong, I would be the wrong person to endorse unproductive activity. I would suggest some kind of healing activity.... Kushner's book is about this 'looking within'. He uses the book of Ecclesiastes to help us thru the 'vanities of vanities', our human restlessness, our desires and our sufferings.

The answer is applicable for any generation.Although written by a Rabbi, the wisdom in this book is applicable to anyone of any belief. Although I don't believe that this is Kushner's most popular book, it just might be his best. He actually ends up answering several questions rather than just THE ONE - this is exceptional work.As well written as the book was, the quality of the printed book was awful. It looked like the printer was short on ink and many pages (not just 2 or 3) were tough to read primarily at the edges.

Why do the Jerry Falwells and Laura Schlessingers get a bigger audience than Kushner, who has a gentle and humanistic approach to spiritual matters? Is it because, as he says in this book, a life of value has nothing to do with fame or money, and knowing this, he doesn't have the desire to be a celebrity pundit? I wonder.As with all of his books, \\"When All You're Ever\\" is gracefully written and brief, and thus hard to put down (I read it over a Sunday afternoon and evening.) Despite its brevity, it touches on many relevant themes, from ennui to materialism to biblical relevance in modern lives. He frames these discussions around the story of Ecclesiastes, which has always been one of my favorite books of the bible. Until I read Kushner's perspective, I didn't realize why. Unlike so many books of the bible, Ecclesiastes is written by someone who lacks purpose in life, and comes to appreciate the small pleasures. It lacks much of the fire and brimstone of other parts of the OT, and therefore has more to say to the modern reader than the more archaic (and spiritually immature) sections.All of Kushner's books are wonderful.

You must search for internal wealth; that is, being human amongst humans, while you share something of yourself.I also love this book for telling the readers, &quot;If we obey God because we are afraid of Him, because we don't want to offend Him, or because we are so overwhelmed by His might that we do not dare to challenge Him, then He has our obedience but He does not have our love.&quot;It's important that we find a purpose for our being on this earth, and live within that purpose -- this is what we attract what we really want.Thank you Rabbi Kushner."},{"Title":"When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough","review":"Finally, someone helps us see that what we strive for is not where the meaning is-- the meaning is in the everyday!Rabbi Kushner in his simple way, takes away the anxiety we all feel in wanting more, and helps us turn our point of view from what is out there, to what we have.When we relish every TODAY, and stop dreaming of a different TOMRROw, we will realize that life is beautiful.Kushner takes &quot;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff&quot; and explains why."},{"Title":"When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough","review":"I too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as I wanted.

Until they arrive at that \\"something more\\", people can never truly feel content.As is the case with most of Kushner's writing, he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation. In this case, he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes. This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life. In the end, the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance.Kushner's overall point is best summarized on page 189. Does it make a difference if I am honest, good, or faithful? It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune. \\"... It matters if we are true to ourselves, to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them. It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others, making them and their world different, rather than try and hoard life to ourselves. It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day, food and work and love and friendship, as encounters with the divine, encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too.\\"It is a simple yet beautiful message.

My professor, a remarkably learned fellow with a tremendous knowledge of American literature, would occasionally reference it with amused appreciation. In our discussion of the Last of the Mohicans, I can still recall his enjoyment in recounting Lawrence's description of Cooper, sitting in a hotel room in a European city, with his gentleman's finery, surrounded by all of the trappings of a genteel aristocrat, living a sort of Walter Mitty life through his virtual antithesis -- Natty Bumpo, the protagonist of the Leatherstocking tales. To this day, I am amazed whenever I read this little tome, since Lawrence captures, in a few short essays, the essence of such authors as Franklin, Whitman, Cooper, and Melville. His style, so cheeky and incisive, is a joy to read. Lawrence had an astonishing grasp of what it is that makes American literature so fundamentally different from that which was composed by his own countrymen. He brings a pschoanalytic, Jungian perspective to bear on these great works, and sees in Natty Bumpo, Ishmael, and other heroes of American literature the archetypes of our collective American unconscious. Of course, this work tells us as much about Lawrence as it does about great American writers, which is why it makes such great reading. Lawrence is well known for being a novelist, but his corpus contains much else besides: travel literature, criticism, poetry, essays. This one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"There are three reasons to read STUDIES IN CLASSIC AMERICAN LITERATURE by D.H. Lawrence. First: to better understand Lawrence and his themes. Second: to be entertained. Criticism is rarely rendered with so much passion, wit and clarity. Third: to experience American culture from an outsider's perspective, a very knowledgeable though albeit highly opinionated perspective (which makes for that entertainment value).DHL's prevailing theory is that to emerge as a distinct cultural, as well as distinct political entity free from Europe, America had to go through some growing pains before arriving at its authentic self. America had to kill off the European in its heart. He starts out with Ben Franklin, whom he gives a real trouncing for the overly self-conscious act of assigning an American character with a shopping list of virtues. (It should come as no surprise that DHL especially has trouble with \\"chastity.\\") Ben may be generating a fake, a lie, but he marks the beginning of an effort to break with the old homeland, Europe. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur is next in line for a beating. He moved his unfortunate family to the frontier, wrote the letters glowing with the accounts of the American Dream amongst the nature and the \\"savages\\" and then went back to France to revel in literary salons. When he returned, the wife and farm had met brutal ends in that American dream in which he had left them, so he settled in New York City. DHL screams, \\"Fake!\\" But Crevecoeur did announce the concept of an ideal tied to the unique attributes of the new world.DHL takes us through Cooper, Poe and Hawthorne, who begin to make progress (and also give DHL space to expound in ways that have annoyed his feminist critics), and onto Dana (TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST) and Melville, who go to sea to find themselves and their American consciousness. It is Melville who smashes the old mold forever and makes way for Whitman to plow through with a new road, singing that song of self.We get the tour of the past; we get, obliquely, a tour of post World War I intellectual preoccupations; and we get DHL being DHL at full throttle."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"this is a masterpiece, and you do not have to know much about books to notice the expertise of the author, his sense of what he is writing.he has really given me an orientation into the vast lands of american letters.he has set me going into a different direction and has made me read some books again. i recommend this book to anybody with a deep interest in american letters, but please keep reading this author, he is wonderful. LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"D.H. Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature is by no means a comprehensive analysis of the American classics at the time Lawrence wrote his collection of essays. The works of Harriet Beecher-Stowe and Mark Twain are notably missing. But Lawrence's aim was not to analyze all the seminal works of American literature. He chose specific authors who fit his agenda and constructed an evolutionary argument around them. Lawrence's main thread is that America can't emerge as a culture in its own right until it discards completely the influence of Old Europe and finds its own \\"spirit of place\\"--the sense of who the people are and what drives them. The author's search for this spirit of place results in a more or less disparaging analysis of each American author in turn, with few exceptions of genuine praise.We begin with Benjamin Franklin. Lawrence derides him for advocating \\"the perfectability of man\\" (Lawrence 15) and creating a list of virtues, and proceeds in doing the same himself. \\"I will try always to recognize and submit to the gods in me and the gods in other men and women.\\" This is of course merely a symbol; Lawrence was not pagan. But it begs the question: If we are supposed to accept all these new rules at face value, based only on Lawrence's discursive analyses and often abstract philosophizing, doesn't it stand to reason that Benjamin Franklin's rules were open to symbolic interpretation as well? I marvel at Lawrence, actually. He makes a good deal of sense, but he too hits a wrong note sometimes. And then speaks entirely in absolutes for the whole book, as if his opinion truly is the only one. Suffice to say Benjamin Franklin was a good deal more intelligent than Lawrence makes him out to be and was horrifically underserved by Lawrence.From Franklin onward, Lawrence hardly has a good thing to say about any of the American authors. Sometimes they deserve it. Hector St. John De Crevecoeur gets slammed for oversimplifying nature and idealizing the frontier lifestyle in his Letters from an American Farmer. Fenimore Cooper really gets it for romanticizing the frontier, the relations between white men and Native Americans, and for utilizing the 1800's literary conventions of his contemporaries when concocting a love triangle. I agree that the conventions were stale and unrealistic, but what can one expect when everyone wrote their historical fiction with those same tired conventions? I'm pretty sure somebody out there thinks The Last of the Mohicans is a classic of 1800's historical fiction right up there with Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis.Poe is \\"rather a scientist than an artist,\\" because he \\"reduc[es] his own self as a scientist reduces a salt in a crucible.\\" Lawrence seems to like him until he accuses Poe of trying to make his \\"disease\\" (love) fair and attractive--which, as it turns out, is the \\"duplicity of art, American art in particular.\\" Good to know.Nathaniel Hawthorne writes hellish romance, says Lawrence, and has such a fixation with sin that it becomes stale. Thank you, Lawrence, for going after The Scarlett Letter with a vengeance. That one deserved it. Richard Henry Dana's Two Years Before the Mast is where Lawrence starts getting very metaphysical. (I wouldn't advise anyone to read individual chapters out of order. This really must be read as a consecutive whole or you won't understand a thing.)But Lawrence likes sea voyages. He has praise for Herman Melville--and criticisms. Melville is criticized for finding a tropical paradise and wanting to return to civilization. Then Moby Dick comes along, and we find out the white whale is a symbol of the \\"deepest blood-being of the white race...our deepest blood-nature.\\" We hunt him because we want to \\"subject him to our will.\\" That is, the men hunt him. Lawrence doesn't have much to say to us women other than criticize us for wearing our American suits.Walt Whitman. Lawrence really likes Whitman. He derives from Whitman the concept of true American Democracy, souls meeting on the Open Road, free to do as they please. But he still criticizes him for following the Christian doctrine in his philosophy, confounding \`sympathy' with \\"Jesus' LOVE, and with Paul's CHARITY.\\"Lawrence was a very brilliant individual, a devoted critic, and an insightful analyst. I enjoyed Studies in Classic American Literature immensely upon my first reading. For the most part, if there are faults to find in American literature he will point them out. That's all right, somebody had to do it. But I wish he'd rein it in just a little. No need to antagonize the ladies, Lawrence--or couldn't you predict that women would read your book some eighty years into the future? His trick of using he exclamation mark to prove a point was fun at first, and got really old by the time I got to Walt Whitman, though this could possible be attributed to the fact that Lawrence starts out very concrete and moves so far into the abstract that readers may have trouble following him unless they read the entire book in one sitting and keep all the cross-references fresh in their memories. He's also a little too self-important for my liking. We all know there are problems with the American classics. Did Lawrence never consider that we wouldn't like to be preached at the same way he didn't take to the self-righteous Americans like Benjamin Franklin and Nathaniel Hawthorne?"},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"In this analysis of (not always) well-known classic US authors D. H. Lawrence gives his personal, but very revealing, view on the heart of the American soul, the old and the new moralities and the cardinal aspects of the gender battle. These brilliant essays tell also a lot about the author himself and the backgrounds of his life vision.David Herbert LawrenceThis world-class author was highly influenced by Nietzsche (rejection of the Christian slave and anti-senses morality, his anti-democratic stance and his misogyny) and Freud (the un- and subconscious).The old and the new moralitiesIn the old morality, the \`soul' of man stands above the \`flesh'. In the new morality, the \`soul' \`sits in the dark limbs, in the body of the prostitute, in the sick flesh of the syphilitic'.American soul\`The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer'.The essential American action is destruction.The spirit of the place is freedom to lynch anybody who is not one of them (racism).The labor class is obedient because of the continual influx of more servile Europeans.American literatureBENJAMIN FRANKLIN \`doesn't let me have a soul of my own. He says that I am nothing but a servant of mankind, a galley-slave.' But he was also a destroyer: \`Extirpate the savages to make room for the cultivators of the earth.'HECTOR ST JOHN DE CREVECOEUR (\`Letters from an American Farmer') shows that there are no \`Sweet Children of Nature. All fraternity and equality go up in smoke and his ideal of pure sweet goodness along with it.'For JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, there can be no blood-mixing between the white and the red race. His world is a paradise for killers (\`The Deerslayer', \`The Last of the Mohicans').EDGAR ALLAN POE is fascinated by inquisition, torture and murder. For him, a woman is \`a vulture of stern passion'. \`Drugs, women, self-destruction are adventurers in the horrible passages of the human soul.'In NATHANAEL HAWTHORNE's \`The Scarlet Letter', the male protagonist is \`a spiritual fornicator and a liar'. The female protagonist is the destroyer of the white consciousness, of the old moral, of spiritual love.DANA's \`Two Years before the Mast' depicts the sea as the cosmic enemy, as the great disintegrating force, leaving the human nerves blank.HERMAN MELVILLE hated the white world and searched for a savage Eden (\`Typee'). But, he came to understand that \`civilized' people can't go back. \`Moby Dick', the white whale, represents \`the deepest blood-being of the white race', \`that lonely phallic monster of the individual you.' The whale is hunted by our old consciousness. His death is a suicide.WALT WHITMAN is the first author to break down the old morality. He gives the soul its own life, a life of sympathy. But he misinterprets sympathy as a feeling \`for', not as a feeling \`with'. His individual self leaked out of him into the universe (\`Democracy', \`En Masse', \`No Identity').These remarkable interpretations and insights are a must read of all lovers of world and US literature."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"This book is literary criticism about some of America's most famous writers. Basically, it is a &quot;Lawrencian&quot; reading of classics.D.H. Lawrence comments on Benjamin Franklin, Melville, Hawthorne, Dana, Fenimore Cooper, Poe, Whitman, and de Crevecoeur. In doing so, he is trying to get a picture of what America is and what it is trying to do. Although he mentions his interest in some, all fall short of the mark of creating a new identity for America.If you have ever read notes by Lawrence on some of his novels (like &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot;), you will see the repeat of a lot of ideas and language. This was written later in his life, so it does make sense that some of his ideas of the blood-relationship would come again.I would not recommend this book for people trying to understand American writing (except maybe to use this as contrast), but I would highly recommend this for anyone studying D.H. Lawrence. This will give you another perspective (aside from his fiction)."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"This is a small book yet Lawrence's genius enables him to see big things in it, especially about those large writers like Melville he felt an affinity to. \\"Trust the tale and not the teller\\" is one of his motto's here and he tries to show how the great works go beyond the intentions of their creators.One objection.

Lawrence is the only writer I know of who was able to trace the priggish type of American back to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day. Well, Lawrence gives him a perfectly-placed kick: check it out.All of these essays are thoughtful, funny, and insightful. Lawrence has a unique way of grasping the undercurrents of works of fiction, and many of his most surprising assertions ring true upon reflection."},{"Title":"Studies in classic American literature,","review":"This passionate brief survey of American Literature contains much spontaneous flowing masterful and original writing. Lawrence famous 'Trust the teller not the tale' is the motto of the work. It argues that the true creative work takes on a life of its own that even its creator cannot completely define and control.Perhaps the most famous essay in this book is Lawrence's hatchet- job of Ben Franklin who he found to be a spiteful, penny- pinching, calculating dead soul. In fact old Ben could be in certain places as lively and probably more lively than Lawrence himself.What however is most important is that Lawrence in this work understands the great subterranean and mysterious genius of a kindred spirit for him, the literary creator of the Great White Whale."},{"Title":"Aphrodesia","review":"After having purchased a couple books from the Druuna series, including this one, I have come to some very strong conclusions. This artist knows comics, and knows art. Like any good movie, the story can be told by the pictures alone, without even NEEDING to read it. And when you do, upon deeper exploration, you get plunged into an entirely different world unlike any other comic out there. I don't mean to over emphasis the uniqueness of the story or concept, but in it's success. No other comic can intrigue you, and have you totally suspend your disbelief and think that this might actually be real somewhere. The eroticism is high, and much hotter than any other &quot;hard core&quot; or &quot;underground&quot; comic.... but this differs completely. Dispite how good any adult comic can rise, this can only be a category unto itself. Erotic, yes, but moreso: it is utterly stunning. As the Druuna series comes to a close, and the story ends I find myself disliking this book in only one way... that I had to purchase the different peices individually, in serperate volumes. An collected book of all six episodes back to back in a thick well bound quality edition would be worth every penny, as is this book and any other of Serpieri's."},{"Title":"Aphrodesia","review":"Another thrilling adventure of serpieri, Great dose of erotism.

Although the story itself is quite interesting, I am finding it very hard to follow Paton's writing style and that is discouraging. People keep telling me it is SUCH a good book (and I keep hearing people rave about it on \\"Oprah\\") so I'm forcing myself to finish it, but I feel like the ground-breaking steps that Paton took with this book have been set back by the difficult-to-read style of writing. He doesn't use quotation marks. Instead, he delineates a quote with a dash at the beginning and no ending mark... which makes it very hard to tell when someone stops speaking and the narration resumes. In addition, the South African dialect is difficult to follow (it reminded me of reading \\"The Color Purple\\" at times) although the appendix does help a little with some of the words. Those two things added together have equaled a disappointing experience for me with this book.I feel like it's such a shame because I can imagine many people get a few chapters into the book and put it down forever, missing out on a wonderful story and the first \\"real\\" look at South Africa for its time.

Reading of his journey brought me to think of Kumalo as a real life character. What interested me most in the story was the strong influence of religion in life. One example would be Mr. Carmichael, who does an incredibly genorous deed in the name of god (I won't ruin the story). The story brings out the best while at the same time showing how bad people can be. It shows how power and society can affect anybody. Personally, I feel that religion was used too much in the story, although it may be somewhat important to the plot. I could not relate on a personal level, but it is a great story and the author uses quite a poetic language and style in writing."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is my absolute favorite book.

It is a sad story because Kumalo's son is hanged at the end of the story. This story I thought contain miracles and hope because Kumalo's dreams of restoring the land came true.

It tells the tale of tremendous injustice that is lain upon the shoulders of those who had their lives forever altered by a series of events and decisions forged out of ignorance and indifference. It is a grand novel of South African politics, underlain by the stories of those who lived under the legal system. It tells about good men and uncaring men, men of different races who are selfish and men of different races who care beyond measure. It shows how the racial divide is built by people on both sides and also how it is systematically deconstructed by good, honest decent men to whom race itself is not a measuring stick.This is a classic book, set against the amazing backdrop of a land that is in and of itself a contradiction, both lush and yet bleak, like the heart and soul of each person involved in this novel, where the consequences of each action carry on far beyond their perceived boundaries."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The story line involving several generations reveals how age affords patience and a sense of realism to a person.

Anyone who is interested in learning how to write effective, creative dialogue would do well to read this. Quotation marks are not used and therefore not OVERused. Instead it begins with a simple dash mark like this -Pretty good eh? It was so REFRESHING, I never realized how tedious and distracting breaking away to quotation marks could be in reading and attempting to comprehend a novel.

S.A.faces major problems to-day, the Aids crisis and a poor economy both of which can be directly traced to apartheid which broke down black family life,referred to by Paton in the introduction in articles he wrote stating,\\" the underlying causes of African crime ... the disintegration of tribal life and traditional family bonds under the impact of Western economy and culture.\\" This break down seen in the way black workers were treated, described by Paton.Big corporations such as the mines, built houses for white workers for wives and families; black workers were housed in single accommodation in compounds, only visiting their wives once a year! Likewise with domestic workers who supplied cheap labour but not permitted to having spouses living with them in backyard rooms in the suburbs. Prostitution was rife and likely Aids began spreading in the early 1980's in S.A. The apartheid government spent 6 times more on a white child's education than a black child, the policy was to keep black people as a serving class. This has caused an uneducated and untrained workforce which contributes to the poor economy and poverty leading to crime. The cycle must be broken. Understanding the cause of these problems will encourage foreign investment to provide jobs to end the poverty. Perhaps someone reading \\"Cry The Beloved Country\\" will be encouraged to invest in South Africa.I applaud Oprah Winfrey for choosing this story for her Book Club choice, bringing attention to the hardships black people suffered and yet they always expressed joy and hope, demonstrated by their great leader, Nelson Mandela, who set the example of reconciliation rather than retaliation. An example world leaders, particularly in the Middle East, would do well to follow. Paton writes beautifully, describing the people and the countryside.Elaine Bunbury.\\"What Hope Have You!\\" a story about the affects of colonialism and apartheid upon three families of different races in South Africa, over 100 years and 4 generations."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This has to be my favorite book of all time. Even though it is set historically in Apartheid South Africa, it speaks of themes that are universal and timeless eg. love, hatred, prejudice,and injustice, and through it all is the magnificent soul of the priest. Paton's writing is skilfull."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"REVIEW: CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTYAs a seminarian, let me first say this: \\"Cry, The Beloved Country\\" taught me more about being a true, compassionate Christian minister then from all I've learned in my short time in seminary. How can I make such a statement? Because the author, Alan Paton, does more to illustrate the power and truth of Christian charity than the best Sunday sermon could ever hope to achieve.Like all truly great literary works, this book works on multiple levels, the highest being theological. One could write a doctoral dissertation on the Christian theology which pervades every single page of this novel. And yet there is very little preaching, and only a tiny handful of Bible quotations. We are not being talked down too, we are not being lectured; rather, we are being invited into a world where the best virtues are illustrated, not commanded.Those looking for a political treatise on the evils of apartheid will be sadly disappointed, as this book was written before those laws were put in place. (In fact, the word \\"apartheid\\" never appears once in the story.) However, one can easily see the evil seeds being sown that will bear a bitter harvest in years to come.There are three main characters in this story: the old Zulu Anglican pastor Stephen Kumalo, the wealthy white farmer James Jarvis and the country of South Africa as it was in the early to mid 1940's. The way in which these three characters interact with each other is truly remarkable, and sometimes quite surprising. I could say much more about the plot and characters, but it will be much more fun for the reader to discover these things on his own. It is well worth the effort.As I write this review, the book is the current selection of \\"Oprah's Book Club.\\" While I've always taken that label as a warning to avoid a work of fiction, this time it proved to be an invaluable guide to a book I would have otherwise overlooked. The book club's new emphasis on \\"the classics\\" is an excellent idea. The first two choices of \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" are outstanding selections. Much credit goes to Oprah Winfrey for steering us out of the gutter of contemporary fiction, and helping us to enjoy the rich, powerful treasures from our recent past. You go, girl.I read a tremendous amount of books, more so than anyone else I know. So you can truly appreciate how significant it is when I say \\"Cry, The Beloved Country\\" is one of the top ten best English language novels I've ever read. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"In the isolated village named Ndotsheni, in the Natal province of eastern South Africa, the Reverend Stephen Kumalo receives a letter from a fellow priest, Theophilus Msimangu. The letter carries news that Kumalo's sister, Gertrude, is ill and that he must immediately depart for Johannesburg. Kumalo agrees to undertakes the difficult and expensive journey to the city in the hopes of helping Gertrude and of finding his son, Absalom. In Johannesburg, Kumalo is warmly welcomed by Msimangu, the priest who sent him the letter. Straightaway, he tells Kumalo what the real problem with Gertrude is; she has become a prostitute and liquor-seller. Kumalo finds her and persuades her to come back to Ndotsheni with her young son.After dealing with Gertrude, Kumalo and Msimangu begin searching the enormous, confusing city of Johannesburg for Absalom. They visit Kumalo's brother, John, who has become a successful businessman and politician for hints of the reverend's son. One clue leads to another, and as Kumalo travels from place to place, he begins to see the racial and economic divisions that are splitting his country apart. Eventually, Kumalo finds his son in a very troubled situation. Absalom has \\"accidentally\\" killed the racial justice activist Arthur Jarvis, and has also impregnated an unmarried woman. Absalom goes through his trial and is sentenced to the death penalty for homicide. Devastated, Kumalo goes back to Ndotsheni aware of how his people have lost the tribal structure that once held them together. The book ends on the evening before Kumalo's son's execution. He goes to the mountains to have some time alone and on the way there he encounters the father of the man Absalom killed, James Jarvis. Kumalo and James had met before but it is not until now when they become the closest they've ever been. The two men have always had good intentions but have failed to cross the lines into each other's world. The imbalanced relationship between whites and blacks is still portrayed: James sits on top of his horse while Kumalo humbly thanks him. Nevertheless, the intense moment of understanding and compassion that they share might be a slight step toward mending the country's enormous racial divide. The final paragraph ends with the breaking of dawn. As Kumalo stands outside, gazing at the stars, he feels like he has done many things wrong with his life. However, he takes some consolation in knowing that his life has been the only kind he could possibly have led and hopes that the changes for the better will outpace the changes for the worse.Throughout the whole story Alan Paton fills the pages with philosophical lines that are true about life. It candidly makes the reader sense the wisdom of the the man who tells such a beautiful, enriching and moving novel. An example is when Msimangu tries to explain why \\"whites\\" are afraid of \\"blacks\\" having power and Kumalo responds.Yes that is right about power, he said. But there is only one thing that has power completely, and that is love. Because when a man loves, he seeks no power, and therefore he has power. I see only one hope for our country, and that is when white men and black men, desiring neither power nor money, but desiring only the good of their country, come together to work for it.Again, Paton uses very powerful words and puts them together perfectly to describe the fear that was felt by the inferior social groups in South Africa in the 1940's.Have no doubt it is fear in the land. For what can men do when so many have grown lawless? Who can enjoy the lovely land, who can enjoy the seventy years, and the sun that pours down on the earth, when there is fear in the heart? Who can walk quietly in the shadow of the jacarandas, when their beauty is grown to danger? Who can lie peacefully abed, while the darkness holds some secret? What lovers can lie sweetly under the stars, when menace grows with the measure of their seclusion?Lines like these are what make this novel unforgettable. In times of tragedy the characters handle the situations with such humility, dignity and grace that it makes the reader want to act the same way in his or her own situations. The connection between Kumalo and Msimangu is captivating. After just some hours of knowing each other they understand each other and become trustworthy friends. Msimangu shows sympathy and compassion toward Kumalo every time Kumalo receives bad news about his relatives. For all these reasons I describe this novel as heart-rending and touching, but most importantly memorable.Alan Paton writes about the situations and relationships in the immediate years prior to apartheid in South Africa. Apartheid was a set of laws defining the place of various racial groups in the society of South Africa. From 1948 to 1994 \\"blacks\\" or native South Africans were under a strict governmental system that segregated them from the white supremacists. The author makes the theme of the ethnic gap between the two groups consistent and noticeable across the whole story. If social inequalities were not the direct causes of Absalom's troubles, then they were certainly catalysts. Other instances like when Kumalo and Msimangu want to ride the buses but can't because there is a boycott taking place by the colored people to protest, are when the reader can discern the rising tension between the two divisions. Paton tells a story full of hope, love, courage and endurance about one of the most tragic historical periods of South Africa."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Reading some of the reviews for this book has been interesting to say the least. In CBC Paton writes in verse, not prose. This is something that not many pick up on, but it is shown through his use of repetition and imagery. This book is somewhat tragic in that it paints a hopeful picture for South Africa's future only a few years before apartheid was established. CBC is not a book for those who don't have the patience for Paton's wonderful use of verse."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"They say the worst fear of a parent is for their child to die before them. There's something unnatural about it. In Cry...two sets of parents have this fear become a reality, but the focus is primarily on the fathers, Stephen Kumalo and James Jarvis.Set in South Africa during the gold mine craze, Cry...shows the effects of white imperialism on a predominately black nation. James' son is one of the few whites sympathetic to the plight of the native African people, yet is shot down by one of them, Kumalo's son, during a robbery.The two fathers are united by this tragic event and the pain that accompanies it. Both men learn and grow from the experience and use this newfound growth and knowledge to help each other and the people of their hometown. They try to make some sense of the havoc in Africa, and to bring hope to the destitute people who are made to help the wealthy get wealthier, but who are not allowed to share any of that wealth. We can see now how Africa has been sucked dry and the people left to starve and die of disease thanks to exploitation.The story is a 5-star, but the writing style is a 4, averaging it at a 4.5, which has to be rounded to a 5 rating. The language can sound wooden and repetitive. One could argue this is simply how the African people would sound in English; but, I still believe the dialogue could have been livelier than: \\"Will you stay father? Yes, I will stay son. Okay, father. Okay, son.\\"To clear up some confusion, some of the chapters consist of no dialogue between the main characters, but dialogue of anonymous and random people in Johannesburg discussing the different ills of the city.Cry, the Beloved Country is an easy read and a good one."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, The Beloved Country is my favorite novel, and Maggie Soboil is an incredible narrator! I love the honest humanity of this novel. It deals with hard issues in an unflinching way. Moreover, Ms. Soboil's voice strengthens the novel, with accurate pronounciation and accent -- you feel that she has transported you to South Africa."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is one of the best books of fiction I've ever read in my life, in that it is almost biographical. It is a simple book written in a deceptively simple style that can spawn many imitators but no equals. It easily reminds me of Hemingway's &quot;Old Man And The Sea&quot;, but only in its style of language. It is full of poetry, easy language, complex syntax, human emotion and vivid imagery. For me, reading it was really like rowing down a river in an African canoe.It is set in racist, white-monopolised South Africa of the 1940's, at the dawn of Apartheid. It all revolves around Stephen Kumalo, an old Zulu parson living in the country, and his subsequent search for his son [and sister] somewhere at street corners in Johannesburg. He finally finds his son but it is too late, the latter being in police custody -- charged with the murder of a white man, and a &quot;good&quot; white man at that, who devoted a great deal of his time to arguing for blacks[!]Finely entwined with old man Kumalo's seemingly endless search are the little and big occurrences of everyday life, only that they are this time set in racist South Africa, with its crude realities of that by-gone day. It all smells of chaos and derangement in the black townships of the city. For an old man from the country like Kumalo, life in urban Johannesburg is too fast and he is confronted with city experiences and everyday-struggles he never had before. He is mugged, deceived, sees sex and money at work and has further encounters with other strange, tricky and sinful city situations for the first time in his old country life!Mr. Paton's epical story of an old black man's search for his young son gone astray in the city -- and also in search of answers to other societal questions that still persist -- remained an unsolved puzzle to me, after I read his wonderful book the first time. &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; is one of the few books of fiction I've read that so powerfully combine feeling and a deep understanding of conflicts that permeate across divided society. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is filled with poetry and symbolism. The writing style of Alan Paton is truly amazing and each line is rich in metaphor and understanding. Obviously inspired by the country he is writing about you can feel the love he has for Africa in each and every line of this text.As for the story it's a very interesting look at the coming of age in a society that probably doesn't want to come of age yet. It probes deep questions about what right societies have to interfere with each other and what steps can and can't be taken after interference has already occurred. One of the most powerful messages for me was that you can't go back. The natives in the book can not return to the culture that they once had, instead they must look for a way to combine their old culture with the new culture that has been forced upon them. The book seems to give hope that this is possible and makes us realize that culture is stronger than the conditions it lives in and can stand strong against even the heaviest adversity."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Being South African, this book touched me like few others. Some may say it is slow, but I found the prose lovely, with Paton's descriptions coming near to capturing the beauty and sadness of the country. Paton also avoids falling into the trap of portraying all Black people as noble, and all White people as evil settler types, making the story much more subtle and realistic than many others dealing with South Africa.[...]"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Somehow this was a classic I &quot;missed&quot; in high school and college. I just finished reading it yesterday and still find myself thinking about many of the beautifully rendered scenes. Others have summarized the plot -- I love the labyrinthine (Dante-esque in scope) descent from the country side into the hell of Johannisburg. As we watch the narrator weave his way in and out of the horrible living conditions, we are presented with a modern day Inferno that would have made Dante proud.The dialogue is rich and detailed and the character's well-developed. There are some gut wrenchingly scenes between a father and his son, not to mention between his other siblings as well. Bitter disappointments, difficult circumstances and a trial that makes To Kill a Mockingbird's look fair add to the book's tension. Overall, a lyrical and stirring portrait of unfairness and oppression (but also beauty and purity) in South Africa and one family's trials and tribulations. It makes one wonder how much things have really changed from Paton's day."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Although this book is about 60 years old I just read it for the 1st time. It is a keeper and a treasure. It is a book that you will want to revisit often at least for awhile. I find the book to be filled with spiritual messages. You will see the making of aparthaid long before it was abolished. The story itself is quite suspenseful and Paton's writing style is unique. I like it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I didn't like the way it swiched to another topic in the middle of the book. It didn't make sence. It really screwed me up becove of that. I didn't like reading this book for school."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course.When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This work of literary genious was written by Alan Paton. Anyone who writes a book like this is &quot;ok&quot; in my book. I learned some wonderful lessons in equality, as well as some lessons about myself. I'm white, so I kind of felt bad. Because white people are evil. Especially in South africa. They just were so racist and selfish that they forced the African Natives to poverty, and a life of crime. This book was a wonderful reading experience, and I hope that it withstands the test of time."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry the beloved Country is a book about the people in Africa during the 1940's. It shows how whites and blacks reflected each other, and how they were so different while being exactally the same. There was lots of crime and hatred shown between every one in the book. I found it to be a good book, and well worth my time. I found it to be sad, and yet beautiful classic. Although it seemed to drag some what, and be kind of slow; by the time you were done you felt like you were in the middle of the story. And you felt like you knew the people and expeirenced it with them."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Author Alan Paton wrote a pretty good book in my opinion. The story tells of an old Zulu pastor living in the South African village of Ndotsheni. In the story Reverand Kumalo goes to Johannesburg in response to a letter he received from another pastor stationed there. While in Johannesburg, Reverand Kumalo learns that his own son has committed a murder and will be sentenced to death. This in itself is a tragedy to Kumalo, not to mention that his sister and brother are also living poorly in the great city. He goes to Johannesburg and loses one family but regains another in a way he never thought possible. I liked the book because it told a heartwarming tale of the struggle for natives in South Africa and the difficulties they face. My criticisms of the book are that it has a slow opening and many details such as time and setting are not clearly explained or understood."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I think that the Cry, of the beloved country was a very fun book to read, because it was interesting. The book had a very good begining and i liked how Stephen Kumalo told you where he was going to and how he was going to get there. Overall it was a very good book to read. The movie was pretty good to cause it made a lot of sense about where he was going and it described the countrys like how Ndotsheni was Hilly and green grass and beautiful."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry The Beloved Country was an outstanding book! It showed the importance of family, and how far one will go to save his own family. Stephen Kumalo, the main character in this book, travels to Johanesburg to help his sister Gertrude. He runs into many obstacles along the way. This book is set in South Africa, and many words used in the book are South African. These words may confuse the reader, but still conveys the outstanding work of the writer. I enjoyed this book very much, and recomended to everyone that enjoys reading novels, of love and pain!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I really enjoyed this story. It had a good description of the places being visited and the people. I thought it displayed a good view of the emotions of the people living in the country. My one complaint was that it was rather confusing. The way the book displayed speaking parts, was very hard to understand. It took a while to find out who was tlaking and how the conversation started. There were parts of the story were it did not explain who was talking at all. And as nice and discriptive it was, it started to get a tad boring. It had a very slow flow to it. The speed of the book was not consistent at all. This book I was assigned to read as a English assignment. And so was this review., Terah S"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I liked this book. I thought that it should how South Africa was exactly in the 1940's. This book was about a Black reveran from a little town going to the big city to find his son and his sister and also see his brother. While tring to find these people with his guide another black reveran he finds trouble with all of them. I would suggest this book to all people to find out how South Africa once was through a mans' veiw. Also read this novel to find out what happens to this man."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"In my opinion, this book was not an enjoyable book for any teenager to read. It was more over a book for the older group to endlduge in. I think that the morals of this story were clearly stated but was not a book that was one you can't put down. If i was given the choice of reading this book i probally would try to find a more exciting. I still think that the story was very clearly put but was not too enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"In my oppinion, &quot;Cry the Beloved Country&quot; Was a very interesting book. I think it told the history of south africa very well. It was also interesting to see the veiws of more then one side. &quot;Cry the beloved Country&quot; was as page turner!!! There was new adveture each chapter. I think the life of Kumalo his journey and the people he met each had a unique role in this story. The whole book resovles around stevens broken pieces of his life that he is trying to put them back together. This story also teachers many life's lessons. The theme and quotes are all very meaningfull. I Highly recomend this book.~~~Brianne E.~~~~~"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"it was the greatest story of all time. I mean one minute im laughing, the next im crying for the beloved country.This story is about south african country under a white work law is the deeply moving story of Stephen Kumalao and son Absolom, set against the backdrop of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. A classic work of love hope,courage and endurance,born of the diginity of man."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"When you read this book, not only will you cry for the beloved country, but you will also cry for the natives getting kicked around by the whites, cry for all the injustice, murder, and other crimes that these people had to suffer from. This story portrays several different points of view. A humble and honest man, Steven Kumalo, journeys to the mystical city of Johannesburg. His sister Gertrude has been sick and he must go to help her heal. While Kumalo is there, he intends on finding his son who now lives in Johannesburg but never communicates with his parents anymore. As we follow Kumalo on his excursion through South Africa, we witness a series of events that causes him to open his eyes to all the world around him. For the first time in his life, Steven Kumalo realizes that there are other worlds besides the one he lives in."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I know that my summary is a clich&eacute;, but it's true. Alan Paton's remarkable novel explores many of the basic human emotions. It paints a vivid portrait of South African life, especially with the contrast between traditional Zulu life and urban life. No character is left undeveloped - even a murder victim is a believable character. The book gains its power through concrete, vivid images, not through clich&eacute;s and syrupy description. If you have a short attention span, the book may seem long and long-winded due to long conversation-free passages. But once you pick up the rhythm of the novel, it is a brilliant, powerful, accessible masteripece."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The beloved country of Africa should cry due the injustice their children are being born into. This novel is a non-biased story of the life of a Zulu pasor in Africa. This book was fast-paced, well written, and fascinating. Paton has mastered the art of fine writing. I couldn't put the book down! This book definitely has a lot of food for thought. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I have read this novel twice. It is truely a work which challenges the reader on various levels. At times you are locked in a wonderful lyrical poem; the descriptions of South Africa are vivid and so authentic that you are there. Paton is wise enough to pace the action in a previous time. There is no one that is naive enough to keep the heart wretching drama in the past. It is prehaps these fact that everyone can relate to in the pathos of Rev. Kumalo in his journey to reunite the tribe and his gradual awakening to the fact that there are changes that are occurring that his compassion and tears can do nothing for. Indeed this is worth the reading. The only complaint I have is that there is not enough attention given to Gertrude. But this criticism does not decrease the value of the book. One can still see Mr. James Jarvis in the delipated church as the rain washes away his hatred and it is replaced by compassion. &quot;Cry The Beloved Country&quot; is not just a novel about South Africa but about the social injustices we all see around, or at least we should be able to see ."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is a really great book....I started reading it knowing nothing abt how popular it was etc.....I was really moved by the lyrical prose......It is a book that doesnt judge, doesnt take a high stand, doesnt provide a solution to the problem....just talks about it in humane way.....really beautiful.... a must read for everyone....and trust me, it is a serious book....without all the pretensions of one....."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I was moved and cried till my eyes ached. This is one of the best books I have and will ever read."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I've read many of the reviews of this book, and it doesn't say much about higher education. This is not a book to hurry through to meet a class requirement. It's a book to make you stop and reflect. Despite the crushing sadness of the story, the overall message is one of hope and redemption. If you don't have time for such things, go to your local video store and rent &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; and get wasted, instead."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"When I first was assigned this book for my English class, I was at first doubtful of the book, especially because I knew it was a book in Oprah's book club. My teacher, deciding to prolong the torture, made us take four weeks to read it at home and at class everyday. Needless to say, I payed absolutely no attention during class. Because we had an assignment due, and I could obtain a B if I did well on the rest of my year's projects, I decided to read the book.I was at first skeptical, but soon found that the story itself is interesting. It is a story about the intertwining of the lives of a black and white man, whose sons met with conflict. But more than that, it is a story of hope for the African people. The message of this story is actually quite effective, with me, an 18 year old male, actually enjoying the book.When I first started reading it, I felt that the language was chunky and ineffective. However, after getting used to Paton's style, it became easier to decipher his message. It is both races that are to blame for the current situation in Africa. The whites destroyed a culture and replaced it with nothing, while the blacks refused to take control over their lives. It is a story of the rebirth of Ndotsheni and the understanding between two men of different races. This cooperation provides a symbol of hope to Africa that things may be changed.The reason I give it a four is purely personal, for it is not an entertaining book but should be read by any academic mind."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is an extraordinary novel. Paton's fiction explores the nature of human feeling, spirit and behaviour. Well written prose not wasting words or pages in non sense. The characters, the plot, the technique all are great."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is an inspirational glance at the inherent goodness in man and it's abuse by fellow man. While dealing with touchy subjects, namely apartheid, the ideas presented by Paton are as powerful as anything Orwell could have written. The bright, fresh, and positive future suggested by Paton reaches deeper into the soul than the dystopia presented by many 20th century authors. With conviction in God and country Paton illustrates the power of forgiveness and love in changing a corrupt society."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"It was for my history class, but I didn't know what it was actually about, and I fell in love with the book! So moving, I think I was in tears in the end."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I thought this was a great book.

I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I listened to this story on CD, as read by Maggie Soboil. Her South African dialect made the story come alive! It was engaging and deep and the story so meaningful and thoughtful that I didn't want it to end. I wish that it was a series. I grew to love the characters and wanted to get to know them more."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I had to do a book report for my AP English class, so I did not expect to enjoy it much. That being said, CTBC really moved me it was as close to a life changing book as I've really ever read.I don't have too much to say about this book, except that it was outstanding! The content was extremely deep and profound and I had no trouble getting through it. I'm not much of a reader, but this is perhaps my all-time favorite book. I'm not sure what it was that I liked about it, but it really touched me. There aren't a whole lot of books similar to it (which disappoints me), but I'm truly glad to have found Cry, the Beloved Country. I look forward to rereading it!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"In this story set in pre-Apartheid (1946-1947) South Africa, Stephen Kumalo, a Native South Afrikaner priest of a rural village, goes to Johannesburg to help his sister, Gertrude, and track down his son, Absalom, who left to check on her and never returned. Once he gets the situation with his sister under control, he sets off with a fellow priest to find Absalom. Unfortunately, the closer they get to tracking down the young man, the worse the situation seems, and, they eventually learn, is; he must suffer the consequences of his involvement in a crime. The author sheds light on the societal issues of the times, especially those involving race, specifically (p 23) \\"The problem of the decay of tribal culture, the poverty of the reserves, and the flight of the people to already overcrowded urban centers...\\"And what makes the story so amazing is the way he handles the race and class issues through the actions of the members of the families of the wrongdoer and the wronged. Although I'm not usually a fan of books involving odds-defying character connections, in this case, it's the thing that makes the story so great. A prediction: this story will stick with you. Also good: Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller, A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest J. Gaines and A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"ProfoundThis book was interesting, poignant, sensitive and written in an atmosphere of inspiration and hope. I felt an instant connection with the minister at a heart felt level. Seldom is a religious person depicted with such honesty, directness and humility that can be believed as the main character in, Cry the Beloved Country. I am not a religious person but I truly felt drawn in by the profound love and directness. If ever there was a platform for religious belief it is demonstrated in this book.This book points in the most direct way that as parents we must have a relationship with our children that will influence them in positive ways and encourage them to think before they act because our children have more opportunities to destroy their lives than we have power to keep them safe.This book should be grabbed with hunger by anyone who wants to be educated, seek maturity and wants to be a really good parent. Perhaps from those who just don't get it or thought this book is boring, well, they are the people who just aren't there yet. Bless their hearts"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A wonderful work from a gifted author, this story explores race relations in South Africa. The references to local geography and the beautiful Afrikaans language sets a lyrical tone for a difficult narrative. I really believe that this work was prescient in that it not only predicts later changes in South African law but also the issues surrounding crime and desolation currently confronting the RSA.Not as good as the superb \\"Too Late the Phalarope\\", but still a worthwhile read that packs a punch."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This story took place in Africa during the time of Apartheid, where there was much racial conflict. It is the story of a poor black minister who struggles with his family, many of his family and church members have left the farming and grasslands during a drought. The land has also been overused and doesn't produce many crops. The parish is poor. The minister receives a letter from the big city where the people have been going, about his sister who is in dire circumstances and very sick. She also has a son with her, and there are others he is asked to look for including his own son. All of these people have gone for work, but never come back and never write home, so no one knows about them. The minister grieves for his son and all of them and takes what little money he has saved to take the train and find his sister and his son.He finds them in tragic circumstances and what happens to them is the heart of the story. There are two fathers, one white and one black and both face tragedy together and form a bond during these awful times. It is a story of love, forgiveness, and faith. All of the story is shadowed by apartheid as it was in the 1940s. People die, people love, forgive and go on living despite all barriers. There is much to be learned from this tragic, yet beautiful story."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Before leaving school and going home for the summer, I told myself that I would fill my time with intellectually stimulating activities like learning Spanish and reading classic literature. Unfortunately, I did not accomplish as much as I had hoped, but I feel that my summer was successful, if for nothing else, because I read Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country. Paton's description of the country that he and his characters love is poetic, and the dialogue is wonderfully South African. His characters are realistic, but he maintains their dignity. His treatment of topics like apartheid, inner-city crime and faith is not overly condemnatory or simplistic. All of this plays out through the story of one man's journey to find and reclaim his lost son--an archetypal story that resonated with me. It is not a happy book, but it is full of hope. It deals with human failure, but it allows for redemption.[Spoiler Alert!] The protagonist, Stephen Kumalo, leaves his native land in the South African wilderness and travels to Johannesburg in search of his prodigal son. Eventually, Kumalo finds his son, but he also discovers that his son is convicted of murder. The father of the murder victim also journeys to Johannesburg. There, both fathers must face the results of the things to which their generation has figuratively given birth. It is a journey from innocence to knowledge and from physical and emotional distance to involvement. Both men leave Johannesburg and return to their rural homes after Kumalo's son is condemned to death, but they go with changed eyes. Kumalo sees some of the flaws in the native tribal culture and the victim's father notices the negligence of the wealthy white land owners. By the end of the book, both of their sons are dead, but their daughters-in-law and grandchildren are alive. This can be viewed as a prediction that the generation following Paton's novel would consist of violence and racial estrangement, but successively, there would be rebirth and hope for a peaceful coexistence.Paton proved prophetic on all counts. Indeed, Cry, the Beloved Country was published the same year that the apartheid system was established. It seems that Paton could foresee a darkness setting in on the country he loved, yet he concludes his novel with a sunrise. He writes, \\"For it is the dawn that has come, as it has come for a thousand centuries, never failing. But when that dawn will come, of our emancipation, from the fear of bondage and the bondage of fear, why, that is a secret.\\" Perhaps today we are seeing the beams of that sunrise--the summer in which I read Paton's book is the same summer that South Africa hosted the World Cup and that Invictus was released on video. I do not think that the problems Paton deals with in Cry, the Beloved Country are entirely resolved, nor do I think that a major sporting event or motion picture are necessarily portents of South African peace, but I, like Paton, believe in the sun, even if I cannot tell when it will rise."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"After reading Cry, the Beloved Country I realized how terrible the situation is in South Africa. I knew it was in bad condition now but to actually feel like I was there really made me realize that the grass is not always greener on the other side. This book had its emotional moments; for instance when Stephen Kumalo finds out all the situation his son Absalom is put in. I recommend this book to anyone who has an opened mind, and wants to learn more about cultural differences."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I saw the movie made from this book first and I thought nothing could top the beauty of the film. I was wrong, as usual the book is always better than the movie.Alan Paton writes with extrodinary beauty making each sentence into a poetic phrase worth a second glance. He has written a story about racism, prejudice and forgiveness, ideas not often mentioned or acted together. Paton draws his reader into the beauty and magnificence of South Africa without the benefit of pictures, but your mind fills with splendor anyway. The lesson Paton provides is beautiful, to accept others, to betray society's prejudices and to die with a clean and pure heart."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"What a gem. A perfect novel. The characters are unforgettable. The writing is exquisite. The imagery is scenic, rich, resonant. Most important, the story is actually important. The novel made me grieve for the lost quality in so much modern literature, which often pales in comparison to this classic work. Can't believe I was never asked in high school or college to read this wondrous work. What a gem."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I loved this book I could not put it down! I think Paton did a brillant job in writting this magnificiant story. One will be drawn to the characters as Paton described each of them so well. This book will teach one to appreciate what they have or hope to have. And that my friend will have to discover it for themselves. I hope one will love this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Yes, the writing style was a bit CHALLENGING but made it all the more authentic. (I was truly surprised to learn that Mr. Paton is a WHITE South African!) The message was so amazing. The story was so well crafted.I would recommend this book to anyone. If you take the time to absorb it - and not &quot;just read&quot; it - then you will be the lucky one. This is not a quick read to check off your list, but a masterpiece to savor. (Nelson Mandela's biography is also fabulous reading!!)"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is my most favorite book of all time. Even though it was written in the 40s, it still speaks volumes about human dignity as well as prejudice. Sadly, these things are always with us, and so this book is timeless. A more recent novel of the same genre, set in South Africa and movingly written, is \\"A Telling Time\\" by Glynnis Hayward. (ISBN 1591295912) It provides a good companion read with Paton's novel. I highly recommend reading them both, - read one for Oprah, and one for yourself."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is moving and compassionate, and Paton understands Africa and human nature so well, as well as all the prejudices of Apartheid South Africa in its early days. If you enjoyed this book, I really recommend reading A TELLING TIME by GLYNNIS HAYWARD which also tells a story of compassion, love and prejudice in South Africa in the 1970s. There is hope and reconciliation in her book, rather than total despair. Read them both."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Paton's acclaimed tale about a pastor in Johannesburg looking for his son is South Africa's finest literature. Kumalo's struggle with faith in man, in god, and in himself is a compelling look at what happens when fear and hate dictate what happen in any government or group. In addition to describing the evil apartheidist regime, it lays bare the fundamental spirit of man. Paton apparently fashioned his novel from The Grapes of Wrath, and while it is tedious at times, it is a valuable historical document and a wonderful story, and important too."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is an enthralling story of a priest who's efforts are endless in the struggle of his own family, and the struggle outside. The way Paton details the scenes is to me, what made the book what it was. I felt as though I was looking at pictures while reading. He is so thorough in describing the lack of life in the valleys, that you can understand the significance in the title. What struck me most about this book, was Stephen Kumalo's efforts in forgiveness and the reconstruction of his family. His own family life struggle subtly reflected the outer stuggle, the black man's struggle. The last line of the story is most powerful when summarizing... &quot;But when that dawn will come, of our emancipation, from the fear of bondage and the bondage of fear, why, that is a secret.&quot; That line points out a major theme in this book, and really gives the reader a sense of history, and a sense of what still remains, not as severe, today. I positively enjoyed reading this book. I found it to flow through the three books smoothly and coherently. It wasn't a burden to pick it up and read sixty or seventy pages at a time. My fascination with South Africa may have had an impact on choosing this book, but with that in mind, I knew I could enjoy what Paton hopes every citizen should be aware of. His powerful message would touch anyone who reads it, aware of apartheid or not. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some relaxed pleasure reading that won't boggle your mind or frustrate you in a confused sense."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"What a book!!! I read this book when I was a senior in High School and that was almost 7 years ago! It was summer reading, and I can still remember thinking oh what a drag! But I am so glad that my instructor added this novel to the list! The views on apartheid especially as seen through the eyes of the black and white men both help make us think about what goes on in the world outside of this country and give us a clue as to how we can stop this from happening here. If you need a good book to read, make this one of your top choices!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"After hearing from a person whose opinion I respect that this was the definative book on South Africa, I was very disappointed. It wandered around a great deal and at the very end it finally got to the point of how great South Africa is and why. I am sure I have read better books on the subjet but it was many years ago and I no longer remember the titles or authors."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is a classic. The author skillfully restores the reader's belief that our lives have meaning and purpose.

It is still relevant today, and an enriching context for the revised opera Lost in the Stars, even though the book is considerably more complex than the Weil opera.Margaret Healy"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The 3 stars I am giving this book are the average of what I would give the content (5 stars all the way! great book!) and the formatting/delivery (0-1 stars), because unfortunately there is no way to give separate reviews for both.It is a great and touching book. Get it now--from a used book store or a used book seller online.I could not tell whether this was intended by the author or a defect in the formatting of the ebook, but there are no separators for dialog. Normally things that characters say are either enclosed in quotes, or set off by a long dash. In this book the dialog all runs together. It is for the most part possible to figure out who says what, but sometimes you have to read a passage over a few times to be sure. Since the book was written decades ago, it is possible that this was accepted form back then, e.g. similar to stream-of-consciousness writing. If this was the author's intention and it was preserved in the ebook, there should be a footnote or a short explanation for the reader to that effect.Second--the ebook costs more than the paperback and that is unacceptable because it certainly cost a LOT less to produce and distribute. Unless an ebook costs half the cost of the paperback or less, I will stick to used bookstores in town or online."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The book was in really good condition, but had some smudges on it. Great quality though and reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I studied this in college, traced the history of South African society for years afterwards, and then taught this book to my senior level World Literature Class. This oral rendition with my old annotated copy worked well to equip me to do that as well as renewing the inspiration of my read of this classic book,"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is a wonderfully written and powerful novel that takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride of emotion. From the depths of despair, Paton shows his readers a nugget of hope. From utter desolation, Paton gives us a measure of courage. His story is utterly devastating and demoralizing, yet his beautiful language and vision lead the reader to end up feeling energized and encouraged.Overall, I was shocked by the power of this novel and while it's not along the lines of things that I would normally read, I am immensely glad that I decided to read it. Following Stephen Kumalo, a Zulu pastor from the wilds of South Africa, in his seemingly hopeless search for his son in the \\"civlized\\" metropolis of Johannesburg was a challenge at times, but Paton's writing and the courage of his character carried me through even the deepest and darkest points of his story and helped me to see the wonder of the human spirit regardless of the challenges and trials that it is put up against.May not have been my favorite novel of all time, but I am glad that I disregarded my inhibitions and picked this up to actually read it. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but I would recommend giving Cry, the Beloved Country a chance. You may find something here that you never expected."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I owned a dog eared, disheveled paperback copy of this novel from over fifty years ago. I recently had occasion to read another of Mr. Paton's novels, Ah, But Your Land Is Beautiful, and remembered what \\"Cry\\" meant to me as a young white Southerner, trying to come to terms with the still segregated South. I wanted a hardback copy, and was pleased to be able to find it on Amazon. Cry, The Beloved Country is a novel that I will read, re-read, and savor. It's language and style are compelling; they draw you into the tragedy and redemption of a story that, through the writer's skill and without didacticism, requires you to confront the immoral and dehumanizing nature of apartheid. That the works of Mr. Paton invaded the corridors of world power through the years -- until the release of Mr. Mandela from prison -- speaks for itself. \\"Cry\\" was in its time a shot across the bow, a sign that a new age that was already emerging. The tree of humanity had sprouted new leaves, and the full bloom of a new South Africa was becoming visible."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is one of those novels I pick up and re-read every few years.

Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the waters run through his fingers nor satnd too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire.

For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.&quot;i memorised the first chapter and recite it sometimes, amust read i think, it desrves to be read with patience and care, for its plot AND style.

Here he searches all over, but only in vain, for the places where his son has resided, but his son has already departed from them. But its in Johannesburg where Reverend Kumalo discovers his sister and her son, his brother (a carpenter come political activist), and other characters that range from a fellow pastor to the father of a son who has been murdered.Cry, the Beloved Country, reads like many ancient texts oddly enough, and some readers may find it difficult to keep up with because Paton uses no quotation marks to signify dialogue, but nonetheless Cry, the Beloved Country is a captivating novel that reaches into one's soul and explains the boundaries of compassion, and the meaning of friendship even in the most trying of times."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A very moving story of two neighboring families set amidst the racially/politically turbulent atmosphere of Mid-20th Century South Africa.

(I have always doubted others' insistence that our culture has been turned by television and computers into a short-attention-span travesty, but now I am reconsidering that skepticism.) If this book is boring, a speech by Martin Luther King is boring. A beautiful day at the beach, or on a mountain, is boring. A beautiful woman is--boring. And frankly, if you think those things are boring, I have little use for your opinion.More pertinently, there is so much about this book that is so moving, and what is moving is exciting by definition (at least in MY opinion). The universality of Paton's dialogues, the way he shifts so effortlessly from present to past tense to convey tension and emotion, his command of the Zulu culture and of the history and terror of his native land--all of these factors are simply astounding. This is a book people will read three centuries from now--and it will be just as exciting then."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. It was very insightful into the issues of racism and prejudice. I read this for a 9th grade English assignment, and it was a great book.

I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton's &quot;Cry, The Beloved Country&quot; is a fabulous book. Admittedly, it starts out a little slow and the style takes a bit of getting used to, but the characters are amazingly real and the story saddens and uplifts simultaneously.

If you have, read it again."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Sure, the book got a bit confusing at times because of the lack of quotation marks, but this book never got boring.

It was pretty exciting, most of the time. At parts the book drifted off and became boring. Then it came back suddenely. The book teaches some very great lessons.

It is about Stephen Kumalo, a priest in Ndotsheni, who goes to Johannesburg, the big city, to find his sister, brother, and son. They had left a while ago and were not heard from since. He goes to Johannesburg and one by one finds each one of them. He is not pleased by most of them, but is happy to see his family again. Then he learns some terrible news about his son, something that could tear his family apart. To find out what happens to Kumalo, and if he brings back his family read this great book.

The book is heart wrenching and I was almost moved to tears several times.

He sets out to find his sister because he has been informed by a messanger that she is very sick and needs Stephen to come there right away. Upon finding her, Kumalo realizes his sister Gertrude is not phisicly sick, but is mentally corrupt, dealing with alcohol and protitution. He then realizes that he has yet an other problem, when he finds that his son, who also lives in Johannesburg, has commited a murder of a white man who defends the native's rights, Aurther Jarvis. Kumalo meets with his son, and finds this acusation to be true. His son is later proven guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Kumalo later confronts Aurther's father, James Jarvis. While Kumalo is deathly afraid that James will now hate him, he finds that Mr. Jarvis is in peace with him and does not blame Kumalo for his son's death. This story shows that to anything, good or bad, a new begining will come."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I had a hard time deciding between three and four stars for this book. It is a classic and deals with a very difficult subject, but the story-line seems scattered at times. Paton was trying to communicate the pain, fear, and anger that punctuated life in South Africa in the 1940s. This sociological topic is difficult for young people to grasp...well, it's difficult for not-so-young people to grasp if they have never experienced it. Thus, I found the book's topic interesting and learned a lot. The main character was complex and well-rounded. The raw emotion was captured. Because of this, I give the book four stars. However, a word of caution: when you read it, be prepared to accept the slow-moving, disconnected story line and just enjoy the characters and the sociological portrayal."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, The Beloved Country is a tremendous work of art. It really, really is. It may not be as \\"good\\" as the somewhat similarly-themed The Power of One...but it is \\"better,\\" if you take my meaning. Deeper, more profound. More illuminating and thought-provoking.Author Alan Paton was a devout Christian and a Kafferboetie--two things which I, emphatically, am not--but his literary ability, dovetailed with a definite time-and-place serendipity, enabled him to fuse those aspects of his persona into a book which transcends identity and politics, and which speaks not only to the Amy Biehls of this world. It touched me, and I think that South Africa, under black rule, is doomed to Zimbabwe's fate.But politics and dogma aside, this book is a gift, not a polemic. It is a cri de coeur, not a political tract. It's a book that espouses a Christian moral ethic which, in the abstract, non-Christians should be receptive to. It is of Paton, but not for Paton. It's for you and I, whether black, white, liberal, conservative, and so forth.Now, one last thing: How in the hell is this book not included on the MLA 100? It is MUCH better--not just as a book, but in terms of the significant issues it raises--than some of the pap stinking up the list. (E.g., Wide Sargasso Sea, On the Road.) It is CLEARLY superior to credible books on the list such as A Bend In The River, and the Studs Lonigan trilogy. Paton was a staunch liberal activist, and his book has as its main character an extremely sympathetic black South African...how did this not appeal to the bien-pensants who composed the list?I don't get it. It should have been included...but it wasn't. Read it anyway, though."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is the second Oprah's Book Club selection that I have read, although, like the first, I read it a few years back before that appellation was added. I was just expecting a sad story and some social commentary. I had no idea of the pathos and bitter irony that Paton would be able to wring from this ostensibly simple tale of fathers and sons. As far as African Literature goes, and I am by no means an expert, I would consider this the best novel that I have read, Achebe withstanding.The story is centered on Reverend Stephen Kumalo, a Black Anglican Minister in a rural South Africal tribal community. He departs to look for his son Absalom quickly in the novel. The first part deals with his search in Johannesburg, which exposes some miserable and excruciating injustices to the native population. He is accompanied by a fellow minister, the Reverend Msimangu, a more liberal but nevertheless devoted preacher. We also meet John Kumalo, a leader for Black rights who has nevertheless become corrupt in his work. As Kumalo looks for his son he is exposed to these conditions for the first time, having never been out of his insular farming community before. Some of his observations are truly shocking.The novel really picks up in the second part, when we discover what has happened of Absalom: he has killed a white man named Jarvis who was an idealist and fought for Black rights fiercely. This is where we meet his more bigoted father, James Jarvis, a rich farm owner who sees his bigotry validated when his son dies at the hands of a man he wanted to help. However, as Jarvis examines his son's writings and how he lived, he begins a powerful movement toward the idealism of his son. This corresponds with Kumalo's crisis over his son being a murderer. The most powerful moment is the brief conversation between Jarvis and Kumalo, which drips of conflict but nevertheless ends in closure and understanding.The novel ends powerfully as well. Jarvis ends up giving a sizable portion of his fortune to help Kumalo's impoverished farmers, Absalom is (inevitably) executed for his offense, and the novel ends with Kumalo contemplating his life on the top of a mountain while the sun goes down, a fascinating juxtaposition of symbolism that wraps up an intriguing novel quite nicely.This novel tackles a plethora of themes, most notably the relationships between fathers and sons, the rift between White and Black, rich and poor, and the proud and the fearful in both mid-twentieth century Africa (which would shortly make Apartheid an official policy) and in all society. It also shows how people will willing to sacrifice many things and live in fear instead of fixing the enormous social problems they face. What results is a devastating little novel about what happens in a post-imperialist society, which is as senseless as is is poignant. This is a book that is often required reading of High School students (it was for me) but it is a first step in understanding what happens in such societies, abroad and here. This book has a ring of bitter truth to it and is unforgettable without being lurid. A must read for anyone who thinks they know what injustice means but has never experienced it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Paton's novel relies heavily on his descriptions of South Africa and the characters of the story to get the reader involved in the simple, yet elegantly crafted story line.

This story is very cleverly weaved in with the story of a White family going through the loss of a son and troubles with their farm. Together they meet and have interesting results. The start of the story is bleek with racial troubles but the latter part of the book shows new hope in our younger generations to come. This is a good book recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I thought that this book was ok. I have read better books. But i dont like reading history type books.

It showed a picture that people not only had ignored, but hadn't even realized was there at all. It brought a spotlight to focus on South Africa that has remained there ever since. The story of one man or of a small group of people has far more effect on people than any number of essays. You, the reader, come to understand and identify with this man and his problems, hopes, and dreams. And once you do, once a large body of people does, then public opinion changes, and then laws can be changed."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton's &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; is a very well-written novel, but you have to take into account that it was also written several decades ago and in an entirely different country.The adventure Paton takes us through in the eyes of Rev. Stephen Kumalo is a very emotional one. While there are times of happiness throughout the story, there are also many times of sorrow, as Kumalo goes through many hardships. But in the end, although it's not the happiest ending possible, it still ends on an uplifting note.As I said, this novel was written by someone from a different country in a different time, so some of the story will seem a bit garbled. One chapter in particular sounded like complete gibberish to me, completely switching the point of view and location.So, will you enjoy this novel?

And I, like many other high school students, would have rather read something completly out of the ordinary or something not so heavy.

I thought the author got sidetracked a lot while Stephen looked for absolom. the way that alan patton went to all of the different cities while he should have been focusing on the original motive of the search. I think that maybe he should have focused a little more on absoloms death. I also found the book to be a little boring at times. Maybe if the author could have told of physical struggles instead of bus boycotts and bad living conditions. I didn't really find the book very interesting. To be honest it was kind of hard to finish it. Even though I am aware that hardships like this really took place, it did not make a very good book.

It showed that good people can have terrible thing after terrible thing happen to them. It also showed no family values. What kind of person lets his entire family leave their hometown for a bum town that lures you in to the point where you can't leave? The book was also hard to follow, even though there was a glossary in the back of the book. However, this book did powerfully convey tragedy which was a plus.

I believe that this book is not very interesting, especially at first, but it teaches good lessons. I agree with the idea that people fear what they do not know, which is one of the main points that Alan Paton tried to get across. Also, sometimes the dialect used in the novel was confusing, but there is a handy glossary in the back(if you're not too lazy to turn to it and look up whatever word you do not understand). Overall this book wasn't too horrible for a class assignment, but if given the choice i would not read it.Emily Canosa"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This was a good novel. Usually in school I read the first couple chapters and if I don't like it I stop reading it, but this book I kept on reading and it was a very good book. It was about black and white racism. It is a deeply moveing story of the land and a people riven by racial injustice. Alan paton was one of South Africa's greatest writers. You should read the book Cry, the Beloved Country."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I liked this book because it showed the comparison between two different families -- a rich, white family and a poor, black family. Both families went through pretty much the same things, in that the parents lost their son. It was somewhat emotional and the details about South Africa were interesting as well."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The story of Kumalo, a Zulu minister who travels to Johanesburg to look for his son, is a highly charged tale of delinquency, race hatred, prostitution, murder and eventual reconciliation in the big city. Some passages resonate with a lyrical, almost magical quality and the prose is deft and extremely supple. However, the plot is bogged down towards the middle of the book by some ill-timed excursions into South African politics and the ending is telegraphed a hundred pages in advance. These sections, I felt, could have been better woven-in into the novel's dramatic fabric. Though it is highly recommended for being the book that whipped up a worldwide whirlwind of awareness of South Africa and the injustices of apartheid, it is a taxing and artistically disappointing work."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This novel by Paton is probably the most important novel in the history of South Africa because it opened the eyes of many in the world about the hardships and the cruelities of South Africa. Without this book South Africa may have not went through the renaissance that it went through in the early 90s. But I gotta admit it is one of the boring novels out there."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The evils of the Apartheid -- the subject of Cry, the Beloved Country -- have mercifully disappeared from South Africa, but Alan Paton's novel still entrances millions of readers. When we'd rather forget the atrocities of that era, Cry still bewitches us more than fifty years after its publication. Why?Indeed, the work, similar to Barbara Kingsolver's the Poisonwood Bible, is a moving testament to the injustice and corruption of 1940's South Africa. The author's devotion to his homeland and the heartache he feels for her plight are eloquently etched on every page. He delineates some of the worst problems in detail, but expresses hope that they will ameliorate with cooperation and the genuine desire for reform.Paton's masterpiece is far more than a protest against social and political issues, however. It is a tenderly evocative character study of three men molded and changed by suffering. A black Zulu priest journeys from his country village to dissolute Johannesburg to track down his profligate sister and son. The conditions in which he finds them and his efforts to save them profoundly affect his attitude about his avocation and prompt him to bring much-needed improvement to his village; the reverend's naive, impressionable son matures and repents of his wrongdoings during his murder trial; and the white father of the murdered man, rather than becoming bitter, is moved to compassion for the black villagers he oversees and brings about the means for the reform that the priest desires.Cry beautifully recounts the separate odysseys of these three intertwined characters with the turmoil of South Africa as a fitting backdrop. Paton's phenomenally lyrical prose and unique narrative techniques are my favorite aspects of the novel, capturing Africa itself in all its graceful simplicity and painful upheaval.This is why Cry still relates to readers so universally and on so many levels. Suffering, redemption, the ability of love to conquer obstacles, the fear and misuse of absolute power in a country torn by unbroken strife...these concepts will always strike a chord with every human being as long as the world keeps turning.This ethereal story will touch you, inspire you, and remain with you for a lifetime. I am proud to rank it among my favorite books. I urge everyone to read it; it's well worth your time. You will fall in love with it as I have. Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is one of the most graceful and thoughtful portrayals of the tension in South Africa I have ever seen. The story is well told and the lush descriptions of the land itself will make you see it clearly in your mind's eye. I cried at the end, for Absalom, for his father, for the country. A must read book!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This beautifully written novel portrays the tale of a priest searching for a son he had lost. At the beginning of the novel, Alan Paton beautifully describes the land of South Africa somewhat the way Steinbeck used vivid description in the novel Grapes of Wrath. This novel deeply speaks the truth of racism and hatred during the time of apartheid. Stephen Kumalo faces many problems on his quest. He encounters many people both black and white. Reminescent of the segregation that had plagued the United States in the early 1900's Kumalo finds that the natives of the land are being exiled into the slums of the city while the white people sit on their thrones. Kumalo discovers, though, that hope exists as he encounters kind-hearted people both white and black. He discovers that the people he once felt he knew have been consumed by the troubles and dangers of the city. Though he begins his quest with a heavy heart, he returns with new hope as the pregnant wife of his son Absalom returns with him. His quest brings him closer to a white man named Jarvis. This relationship brings hope to the cause of the natives as this shows that there is hope that people can one day live together as equals. This book boldly states a problem that is all too common in a world divided. It strongly speaks that until we can treat everybody as equals reguardless of our differences we shall never be free."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton has made a great historical contribution to the people of South Africa. In this gripping novel, Paton exposes the cruelty and injustice taking place in post-war South Africa. He does a superb job of describing the wretched townships of Johannesburg, in which thousands of blacks were confined and forced to live. Also illustrated in the book are a corrupt court system, completely dominated by whites. This book gave me a real understanding of the brutal racism and hatred that was so present at the time of this books first publication, and exists even today. Yet amidst all of the bigotry, the reader is left with the impression that the people of South Africa will inevitably come to accept and respect one another regardless of the color of their skin."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton's novel \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" (1948) somehow escaped me over the years. Paton's novel was already a staple on high school reading lists when I was in school, and I tend to avoid such books. A glance at some of the many reviews here on Amazon suggests that the book continues to be force-fed to students, a situation that discourages appreciative reading. When our book group selected the novel, I became an initially reluctant reader. But I soon realized I had missed a great deal in not reading this book.Set in South Africa in 1948, Paton's novel examines race relations in that troubled country just before the formal institution of apartheid. The primary character is an elderly Zulu minister, Stephen Kumalo who lives and tends to his congregation in a poor farming community which has depleted its soil by poor farming practices on hills. Steven's brother John, his sister Gertrude and his only son Absolom have left the homestead to try to find their ways in Johannesburg. When Steven receives a message that his sister is in desperate straits, he undertakes the lengthy,expensive rail journey to Johannesburg in search of his family. Steven finds each of the three, and the novel tells their stories. The book develops primarily around Absolom who has become a troubled, delinquent young man. Absolom is arrested and tried for the murder of a young white man, Arthur Jarvis. Arthur's father, James, is a wealthy landholder and near-neighbor of Stephen Kumalo. During the trial of Stephen's son, the two men become close. In his life, Arthur had studied closely South Africa's racial situation and had written and spoken out eloquently for change. With his son's death, the novel shows how James, who had been apathetic on the issue at best, came to understand and share the convictions of his son.\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is immeasurably more than a polemic against racism in South Africa. In my belated reading of the book, I tried to think of how the work transcended its time and place to become a convincing work of art. Here are some of my ideas. The writing style of the book in its lyricism, solemnity, repetition, and detail frequently is more akin to poetry than to fictional narrative. The tone of the book is sad and thoughtful much more than it is critical.Paton seems less inclined to blame any party for the origins of racism in South Africa than he is to understand. He explores how racism developed and he examines the fears of all the participants in the system. The aim is not to condemn but to understand, forgive, and change.There are beautiful portrayals of South Africa in all its aspects, from the small native communes and compounds to the mines to the metropolis of Johannesburg. The book celebrates reading and the life of the mind primarily through Arthur Jarvis, whose library and thought Paton explores in depth. Abraham Lincoln receives great and devoted attention in this book, showing the universal appeal of this great American president.More than the portrayal of an unjust social system or the depiction of a complex country, \\"Cry the Beloved Country\\" is a religious work. Few, if any characters in this story are entirely evil. Although shown as a person with flaws and a tendency to hurt others, Stephen Kumalo emerges as a committed Christian minister to his people. When he travels to Johannesburg, he meets several other ministers and church officials who, contrary to much literature, are portrayed selflessly and positively.Several other characters, including a lawyer who defends Stephen's son pro bono (\\"pro deo\\"), and a native landlady are shown as unselfish, well-meaning and noble. The book tells its story of hope, forgiveness, and correction of injustice without derogating.On my reading, I found \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" in large part a religious novel of an unusual and profound spirit in the way it approached its themes. I was drawn by the goodness and sincerity of the characters. The book helps show what religion, Christianity in particular, can be at its best in a troubled time. Forgiveness and not condemnation is the overriding theme of the book. I was grateful to take the opportunity to read Paton's novel at last.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A member of my Book Group had taken a week-long course on Alan Paton's 1948 novel \\"Cry the Beloved Country\\" about South Africa and was able to instruct us in the parallels between it and the Biblical Book of Isaiah, in which can be found a redemptive pattern of destruction-repentance/penance-rebuilding/restoration.The destruction of traditional South African culture and social cohesion, of the tribe, the family, and the individual is represented in the novel through the story of Stephen Kumalo, a Zulu Anglican pastor, whose narrative of loss intersects with that of James Jarvis, a white South African of English descent, whose son is killed by Kumalo's son in an attempted burglary.Both fathers, as well as other characters, undergo their own repentance and penance before achieving a renewal of hope through the rebuilding of family and the restoration of the valley in which both the Kumalo and Jarvis families live.This intertextual relationship between Cry the Beloved Country and Isaiah is convincing and entirely appropriate for the white author and Christian protagonist of the novel. However, it also illustrates how the novel itself, by framing the story in terms of Western religion and Biblical traditions, serves to perpetuate the colonial culture which has caused the destruction of native South Africa in the first place.Another example of intertextuality can be found in the repeated references to Abraham Lincoln, a hero to the young Arthur Jarvis, who has devoted his life to undoing the injustice that his white ancestors have done to the native land and its people before, ironically, he is killed by one of those native people.Lincoln also, especially in his Second Inaugural Address, invokes the Bible as he frames the American Civil War in redemptive terms. War is the penance that must be suffered before the destruction that slavery has done to African people in North America can be redeemed. Repentance and forgiveness are also necessary before the nation can be rebuilt and restored. Thus Lincoln refrains from attacking the South or the Confederacy (\\"With malice toward none, with Charity for all...\\"), but looks forward with renewed hope to \\"a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\\"This parallel of American slavery with South African apartheid similarly frames colonial injustice in Western terms from a white perspective, as does the Biblical parallel of Isaiah. Perhaps no more could be expected from a white author on this subject.One wonders, though, if it is the repentant white perspective that contributes to a novel in which there are no villains except the generalized colonial history and social system of apartheid (\\"With malice toward none, with Charity for all...\\"). Would a black African author have been so generous? Would blame and even malice from such an author be misplaced?As the young black pastor Msimangu states, \\"I have one great fear in my heart, that one day when they are turned to loving, they will find we are turned to hating.\\" Would a hateful attack on white colonists or on white America be justified by the tragic history of black South Africans and African Americans?Is the redemption narrative a luxury of wish-fulfillment for the guilty or is it a universal human story of forgiveness and renewal? Or both?"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton raised the issue of emancipation, from fear, as the last line in this seminal work. Paton was a member of Africa's \\"white tribe,\\" the dominant one at the time, and this was his cri de coeur. He wrote it just before the Afrikaner sub-tribe would become ascendant, in 1948, and construct a formalize system, Apartheid, to maintain Blacks \\"in their place.\\" The system had much more in common, than not, with segregation, particularly in the American South, as well as what has evolved in Israel today. In the latter case, the parallels with the \\"Bantustans\\" are particularly strong.In general, Paton's characters are not subtle or nuanced. They serve more as prototypes for certain sub-sets of the South African population. Stephen Kumalo is a black preacher, from a rural setting, with simplistic good faith, fearful of \\"mammon\\", which resides in \\"Jo'burg.\\" The action commences when he receives a letter from a fellow \\"man of the cloth,\\" a priest called Msimangu, who resides there. The priest asks Kumalo to come, and address the needs of Kumalo's sister, Gertrude. It is revealed that she has sunk into the underworld of prostitution and drugs. The central dramatic theme, however, involves Kumalo's son, Absalom. In a botched robbery, he has murdered a white liberal activist, Arthur Jarvis. As Arthur's father, a conservative who was previously somewhat estranged from his son, examines his legacy, he chooses reconciliation, by accepting the mantle of his son's work. Paton's own outlook was deeply religious, so this work is replete with biblical analogies, as is evident by the name of Kumalo's son. The denouement seems inevitable, and it seems to forsake hope, an ending I projected on all of South Africa.I first read this book more than 40 years ago. Any book that inspires a journey deserves 5-stars, and this was the motive force behind three visits to South Africa in the early 80's. Each time I had a camper (a combie, as they say there), and freely traveled throughout the country, during the very height of the Apartheid system. It is a country of stunning natural beauty; in fact, the tourism slogan of the time proclaimed: \\"The whole world in one country.\\" Indeed, I thought that applied, certainly not in the sense intended, on a global economic scale. The country had a minority of largely white individuals who believed they had a claim on the country's resources that far exceeded the rights of the majority of largely non-whites.Like Paton, I was pessimistic for the future prospects of South Africa. The one country, also on the African continent, that it seemed most to resemble, in terms of the percent and claims of a white minority vis-&agrave;-vis the larger, native population, was Algeria. The end of white rule in Algeria occurred at the end of seven bloody years of war. So, I felt that past would be prologue, as the expression has it. Fortunately the wisdom of a few individuals in leadership positions, particularly Nelson Mandela, averted a repeat of that tragedy.Paton, who died in 1988, did not live to see the largely peaceful end of the Apartheid system in 1994. Black majority rule is now the political system. The problems of economic distribution largely remain however. Two other South Africans have won the Nobel Prize for Literature, both whites, Doris Lessing and J.M. Coetzee. Paton did not, but it is on his proverbial shoulders upon which they stood.South Africa is an intensely beautiful country, whose dramas have been more visceral than most. This is the classic book that spelled out the South African dilemma."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Stephen Kumalo, a black Anglican priest from a rural Natal village, travels to Johannesburg to search for his for his son Absalom, with whom he has lost touch, and his younger sister Gertrude, who has fallen ill. Upon arrival, Kumalo discovers that Gertrude has become an alcoholic prostitute involved in the clandestine liquor trade. The news about Absalom is even worse; the young man has fallen into a life of crime and has been arrested for the murder of a white man during a burglary.\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is sometimes described as an indictment of apartheid-era South Africa, but in fact it was written in 1946, two years before the election of Daniel Malan's Nationalist government which introduced the apartheid system. The word \\"apartheid\\" has now passed into English as a synonym for racist discrimination, but it was originally an Afrikaans word meaning \\"separateness\\", and was used to describe the Nationalists' grand scheme for \\"separate development\\" of the various races of South Africa. As the book makes clear, however, racial discrimination and injustice already existed under the pre-1948 United Party government of Jan Smuts; indeed, some of what were later to become the most hated features of apartheid, such as the pass laws, were already in force. It is this injustice which is the theme of Alan Paton's novel.South Africa was originally an agrarian society, and remained one long after the start of European colonisation in the seventeenth century; for many years the Afrikaners were known to the English as \\"Boers\\", a word which literally means \\"Farmers\\". By the twentieth century, however, the discovery of the country's mineral wealth led to a South African industrial revolution, and South African industry was dependent on cheap black labour. (It was this dependency which meant that the idea of \\"separate development\\" was doomed to failure from the start, as the last thing white employers wanted was to be deprived of this labour source).Paton describes how an unequal distribution of agricultural land between black and white landowners made it impossible for many blacks to continue farming the land and forced many young black men, of whom Absalom Kumalo is one, to move to the cities, especially Johannesburg, to work in white-owned mines and factories for low wages. This weakened the traditional tribal way of life of South African blacks, especially as the pass laws meant that these men could not bring their wives and families with them. Under these conditions, drunkenness, prostitution and crime flourished in the black townships, and growing white fears of black crime led to the introduction of yet more repressive measures of social control. The title is taken from a passage in which Paton articulates his fears for the future of his country:-\\"Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or a valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much\\".As will be clear from this passage, Paton's prose style is a highly poetic one, much influenced by Shakespeare and the King James Bible. Biblical influences can also be seen in the names he gives to his characters; Absalom is named after the son of King David, who rebelled against his father, and Kumalo's own forename may be derived from Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr. Another influence may have been Paton's American contemporary John Steinbeck, who also combined a crusading social conscience with a lyrical prose style. Paton's opening passage, dealing with soil erosion in Natal, is reminiscent, in its tone as will as in its subject matter, with the equivalent opening passage in Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" dealing with soil erosion in the American Mid-West.The Biblical influences in the novel are far from accidental; Paton was a devout Christian and saw Christian principles as being the only hope for his country. One of the most important characters in the novel is Arthur Jarvis, the man murdered by Absalom. Although Arthur does not appear directly, we learn a lot about him. He was an engineer by profession, a committed Christian and a liberal activist for racial justice, and can be seen as a mouthpiece for Paton's own views. After Arthur's death Kumalo befriends his father James Jarvis, a wealthy and hitherto conservative white landowner, and James decides to take up his son's work on behalf of South Africa's black population. The two older men realise that they both stand in need of forgiveness, Kumalo for the murder committed by his son, Jarvis for the wrongs committed by his people against their black neighbours.\\"Cry, The Beloved Country\\" is a novel which combines beauty of language with elevated moral ideals, with well-drawn characters and a positive message about the need to combat injustice. Its status as a modern classic is well deserved. To adapt a phrase of Paton's, it is a book lovely beyond any singing of it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A sad social drama in the migrant workers milieu of Johannesburg, South Africa, during the post- war and pre- apartheid years of the 1940s.Young men leave their tribal areas to find work and hopes for a better life near the big city in the gold mines, where the money is. For most of them, the move means life in a shanty town, backbreaking work and minimal payment, disease and misery, broken families, prostitution and alcoholism, crime and punishment. The money is for the white men.It is fear that rules this country. (And maybe the saddest thought is that crime is still the main fear in the country even now, after the race issue has largely gone away.)The story is told in simple language, starkly realistic at times, or touchingly poetic at others, like Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, which it resembles in its language, narrative structure and sad humor. There is also the thematic similarity of the erosion which destroys soils and drives people to miserable places.We follow a parson from a tribal village on a trip to Jo-burg, where he searches for his son. The search is elusive for a time. It is an odyssey through the social reality of the city: the church, the black politicians of different colors, a bus boycott, the shanty towns, a reformatory, the hopelessness of a teen pregnancy, the penal system.We listen in on white conversations about what to do with the blacks and their unruly and disturbing behavior.The second part of the novel follows the father of a murdered white man. The victim was a fighter for reason and fairness, and he got killed by blind stupid fate. The father gets to know his son through tales about him, through his papers on his desk, through his library. There was a strong fixation on Lincoln. The old man begins to search for his son, like the other father in the first part, but now in the spiritual and intellectual sense.We learn more on the mining industry, on unions and strikes.This was Paton's first novel, and it was a huge success, enabling him to stop working as a reformatory manager in order to become a professional writer. But then he chose to walk on yet another path: he became a politician with the Liberal Party, opposing the politics of the apartheid regime. He is mentioned in Mandela's memoirs among the men who tried to fight his prison term.Does this mean that the novel is propaganda? I would say: emphatically no. It does not take any side but the one of humanity and morality. It does not preach or indoctrinate, nor try to convince us of a political program.This is a book about fear and sorrow. Fear is like a storm. Sorrow is when the storm has destroyed the house. One can do nothing about the storm, but one can rebuild the house. Sorrow is better than fear.Thanks to Judy P., who convinced me that I need to read this. It is really one of the great novels of the century."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry Beloved Country is a beautiful , lyrical book. Paton has an interesting writting style which adds to the poetry of the novel.Stephen Kumalo, a Angelican priest of Zulu ethnicity is the parson of a native African congregation. He lives in the countryside which is suffering from drought and erosion of the soil. He journeys to the city to seek his sister and his son. Kumalo is a good man. There is a tragedy ,but also inspirational actions. There is nothing sugary sweet about this story.The ending is upbeat and demonstrates the goodness of people."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The writing is trully amazing. I have never read such a lyrical book. There are sections of it which feel like they could to be sung. There is wonderful poetic rhythm to the language.And then of course there is the actual story ... which is also beautiful and tragic. The drama is very intense. Don't let the difficult to pronounce names put you off. This is worth reading numerous times."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Reverend Stephen Kumalo is a minister in Natal whose sister, Gertrude, and his son, Absalom, have gone to the South African metropolis of Johannesburg to search for a better living. Receiving a letter saying that Gertrude is ill, he travels there to discover that her sickness is a spiritual one: she has become a prostitute. After meeting up with the pastor, Msimangu, he finds that Gertrude is willing to come back to the village with him, taking her son along. Sadly, he finds that Absalom and his brother's son have been accused of killing a man, a white layman of the church and a great activist for native freedom, in a break-in. The father of the accused, Jarvis, meets Kumalo and comes to reconcile. A priest hires a white lawyer for Absalom. He confesses, however, and is sentenced to be hanged, while Kumalo's nephew is declared innocent. All hope seems lost. Defeated, Kumalo decides to return to his village of Ndotsheni. He takes along his son's wife, wed to Absalom in prison, and nephew. Gertrude, however, is nowhere in sight. Returning to Ndotsheni, Kumalo finds a month-long drought is starving the people. Jarvis's grandson is the one who sets up a system, sends an agricultural demonstrator to teach the people farming, and builds a dam to bring water to the village. Jarvis helps reconstruct the church and restore the village, bringing peace and reconciling Kumalo with life.\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is a story of the quest for justice, the search for freedom in an impoverished and oppressive land. Love and forgiveness are themes prevalent to ending the human struggle. One must overcome whatever trials and injustices have been dealt to move on and live. It is in making peace that these two men join to support each other in grief and save a community.It is beautifully written, in descriptive language, even with Zulu words and the pronunciations in their native tongue. One certainly feels a connection with the trials of Kumalo and his people, because they are about the basic human rights that are struggled for univerally. There is a well-established bond and a deep love for South Africa in Paton's writing that show just how strongly he feels about the reality of the injustice suffered there. It is a work that will outlast us all and continually remind people to strive for freedom. This is a book not simply to read, but truly to be experienced."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is a very moving novel about a black man's country under white man's law. Anyone who is interested in race relations, history, or the African language will enjoy this book like I did. This is an insightful book in which I learned a lot about South Africa. I learned that Johannesburg was the center of the gold mine industry. Many people left their small tribal villages to work there in 1946 which is the year this novel is set in.The basic premise of Cry, The Beloved Country is about a young black man who is accused of and found guilty of murdering a white man. The author does a great job of making the reader care about both the victim and the accused.The author Alan Paton does a great job of describing the character of the victim Arthur Jarvis as a very caring person who was well respected by people of all races. Arthur Jarvis was concerned with the social problems facing South Africa in 1946 like racial crime, the lack of education of African youth, and the conditions of the gold mines, and the welfare of the workers who labored there.Alan Paton does an equally excellent job describing the accused person. Absalom Kumalo is the son of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo who goes in search for his son in the first section of the book. The cause of Absalom's crime according to the author is a breakdown of tribal values and family bonds like working together to achieve a common goal and a sense of belonging to a group. The Western emphasis on focusing on the individual influenced the way of thinking in South Africa that led to this breakdown.I really enjoyed how the fathers of both sons became friends in this book. The white father James Jarvis actually helped Stephen Kumalo The elder Jarvis supplied Stephen Kumalo with milk to nourish the sick children of his village. Jarvis also provided Stephen Kumalo with a person to teach his people how to farm to grow more food.I appreciated the list of words at the end of the book, because some of the African words were hard to pronounce. I love finding out the meaning of new words even if they are in a foreign languages. Cry, the Beloved Country is a beautifully written book about South Africa with strong themes and memorable characters. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"\\"Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply.

For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.\\" This is an excerpt from the book Cry, the Beloved Country, which is about the story of a Zulu pastor named Stephen Kumalo and his son Absalom in the troubled times of South Africa in the 1940's.A trend has been made in the small village of Ndotsheni, Natal that the youth migrate to the cities where they see more of an economic chance, for there is industry in big cities. They do not realize the dangers and crime which also lie in wait in the big city. Kumalo's brother, sister, and son all have journeyed to the \\"white man's town\\" of Johannesburg in search of a better life, only to be seized by the foul hand of impoverishment and discrimination.This being said, the tale is about Kumalo and his search for his son in the mazy streets of Johannesburg. Along the way Kumalo faces many trials and travails, including robbery, adultery, deceit, and miles upon endless miles of walking. This is the base of the direct plot, but there also is an underlying plot of love intertwined within this story. There lie messages of loss, guilt, and murder in this story. But through everything else, the most prominent message this book states is the love one man has for his people and most of all, his country.This book relays a message of unfailing love for human society sans racial barriers. I found it very interesting, although it was a bit tricky to read, as it was written without quotations and indications of who said what. Once you adjusted, it was a marvelous tale about the historic times of South African injustice, inequality, and Christianity of the mid-1900's."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The extraordinary beauty of Paton's best-known novel--the first of many works set in his native South Africa--is not its lyrical prose, its biblical allusions, or its evocative descriptions of Natal and Johannesburg. While all of these elements are striking and original, what truly lends the work its power are the moral questions the author leaves unanswered. Refusing to assign blame and casting an empathetic look both at the ruling white class and at impoverished blacks, Paton offers a far more devastating condemnation of apartheid than if he had written a book with clear-cut villains and saviors. The author's abhorrence of what became of South African society never threatens to overwhelm his love for his homeland.The novel's two protagonists are Stephen Kumalo, a black pastor in the countryside, and James Jarvis, a wealthy white man. Both men are remote from their sons; Absalom left his rural home to seek a new life in Johannesburg, where Arthur Jarvis fights for racial justice--much to the chagrin of his conservative father. Chance and circumstance throw these two young men into a fatal confrontation, and their fathers struggle to make something from what little remains of their sons' lives.Paton acknowledged that he began this novel shortly after reading Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"--and the influence is obvious and deliberate. Published as protest novels, both works revealed to an international readership the squalid lives of migrant workers and of the African underclass, respectively. Not coincidentally, both novels are also heavily indebted to the Book of Job. Overall, I think Paton's book improves on its illustrious counterpart; remaining faithful to the traditions of American naturalism, Paton's prose strips away Steinbeck's occasionally excessive verbiage to a leaner, meaner singsong prose."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is one of the most incredible I have ever read. Many people rave about its depiction of apartheid and racism in South Africa, but it's so much more than that. This novel is a beautifully told story of one man's struggle against fate and a system set against him, of human compassion, and of renewal on a multitude of levels- the renewal of the physical earth, the lives of the people of Ndotsheni, and Kumalo's soul. The frailty and confusion felt by Kumalo, the anger at society of the young white social worker, the fear of young Kumalo, and the passion of Msimangu are all set beautifully against a vivid depiction of a racially divided South Africa in which the Africans themselves have no hope. Paton's style is perfect. His characters on occasion are a bit simple, but they are so vividly described that it seems that if there is a problem, it lies with you the reader! The settings are beautiful, and Paton's love of South Africa and thirst for equality run throughout the novel. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Many friends recommended CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY to me over the years, but it was not until May of this year that the book came my way in the form a gift. I picked it up one evening and--much to my own amazement--read it in a single sitting. Yes, it really is that good.Published in 1948, the book tells a simple story. Zulu-born Stephen Kumalo is the elderly Christian priest of a tiny church who has seldom set foot outside his rural South Africa village; he is both uncertain and frightened when he summoned to Johannesburg to attend his sister, who is in great crisis. Once in the city, however, he determines to locate his son Absalom, who also lives in Johannesburg and from whom he has received no news for quite some time. Kumalo conducts his search with a mounting sense of despair--and ultimately finds himself in the midst of both personal tragedy and public scandal.Although the story is grim, the novel itself is not. Alan Payton (1903-1988) wrote several novels, but CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY is best-known and most widely read work, and much of its power rests on the remarkable way in which he styles his prose: it possesses a shining simplicity that not only seems to capture the vocal cadence of South Africa but also allows the reader to see through the novel's several levels with a remarkable sense of clarity.Much of the novel's power resides in its portrait of South Africa in this particular era. The word \\"apartheid\\" had not attained its full implication in 1948, but Paton not only identifies the almost accidental seeds of apartheid, he forecasts the ultimate result as well. Paton also endows the novel with a very clear idea of what Christianity should be in actual practice as opposed to what it too often is in actual fact, and although the story is indeed dark, the humanity involved is such that one never feels the darkness cannot be dispelled.The older I become, the less inclined I am to keep books; these days I read them and give them away, and new permanent additions to my library are rare. But CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY is a keeper, a book I've no doubt I'll return to again and again.GFT, Amazon ReviewerWith Thanks to Kate, Whose Gift This Book Was"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"It is too simple to simply report this as a book about apartheid. The novel depicts human nature beautifully--the fact that the story line is about South Africa is just a prop to describe how and why people acts as they do. So much of this story applies today and in so many settings=--and in our own backyards.This is a remarkable novel and while I don't see it on too many lists of the greatest 100 novels--it belongs there.Unconditionally recommended for the thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is an authentic expression of hope in a bleak climate of despair. The characters are human. Their experiences are sheer misery, and their responses are not particularly heroic. Through it all, the reader is sustained by the vision of a redemptive truth at work in one of the deepest hells of the present century.Alan Paton unquestionably attributes this truth to a personal God. At the same time, Paton believes that his God expressed Himself in the lives of weak and selfish creatures like ourselves. Thus, even if the reader prefers to maintain a humanist stance, Cry, the Beloved Country will resonate as its characters grapple with the primal struggles of all humanity.Cry, the beloved century.

As a college student, I have read this book 5 times and written papers on it for English, History, and Sociology classes. (I got A's on all of them!) I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great literature and a great story. The 1995 movie with James Earl Jones was superbly done and was the first of the three versions made to be filmed in South Africa.

Even though it is a fairly old book, its themes have remained important in South Africa today. As this country struggles with a post-Apartheid past and current racial divides, this book remains important. It tells the story of a black priest and his involvement in the trial of a young black man and a powerful white landowner. Even though the trial has a sad outcome, the priest and the white man learn to forgive and accept differences so it isn't all in vain. A must-read for anyone interested in this great country and its current or past issues."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is a powerful book. The theme is universal. If the names were changed it could have been about native americans or any oppressed peoples. In parts of it I felt a \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" type quality. People go to the city with hope looking for a better life. There they loose their hope and turn to vices and crime. They disappear into the woodwork not making contact with their former lives - almost like a loss of innocence.The only problem I had with the book was that the progress and improvement experienced in the valley occured because of a tragic murder. I almost got the feeling as I was reading that it was a good thing this man was killed. That bothered me. I am sure that is not what the author had in mind. Otherwise, it is a very worthwhile book to read - especially the first two books."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Excellent book about a black man accused of killing a white man in South Africa, during the time of apartheid.Paton's writing works on many levels, and the plot is not a simple one, but the portrait he paints of the time period in South Africa is a powerful one, and I believe that the book deserves the recognition it is finally getting as a result of Oprah's Book Club. I normally shy away from her selections, but as soon as she switched to the classics, I've been impressed with her choices of material.This is a book not to be missed--and I am glad that I discovered it after all of these years."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"It is great to see a classic like this back in print. Although South Africa is now a free country, it does us no harm to be reminded of what it used to be like and this book does that famously.

An absolutely wonderful book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry the beloved Country, By Alan Paton, is a beautifullly written story of the conflict in South Africa in the 20th century. Its the story of a Zulu priest named Stephen Kumalo, who leaves his village to go and return his sister from the city. Yet, when he gets there, nothing is the way that he imagined it. The story is completely descriptive, and told so that you completely emphathize with Kumalo, and the problems that he is going through. You see his anguish at the fates of his son and his sister, the sadness and growing awareness that his country is being torn apart, and the knowledge that he is almost powerless against it. You see it from the other side as well, the side of James Jarvis, the father of the man that Kumalo's son murdered. You see him comes to terms with his sons death, and his changing views on the plight of his country. YOu watch his help Kumalo. In all, although slightly saddening, the story is moving and beautiful, and totally worth reading. If not for the value of the story alone, but for everything that it pertains to. Cry the Beloved country is wonderful."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I read this book four years ago and it still comes up in my conversation on a regular basis. I have read few other books so moving. You can feel what the characters are feeling--as individuals and as members of their larger culture. Nothing but thumbs up."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is my all time favorite book. It dives deep into the African experience using the life of a minister. From the beginning paragraph when Paton gives his description of the land of Africa I was hooked. This book touched my heart and inner emotions, and yet was entertaining. When and if you do read this work take it slow and envelop the inner meaning. It will definetly stop you and make you think. Give it a try!!!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is by far my least favorite Oprah Book Club Book. I don't know if it was the style of writing or the language barrier but I had the hardest time focusing on the story line. I would notice I had read 10 pages but had no idea what had happened. It was very slow moving and I just could not get into it. A few people wrote that they felt the book was boring and maybe that was my problem too."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country was written in 1948 from the author's love and sadness for his native country, South Africa. Even though things have changed radically in the intervening 60-some years, it is still a story that resonates with love of one's home, wherever it might be on the planet, and despair for injustice, which the planet still knows too much of. A lovely, lovely book -- or, to paraphrase the author, more lovely than any singing of it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Had to read it for AP English high school, very glad I did.

We are travelling to South Africa next year and this book gives an excellent view of the times."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I can't believe I'd never heard of this book before I received the list of books my church ladies book group was going to cover this year. I could not put this book down. It is the story of two elderly South African men, one black and one white, who had never met until the lives of their only sons tragically intersect. The two men find, not only that their sons were not the sons of their youth but vastly different, indeed their fathers truly had no idea what kind of men they had become.As they try to come to know and understand the men their sons had become, two fathers learn and grow, themselves becoming new men in the process.I highly recommend this book - I only wish I'd known about it sooner!Oh, and I'm so glad that I did not know it was an Oprah's book club pick because, sad but true, that would have turned me off of it before I even opened the cover!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"BOTH THE PRICE AND THE CONDITION OF BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD !!THANK YOU ~"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This reading is exceptional.

After listening to this, I bought everyone in my family a copy of the book for Christmas."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I cried and I smiled at the same time. The story is very well written and tells a story about a wonderfully gentle man who does his best to help everyone he meets. Without telling too much of the story, he goes from a small village in the midst of incredible change and goes to the large city in search of two members of his family. Several situations arise, not always with a happy ending, but he faces them with sincerity, compassion, and a commitment that is inspiring. I took from this story the lesson that the worst situation that a person might ever have to deal with in their life that love can shine through and prove that there is a powerful goodness in man that is only waiting to be discovered and revealed."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is amazing. It is by far the best book I have ever read. The story is heart-warming. I could not put it down. The characters come alive on the pages. Alan Paton handles a sensitive situation with compassion.

It no longer became a chore for me to sit at home and read this book. I thought it was brilliant. This story takes you back into the segregation between the whites and blacks - the aparthied. It's completely unforgettable and very moving. And just by reading this book, you get a feel of what it was like for a poor, black family. People can disagree soley based on the author's lack of quotation marks, but you have to bear in mind that this story was translated, and somethings aren't going to sound like formal english."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book takes you into the heart of South Africa. You see the different perspectives of all those living through some of the same situations. You see the main characters vision of South Africa through the church. You see how poverty can change ones outlook on life in general. Poverty will make one make decisions that they wouldn't normally make. You see how a tragedy can bring neighbors together during a tough time. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to see South Africa through the eyes of South Africa."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry,The Beloved Country is a very descriptive book about Steven Kumalos family being torn apart.Steven Kumalos sister gets sick due to a life of prostitution. He had to use all his money to go and visit her while she was sick. I thought that the book was not very entertaining. Nothing exciting happens. Some parts of the book are descriptive and give good details. The story line is good, Steven is a priest who does not have very much money, but is willing to sacrifice what he has for his sister. Even though his sister has become a prostitute and ruined her life, he still loves her. Before receiving the letter that told him about his sister being sick, he did not even know where his sister was, he had not heard from her for years. It turns out that she was only a few towns away. The story takes place in South Africa during the years while apharteid was present. It shows some of the ways blacks were suppresed during those years. Steven and his family were very effected by apharteid. They stugled through many things. Even though they went through so much they got through it all because they were a very strong family. Even though i thought the book was boring, it did have some good points in it. Like how much you need your family in hard times and how you should stick together with your family no matter what. I personally would not read this book again, but its up to you to decide if you want to."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The author needs to learn to use quotations. The reader has a really hard time understanding who says what. This whole book has grammar problems and there are many irrelevant conversations. Because of this book, I no longer trust Oprah's recommendations. I made it half way through the book and couldn't take it anymore."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I was initially intrigued to read a South African historical fiction novel. However, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I frequently cringed when I read through functional dialogue, poorly written detail of scenarios, and rudimentary story structure. I couldn't believe that someone who held high ranking in a country actually published a book that was so bland. The dialogue, I must emphasize, is so bad that it's hilarious.I read about halfway through the novel and HAD to put it down. There was no way I could possibly waste my time reading something that made me think that anyone could get published. And an Oprah book? Did she even open it to read or did she just read the back cover?"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I had to read Cry, the Beloved Country for school, and I have to say, I would definetly not have read it if I had a choice. My two main problems with this book were that I really felt no compassion for the main character, Kumalu and the story was uninteresting. Kumalu is an Anglican parson living in South Africa who travels from his sheltered, obscure, little valley to Johannesburg to find members of his family with whom he has lost contact. When he gets there, he basically finds that everybody in the big city is corrupt, especially his son. I found Kumalu to be naive and unappealing. When he is looking for his son the story gets a bit more interesting. But, he has to go to so many different places to find the son's home, and he doesn't even find the son! Couldn't the author just have cut to the chase and sent him to two or three places? Another thing I disliked about this book was that all of the pious people that worked at the mission where Kumalu stayed in the city kept getting mad when people laughed or talked \\"idly.\\" It just got annyoing after Kumalu's sister was scolded three or four times for doing this. I don't think this book was poetically written, it was just slow moving and described the valley for about ten pages. In short, I would not recommend this dull and unmoving book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"i didn't like it, it was very boring and slow."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Wonderful. Heartbreaking. Tearjerking. Powerful. Breathtaking. Inspiring.These are all words that do not come to mind when thinking about Cry, the Beloved Country.

Now, I'm not saying that it was a horrible book because it wasn't. I can honestly say it was one of the better books I've read for school. (I really, really hate it when we have to read those old, English classics.) But it wasn't what I expected it to be at all. I was expecting a brilliant piece of work about racial and prejudice problems of South Africa, but I found those things to be a sidenote of this novel. It was mostly about a quiet, humble pastor looking for his family. While it was touching that he did eventually find all of his family, I thought there should have been more to the story. More about the friction between the different races that inhabited South Africa. Then it turned into a To Kill a Mockingbird type thing, with the trial and everything. While I found the writing to be good, I thought it was kind of boring. And there must have been some translation problems because somethings just didn't make sense.

For the majority of this book, Stephen Kumalo merely whines and moans about his misfortunes and while providing a true insight on the suffering of Africans, proves to be frustrating to an avid reader. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand and appreciate the messages conveyed by Paton, yet his style of writing tries my patience. Furthermore, his abandonment of quotation marks is an annoyance.

In addition, I am extremely interested in South Africa and apartheid in general. I was disappointed by this book and forced myself to finish it. I felt the characters were just shells of people who were difficult to envision and impossible to identify with. The reader is never let inside the heads of any of the characters.

But does this distract from the story, or give it the flavor of the the country and peoples of South Africa? I cried several times during this story both in feeling the pain of a son convicted of murder, and in the joy of hope. As a middle age woman, the wisdom conveyed through advice both to and from the priest spoke so clearly to the youthful rebellion our generation played out in the 1960s.

For a recent and accessible novel set in South Africa against the backdrop of the apartheid and post-apartheid era, try Lynette Brasfield's wry, poignant novel, NATURE LESSONS, which is told from the point of view of a white woman growing up with her paranoid mother in a paranoid society. And of course the books of Nadine Gordimer and Doris Lessing are essential if you're interested in this part of the world--though Paton's book remains the South African equivalent of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is a wonderful book!

His sister Gertrude, his brother John and his son Absalom have all gone to live to Johannesburg. One day The reverend receives a letter from Theophilus Msimangu urging him to come to Johannesburg because Gertrude is very sick.And so begins Stephen's long descent from the mountains to the capital which almost resembles a descent into Hell. Indeed, he is to discover that Gertrude is a prostitute and liquor seller who doesn't care about her young daughter, that John is a politician fighting against the white leadership and that Absalom has murdered a white man.Mr Paton admirably portrays all the contradictions which the people of South Africa endured in the 1950s. And he does so through the eyes of a forlorn old man who tries to make sense of the way the members of his family behave. The author's humanity, compassion, generosity and wisdom are apparent in every sentence he writes and his novel shows with sensitivity the complex social and racial issues in a country where so many had to suffer for so long."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I read this book for an English class and was hesitant about reading it. Right from the start Paton hooks the reader in by using descriptive language and imagery. Paton really makes you feel for Umfundisi, his family, and especially his son. Umfundisi is a pastor at a church in, small town, Ixopo. His brothers' family, his own son, and his sister have gone to Johannesburg, a big city falling into the despair from crime and hatred. Umfundisi gets word that his sister is ill and must travel there to get her. Both his trip there and his experiences and hardships once in the city strengthen him and his faith in people and God. Although he is there in Johannesburg to retrieve his sister, he ends up contacting his brother whose son has gotten into trouble with Umfundisis' son. Once he has found his sister, he travels all around Johannesburg and surrounding towns to find his son. Even though only a small amount of time passes in Johannesburg, Umfundisi ages immensely form the trials he encounters. Once home he has a new person to raise and realizes that his small town is there for him no matter what happened in Johannesburg. The members of his church rejoiced when he got home telling him that no other pastor is quite like there own. I recommend this book to people who need to strengthen their faith in others and in themselves. If you want a book that will make you cry at one point but at the end makes your heart fell good this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Whether you've read this book before or not, listening to this reading is well worth your time.

Believe me, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A beautifully written exploration of racial divisions that transports the reader into 1946 South Africa through Paton's vivid descriptions of place and people. Originally written around 1948, it's themes of race, family, injustice, and political division ring as true today throughout our world as they did then. Though this story is set in South Africa, there are people in every country who can find relevance in the issues raised in Cry, The Beloved Country because bigotry continues to find a home in the hearts of many. There are still many in our world who are being treated unjustly due to their skin color, their political beliefs, their religion or lack thereof, or nationality. Reading this books touches the heart and makes one long for a world where our differences no longer divide us but become a way for us to enrich one another's lives."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The Reverend Kumalo is at the center of a social experiment that has destroyed tribes, families, societal values and human beings. He is a poverty-stricken minister, caring for his flock of villagers living in a drought-stricken area of South Africa. The drought and its devastating effects on the capacity of the already-poor to farm and provide for their families seems to be a metaphor for the human drought born of racism and emerging apartheid.The land will no longer feed them, the young flock to already-teeming Johannesburg and they then get swallowed up in the further degradation of thievery, murder and prostitution. And the majority Afrikkaners then satisfy themselves with the proof positive that blacks are inherently weak, untrustworthy, lazy and are beneath dignity.This novel both paints a devastating picture of everything that's wrong with racism and the ensuing apartheid while holding out hope that there are some among the white who see the problem as clearly as Reverend Kumalo and strive to do something about it. Unfortunately, however, those who advocate for the despised sometimes get destroyed in the process.And that is exactly what happens to one idealistic young man, the son of a wealthy Afrikkaner landowner, who writes extensively and publicly advocates for those who have no power. But the young man is not destroyed by one of his own, who fears a change in the power balance, but by one of those for whom he advocates.Each father mourns the loss of his son; the father of the murdered knows the white man's justice will prevail but will still leave him childless and the black man's father knows he has lost a son on two counts. One, he lost his son when Absalom left the village and broke all communication with his heartbroken parents. Two, for a black man who killed a white man, there is only the white man's justice.Reverend Kumalo meets the good, the bad, the indifferent, the greedy and the generous. His dialogue is that of a humble man, loved by his townspeople, deeply respectful of others. While his demeanor is very self-deprecating, he cannot be mistaken for one who is servile. Reverend Kumalo's deep understanding of human beings, with all their inherent imperfections and machinations, is awesome. Despite this, he forgives.Thankfully, despite his great personal losses, Reverend Kumalo witnesses a number of small miracles thanks to an unexpected source. His benefactor, and that of the village's, is the father of the young man who was murdered.This is an eloquent book written by one who truly understood the evil and great destructive powers of any system that strips a people, any people, of their basic and fundamental rights to berespected, independent and self governing."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I read this book in 1974 as part of my high school Advanced English course growing up in India and was moved by the author's ability to elicit strong emotions while painting a clear picture of the immorality of apartheid in South Africa. I am glad to see it finally on a recommended reading list in America."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"If there were more stars with which I could rate this book, I would use them all. I have read this book many times, and would like to share my thoughts on one of the most beautiful books in the history of literature and in the English language. It is a story about friendship, humanity, being hurt and being free; it is a story about kindness, forgiveness, sacrifice and perserverence. But most of all, it is a story about a love so amazing that it must die so that the seed which falls can grow again. Although the evil of Apartheid has been finally abolished by justice and righteousness, the lesson that it has taught us must never be forgotten. And Paton's unique diamond of a masterpiece will continue to speak resoundingly to the future about a painful history of mankind that spelt deep tragedy but great poetry and human triumph as well. I cannot begin to extol the beauty of this novel - so profoundly rich in Christian virtues, so poignantly told. If you wish to hear the African grass sing its morning song, to hear a land of blood and tears beat her heart, and to marvel at the integrity which is man - read this wonderful book. It will change your life."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"\\"What are master-pieces and why are there so few of them?\\" was Gertrude Stein's rhetorical question. Gertrude would have found plenty to criticize about Cry, the Beloved Country. Sentimental; politically correct; intensely personnal; carefully crafted; embedded in a time, a place, and a people - Alan Paton's novel is everything that Ms. Stein despised in novels. But it is also undeniably a Master-Piece.Cry, the Beloved Country is at once a poetic portrait of South Africa, a testament of racial justice, and the universal story of suffering and despair overcome by hope and love. The protagonist is a village parson, Stephen Kumalo, who travels to Johannesburg in seach of his loved ones (son, sister, and brother) who have been lost to urbanization. In his search, Kumalo loses more than he thought he had to lose. But his stubborn integrity is rewarded in all the ways that matter.The literary quality of this novel is undeniable. Paton shows a fine facility with with dialect, description, point of view, and voice. I was particularly impressed by Paton's effective use of the second person in passages that evoke sympathetic internal dialogs and solidify his varied characters."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I can yet to fathom how some people gave this book 1, 2 and 3 stars out of five. Most of the people giving these low scores admitted that they were being forced to read the book at high school, and found it boring and dull. Please dont corrupt these reviews with those opinions.The biggest problem is that most of the people rating the book low took it right out of the context for which it was intended. It was not written as a 'novel' in the conventional sense. It was a social commentry, a cry out to the hatred, the demise and the vehement degradation of the times. The book was to showcase the plight of the black South Africans on an international level. It had no intention of providing a source of entertainment for ignorant, naive, myopic minds of 15 year old some 55 years later.Paton writing style has been criticized greatly in this forum. Remember, Paton was a poet- not a novelist. Most poetry is difficult to understand, and hard to read for long periods of time- but it is the imagery and flow that captures the imagination. Think of Cry, The Belovered Country as a poem- not a Michael Crichton or Tom Clancy thriller.While probably NO-ONE will ever be able to understand Cry in the same way as those in the context and time it served, it will go down as one of the classic literature endevours of our time."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into the hills. So starts this book, a portrayel of one South African man's struggle to reunite his family. Kumalo is a black man who lives in South Africa in the 1940's admist Aparthied. His goal is to bring back his sister and son back to him. Alan Paton does an excellent job showing the obvious difference between a life of a black and white. Skin color was everything at that time. He displays the awful townships that blacks must live in because they have no other place to go. He also shows how mistreatment of blacks was a daily routine. As only a seventh grade student, I have to admit that at times I was sometimes confused while reading. However, the true meaning of this book was obvious. South Africa has gone through a tragic life. This book gives such an in depth gripping example of a black man's life that it is hard not to believe that it isn't an autobiography. This book displays the racial injustice of the law, by showing the sentence against Absalom. It's a true-eyeopener of the cruel history of our world, and what we have done to it. This wonderful book is one that should be read."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"It is true that Cry, the Beloved Country tells us of suffering, of injustice, of conflict, of South Africa. What sets this book apart, however, is its beauty: the beauty of the language, the beauty of faith in the forge, the beauty of the people, some struggling with their oppression, othes struggling with their privilege . You cannot fully appreciate this book if you only see it as a statement. It is not merely a statement, but a . . . well, a cry, not of pain only, but also of hope. It is profoundly touching.It astonishes me that I did not discover this work until I was twenty years out of college. Beautiful, touching, unique in style, and very relevant. It should be on every English department's short list."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This masterpiece by Alan Paton shows what a brilliant literary work can be. Alan Paton describes a world with vibrant adjectives and emotional turnpoints. He showed us the terrible world that was South Africa. He wonderfully showed the story of apartheid through the journey of Stephen Kumalo. The book has some gut-wrenching parts and gets you emotionally involved. This book addresses a problem that is all too common in a world divided by racial boundaries. Alan Paton did a incredible job of a bringing this character life as well as the entire book. I really thought it was one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Whenever we finish a great book we feel a deep sorrow,just as we were leaving behind good friends. When you finishthis specific book, you'll feel like crying, for the lossof friends like Rev. Kumalo is very hard to take.&quot;Cry, the beloved country&quot;is one of the best books I haveever read. You can feel the passion for South Africa thatMr. Paton felt, you will be touched by the Rev. Kumalo'ssearch, and will feel frail, just like he did.But that is not all this book has to offer. It is alsoan accusation agains the prepotent owners of the power andan accurate description of Apartheid long before it hasbecome legal.You will become involved with this story and will not beable to put this book down. If you want to read an excellentbook, pick this one and I can assure you will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"A wonderful, profound, and very beautiful book. As other reviewers have noted, it was written by a white South African in the late 1940's, and is set in that time and place, just before apartheid was officially imposed. It tells the story of Stephen Kumalo, a black minister from the countryside, who travels to Johannesburg to find his sister, and his son, both of whom have have vanished into the great city. He finds them, but his son has killed a white man, and his sister is a prostitute. The full story is described elsewhere; suffice it to say that it ends tragically, but with redeeming grace.The language of this book is amazing, poetic but also critical in the development of character. In large part the book is a love song to the land of South Africa, a place of great natural beauty which has been badly treated by man. But the language is also wonderful in expressing different personalities, different experiences, and different ways of thinking -- it changes and shifts with the subject.The plot and characterization are very powerful. The people are rounded, neither all good nor all bad, and each speaks with his or her own voice. The story pulls one forward with the minister on his journey -- I read this almost without stopping. To a degree, some elements may be jarring for some readers today, particularly readers of color. The book was written almost seventy years ago, and it was written by a white South African, perhaps with the intention of reaching other white South African.The ideas are compelling, and go far beyond the political. For me, the novel as a whole is about many things, about forgiveness and redemption and the tragedy of death and the miracle of new life The politics, of course, can't help but dominate the foreground. It is sad to think that the subjugation of South Africa's blacks continued for most of the next 50 years. But it is also inspriring to remember that apartheid ended without a civil war, and with reconciliation rather than revenge. A great book, worthy of its subject.."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This strange, lyrical novel is easily the most agonizing painful books I've ever read. Murder is perhaps the most overdone topic in the history of literature, but if all were done like this, we couldn't bear to read many. Published months before white supremacists created the legal system of apartheid (and set two years earlier, in the fall of 1946), the novel follows the fathers of an accidental killer and his unintended victim, starting before the murder and ending only after we get a sense of its ripple effects through the lives of whites and blacks as they try to make sense of the utterly pointless tragedy and the social system that led to it.It's a novel that does little to try to flashily seduce the reader. It starts out with a description of a rural valley in South Africa, a description that is repeated later with some key differences. Then it moves dialogue that almost sounds off-key: there are no quotation marks, only dashes, to indicate speakers and the characters have an odd repetitious quality to their speech that puzzles at first. At the risk of only a little hyperbole, it sounds like this:-- The sky is blue.-- You say the sky is blue. His eyes flickered upward.-- I say the sky is blue.-- I understand. The man nodded.-- You understand.My initial reaction to this was, \\"Oh man, did I pay for this?\\" But then as the matters grow more serious, I learned to appreciate that such dialogue has a somber rhythm, if not beauty, to it. It is not so much repetition as characters recognizing each other's humanity.And that is what makes this book so painful. Paton at every key moment goes for the perfectly understated emotion. The father of the murder victim does nothing histrionic -- there's simply this powerful scene in which he looks around his son's library, which is filled with passionate political books that mean nothing to him. He's forced to simultaneously confront the gulf that had arisen between himself and his son -- this sense that his own offspring is a mystery -- and also the grievous sense of loss in the quiet room (with the blood stain down the hallway). Scenes like this hurt.Toward the end, there's a stretch of maybe thirty or forty pages in which the characters briefly become symbols and Paton seems to be letting whites off easy in their greater complicity. But Paton himself seems aware of this, as he has a character that I was starting to find unrealistic deny that he is a saint and another character points out how much of the blame rests with the sins against humanity of the whites. What to make of these possible missteps by Paton and his own attempt to ameliorate them become a moot point by the powerful final scene. It's simply a man watching the sunrise. Yet, because of what it means when the sun rises above the horizon, I think that scene will stay with me far longer than the last couple pages of any other novel I've ever read.I am, I'm sure, reading this at a time when I'm particularly susceptible to its sentiments. After months of worrying about whether my infant son, who has just seemed like a bundle of vulnerability, I am watching him grow past the initial troubles that can beset a baby. He is starting to show a personality and I can begin to wonder what the future will hold in store for him. And this novel combines what are probably the two worst fates your child could experience: to murder or to be murdered. To me this is much more of a horror novel than some junk about a disturbed sadist with magical powers -- or whatever gets hawked under the label of \`horror' these days.From this point of view, I can only look with sadness on all the petulant one-star reviews by children forced to read this. Some teenagers are moved by this book, but clearly it's too soon for many of them. It's a pity, but there are other great works that can stir their souls and perhaps many should save this until later."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK 15 STARS IF I COULD.BEST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ IN A LLLOOONNNGGG TIME.GREAT JOB!!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I reread this book after many many years only to find it even more powerful than I remembered. Paton has truly captured the human experience of sadness, joy, forgiveness, acceptance, and endurance. The character are complex, memorable, and genuine. Well deserves to be called a \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton was a very great man. In addition to being an author, he spent many years managing a large reformatory, bringing to the inmates some amazingly humane ways of doing things. If prison is intended to reform criminals, to make them happy and productive members of society, Paton was one of the most successful penologists in history. That he did this in South Africa with a group of predominately black inmates, just before apartheid became law, makes his achievement all the more remarkable. It also placed him in a unique position to write \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\".Most of the story follows Stephen Kumalo, a clergyman in a small village whose son Absalom, like many of the young people, has raced off to Johannesburg where things are happening. They sure are; Reverend Stephen travels there to find his sister and discovers in the meantime that Absalom is under arrest for murdering a white man while in the process of burglarizing his home. The victim, Arthur Jarvis, has been a leader in the movement toward equal rights in South Africa. Doubling this irony is the fact that the victim is also the son of a white landowner near Reverend Kumalo's village.In other words, this is an impossible story to tell. You know what's going to happen; whether the young man is executed or not, everyone's going to behave in that terribly noble manner. The black folks in particular, whether submissive or angry, will all show themselves in the best possible light, and many of the white folks will do the same. There will be reconciliation and copious tears. We readers will come away from this novel enlightened, feeling wonderful about the brotherhood of man. Disgusting.Not quite. Although Paton didn't manage to avoid that halo altogether, he steered clear of it surprisingly well. Neither Kumalo nor Jarvis, Arthur's father, could possibly live where they do without thinking about racial issues, but Paton is magnificent at showing how ambivalent their thoughts can be. As is always the case with good fiction, these characters behave like real people - they have no pure element within them, neither pure good nor pure evil, neither pure love of the black or white population nor pure hatred - and the more real they are, the more we can identify with them. When you read a novel you want to immerse yourself in it, and you can only do that if it rings true. (That goes for novels of the fantastic as well, by the way, but we'll talk about that some other time.)Speaking of immersing yourself in a novel, Paton's language here shows that he would probably have made a great poet. The descriptions are wonderful, whether applied to great beauty or great misery, and he gave each character a highly individual voice, something many authors neglect. And then there's the fact that he shows us the people's thoughts in similarly gorgeous language, reflecting deep feelings, in what was clearly an African idiom rather than the clich&eacute;s of melodrama. It's touching to see that he respected his characters to that extent, as he seems to have respected the real people of his nation.As the title implies, this novel describes the landscape in some detail - not so much as to drag, but enough to show that one can truly fall in love with a place. Personally, I've always been more concerned with a story's characters than its environment, but this is one of the comparatively few that have really shown me how powerful setting can be. \\"Cry\\" starts out with a description of a road to Reverend Kumalo's village, which the narrator describes as \\"lovely\\". Not a word you would ordinarily associate with a road, and it shows the people's attachment to their place. The surprise is that loving a place, according to Paton and his characters, is not necessarily such a good thing. It gives you too much to lose, especially if the place you love is full of pain and fear. That, rather than the uplifting journey that these people go through towards enlightenment, is the real power of this novel, lending some heft to its themes and preventing the plot from drifting off into the glowing pink clouds.Those themes are dangerous. Anyone who tries to write fiction about enormous historical events, like apartheid, runs the risk of having the theme dwarf the story. Paton's strategy is brilliant - his characters think about things like race relations, but rarely talk about those things. Jarvis in particular, even after the death of his son, speaks very rarely about what he thinks of his black neighbors or the black African peoples. In fact, he speaks very rarely about anything at all. His actions change radically, though. Even Reverend Kumalo keeps his mouth pretty well shut about race relations. Like a good clergyman, he talks a good deal about God, but what with the troubles of his sister and son, his reflections on God became less certain as time goes on, until finally his most moving action about God takes place in utter silence.The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said \\"What we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence\\", a demand that all too many people fail to obey. I mean, any speech regarding certain subjects, like apartheid, diminishes those subjects, but you have to deal with them somehow, don't you? I said that Alan Paton was a great man, and this is not only because of his courage in facing down a great evil, but also because he found a way to write a great novel about a subject which should ideally be met with respectful silence. At the very least, \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" works because it concerns two men who confront that subject with respectful silence, and its author showed us why that is the proper response.Benshlomo says, if you must talk about the big subjects, at least do so with care."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book was so well written and even though the story is set during the time of apartheid the emotions are still fresh and current reading it in 2010. I was encouraged how the Fathers worked productively through their pain and lost. It is a reminder to persevere and to hold on to your faith and continue to look for the good amongst what may have turned out so very wrong."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book gives us an inside look at South African apartheid in the 1940's. We live this story through the eyes of a poor Zulu pastor who decides to travel from his small village to Johannesburg in hopes to save his son from mounting troubles. The migration of gold mine workers to the cities has increased the crime rate due to the separation of families. Exploitation of these laborers has caused a political unrest in Johannesburg.Stephen Kumalo, our Zulu pastor, has to question his own parenting and lifestyle when he sees the poor decision making of his own son. Stephen meets a varied barrage of people, some who help and some who choose silence as the easiest way to stay out of trouble, when searching for his son.\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is a must read book.

And I felt grief for the father of the man whose son wan murdered.To put a summerize my thought on this novel I was touched"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton certainly had his heart in the right place but couldn't disguise his paternalistic feelings of the plight of the native South African, bringing down what was otherwise a good novel. While Paton recognized the vast injustices being committed in his nation, he failed to recognize the ability of the African to address these concerns. Instead, he created dramatic contrasts between the rural countryside and the City of Gold, Johannesburg, which drew these rural natives into its teeming midst, only to find pain and heartache. In this case it is a father looking for his son, Absalom, only to find that his son has killed a white man. The book resonates with Biblical allusions, taking on the form of a parable, but Paton did not explore the complexities of the situations he created too deeply. He used them more for effect. This is what is most disconcerting about the novel, as it seemed aimed more at a liberal white reader, forcing him to identify with one of his own in the victim he created in Arthur Jarvis.While Paton struggled admirably to get into the mind of Stephen Kumalo, the berieved father of the son who was an accomplice in the murder of Jarvis, Kumalo is forced to turn to a benevolent white lawyer to represent his son in court. This relationship reinforced Paton view that utimately it was the white man who would save the black man by attacking his own system of government. While this served as an indictment, of sorts, against the apartheid system, it had a hollow ring to it, not taking into account the vast number of protests and other forms of non-violent demonstrations Black, Coloured and Indian South Africans held in defiance of apartheid laws. Instead, Paton reduced apartheid South African to the most simplistic of terms, unable, it seemed, the understand, or at least come to terms with, the number of gradients in the system.Still, it is a moving novel, especially when Paton deals with what he understands most, the anguish of the conscientious white man in reconciling himself with a corrupt system of government. This is seen mostly through James Jarvis, whose son was murdered by Stephen Kumalo's son. One gets the sense that Paton put a lot of himself into Jarvis."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"For me, this book had a slow start as I tried to get into the rhythm of the writing and grasp where the story was going. I was reading it for my book club, and for the first 50 pages or so, wasn't too happy about it. BUT THEN, something shifted and I was completely immersed in it. I must admit (sadly) to not knowing a lot about the history of South Africa, so I'm sure I didn't appreciate that aspect of the story as much as I could have. I will now learn more and reread the book so that I can experience that side of it fully. But, the story of what the father, Stephen Kumalo, experienced moved me to tears on several occasions. Reading from a parent's perspective, I could emotionally and physically feel what that man must have been experiencing- Paton's writing is amazing. This book is so sad and sweet and touching. There is much to say about all of the other aspects and story lines of this novel- all good. I was so tempted to stop reading at the beginning, and if I hadn't been reading it for the book club discussion, I believe I would have. I am so thankful that I didn't quit- I would have missed out on one of the most beautiful, rich, heart-rending, inspiring, and wonderful books I have ever read. I recommend it completely."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I am in awe of Paton's ability to capture the South African struggle.

This is great literature one of eternal verities!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"My class was recently assigned this book to read to go along with our unit on Africa. Cry, The Beloved Country was filled with extrodinary passages that made me feel the pain and suffering of a country under a time of great turmoil.

While I must say I never read ahead, I did find the book quite interesting, and it arose some thought-provoking questions. I found myself researching Apartheid and South Africa, and whites in the country. If you are interested in civil or racial issues, or just fairness and equality you should read this book. Also, I recommend it if you've seen the movie."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Well, This book was ok. It teaches many lessons about how people felt but other races and how people can turn as fast as you can imagine. Well, this book was also hard to follow on some chapters of the book. But yet, this book was great because you could exactually imagine what is happening to Kumalo. It also shows you have the places been and how the people living there suffered so much. Reading this book taught me alot about what others go through and that others to are just like one another. It teaches that everyone has problems, not just you. I suppose I would recommend this book to those who like to read long and interest books about tragedy and hope. This book is very great indeed but not too much. So, if you're interested about this book, I hope you read this book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book was very interesting because it was moral, but had every-day conflicts. I enjoyed the parts that were down to earth. Like when they talked about Gertrude being a prostitute, and alcohol producer. The story was very sad, but it makes you realize how important family, and life itself is. I honestly thought that I would not like this book, I even considered just buying the Cliff NOtes, and not really reading it, but I am happy I did. Besides once I picked it up, I just could not put it down. It was like a big adventure, and I never knew what would happen next. I liked the character of Stephen Kumalo, because I could read what was going on in his head, I knew his feelings, and thoughts. But my favorite character was Absalom, because he brought the real excitement to the story. He committed the murder, he was the one who made the book so interesting. You should all read this book because it was very interesting, and sincere. And if you already have read the book, try watching the movie, it was equally enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I found Cry the Beloved Country to be a very exciting book. In my opinion it had a very good plot and story line, but there was too much uneeded information. I found some of it hard to understand, although there are reasons that I had fun reading this novel. The story compelled me to continue reading. I had a blast learning about South Africa. I also enjoyed reading about the journeys of Stephen Kumalo. Over all I found this novel to be very intersting, fun, and educational. I give it three stars because it was unclear and there was too much uneeded information, but it was very good otherwise."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Over all I found Cry the Beloved Country to be a interesting book. I can honastly say it's the best book i've read in a long time. There are many reasons that I enjoyed reading this book. First off the way that Alan Paton showed Steven struggle to bring his family back from the depths of Johannesburg. Second I loved reading about all the new places that Steven would travel to and all the people he would meet. Also I thought that Alan Paton really showed how badly the natives in South Africa were being treated. Finally I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The book had its ups and its down. The plot was obvious right from the start but then changed dramaticly starting with book 2 in the court room. I thought the plot was interesting but dulled when all Kumalo and Msimangu did was search one house to the next. The overall book itself was interseting but lacked to entertain me. I thought it was interesting because it contained moments when you didn't know if Kumalo was going to actually find his son and how he would react as well as his sister. It lacked entertainment because there was no real climax to the whole thing and it was really drug out. Overall I recommend it to patient readers."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"After reading Cry the Beloved Country, it was very clear the point they were trying to get across. Throughout the tragic novel there were many hardships suffered with many characters. It was a well written novel for being written years ago. Kumalo, the narrator, tells his journey to the wonderful place of Johannesburg. At thatpoint in time, racism was in the air. Kumalo, main character and narrator, examines a letter that tells him to ship out to the town of Johannesburg. There, is where he reunites with his housebroken family. He goes through many horrifing experiences with the family. The one who suffers the most is his son Absolam. Although his son Absolam was suffering his sister Gertrude was had a very sad desease. Not the one that the citizens are aware of. When reading this book, there is a sad but beautiful mood. It is a good book but could be better. Recommending this book would be a good idea if you want to read about life in the year 1948."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I have begun reading this book as a prereq for the International Baccalaureate program; now, not too far in, I decided to check reviews on Amazon to see if I am in for a long haul of a book report, trying my best to finish an utterly dull and stupendously bland book.However, I, being in the French version of the program, was absolutely sickened to see reviewers referring in such a derogatory manner to the author in regards to the hyphen (-) used to commence phrases in the book in lieu of quotations (\\").What they fail to realize is that quotations are a strictly English-speaking thing. Considering the writer was not born in Britain, nor the United States, nor English-speaking Canada, it is perfectly acceptable for a hyphen to be used to start a phrase. I have been reading like this for years...yes, it will take getting used to, but it is a very multicultural thing and those who learn to weave around it if they are so distracted by it will realize that, although in my personal opinion the book is a bit of a snorefest, the writer uses metaphors, similes and euphanisms in a distinct and unique manner."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I love literature and I hate to be politically incorrect. And perhaps I'm being unfair - I did read this a while ago and only because it was required reading in high school. But many classics and important novels are actually good! I'm being sarcastic, but the point is, that I remember this book as being unbearably slow and boring. Yes, boring! It was well writeen, and the dynamics of it were interesting and it did stick in mind for being a great view and exposure into another's life and culture and time. But it was slow and boring and uninvolving. The characters and the &quot;lyrical&quot; writing resulted in my feeling removed from it. Boring!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country has a very interesting storyline. The book is about how a native priest struggles with an ever changing world, filled with injustice and surprises. Yet somehow, the book is unimaginably boring. I think that book has a great base, but it's unique writing style makes it excedingly more boring than it would be in real life."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I read this book in my sophomore year of high school, and wasn't very fond of it. My classmates agreed.The book had an interesting plot, I can give it that at least. Kumalo, a South African priest, travels to Johanessburg, a huge city, to find that his entire family has basically forgotten him. His brother doesn't recognize him, his sister lives in the slums, and his son... well, I won't go there as I don't want to give away the plot.My major complaint about the book is the writing style. It's confusing, lengthy, and one of my friends said they could have cut an entire page of what Paton said into about 3 words. Another complaint I have was that when reading it, it was hard for me to understand who was talking, because the dialogue same as Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. There aren't any quotation marks in the entire book.All in all, the writing style is just plain tedious for those who don't enjoy it. Who knows, maybe my 15 year old mind can't quite fully appreciate the \\"genius\\" of Paton's writing. But that's just me. As you can tell from other reviews listed here, other people obviously love the writing style. Although I found it confusing and unnecessary.To wrap things up, I would give this book a 2.5 if it were possible... I enjoyed the story, but I disliked the way it was written."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The story was beautifully written. I refused to read the last 30 pages or so. I just didn't want to know how it ended. I just felt content not knowing."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I'm not sure I really understood this book but Oprah said its good so I do to. It was equal parts hartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. The main part of the story is how Kumalu is apart (no pun intended) from his son and his search for him. Besides the larger philosophical and social issues it was also even more interesting on the personal level of the characters involved. Oprah you done it again girl. I would have gave it a extra star if it had lowfat southafrican recipes."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"the style of the writing was really confusing, I had to read this book this summer for my sophomore honors english class. I agree with Dave, The author just wasted my time describing things on...and on...which completely bored me. I only had 5 days to read this book...so i skipped some pages that some people stated &quot;poetic&quot;. I may be harsh...like Dave...it could be because i cant fully apreciate his writing."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"&quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; had a very intriguing and educational plot, but Paton's writing style is what ruined it for me. The dialogue format was confusing at times and the switching of narration also put a damper on the story. Symbolism was strong, but easily spotted. If only the writing style wasn't so bad. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is filled with poetry and symbolism. The writing style of Alan Paton is truly amazing and each line is rich in metaphor and understanding. Obviously inspired by the country he is writing about you can feel the love he has for Africa in each and every line of this text.As for the story it's a very interesting look at the coming of age in a society that probably doesn't want to come of age yet. It probes deep questions about what right societies have to interfere with each other and what steps can and can't be taken after interference has already occurred. One of the most powerful messages for me was that you can't go back. The natives in the book can not return to the culture that they once had, instead they must look for a way to combine their old culture with the new culture that has been forced upon them. The book seems to give hope that this is possible and makes us realize that culture is stronger than the conditions it lives in and can stand strong against even the heaviest adversity."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I sloughed through this book with much difficulty - as an avid reader, I read the book not as much for the story it told, but for the way it was told. The novel was often repetitive - several passages were copied word for word (the first paragraph of Book One and the first paragraph of Book Two, for an example). Dialogue was repeated multiple times, and descriptions and phrases were reused. Paton's attempt at creativity with his use of dashes to begin dialogue was distracting at its best points. The base story of South Africa and Kumalo was engaging, but the story as it was written was difficult to process and dull. The only parts of the novel I actually enjoyed were Paton's passionate tangents in which he would leave his characters for a moment and discuss the actual problems and solutions.If this novel had been a movie I had rented, I would have turned it off within the first ten minutes and returned it to the store."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I have heard about this 1948 novel all my life and was aware of its theme. This is the first time I've read it though and I must say the impact was indeed startling. The writing is beautiful, soft and descriptive. And yet it deals with the horrors and inconsistencies that existed in South Africa at that time. The book is nothing short of a plea for justice and at the same time tries to be fair to both the white and black citizens of this troubled land.The story is that of an aging Zulu pastor who travels to the city of Johannesburg to look for his sister and his son. Life there is difficult for black people who are forced to live in shantytowns and who labor for low wages in the gold mines. What the pastor discovers is horrible. His sister has had to sell her body to men and his son has accidentally murdered a white man who was working towards bringing a sense of fairness to the country.Easily I got caught up in this very poignant story. There is a sense of poetry in the words. I felt I was hearing the voice of South Africa and it truly gave me the chills. And what was indeed the most chilling of all is that this book was written before Apartheid came and tore the country apart.The author was born in South Africa, the son a third-generation English mother and a Scot Presbyterian father. At one time he worked as a teacher and later the principal of a reformatory for young African offenders and these experiences certainly did influence whole sections of the book. Mostly though, the book just picked me up and placed me right in the middle of a country that has not yet been able to deal satisfactorily with its problems."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I picked this book up from my bookcase, where apparently, I had bought it sometime ago when it was recommended to me by someone. I was in between books and thought for Christmas, I needed a classic to read and this book is way better than I ever expected. It is a classic for the ages and the language is absolutely beautiful, heart-wrenching and lyrical. What makes this book even more beautiful is that I can relate to it even today, though I know little of South Africa and its history. Unfortunately, I see a lot of similarities between South Africa and our own history.The back of the book simply states that this book is about a man and his son in the depths of South Africa. Do not be misled by that simplest of blurbs. This book is about a lot more than a complicated father-son relationship. It is about the deep love the natives have for their country, the deep divide between the minority (the whites that have come to power) and the natives, and the unsettling of the tribes now that the land can no longer provide for them. It is a complicated book about a lot of issues that comes to head when the minister's son killed a white man. It gets even more interesting when the white man's father (Jarvis) finds in his heart the ability to listen to what his son was trying to do all those years. It turned out that Jarvis' son was a social worker in the highest sense of the word. He was trying to reconcile the divide between the natives and the uprooting of their tribal customs and trying to bring about the differences. The minister, Stephen Kumalo, went to Johannesburg to look for his son, but only was he too late to save his son.Paton touched upon so much in this tiny book and handles all the difficult subjects well. One could feel the anguish of Kumalo when he finds his son and hears his sentence of death. One could feel the pain of a man who is called to attend to his son because his son was murdered and that he knew his son's murderer's father. Interwoven throughout the men's pain and grief, are stories of a land that is now rendered apart by two different races.One cannot just pick this book up and read it without being affected. This book is one of those that will haunt you long after the last page has been turned. It is a book about love, hatred, indifference and greed but also of hope and promises. It is rich in details and it is one of my absolute favorite books to recommend for others to read. It really is a must-read for all serious readers because it will touch upon your heart.12/28/09"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"For some strange reason, I didn't read up on the history of this book until after I'd finished reading it. What was so surprising to me is that the book itself felt timeless - applicable to any episode in recent world history. Only later did I discover that it was written and published prior to the advent of formal apartheid rule in South Africa. The themes are still very relevant, the writing is wonderful, and the people are fascinating. Well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Note that this review is for the audio book narrated by Michael York. As for the book itself, this is the type of literature that I feel helps expand me as a human being. Paton does a great job of putting me in the shoes of several diverse people going through very difficult situations and helping me see all sides of the racial issues that were occurring in South Africa after World War II.First of all, I was able to see and feel what the natives were going through with the minority taking over their country and resources. I was able to understand that there were many white people who were actually working for the right thing, plus there were many who didn't seem to understand the impact of their policies on the majority. These are lessons that can be applied in many situations in the world. I only hope that I will learn these lessons and do the right thing in similar situations.The main characters were very good people similar to some whom I know in real life. The people with weaknesses are also shown with true feelings and humanity. I can understand why this book is listed on many lists of great literature.As far as the audio book goes, I though Michael York did an excellent job reading this book. His characterizations were excellent, especially that of the old man. It made it very easy to follow the dialog. He was able to convey the emotions very well.I highly recommend this audio book to anyone interested in great literature. This has to rank as one of my favorite books that I have read recently."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I enjoyed the book. It was beautifully written and well understood. It really touched emotionally. It showed many angles and points of view."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Very logically, it was a trip to South Africa that reminded me of this important book, and I'm very glad I have finally read it. It was probably the right time to read it too, since instead of it striking me as quaint and exotic, it was full of things that were already a little familiar to me, like place and language names.The characters and plot are all highly symbolic, chosen for their representative value in telling the story of South Africa as Paton knew it, rather than being realistic references to specific people and events. White colonizers first systematically deconstructed the existing tribal system, then with the steady growth of \\"native\\" crime, they tried to patch things up. But the damage had been done, and rampant crime is still probably the one near-fatal flaw of modern South Africa. Otherwise it is a vibrant, exciting coming together of fascinating diverse cultures.One thing that stood out was the sympathetic portrayal of whites who reached out to blacks and tried to redress some of the wrongs imposed by their society. The author himself was one of these, and certainly was using the medium of fiction to tell part of his own story. He succeeds at the same time at winning the readers' understanding of and sympathy for the plight of poor and unsophisticated but basically good and all-too-human blacks caught in the maelstrom of the times they lived in.The language of the book may sound a bit stilted if you're expecting modern, fast-moving colloquial English. The writing is however in fact quite remarkable in how its echoes the syllable-timed tonal languages of black South Africa, and for me it was overall a pleasing effect.Highly recommended - this a basic work not to be missed by any aspiring world citizen."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country, written in 1948, is relevant after all these years. Alan Paton cries for South Africa his beloved country. He cries for the Valley of Umzimkulu the home of Stephen Kumalo and James Jarvis. He cries for the city of Johannesburg, the harsh city that spits at the weak with poverty, crime, prostitution and addictions.Paton uses a third person narrative voice to tell the story of two men--Stephen Kumalo, a black priest (Book I.) and James Jarvis, a wealthy white landowner (Book II.). Paton gets inside the mind of each man, exposes human feelings with depth and restraint. The restraint, in both language and sentiment, gives power to the story. His simple declarative sentences are reminiscent of Hemingway. Paton makes Kumalo and Jarvis fully human heroes, imperfect lovable survivors. They survive after the tragic interconnected deaths of their sons; they relate to each other with dignity and respect.Within the story of two families the larger story of South Africa emerges. Paton exposes the racism that created Apartheid. He details the loss of self sufficient farming compelling young people to go to the cities to earn a livelihood. He shows the impact on young blacks going to the city and losing their communal tribal life. He shows the generosity of Jarvis' son who devoted his life to social justice and was killed in spite of his effort by a disenfranchised black youth--Stephen's son.Paton's tone is measured, even unhurried. The tone slows the reader down and forces the reader to look at the reality of the characters. And then the novel moves beyond Kumalo, Jarvis, and South Africa to a broader picture. Like all great art, Paton's text relates to everyone by touching the core of the human condition. Cry, the Beloved Country evokes universal experience of human life. The novel remains important because it remains relevant."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, the Beloved Country is a rare book that presents a superbly written story that creates a sense of sacredness that is palpable. The characters in the book demonstrate the struggle of humanity to overcome pain and suffering through forgiveness, redemption and love. The main character Stephen Kumalo, an Anglican Parson in S. Africa, illustrates the gentleness, love and unselfishness that characterize the fruits of a life lived in God's presence. In the sorrows that occur during the story however he experiences darkness described by Paton, \\"There are times, no doubt, when God seems no more to be about the world.\\" He refuses to lose faith in God or in the people around him. The relationship that buds between him and the father of a man murdered by Kumalo's son represents the fruit of forgiveness and redemption. What comes from it is healing for a valley and a people.Paton paints the picture of S. Africa that included a beautiful country with beautiful people that had fallen victim to the vices of the modern world and the negative outcomes of a class/race-based society.This is a book that no doubt contributed to the healing and reconciliation among the people of S. Africa.In addition to its moral and spiritual qualities, the story is compelling and enjoyable to read.The plea of the book stands out as the cry for all humanity:\\"God save Africa, the beloved country. God save us from the deep depths of our sins. God save us from the fear that is afraid of justice. God save us from the fear that is afraid of men. God save us all.\\"Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Dating from 1948, this book is at least as powerful now as when it was written, and was on the list of banned books in the old (white ruled) regime in South Africa. It is a simple story of a poor black pastor as he journeys to Johannesburg in search first of his sister, then of his son, and then relatives of sundry others from the locality. The black pastor also finds his brother, who like many caught within the magnet of J'burg, is not recognisable as the man that departed the countryside.Alan Paton produced a well crafted and consistently understated volume. From the storyline, lots of sub-plots are interwoven. It is not an open indictment of the apartheid (\\"separate development\\") system that was increasingly introduced in South Africa in the late 1940's and 1950's - but yet it is. Almost in a subliminal way, there is a questioning of what is going on in the beautiful country, whilst appearing to \\"just\\" tell a tale.Three books make up the story, although it would not make sense to read one alone or to read them out of order. Paton has a strange symmetry; the first and second books begin in the same way, with almost the same words for half a page of each. I found myself turning back to the opening lines of chapter 1 as I read the first chapter of the second book.The story left me crying more than once, and when not crying on the outside, I was usually internally. From the mid point, there is an eerie inevitability about the gentle unfolding of the story. You know what is going to happen, at least in part, but it does not stop you reading further.The cry of the title may be the cry of the author because the land is broken, and the tribe is broken. Paton refers to the tribe, but means the tribal system, with stability and knowing one's position. At the end of the volume, after the events in the storyline, there is some small mending of land and tribe taking place. It is perhaps the beginnings of hope. You have to divorce yourself from the historical reality of the country, as to whether that hope was realised.I read an American edition. The author's note describes the extra-ordinary help given by an American couple to meet a hard deadline with potential publishers. That in itself lifted me up, and perhaps prepared me for the uplifting pages to follow.I wish that I had read this book previously. The story-line is fiction, but the message is truth of the most powerful kind.Peter Morgan (morganp@supanet.com)"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY EMBRACES ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN SOUTH AFRICA AND AT THE SAME TIME REVEALS HARDSHIPS ENDURED DURING THE APARTHEID.

I had never heard of this book prior to the 1001 Books To Read list (it had not been required reading in high school), and I am sorry I didn't read earlier. This book is one of the most memorable books I've ever read, and I know I will look forward to re-reading it again one day.I understand some here have not taken kindly to Mr. Paton's writing style, but I found it engaging and very easy to read. His descriptive style, for me, was far from boring and kept me involved in the story to the point where I could envision all that was happening. For me, his words just flowed so evenly.The story may be a little dated for today's politics being as the novel was written in 1946; however, it provides a thought-provoking point of view of the beginnings of apartheid in South Africa. The issues are complex, and the answers are not always easy or simple, but the effect on people is amazing and long-lasting. Mr. Paton describes how every facet of life is touched through this horrible policy. The dilemma of complexity is driven home when the stories of two men, Kumalo and Jarvis - one black, the other white - come together. Sympathies for both men are strong and the reader can find their hearts wrenched at what happens simply because that's the way it is done.Well done and thoroughly enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book is a quick read, but the issues it approaches are complicated, difficult, and polarizing. There are no easy answers, and this book offers no explicit solutions to the individual, abstract, and institutional forms of prejudice and injustice it tackles. Was apartheid evil and unjust? There is no question it is. But, how can a country recover from its ingrained scars of such a system? There is no specific answer, but the solution is partly in what Paton illuminates in his relationship between the country parson Kumalo and his neighbor, the senior Jarvis. Or to put it more simply, the answer to systematized brutal racism can be found partly in individual responsibility, reason, and compassion.Two issues the book left me with: I did not think the penalty imposed on Kumalo's son was just, especially considering his intent; and I thought Kumalo's Bishop who asked him to depart Kumalo and Jarvis' hometown stupidly didn't consider Kumalo and Jarvis' individual will in the face of tragic circumstances and this made him quite unreal. The Bishop especially bothered me because his position indicated enlightenment, and Paton depicted him as so two-dimensional I wonder if Paton himself believes religion reinforces the subjugation of South African natives - in subtle and more overt ways. Or if Paton wanted to portray institutional religion as more concerned with outward appearances, and acting in hypocritical ways that undermine the true benevolent role religion should ideally play in society.I traveled through JoBo a few years ago. The economic disparity is staggering. I also taught in Namibia for several months about five years ago. (Namibia used to be part of South Africa until it gained its independence in 1990.) Namibia is probably as socially segregated today as America was in the 1950s. All the white German kids attended private school and all the black/colored kids attended the over-crowded, under-funded public schools. (In fact, some Germans even celebrate Hilter's birthday and some celebrate Kristallnacht.) The truth of my experience in Namibia is - it's a beautiful country, filled with beautful, trusting people who are generous and have no fear of connecting with white foreigners.So, Cry, The Beloved Country raises complicated social issues, but certainly offers no explicit solutions. I think Paton does offer what he thinks are key to overcoming such social difficulties - education, true commitment to change, the bond of the family, decency, society, children -- I think Paton offers these things as the proper destiny of men.I didn't feel as moved by this book as I did by actually seeing the problems for myself. And, in fact, my response to Paton's depiction of JoBo and its problems is pretty much \\"He stated the obvious very well.\\""},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Alan Paton writes eloquently about personal struggles, triumphs, and losses. Almost biblical, the lyrical dialogues and descriptions draw you into the reality that is South Africa and don't let you go. Stephen Kumalo becomes a hero and a friend to empathize with and admire. As a college student, I have read this book 5 times and written papers on it for English, History, and Sociology classes. (I got A's on all of them!) I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great literature and a great story. The 1995 movie with James Earl Jones was superbly done and was the first of the three versions made to be filmed in South Africa.

CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY, set against the backdrop of contemporary South Africa (1946), is a story about a black South African named Stephen Kumalo who journeys through South Africa to the city of Johannesburg to find his son, Absalom. After he finds him, he discovers that his son has done a horrible thing. This leads leads Kumalo to cross paths with a white man named James Jarvis. Kumalo and Jarvis, through their journey of suffering, both find that love is the only way the &quot;the Beloved Country&quot; South Africa can heal.Paton's use of imagery allows the reader to have a clear vision of the consequences of Apartheid in South Africa--the devastation of native land and the breakdown of the Zulu, Xosa, and other native tribes. The universal themes in the novel--social injustice, hope, love, etc.--are the reasons that CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY lives on...spreading its powerful message to all cultures and generations.I recommend this novel from the high school age and up...And a great reference to better understand the book is Cliff Notes, & if you want a free resource, check out www.SparkNotes.com!

The beginning of the game is slow and tedious, but the cascade effect is worth it. Some classics are like setting up dominoes. They begin slowly, and the unfortunate reader will put the book down in disgust and never return to it. A more persistent reader is richly rewarded for their patience. Cry, The Beloved Country is that kind of a classic, others are Tale of Two Cities, Dickens and Jane Eyre, Bronte.The language is beautiful, I don't enjoy flowery descriptions of scenery, but in Cry the descriptions helped you feel as if you were there without being too lengthy. The characters are well developed, and some are people I would really love to know. However, because I did care about the characters, the story in the beginning, is just so sad that I almost fell into that catagory of unfortunate readers who quit reading early and miss out on the treasure. I'm grateful that I didn't.Inspite of the difficult beginning, this has become one of my favorite books. It carries you from despair to hope. It is a story about South Africa and its people, but it is also a story that has something for each of us.Cry, The Beloved County leaves you a better person when you put it down than when you started it. It is a journey not to be missed."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago for Academic Decathlon and it is a wonderful book. It introduces you to entirely different era, atmosphere, culture and belief system. It really makes you think about what it would be like to be oppressed and hated and what it means to fight for something that you believe in."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I didn't know what to think of Oprah's latest selection, I'd never heard of this book before. But, oh, was I happily surprised! I was very impressed. I thought it would be dull and drab, but from page 2, it drew me in and I enjoyed reading this book immensely.Before reading this book, I couldn't find anything that really gave a description, so here's my synopsis, in case you were looking for one:This book is about two families living in Africa. One is black and one white. We follow them through their struggles and hardships and watch their lives intertwine in the most magical way. This book is full of thought provoking ideas and the writing is at times poetical.If you'd find a book about Africa, in the 1940's something that would interest you, I'd very much recommend this book. At 270 pages, it's a short, easy, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This book has many beautiful themes tangled into its plot if you can dig through the many lengthy descriptions of the setting. While these descriptions are very wordy, the book would not be the same without them. They are tedious and repetitive, but Paton conveys the beauty of South Africa with the hardships and despair that the natives are facing.Paton does a wonderful job of showing exactly how Kumalo, the main character feels. From his characterizations, the reader understands his motives, thoughts and actions.The setup of the book was confusing because the first section starts in chronological order, then the second section starts in the middle of the plot. Also, there are no quotations which makes the book hard to follow.Overall, the novel celebrated two cultures reaching out to one another, and the bond between families especially father and son. For people who do not mind lavished detailed settings, I recommend this book highly because the themes taken out of it are unforgettable."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"When first published in 1948 in apartheid South Africa, Cry, the Beloved Country raised more than eyebrows as a powerful book about the power of unity and an author's unflinching hope of a future where segregation no longer exists. The book summoned feelings of pride, optimism, and anticipation of a long-desired goal. But Paton's lyrical, poetic prose is not your typical run-of-the-mill anger evoking story about discrimination. The story is a humanizing experience that evokes feelings of sympathy and understanding, not hatred for a system so blatantly wrong.In Cry, the Beloved Country, readers feel an uncanny connection to three things: the land, an old black rural priest searching in a corrupt city for his son, and an old white rural man confronting the loss of his son. All three aspects of the book are connected by a common thread. And a great thing about the book is that Paton doesn't feel the need to build up to the emotional climax by setting the readers against a well defined antagonist, or even an antagonist at all; on a micro-scale, the story is a moving tribute to man's inherent dignity; on a macro-scale, the themes and plethora of symbols are applied to man's all-too mortal nature.This book is also a can't-miss for any fans of poetry who want to read a good work of prose. As the New Republic puts it, Cry, the Beloved Country is \\"the greatest novel to emerge out of the tragedy of South Africa, and one of the best novels of our time.\\" I would be inclined to agree."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Of the (literally) thousands of books I have read in my life, this is still my favorite. I first read it as a freshman in high school (in 1960, when apartheid was still the law of South Africa), and the sheer beauty of the language took away my breath. The words were so powerful that I memorized many portions of the text, just so I would be able to repeat the words aloud whenever I wished. When JFK was assassinated in 1963, I gave a presentation to my senior English class, and began it with the section of this book that starts: &quot;There is not much talking now, a silence falls on them all....&quot; The class was mesmerized at Mr. Paton's eerily appropriate words, and tears were shed. I've always encouraged my own children to read and they are almost as voracious with books as their dad. Needless to say, this is one of the books I highly recommend to them, because of the excellent writing, and I highly recommend it to you for the same reason."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"I first read the book when I was in high school for our novel section of AP English. As a writer now, it is strangely thrilling to see how Paton's ideas and poetry influenced my own prose. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; by Steinbeck was good, but I felt that it lacked the words of the heart that Paton writes with. Never have I read a more simple and profound book, so lovingly crafted, so authentic and natural, that some fifty years later after Paton wrote the novel, it still has not been superceded. Kumalo's plight is everyman's plight; his burden our burden; his son our son. Dear students, don't read this book because your teacher tells you to, you will learn nothing that way. Read it, because you earnestly desire it, because it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Tragic story set in South Africa during a now-ended era. Cry the Beloved Country is worth a careful read for its many-layered messages of loss and faith, of murder and penitence, of guilt and redemption - and through it all is Rev. Kumalo's love for his people (and not just his, but for the inherent goodness in ALL people), his family, his church - and most of all, his country.It's a classic that has already withstood the test of time - and will doubtless continue to do so.Don't miss it, and share it with someone else."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"How much can a man love his country? How much can he love his son? His God? Can justice prevail when man cannot? What is forgiveness? Redemption? Grace? To consider all these elements in one novel is not possible. Or is it?\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is all these things and more. It is forgiveness writ large. It is agape love in the doing. It is the story of two fathers, each with a son. One son is the victim of apartheid and is lost. The other is also a victim of apartheid but of the other side. He seeks to find a way to make things better, to make things right. The lost one kills the seeking one. One is African, the other is Afrikaaner, and therein lies the difference and the ultimate. This difference, this ultimate, this absolute are what drove Alan Paton in the writing of South Africa's most famous, most searing novel of the separation of races in all ways.Absalom Kumalo's life is limited in all ways because he is black South African. Arthur Jarvis is an engineer and has all the privileges of white South Africa, yet he is keen on social justice and works to bring it to pass. What irony then that the one without kills the one seeking to bring justice. However, it is this very irony that brings their fathers to friendship, to a bonding of black man and white man.Umfundisi is the black priest (not Catholic) of a simple, poor church in a village located near the home of the rich landowner and farmer, James Jarvis, who really does not know his son until he is dead. It is the getting to know his son that he connects with the African, and the father becomes the son in the ways of love and forgiveness. The umfundisi is one of my favorite characters in all literature I have read because of his humility and reverence.This novel, published in 1948, remains as one, even today, apropos to race relations, to their very real potentials and actualities. Mutual respect, sincerity, forgiveness, and grace all come to the fore in this most magnificent, lyrical novel.It would be on my Top 10 list of books I would take if marooned on the proverbial deserted island."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Hi. I'm a high-school student, a 9th grader to be exact. I was not assigned this book, but did pick it from a list to read for a report. I am EXTREMELY glad that I did. I do admit that it is hard to get into. In the beginning, I was quite annoyed at Paton for blatantly ignoring correct grammar on quotes, and if you don't get it, i would suggest just reading the first few chapters a couple times in a place where you can concentrate. If you can be patient this long, it will suddenly click. I picked up and put this book back down about twice in two weeks,just to read the first five chapters, but then i was able to get into it, and finished it within two days.If you can perservere, get ready for a passionate, wonderful, brilliant ride. The characters are incredibly sincere, in both their good and bad sides. Paton does not try to make anyone a hero, even priests loose their temper at some point. What he does manage to do is make you laugh, open your mouth wide with astonishment, anger you, make you cry, and finally leave you with a sense of hope. This is an amazing book that captures the essense of South Africa's struggle for balance, in a time when white people were ripping away any structure the black Africans had, and expecting them to deal with what ideas and technology were brought from the western world. We read Kaffir Boy earlier this year, and it is very interesting to see the difference of opinion on little things like the Afrikaans language when a book is written by a white South African, and a black South African. (I...just don't know if i would recommend Kaffir Boy.)This is...I've run out of adjectives. But this is a simply marvelous book, which EVERYONE needs to read. And understand. And enjoy. Because it's very hard not to."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Beautiful imagery, language and chronology. I loved the journey that this book took me on. I read this book very s-l-o-w-l-y to capture every detail to really try and understand. The writing style allows the reader to go through the emotions of the main character (Umfumdisi) on his desperate search to find his son. You will experience the beauty of South Africa, just as you will know the grim of its land. I appreciated the introduction to native words and their meanings, to native traditions and their customs. This was more than a good read, it was an experience.

Unlike many things, though, this was a true deprivation. I first read this several summers ago; though Paton's novel is specifically relevant to an era that is now receding into the past, his prose remains haunting. So deceptively simple is his language, yet flowing, this is almost a book best savoured aloud (well-worth the reading of to a friend).Though apartheid has now blessedly slipped the scene, leaving South Africa with its aftermath to struggle through, Paton's story of the Reverend Kumalo's search for redemption is enduring. Perhaps most significant though, is the very simple idea at the core...reconciliation...of father with lost son, lost daughter...of murderer with the victim's kin...and...in Paton's time, and still so in our own...of each of us with our fellow humans.This is a book that moves me deeply every time I read it, and loses nothing in a rereading. Of the thousands of books I have read, encompassing a myriad of styles, of academic fields...this is still the one book that I recommend without hesitation, without prejudice, to any and to every. This is a truly beautiful work."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This review is more of the novel than of this particular edition of \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" (but I do own a copy of this edition and am pleased with it; have bought a couple of copies of this same edition and given them to friends as well -- it is light, portable, and the pages are easy to turn and easy to read).\\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is an amazing novel written by one of the most celebrated writers from South Africa. Set in a country that has been torn apart (in so many ways, including emotionally and spiritually) by apartheid, the main plot is a sad story that at the same time highlights: (a) the years of racial division, bitterness, suffering, injustice, etc., are a big factor in what happens; and at the same time (b) personal responsibility cannot be done away with or excused because of the severity of the sufferings.The characters are very believable and you can really empathize with them. At the same time, it is all written in a very lyrical style that shows the author's love for the country and continuing hope that things can change for the better."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Assigned this book for class, of course.

It was brand new, so there were no cosmetic issues and it shipped very quickly."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"The book is in good condition and the price was very reasonable. I ran across the movie late one night and decided that I'd like to read the book. It's so easy to find things online."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"This is a novel in my collection that I return to again and again. It is beautifully written, lyrical prose that drew me in when I first read it 20 years ago, and maybe even more so when I read it again. The characters are deeply rooted and real, the dialogue clear - one can hear the tone of the words and see the characters as they talk. There is much depth, heart, and compassion in the Rev Kumalo, whose journey to the big city of Johannesburg is heart-wrenching, as he sets out to find the fate of his family members who'd left his native tribe and never returned. This is a profound novel about faith, the human spirit, brokenness and restoration, justice, and race relations as it played out in South Africa.

It's not very thrilling or a work of great genius, but it is a touching and intimate story of an old pastor in South Africa. The writing mixes styles, present and past tense sections, and this lends support to the theme of apartheid, and the clash of two cultures that threatens to destroy the old way of life of the South African natives.While the writing could be a bit hard to follow at times, the plot is solid and the characters are vivid. For those readers who have a taste for classic fiction and don't mind reading something different, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Yes, you've read this before. You probably read it in high school, or a good college literature class.Yes, you know the story.But this is one to own -- a beautiful hardcover version of this book.

Your pity and understanding well up as you read this story, and especially the words of Kumalo and Jarvis, the murdered man.The hopefulness at the end -- the sad and searing ending -- America still struggles with these ideas. The simple and complex language, the points of view, the cross-cultural explanations... not only black and white race relations, but also white Americans and the Indian nations share perspectives on this.Read it again as an adult -- you will be moved."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"After finishing \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", I can confidently say I have never read a more beautifully written novel in my life. Page after page, Paton eloquently knits together a tale of a struggle for reproach, as well as the very real and vicious cycle of injustice and inequality into one modest and sincere work of art. \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" is set in mid-20th century South Africa, during a time of transition between the modest values of the traditional African tribe and Christian faith to the radically immoral prospects of the modern day metropolis. The novel begins in a small village located in Eastern South Africa, but quickly shifts to the booming city of Johannesburg as it follows the journey of Rev. Stephen Kumalo as he does everything he can to retrieve his only son and sister whom he has lost all connections with upon their previous departure. During Kumalo's wild goose chase, he realizes the weakening separation that his once steadfast family has undergone. Regardless, Rev. Kumalo does what he can to mend his broken tribe through the great faith he asserts as he experiences the strange cruelties of the big city. A few universal themes which Paton tries to express to readers is the rapprochement between fathers and sons. Although Rev. Kumalo and his son, Absalom, as well as James Jarvis and his son, Arthur, have many distinct differences throughout the progression of the novel, in the end, Paton reminds us that a place of compromise and harmony always exists; you just have to persist through disagreements. Paton's writing also depicts a never ending cycle of inequalities and injustices, which were a heavy burden throughout history, but particularly through the trials and changes of this book, which inevitably concluded the fate of several characters. I personally was highly pleased with this novel. To me, the raw beauty and distinction of Paton's writing was a unique way to stress the messages he was trying to convey. It truly is a classic which deserves more credit than it tends to be given."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Cry, The Beloved Country, by Alan Paton is truly a compelling novel. It is brilliantly written and had me intrigued throughout the entire novel. The rich text captures the moments and allows me to feel and be a part of all the chaotic activity.It made me think about how fortunate we are today to have diversity in our neighborhoods and in schools. We really don't think about it until we are forced to; whether it is by coincidence or by intention. It made me sad to think about how we concentrate on little bothers and miss out on the huge issues like the ones in the novel, including racial discrimination and the struggles between justice and the law.The way Paton has formatted his text gives a stronger feel to it. It's excellent how he puts a great deal of emotion and detail throughout the entire novel. Some examples of this are when he writes about the great valley of the Umkomaas. He describes it by saying, \\"the soil is sick, almost beyond healing.\\" It gives you a clearer picture of how the soil really was. Another example is when John Kumalo speaks about raising the wages in the mines. Paton wrote, \\"The crowd stirs as though a great wind were blowing through it. Here is the moment, John Kumalo, for the great voice to reach even to the gates of Heaven.\\" He states the point but adds a little kick to it and makes the statement more understandable. By putting emotions and details into his novel it drew me more into it.The intensity in the events was so great that it took me to places I've never been before. Like whenever Paton raised the intensity, it felt like I was right there with his characters. Almost like I was Mr. Kumalo going through all of those troubles. It was very powerful to me. My mind has opened up to new ideas that I would've never thought of before. Such as maybe white people weren't always racist against blacks. That blacks and whites sat in the same churches. Also that by one man's doing, a whole world can change. Like when Jarvis helped out Kumalo's land, by giving those supplies that were desperately needed.I would definitely recommend this book to whoever likes intensity and purity in a novel."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"You will become involved with this story and will not be able to put this book down.

For example - revealing how wealthy Pastor Kumalo looks to his poor, shoeless parishoners; but how wealthy whites see this same man as old, tired, and in poor cheap clothes, frayed at the edges as so many of their people seem to be.The imagery is both beautiful and heart-breaking.I first read this as Apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa. My friends tell me that though laws have changed and continue to change, many customs and prejudices are much harder to break down and renew.So Paton's work is in many ways still current - and always poignant."},{"Title":"Cry, the beloved country","review":"Tragic story set in South Africa during a now-ended era.

You were able to see James Jarvis transform from an indoctrinated white man into an understanding one (much like his son).

You can call them that. But they don't act like hate-filled zealots. The Four Just Man are civilized. They advise their targets they are guilty of crimes. They tell their targets to reform. They alert their targets to the date of their death. They even give their targets a final warning --- delivered in person. As the author notes, \\"The honesty of the Four was their most terrible characteristic.\\" Honesty --- how thrilling.Now the Four Just Men have a new target: Philip Ramon, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain. He is a public servant of unquestioned integrity with a conscience in working order. And yet he is about to commit a crime. A legal crime. But a crime nonetheless: His proposed legislation --- The Alien Extradition Act of 1905 --- would send a great Spanish social reformer, currently directing his followers from a safe perch in England, back to Spain. Once there, the corrupt government would kill him.No reasonable Brit wants this to happen. But the Four Just Men are not like those of us who read the newspapers and bitch. Because they believe Sir Philip is a good man with a single blind spot, they have sent word to him: Drop the bill, or die. Naturally, almost every policeman in London is assigned to protect Sir Philip. The question is: Are they up to the task? Can they even identify the Four Just Men?Very quickly you will get past the moral question --- terrorists? vigilantes? heroes? --- and find yourself lost in the whodunnit. And the howtheydunnit. You may even find yourself rooting for The Four Just Men.How does it end? Glad you asked. Edgar Wallace held a contest when he published this novel, offering 500 pounds --- not a small sum in 1905 --- for the correct answers to some esoteric questions about the ending. Several readers guessed the answers. Wallace lost money. Or did he? For Wallace hyped 'The Four Just Men' as if it were a new flavor of Coca Cola. He took out full-page newspaper ads, put posters on subways and buses, even advertised in the movies. The publicity launched his career.And Wallace went on to become the most famous writer in the world.He was quick --- he could write a novel in a weekend. He was good. And he was prolific: 175 books, 24 plays and countless articles. The only title known to the contemporary reader? \\"King Kong.\\" Maybe you've heard of it.'We kill for justice,' claim the Four Just Men. On that morally uncertain but dramatically delicious boast rests the second of Edgar Wallace's titles that the world should remember --- and relish."},{"Title":"The Four Just Men","review":"If you are the Saint fans, you'll be also interested in &quot;The Four Just Men&quot;. They are also a kind of &quot;Modern Robin Hoods&quot; who fight against the injustice beyond the reach of the Law. I read some Edgar Wallace's short stories before and they were splendid. This book is enjoyable, but not so good as I expected. Unlike the Saint, the Four Just Men lack outstanding indivisualities that attract readers.

This was such a heartfelt and moving book that it is definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lily typifies the very young and the restless that hot, sweaty summer of 1944 after the invasion of Normandy. All America waited to hear news of the Allied victory and the end of WWII. But not Lily--she was bored and angry that she had no mother and then her beloved Poppy had to join up to help Over There. Her only delight was their annual summer vacation at Rockaway, NY, in stern Gram's summer cabin on stilts. But things will not be the same for the three of them--not this summer nor ever again.The world wearies of war, refugees flee Europe and spy paranoia reigns. Lily tries to ignore the world's problems as she grapples with her own: she lies, cheats, sneaks, is lazy, disobedident and dishonest. Most of all with herself. But her shoddy little world is forced open when Poppy ships out overseas and she meets Albert, a Hungarian refugee staying with neighbors in a similar beach house. Their adult-arranged friendship almost backfires when Lily decides to ignore him; but her own unreasonable resistance is worn away when they rescue a drowning kitten.Lily learns how dangerous her web of lies can prove, when Albert seems to believe her boast about reaching a troop transport for a free trip to war-ravaged Europe. Will she ever recognize the error of lying and being so utterly selfish? Both children yearn to reunite their families but are unrealistic in their schemes.The author, however, leaves us with the hope that the price of defending Democracy and loved ones at home is worth all the personal sacrifice, of adutls and children alike. She reminds us that a mother's love lives on in the heart; and the need to treasure our grandparents who have lived and suffered long years before our birth. This is a serious book about a girl's abrupt coming of age, which will remind readers how the War affected millions of lives right here in America. (More cultural history than news broadcasts.) She depicts the world that our men and women went off to preserve for us all."},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lily's Crossing is an incredible book.

With her father going into World War II, her summer becomes even worse until, Albert, a refugee from Hungary, comes to live with his aunt, Mrs. Orban, (Lily's neighbor) because his parents died and his sister, Ruth, is in Europe with the measles. Now Albert and Lily become friends and they both tell many lies, but Lily tells one that almost costs Albert his lfe. He tries to swim to Europe to get his sister, but the problem is Albert doesn't know how to swim. Lily also finds something sewn in Albert's coat. Read this awesome book to find out what's sewn in his coat and what happens next summer (at the end).I enjoyed this book very much because I wanted to keep reading and never put the book down. There are also lots of cliff hangers which I liked.The one thing I did not like about this book is that I thought the secretsewn in Albert's pocket would be much more interesting than it was, and that it would be the plot of the story, but it wasn't.

I want readers to know that love and friendship make a difference.\\" She does just that.Lily spends every summer in Rockaway, New York with her father, her grandmother, and her childhood friend, Margaret, but in 1944 the war changes everything. Her father, Poppy, joins the army, Margaret's family moves to Boston where her father is helping to build B-24's, and Lily is left with her Grandmother. So upset that she lets her father leave without saying goodbye, Lily worries she will be alone all summer, but Albert, a Hungarian refugee, moves into town and as Lily and Albert become friends they help each other work through their fears.Giff creates a memorable setting with an ocean that lives as it rolls in and out, waves cresting and falling, leaving shells, smells, and a vivid sense of place. Rockaway becomes more than just a small seaside town, it is Lily's place of belonging where people know her and love her. (Even the matron at the theater, \\" . . . you can't keep coming in here when you don't pay. It was one thing when you were six years old, but . . .\\")But Giff's real achievement is drawing the world from Lily's perspective without interjecting adult sensibilities. I love the struggle Lily has practicing the piano, \\"The damn piano, she called it deep inside her head. If Gram ever thought she even knew that word, she'd be in trouble for a month.\\" (5) Later when her grandmother calls her to practice, \\"She played the C scale as loudly as she could, up and down, faster, faster. It made a terrific noise. She could hear Gram bang a cabinet door shut. Lily was probably driving her crazy. Terrific.\\" (117)Lily has a list of childhood problems in the midst of an adult war: Lies, Daydreaming, and Friends, need. Her summer in Rockaway cures her of lying and teaches her about friendship, and she learns that daydreaming might not be a problem after all.Tender moments permeate the story, such as Lily scraping a star off her ceiling to take something from her mother (who died) with her to Rockaway every summer, yet emotions never feel forced, but surface naturally."},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is a selection for a young girl's reading group, ages 9 and up.

She sat there a minute longer, her heart pounding, thinking that this was truly the worst lie she had ever told.\\" This passage is found on page 77 of Patricia Reilly Giff's exceptional novel, Lily's Crossing. This passage in the book shows that the naked truth is always better than the best dressed lie.Lily's Crossing, a fictional novel, is based on the summer of 1994 in Rockaway. World War II was starting to change everyone's lives. Especially the life of 10 year old Lily Mollahan. Lily planned to spend the whole summer relaxing at her family's summer house spending time with her best friend Margaret. But nothing seems relaxing about the fact that Margaret and her family have moved out of town and her father is drafted into the military. Everything in Lily's life seems dreadful and dull until a special visitor arrives. The arrival of Albert.I felt Lily's Crossing was an ingenious book where you had no idea what would happen next. The passage that makes me feel this way was on page 151, \\"There was another tremendous streak of lightning. It lit up the porch, and the whole of the sky, and she could see in the distance a rowboat at the edge of the bay, about to cross through the edge of the marshes. It was Albert.\\" This passage took me by suprise, I was not expecting Albert to go off by himself into the ocean. I also felt Lily's Crossing was a sad emotional book. On page 39, \\"She didn't stop until it was a smudge in the distance, and then gone completely, even though she knew Poppy couldn't have seen her.\\" This passage made me sad because all of Lily's anger towards her father evaporated when she missed his train and couldn't say good-bye.Even after reading the book I still question Lily's life after the war and her relationship with Albert. But, overall I think Lily's Crossing would be age appropriate for children 10 and up. This Novel I felt was the most influential, fascinating book and I highly recommend reading this novel.

Lily's best friend temporarily moved with her family to a factory in another state because the military needed her father, and all Lily's favorite stores don't carry as much anymore because of the war.

Also, if your child was living with her aunt because your wife had died. It is both a sad and exiting book to read. If you like true stories and action this is the book for you. Lily's Crossing took place in Rockaway in a summer house near the Atlantic Ocean. She would swim every day and was a really good swimmer. She was a little girl and she had no friends at all in the town because her best friend Margaret moved away. However, after living there for awhile she met a boy named Albert. Albert came from Hungary. He was the same age as Lily. They got along very well. Albert didn't know how to swim no one ever taught him how to. One day Albert and Lily went out there for there after noon swim and they noticed something in the water that was moving. If you want to find out what that was you will have to read this exciting book to find out more! Lily did some bad things and told lots of lies. After she figured that lying would get her no where she stopped doing that bad thing.This book was very exiting. If you like page turners this would be the book for you! At times this book could be a bit confusing because they kept referring back in time. When you read the story you may be able to connect to the story because Lily is a great swimmer and sometimes needed to have somebody there for her besides her aunt. The style of writing is very explicit. The person reading could see the ocean and waves and different things that were described. I don't feel like every chapter ended with a page turner, however some chapters did. Sometimes for me my mind would wander because I don't really like stories about the war.

Patricia Reilly Giff writes in a manner so that her readers can relate to the main character. Lily is a young girl who travels to Rockaway Beach every summer with her family. Lily's best friend, Margaret, lives there. But this summer, things are different. Margaret's family is moving to a place where there's no ocean. Margaret's father, Mr. Dillon, is taking his family far away so he can help the WWII effort. Lily soon learns that her father is enlisting in the military and will also be leaving. But, in spite all this, Lily makes a friend and together they share the summer. This is a powerful, yet simple storyline that most readers can relate to. This is why this novel, in my opinion, is rated at four stars.Lily's Crossing also demonstrates the power of friendship. Lily meets Albert, a Hungarian refugee who loves the violin, when the family he is staying with, the Orbans, invite Lily and her grandmother to dinner. When a kitten, in a paper bag, is thrown into the bay, and Albert sees it, Lily is immediately in the water to save the small creature. This is the first adventure of many as Lily and Albert care for the kitten. Lily even saves Albert's life as she risks her own during a horrific thunderstorm. Albert and Lily are the best of friends and this novel portrays the power of friendship. This is also why Lily's Crossing should be rated at four stars. Although Lily's Crossing is an amazing account, it does not deserve five stars because it is not a work of perfection. Patricia Reilly Giff could have livened some of the adventures of Albert and Lily, such as their swims together. But overall, it is a very well written tale.Lily's Crossing is quite a good book, but there are many others.

Lily and Albert who can't understand the politics or feel the same level of patriotism, are confused and show their anger against the war because it takes away their loved ones. I was born and raised in Queens, and we spent our summer days in the Rockaways. This book brought me many a nostalgic moment. A tear came to my eye when the lady in the gray dress turned out to be from the Daughters of Wisdom who taught me at Our Lady of Widsom High School in Ozone Park. I wonder if Patricia Reilly Giff knew the Daughters of Wisdom herself. Americans will probably never again experience the camaraderie of that time, but Lily's Crossing can revive it for all ages.

What I liked about the genre of this book was even though it was fiction; it still had true facts about life during the war. Typically, girls would appreciate this book more because it is based on a young girl's life. In some parts of this novel I just could not put down the book because there was a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter. An example of a cliffhanger in this story is,\\" She sat there a minute longer, her heart pounding, thinking that this was truly the worst lie she had ever told.\\" Lily's Crossing would be an educational and interesting book to choose."},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thought this book was VERY well written.

The genre of this book is Realistic Fiction. The characters in the book were Lily, her grandmother, her father, and her friend Albert. The setting of this book was Rockaway during World War II. The problem was that Lily's father had gone to fight in the war. Lily was really mad that her father was leaving because her mother had died and she would have to stay with her grandmother. She did not want to stay with this relative. Then to make matters worse, her friend Margaret had moved away because of the war. She thinks she's all alone until she meets a new friend, Albert.

Lily Mollahan, a young girl, lost her mom when she was very little. Her father and grandmother are the only ones left to take care of Lily. Every summer, Lily's family goes to Rockaway, New York to stay at their beach house. But this summer, things don't go the way Lily wants it to go.

Lily cannot imagine what it would be like to be in Albert's place. They didn't really get along in the beginning, but their friendship comes into action when they save a drowning kitten and care for it. But then, Lily tells an incredible lie that may kill Albert. She is also very worried for her father, after hearing the news that many soldiers in France have been killed. What will happen to Albert? And will Lily's father make it back safe? These questions are all answered in this incredible book. Although, I usually don't like historical fiction, but this book was very exciting. It's definitely a page-turner. Patricia Reilly Giff is so descriptive with all her words. She makes you imagine as if the beach was really there.

The book starts out when Lily moves to Rockaway and her dad is out helping U.S.A. on the battlefield. She only has her grandma to accompany her during her stay. Another family called the Orbans have a boy called Albert who fleed from Hungary to be safe from the war. Albert and Lily build a relationship starting with Albert asking for swimming lessons. They later find a lost kitten and sneak into a movie for fun. They steadly bond closer together when one day Lily finds out Albert wants to learn to swim, across the Alantic Ocean to get his sister back from Europe where she is being taken car of when she was sick. Then, one day, Albert tries to go to Europe on a boat during a storm in the bay. Luckly, Lily saves him be grabbing onto his lifejacket against the wave and pushed Albert into the boat that goes to shore. This book's end is filled with understanding and heart touching.I recommend this book because it contains many things that lead to understanding life and friendship. Lily's Crossing shows this in the adventures Albert and Lily had together, like care for the kitten or sneaking in to watch a movie. Understanding life in displayed in when Lily is thinking about the war and looking for Albert in the bay, or when Grandma was explaining to the two friends why pappa is at war, Albert's parents at Hungary, and Lily's friend is away. This Newbery shows life changing in World War Two, and how a person is affected. These are the reasons why I would recommend this book to be read.My favorite part of this Newbery is when Lily rescuses Albert during a small storm in the bay. But in the meantime, she thinks of what her father told her in the letter and her and her lies. The pappa (who is at war) told Lily in a letter about the promise, a promise that her friend (Albert) had made to her. And the next thing was about her lying. Lily lied a lot and it was like a habit. Lying had also caused Albert to be stuck in a boat during a small storm because Lily lied saying a ship was going to be waiting to take them to Europe. The reason a choose this as my favorite part is it taught lying's consequences and a promise means a lot."},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The Best Book is here!

When Lily's beloved father must go overseas and her best friend moves away, Lily fears that her summer at the family's vacation home on the Atlantic Ocean has been ruined. However, she becomes friends with Albert, a Hungarian refugee who also fears for loved ones overseas.

While she and Albert wait for loved ones to cross the Atlantic and join them in America, they form a friendship that crosses cultural boundaries.

Will father come back? The author Patricia Reilly Giff gives the reader suspense with lots of questions. Will father get back okay? Read the book and find out.In this book, the theme maybe be \\" Friends consist of love, care, and kindness\\" My evidence to this theme is Lily met a friend Albert which she thought she would hate but she really met him and he was one of the best friends she ever had.Put aside all the suspense and post-its your going to have. The one thing I noticed when I looked at the book was the \\"Newberry Honor Award\\" This award was given to these books in 1921 and has come to represent the beset in children's literature. So there's no way this can be a good book for the soul.Giffs well writing and imagination makes these characters have had. Personally, I had so many connections with this book that it made me feel like Lily was my very own sister. For example, Lily has a hard time meeting friends and so do I. This book teaches you a good lesson how to get to know people in their own special ways.Patricia Reilly Giff, started out wanting to write stories by just picking up a book for the first time. She says, \\" I thought it must be a marvelous thing to just print the pages.\\" You can tell she had a dream from the very start. Patricia's education includes a B.A degree from Marymount Collect, an MA from St.Johns University, and a Diploma in Reading and Doctorate of Humane Letters from Hofstra. All of Patricia writing comes from her experiences or stories she has heard. When Patricia was young her favorite books included Little Women, The Secret Garden, the Black Sue Barton books, and finally the Nancy Drew Books.

It was about Lilly, who must be at least six. Her mother died and her father is kind of strange. She goes away to their summer home to live with the grandma. Grandma is rude and extremly mean to poor Lilly. Then Lilly's best friend moves away. Then her dad leaves to go work in a factory. She is not sure what to do. Grandma is even meanier than before. Then a new nieghbor moves in. He seems nice. Lilly lies a lot, but she can swim. The new nieghbor can't. SHe decides to teach him how to. Then she discovers that he lives with his aunt and uncle. His parents are across the ocean. Lilly lies and tells him that he can swim accross the ocean. The retard actually believs her. Then he trys to get home by swimming in the middel of a hurricane. Pointless. Then Lilly discovers what happened and rescues him. In the end, her grandma says that she is heroic and doesn't even dicipline her. Lilly keeps on lying. Lilly's grandma should have really punished her. I mean, she could have gotten herself and ALbert killed. Then the whole town thinks she is a hero. This book is set during WW1.

Lily's Crossing was a book about friendship and both hard and happy times. Lily made a wonderful new friend, Albert, in Rockaway. This all happened during the summer of 1944, at the height of World War II. Everything occurred after Margaret, Lily's best friend, left Rockaway, Beach because her father was transferred to a new city were they manufactured bombers. Lily also had a difficult time dealing with her Poppy (father) leaving to help win the war. Read and discover the adventures and risks Lily and Albert experienced which built their friendship throughout the summer in Rockaway. Our feelings throughout this story were changing constantly. At different parts we both cried and shared happy and sad emotions with one another. Lily's Crossing is suspenseful, well written, and can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"Lily's Crossing (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lily's Crossing, a popular Newberry Honor Book, is wonderful for readers of all ages. Patricia Reilly Giff brings the whole story to life with her amazing adventures and her remarkable characters. Lily, an eleven-year-old girl with a life full of happiness, is living through the tough times of World War II. Her father has to move away to help strengthen America in the war. It doesn't end there! Every summer Lily goes to the beach with her friends but not the summer that her father leaves.

They became best friends, but can they stay out of trouble with her lying? Will Lily say something that can cost Albert his life?This book is highly recommended because it shows just how important friendship can be. Lily is an amazing girl who shares her wonderful world with everyone. Her story can help many people during rough times with friends because she teaches people never to give up on friends. When Lily realizes that her best friend must move away, she feels miserable! She and Albert have their rough times at the beginning, but in the end, they become best of friends! The book also presents life during World War II.

One of the reasons why I liked it was that it had good voice. It had such good voice that when Poppy came home I cried out loud as I read. I also liked the book because I like historical fiction. The events that happened in the book could have happened in history in 1942. Also, it was about an immigrant from Hungary whose sister is in France with the Nazis. I loved Lily's Crossing because I never knew what would happen next, because of the way the problem was set up. The probem is Lily tells Albert she can take him to Europe.

She loves to go to a place where no one really knows her--they don't know she doesn't do well in school, she lies all of the time and makes up stories, and she doesn't have friends. Lily does have a friend in Rockaway--Margaret has been her friend since they could walk.This summer is different, though.

He may be gone a very long time, and he has to leave Lily all alone with her grandmother. Terrible!But then Albert, a boy about Lily's age, arrives at Rockaway. He speaks English with a heavy accent, and Lily soon learns he is a refugee from the war. Will Lily be able to become his friend and stop her cycle of lies?I liked that over the course of the summer, Lily discovers things about her grandmother she hadn't seen before, and that strengthens their relationship.

The lecture hall was always jammed to overflowing, because even on a bad day Nash was really something! Nevertheless, the book was subsequently very useful, with lots of ideas about game-theoretic approaches to real-world problems.Nash didn't think too highly of this book (too much non-mathematical stuff), but thought it the best available at the time not written by his arch-enemy, Von Neumann!"},{"Title":"Games and Decisions: Introduction and Critical Survey","review":"This overview of game theory and decisions is a great into the problems and ideas behind game theory.

The reading in the main text can be very low yield at times, as he is often simply musing, explaining the implications of certain ideas without much mathematical analysis. This is basically a very long primer on game theory, which ends up often explaining what is intuitively obvious based on his previous expositions.So why 5 stars? For starters the book is quite comprehensive, but where I found this book really shines is the appendices, which comprise roughly a fourth of the book and are really interesting. They address topics in high yield fashion simply getting to the mathematical methods: A probabilistic theory of utility, The minimax theorem, Geometrical Interpretation of Games, Linear Programming and Games, Methods for solving Games, Recursive Games, and Games of Survival.A mathematician may not find anything in this book that is new to him other than an explanation of what game theory is and a vocabulary for reading and writing about game theory, but a non-mathematician (like me) will likely find some very interesting topics presented in the appendices."},{"Title":"Games and Decisions: Introduction and Critical Survey","review":"You need calculus to appreciate this one.But it is still very good. Like a dinner made by a top chef with the finest possible materials, it still may not be to your personal taste, no matter how well made it is. \\"Games and Decisions\\" is of limited utility for non-mathematicians, especially the attorneys and liberal arts majors that make decisions for nations.The maths are mostly over my head, and I was only really able to follow one out of four pages (on the average) of the book. Nevertheless, from what I could appreciate, I learned a lot about the nature of utility, reiterative games, non-zero sum games, conditions of certainty and uncertainty, etc, as well as a lot of 'special case' games in the appendices.I can see that this is the work of masters, but it is not something I can fully appreciate.E.

Functional genomics, on the other hand, assumes the existence of a complete genome sequence, and then attempts to elucidate the functional properties of each gene. Motivated by the completion of the sequencing of the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana in 2000, the authors of the articles in this book discuss the more recent developments in plant functional genomics. Even though it is written for experts in the field, with some concentrated effort and a thorough perusal of the references, non-experts (such as this reviewer) who are curious about these developments should find the book worthwhile. Because of the interests of this reviewer, which lie predominantly in the biochemistry and biology of photosynthesis, and the genetic engineering of the chloroplast, the review will be restricted to the two articles that discuss these topics.In the article \`Chloroplast Proteomics' by Klaas J. van Wijk, the author believes that the study of the proteome of plastids is advantageous because of the reduced complexity of the problem, if compared to the proteomics of a total cell. The author illustrates this reductionist philosophy in the dividing up of the chloroplast proteome into six different \\"subproteomes\\" so as to make the identification and characterization of proteins more straightforward. These subproteomes are the inner and outer envelope, the soluble stroma, the tight and loose peripheral thylakoids, the soluble lumen, and the integral membrane. This division, the author believes, makes experimental determination of the proteins much more straightforward. He focuses his attention in the article on those experimental techniques that allow large sets of proteins to be predicted. Emphasis is placed on the way in which proteomics has contributed to the understanding of the biology of plastids. The author also takes great care in distinguishing large-scale transcript analysis from proteomic analysis, believing that both approaches are complementary, and gives references to the literature that support this viewpoint.The role of statistical and mathematical techniques in proteomics, such as the use of hidden Markov models, is readily apparent in the article. Noting that the majority of the plastid proteome is encoded by the nuclear genome with the proteins being synthesized as precursor proteins with N-terminal \`cleavable transit peptides' (cTPs), the author lists a few Websites for obtaining software, such as TargetP and Predotar, to identify cTPs and also lists other predictors and plastid proteomics databases cited in the chapter.There are many very interesting facts reported in the chapter. One of these concerns the phylogenetic analysis of the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana, which reveals that it has its origins in bacteria, but during the long process of evolution many other genes that encode for plastid proteins were acquired. Another concerns the use of hidden Markov models as predictors for alpha-helical transmembranes. Still another concerns the experimental techniques used for the identification and characterization of the plastid proteome, such as mass spectrometry, cyclotron resonance, and electrophoresis. Readers with knowledge of physics will certainly appreciate the discussion of these techniques.In the article \`Functional Characterization of the Photosynthetic Apparatus in Arabidopsis thaliana' by H. V. Scheller, C. Lunde, A. Haldrup, and P. E. Jensen, the authors emphasize that a substantial number of the genes of a plant, around ten percent, are involved in photosynthesis, and interestingly, have their origins in cyanobacteria. They are careful to point out both the advantages and disadvantages in using Arabidopsis to study photosynthesis, with the main advantage clearly being the availability of its complete genome. The primary focus of the article is on the function of proteins in the thylakoid membrane and the authors do not discuss stromal processes or transport processes in the chloroplast.For the photosystem II (PSII) the authors give a list of the genes making up this system. They include in this list the location of the gene, i.e. whether it is in the nuclear or plastid genome, the protein for which it encodes, its molecular mass, its major function, and the accession number. Those readers interested in studying the effects on photosynthesis due to the switching off of these genes will find ample discussion in this article, with attention given to the nuclear-encoded subunits. The authors emphasize that not much is known about the chloroplast-encoded PSII proteins in Arabidopsis.As an example of the effect of the knockout of genes, the authors discuss how the quantum yield of PSII electron transport and oxygen evolution can be decreased by the knockout in one of the psbO genes. They also discuss the destabilization of PSII dimers due to the reduction of the PsbW protein. This discussion is interesting in that no observable change in the phenotype was observed despite a fifty percent reduction in PSII activity.Still another interesting discussion in this article regards the role of the Lhcb proteins in Arabidopsis, which are involved in light harvesting. For the Lhcb4 and Lhcb5 proteins, the authors describe an experiment in which these two proteins were down-regulated using an antisense approach. It is interesting to note that growth was not affected in the plants lacking Lhcb4 or Lhcb5, but that the PSII content was increased in the antisense plants. The authors conclude from this that the ratio between PSI and PSII is highly optimized in plants. A mutated plant with defects in one photosystem has a large capacity to compensate for the defects. For Lhcb2, the authors discuss an antisense experiment for one of the three lhcb2 genes that resulted in the largest number of gene products being simultaneously suppressed of any other study to date. Interestingly, the thylakoid structure was not affected by these manipulations, only small changes in the antenna size of PSII were observed, and the rate of photosynthesis was only reduced by about fifteen percent. Growth conditions were the same as the wild type in the laboratory, but fitness was considerably decreased under field conditions."},{"Title":"British Politics: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Tony Wright is a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Labour party, and this puts him in a good position to introduce British politics to the uninitiated. He writes from experience as well as from academic knowledge, and gives many interesting anecdotes from his own experience.His position as an MP, however, also means that he has a few axes to grind, and keeps coming back to a small set of themes:-Strong government is good, but needs better accountability (from Parliament, specifically).-Parliament is a weak institution.-The \\"first-past-the-post\\" election system does not reflect the true opinion of the electorate.-The business of government has become the business of being re-elected.As you read, you may get sick of seeing these same themes repeated again and again. However, they are important issues for discussion.While giving excellent coverage of power from a political perspective, he virtually ignores the power of the media over politics, except to comment \\"Instead of the media feeding off Parliament, as was once the case, it is now more common for Parliament to feed off the media.\\" This could use elaboration in order to properly explain the state of modern British politics.I was recently listening to a discussion on BBC radio 4 about the centers of political power, commentators discussed the increasing concentration of power in the executive (as Wright does). Then one commentator said that the real power is now in the media, and the rest of them agreed unanimously. They had all been thinking in terms of official political positions, but the reality is that power does not always, or even primarily, lie in official places. However, Wright only deals with the politicians' part of this, which is to spin everything.Writing about spin and soundbites, Wright states, \\"Presentation is all. Spin blots out substance. Soundbites substitute for arguments. Repitition replaces originality.\\" Said the kettle to the pot... I guess he misses the irony of writing about soundbites using a series of short, repetitive, sentences. In any case, he scarcely mentions why it is that politicians have gone in for spin: the media.One more cavil is that there are a couple of typographic errors, which is really unacceptable from such a respected press as the OUP.Other than missing out on the power of the media, this is a good summary of the political situation in Britian today, and of how it got there. If you need a readable overview of the British political system and it's workings, this little book will serve your purposes well."},{"Title":"Outcast London: A Study in the Relationship Between Classes in Victorian Society (Peregrine Books)","review":"My mate read this and said it was good lads.

However, since others have already so eloquently dealt with that aspect of the book, I thought it might be fun to dwell on the sci-fi aspect of the book in my review.Written in 1887, this novel is full of predictions about the year 2000. Bellamy gets a few things right, and he gets a few things wrong. Things have changed so radically since his day that it's fun to discover what a person from that time thought might come about in our time.While airplanes and international phonecalls might have been foreseen, who could have imagined computers that understand human speech or even the Walkman - something that's pretty mundane by today's standards? And who could have possibly imagined such bizarre musical genres as disco, techno and rap? I suspect an equal number of surprises are in store for our descendants 130 years down the road.Bellamy doesn't foresee any of the above. Nor does he mention automobiles or recorded music, two ideas that must surely have been under development already in his time. Instead, he foresees a time when various styles of music will be available 24 hours a day via telephone, all provided by real-live musicians. A time when all the public sidewalks of Boston will have awnings to keep the rain off those who get caught out in the middle of a rainstorm. And, if his predictions about how government will be run in our time are flat out wrong, the resulting situation isn't so far off. After all, the vast majority of Americans and many others around the globe live like the kings and queens that ruled their ancestors.But if a greater number of people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and many other parts of the world still live without adequate food and shelter, it only shows that we still have our work cut out for us. (More so than ever today, I suppose one might have to say.)Bellamy's prose is surprisingly easy to read considering how long ago it was written. The reader does stumble across odd expressions here and there, but it's less strange than one might guess it would be. And the strangeness of the prose is part of what makes the reading interesting.Also, the fact that Bellamy's predictions are so different from what one might guess at first thought suggests some interesting differences in thinking and culture between people living in the same country 100 years apart.Decades of carefully crafted propoganda have convinced most Americans that big government is anathema while big business grows and grows until today a company like Wal-Mart has a virtual stranglehold on major suppliers of many types of goods. I agree with the indictment of big government, but I think it's the 'big' part that's the most dangerous thing, no matter what the organization.In summary, I agree with many who feel there's still something to be gained from what we learn in this book despite the gross failure of communism and the problems, large and small, that plague socialist programs like Canadian and European national health care.Visionaries in the business world and the sciences are constantly working on new models for improving our life. Paul Hawken tells some of their stories in his book _The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability_."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Let us start by discussing the characteristics of the modern utopia, which began in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the present. The modern utopia was sometimes isolated by time or by alternate worlds rather than simply by space (such as an island or a mountain top). It also tended to be larger than utopias of the past, sometimes even global in scope. It was no longer treated as a static, unchanging society as much as it was treated like one stage of historical development. It was sometimes (though not always) more high tech than previous utopias. Modern utopias were sometimes (though not always) urban rather than agrarian. Modern utopian writers were more concerned with individual rights and freedoms in utopia, issues which did not bother writers like Plato or Sir Thomas More.There are a great many good modern utopian novels. But I believe that to date there are seven truly great ones. They are Edward Belamy's _Looking Backward_ (1888), William Morris' _News from Nowhere_ (1890), H.G. Wells' _A Modern Utopia_ (1905), Austin Tappin Wright's _Islandia_ (1942), Hermann Hesse's _Magister Ludi_ (1943, trans. 1950), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), and Ursula K. Le Guin's _The Dispossesed_ (1974). These novels form a collective bar of quality. In evaluating the quality of other utopian novels, I hold them to the standards of these works. Does a utopia, for example, have the intellectual rigor of _Walden Two_? Is its setting as concrete and realistic as that of _Islandia_? Does it have the beauty of _News from Nowhere_? The literary subtlety of _The Dispossesed_?What is it, then, that makes Edward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_ so outstanding? To put it simply, it is the _archtypical_ modern utopian novel. It has most of the characteristics listed above. It inspired hundreds of imitations right after it first appeared-- some in agreement, some in the form of rebuttals. Even as late as the 1970s, writers like Mack Reynolds were writing imitations of Bellamy. It has been satirized and parodied. It inspired a short-lived political movement, the Nationalist Party. (At one time, there were over 150 Nationalist Clubs in America.) Whether you are an enthusiast who hands out copies of utopian novels to your friends or a steely-jawed capitalist who gives one-star reviews to utopian novels, you probably think about _Looking Backward_ when you think about utopias.Bellamy's socialistic utopia has been criticised for being mechanistic and impersonal, and many modern readers would probably argue that consolidated government and business is not necessarily better. A third argument advanced against Bellamy (and indeed against a great many other utopian novels) is that he assumes too readily that rational behavior and happiness will follow from the proper social conditions. Yet Bellamy nevertheless has a point. If we are going to live in a truly great society, we must first meet the basic needs of all of its members. They must receive food, clothing, shelter, education, and job opportunities. Bellamy offers a convincing plan to meet these needs, and his satire of the shortcomings and cruelties of a capitalistic society still stings:I cannot do better than to compare society as it was then [the nineteenth century] to a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow. Despite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along such a hard road, the top was covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up out of the dust, their inhabitants could critically discuss the merits of the straining team. (3)Bellamy should also receive some credit for his plot. True, it is thin. But he was the first writer to set a utopia in the future rather than on an island or lost valley, and he was the first to imagine a high-tech utopia on a grand scale. Bellamy is probably not read as much today as he was fifty years ago, but he still deserves attention. Pick up a copy of this novel.Note: There are a number of editions of _Looking Backward_ floating about, but the Broadview edition is especially fine. It is a sturdy, handsomely printed paperback. It has an excellent introduction by Alex MacDonald, a biographical chronology, and a good bibliography. There are a series of appendices of contemporary reviews, commentaries, poems, and excerpts from other utopian writing of the day. It is well worth the few extra dollars that you may spend."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Of all the pictures fun to imagine for the student of socialisms and utopias, American and otherwise, is to visualize a young Aldous Huxley or George Orwell sitting down near their respective public school fire places, during a cold and clammy English afternoon, and reading Looking Backwards. It is very easy for the reader to see Huxley and Orwell, if they did in fact read Bellamy's rather quaint vision of utopia, reflecting to them selves as they wrote their dystopic masterpieces, A Brave New World and 1984, respectively, \\"Alright. But what if...?\\"Just like Huxley's and Orwell's works, Edward Bellamy is reacting to the horrors of his age. Violent confrontations between labor and capital in every corner of the United States were all the rage, and strikes before the age of enforced collective bargaining or binding arbitration were no joke. Imperialist wars in every corner of the world were threatening a world wide war--seemingly every other year. There were rumblings of an international socialist movement that was yearly gaining strength in Europe in spite of serious legal restrictions--while Bellamy was in University in Germany, he would have had a difficult time avoiding knowledge of the imprisonment of SPD leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht as well as the banning of the Party by von Bismarck's government. What most likely struck the most horror into Bellamy, though, was the absolute wretchedness of the slums that so many Americans were trying to survive in, and the inability of anyone to even try to create a way out of it that can not in some way be traced back to self-interest, greed or outright violence.Looking Backward is an attempt to imagine a world where poverty and ignorance are abolished in the sentimental tradition of Charles Dickens--hero of Bellamy and the novel's protagonist Julian West--coupled with a truly novel bureaucratic technocracy. It was at least in part the influence of Bellamy's idealism that Leon Trotsky found most loathsome in American socialism, whether he knew it or not, when he unforgettably called the New York Socialist Party leader, Morris Hillquit \\"the ideal Socialist leader for successful dentists.\\" Marx would likely have written off Bellamy using the language that Julian West uses to describe the Mesmerist, Dr. Pillsbury, who puts him into a one hundred thirteen year catatonic--a mere quack. What both Trotsky and Marx would have grudgingly realized on reading this book is that Bellamy was one of the few people in America in 1887--aside from a handful of socialists, anarchists, and union-syndicalists--who was openly hoping for a day when human beings would leave the realm of necessity and enter the realm of freedom.The world which Julian West enters at the close of the twentieth century, when entreated by Dr. Leete to rouse him self, is a radically altered one. As Rip Van Winkle woke up in the Catskills to find that he no longer owed his allegiance to a King and at first finds that this is a truly bewildering situation, West finds a world even more bewildering to a Boston Brahmin. Complete and total state ownership of all means of production had been achieved during his long sleep, but even more shocking was that the United States was no longer a country suffering from any social ills. Cooperation reigned in the place of the pecuniary interests of individuals. The mentality of dog eat dog, which bred both ridiculous ostentation and indefensible poverty, had simply vanished leaving in its place a world of light labor, high culture, and nearly universal contentment. The state is run by disinterested pensioners--yes, Bellamy believes such a political animal would exist--in such a way as to ensure that the profit motive does not exist, and all that men, and women, truly compete for is glory. All work to the benefit of this cooperative commonwealth to the best of their ability and equality in the most literal terms. This is not Julian West's Boston.What becomes apparent to the reader traveling with Julian in this new world is that in many ways Julian has not left the close of the nineteenth century. Boston at the close of the twentieth century, in spite of the technological revolutions and complete reordering of the state and economy, is very much the same for Julian West. He enjoys the highest of high culture through the intricate wall card telephone system of his acoustically treated room; drinks fine wine and smokes great cigars; at communal kitchens all eat cuisine that only the leisured rich could have afforded a century before. The blessings of civilization are enjoyed by all alike to the point that where, affectively, all have become members of a universally leisured single class. The impoverished and the working classes of America, seemingly, had nothing to lose but their poverty, ignorance, and despair. The truly leisured class had, seemingly, only their haughtiness and arrogance to lose. This is where some of my troubles with Edward Bellamy begin, and where some of his own prejudices become apparent.Bellamy identifies the world in his Boston as having been broken down into truly distinct peoples. As he puts it at the opening of his work, America was organized upon \\"the immemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as they may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant.\\" The ignorance and poverty that so horrified Bellamy was not the only thing about the poor that seems to have been truly their own seems to have died with them.In a truly disturbing way, any notion of how Boston, and America, changed between 1850 and 1887, escapes Bellamy's consciousness. The \\"labor question\\" has been solved through nationalization and making all people work, in one capacity or other, if they want to have anything other than bread, water and a prison cell. What have happened to the Babel of ethnics, the massive networks of parochial organizations, ethnic clubs and sport organizations that were the wellsprings of life for so many Irish and Irish Americans? There is no evidence in the improved Boston of the late twentieth century of anything other type of respectability than Bourgeoisie Protestant respectability. The people of this appallingly genteel world may very have only the variety of one of their singular stores, which have absolutely no variety in products. The twenty-first century reader is left with the truly weird possibility that Julian West and Dr. Leete, after having exhausted the topic of how much better the present is than the past, will have nothing left to talk about but yachting and literature--what with conflict being abolished.The transplanting of Victorian notions of how the world should be run is nowhere more apparent, and more disturbing for its implications, than when West and Leete speak about what portions of the world are organized on the system that America is organized upon. As Dr. Leete explains to West how international relations work in this era, he states:\\"[T]he great nations of Europe as well as Australia, Mexico and parts of South America, are now organized industrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the evolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a loose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international council regulates the mutual intercourse commerce of the members of the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions.\\"The white man's burden and civilizing mission does not go the way of the self-interest in idyllic Boston of the future, and an idealist as deeply committed to social justice as Bellamy could not conceive, even in fiction, of any group outside of the boundaries of western society having achieved the level of sophistication that they could live in a classless society. One has to wonder what the old Confederate states would finally have looked like, and whether old rebels and unionists shook hands across a bloody chasm while educating American blacks up to civilization. Whatever, Bellamy thinks about race in America, and how West would have thought about it--the only black we see in this book is the faithful body servant of West in the nineteenth century, one Sawyer, and nothing of consequence comes out of his mouth--we can easily surmise that his utopia was close to being for whites only.Though Bellamy's idealism reads as totally genuine, Looking Backward has some very vital imagination lacking in it. Bellamy has his cooperative commonwealth based upon the principle that all work which serves the common good is equally important, but Bellamy finds it necessary to have West paling around with Leete, a retired physician. In a world where leisure and not labor is the rule, and where the masses are washed and wholly civilized by the exacting standards of an upper class education lasting until at least the twenty-first year, why was it necessary to have Leete be a someone that would be a portrait bourgeoisie respectability? The laboring intellectual, of astute and subtle brilliance with the gnarled hands of a quarter century of hard labor, is the glorious possibility of this world which Bellamy creates for the reader but never actually realizes. Though slightly saddening, this fact probably made the book more readable to the members of America's upper class, and possibly even more plausible to them.From the vantage of the twenty-first century, Bellamy has an ability to appear hopelessly ridiculous. He could not have known how collectivism would lead to mass murder on a colossal scale in Europe and Asia in the Twentieth century--though he would not have been surprised how much of it was done by men and women who looked on the red flag as their own. Nor could he have foreseen how the \\"backwards races\\" of the world would struggle for their own freedom in the second half the twentieth century, and have several become great powers in their own right by its close. Radio, motion pictures, television, digitized recording devices, the internet, air travel and the hydrogen bomb attached to an intercontinental ballistic missile probably never entered his imagination. He should not, though, be faulted for this. His future was one infinitely brighter than the one the world suffered through, as the nations of the world gorged themselves on the most murderous wars and massacres in mankind's history. For all the novels faults and short comings, it is a profound piece of republican idealism, premised on the very American belief that people coming together can actually change lives."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"If you think that the idea of e-cash was firstly mentioned in Robert Hendrickson's &quot;The Cashless Society&quot;, then you must have not read this book yet.To many novel lovers, this book may not be as attractive as many great masterpieces.

Everyone has ageeable work, and the Victorian distortions of relations between men and women have fallen away. All of industry, in fact all of society meshes harmoniously under the benevolent wisdom of the central planners.Back in 1888, it seemed like a good idea. That was before the rise of national-scale communism, and long before its fall in Europe. Somehow, when it finally came, it wasn't as shiny as stories like this made out.It's easy to criticise in retrospect. Perhaps the central fallacy is that human nature will change so that \\"The coarser motives [of dread of want and desire for luxury] ... have been replaced by higher motives unknown to the mere wage-earners of your age.\\" It's not going to happen, and it didn't happen when the experiment was tried.The fact is that communism really does work in specialized environments like some monasteries. It is easy to see the higher motives and dedication, as well as the communal living at work there. That make it tempting to create a causal relationship between personal dedication and communalist practices.The fallacy, of course, is that the higher motives of a monastery have just about nothing to do with the monks' housekeeping arrangments. The household economy serves the devotion, it neither drives it nor is driven by it. Also, a monastery is a relatively simple environment, with a small and homogeneous population, without child rearing or family complexities, and usually with access to the economy and services of the greater world. However successful such an enclave might be, scaling it to a full and heterogeneous society is difficult at best.Still, Bellamy's book preserves a snapshot of his age's thinking. Almost 120 years later, it helps us understand the ideals behind the social experiments that have since been relegated to the \\"dustbin of history\\".//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"\\"Looking Backward\\" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth. But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received. Bellamy was 31 when this book was published. As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep. But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system. Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates. His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order. These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words. I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues. And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston. But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting? We never find out, because he doesn't tell us. In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires. Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale. He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings. And there is a glaring error in his utopian world: He does not take into account human nature. He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more. As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating. Paraphrasing here: Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.

Much like Rip Van Winkle or The Time Machine, except the narrative is extremely dry and most of the novel is dialogue between the unintentional time traveler and his hosts. It's only 120 pages long, but it took me almost 2 weeks to finish reading it because a couple paragraphs in I would start nodding off. Eventually I found that it was more effective to just skim the book, as I could easily gather the main points hidden in the rambling dialogue.I don't know why Bellamy didn't just scrap the generic plot and offer a socialist manifesto like Karl Marx or Adolf Hitler. Bellamy's ideas are wonderful, but the narrative sucks. His assumptions about 21st century America are way off. For instance, he imagines that America peacefully gives up its ineffecient capitalist ways and seemlessly takes up socialism. Given the impassioned debates about government run health care, it is proposterous to think that all the gun totting red necks in this country would sit idly by as the government took over everything.If you really want to experience a compelling, as well as entertaining socialist society I suggest the smurfs."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"If you're expecting some sort of retro science fiction novel, let me warn you off. \\"Looking Backward\\" is a philosophical tract in the form of a colloquy in the form of a romance novel.A fascinating, heartfelt and audacious socioeconomic treatise, it lays out ways in which America might come to terms with the staggering inequalities and unrest of the late nineteenth century.

LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed.\\" Still, I do not mean to give the impression that Bellamy's 1888 novel gets this honor by default. Magazine covers in 1984 were devoted to judging the track record of George Orwell's dystopian classic and I would argue that Bellamy deserves the same sort of consideration now that we have reached the 21st century. I certainly intend to use him to that end in my upcoming Utopian Images class.At the end of the 19th century Bellamy creates a picture of a wonderful future society. Bellamy's protagonist is Julian West, a young aristocratic Bostonian who falls into a deep sleep while under a hypnotic trance in 1887 and ends up waking up in the year 2000 (hence the novel's sub-title). Finding himself a century in the future in the home of Doctor Leete, West is introduced to an amazing society, which is consistently contrasted with the time from which he has come. As much as this is a prediction of a future utopia, it is also a scathing attack on the ills of American life heading into the previous turn of the century. Bellamy's sympathies are clearly with the progressives of that period.\\"Looking Backward\\" does not have a narrative structure per se. Instead West is shown the wonders of Boston in the year 2000, with his hosts explaining the rationale behind the grand civic improvements. For example, he discovers that every body is happy and no one is either rich or poor, all because equality has been achieved. Industry has been nationalized, which has increased efficiency because it has eliminated wasteful competition. This is a world with no need of money, but every citizen has a sort of credit card that allows them to make individual purchases, although everyone has the same montly allowance. In Bellamy's world is so ideal that it does not have any police, a military, any lawyers, or, best of all, any salesmen. Education is so valued that it continues until students reach the age of 21, at which point all citizens enter the work force, where they will stay until the age of 45. Men and women are compensated equally, but there are some distinctions between job on the basis of gender, and pregnancy and motherhood are taken into account.Bellamy was living during the start of the Industrial Revolution, and like Francis Bacon and Tomasso Campanella who wrote during the height of the Age of Reason, he sees science and human ingenuity as being what will solve all of humanity's problems. He does not get into too many details regarding the comforts of modern living in the future, but there are several telling predictions (e.g., something very much like radio). However, it is clear that Bellamy is writing primarily to talk about economics and sociology, especially because he always compares his idealized future with the problems of his own time.Obviously Bellamy's critique of the late 19th century will be of less interest to today's students that his various predictions on the both the future and an ideal world, unless they are specifically studying the American industrial revolution. But the latter two are enough to make \\"Looking Backward\\" deserve to be included in a current curriculum and I am looking foward to how well my students think Bellamy predicted the world in which we now find ourselves living."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward 2000-1887&quot; remains the most successful and influential utopian novel written by an American writer mainly because the competition consists mostly of dystopian works, from Jack London's &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; to Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; or science fiction works like Ursula K.

I certainly intend to use him to that end in my upcoming Utopian Images class.At the end of the 19th century Bellamy creates a picture of a wonderful future society. Bellamy's protagonist is Julian West, a young aristocratic Bostonian who falls into a deep sleep while under a hypnotic trance in 1887 and ends up waking up in the year 2000 (hence the novel's sub-title). Finding himself a century in the future in the home of Doctor Leete, West is introduced to an amazing society, which is consistently contrasted with the time from which he has come. As much as this is a prediction of a future utopia, it is also a scathing attack on the ills of American life heading into the previous turn of the century. Bellamy's sympathies are clearly with the progressives of that period.&quot;Looking Backward&quot; does not have a narrative structure per se. Instead West is shown the wonders of Boston in the year 2000, with his hosts explaining the rationale behind the grand civic improvements. For example, he discovers that every body is happy and no one is either rich or poor, all because equality has been achieved. Industry has been nationalized, which has increased efficiency because it has eliminated wasteful competition. This is a world with no need of money, but every citizen has a sort of credit card that allows them to make individual purchases, although everyone has the same montly allowance. In Bellamy's world is so ideal that it does not have any police, a military, any lawyers, or, best of all, any salesmen. Education is so valued that it continues until students reach the age of 21, at which point all citizens enter the work force, where they will stay until the age of 45. Men and women are compensated equally, but there are some distinctions between job on the basis of gender, and pregnancy and motherhood are taken into account.Bellamy was living during the start of the Industrial Revolution, and like Francis Bacon and Tomasso Campanella who wrote during the height of the Age of Reason, he sees science and human ingenuity as being what will solve all of humanity's problems. He does not get into too many details regarding the comforts of modern living in the future, but there are several telling predictions (e.g., something very much like radio). However, it is clear that Bellamy is writing primarily to talk about economics and sociology, especially because he always compares his idealized future with the problems of his own time.Obviously Bellamy's critique of the late 19th century will be of less interest to today's students that his various predictions on the both the future and an ideal world, unless they are specifically studying the American industrial revolution. But the latter two are enough to make &quot;Looking Backward&quot; deserve to be included in a current curriculum and I am looking foward to how well my students think Bellamy predicted the world in which we now find ourselves living. This particular edition, while not a Norton Critical Edition, does have a nice selection of additional readings in the back consisting of some of Bellamy's other writings as well as contemporary works by writers of other utopias and social commentaries such as William Morris, Charlotte Perkins, Henry Lloyd George, and William Dean Howells. All of these appendices provide a context for Bellamy's novel in terms of late 19th-century utopianism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, is a vision of a utopian Boston of the year 2000 seen in the eyes of the fictional, nineteenth century Bostonian, Julian West. Having fallen asleep for 113 years Mr. West is awakened by the Leetes family. Over the course of the next several days he discovers a multitude of changes that have occurred during his long slumber. Most importantly or most overarchingly is the idea of social change that has occurred. While many other authors' ideas of the future have involved images of great technological change, they have not demonstrated an adaptation of human behavioral change. In Bellamy's eyes however, there are some technological innovations but the primary changes occur in the areas of economics that leads to dramatic changes in the human condition. It seems to be a world in which, once everyone decided not to fight over money any longer, then people were capable of getting along. Public service and public caring for one another is the norm. In the USA of Bellamy's 2000, the government is a centralized state with the military as the primary employer. Bellamy refers to it as a corporate state and the industrialized army. In his world military and service go hand in hand. In his exploration Bellamy addresses many issues that would be of concern to not only his readers but to readers to this day. Obviously there is the economic foundation of both the nineteenth and the imaginary twentieth century of the book. This leads directly to the issues of labor. Issues of international economics, law and prison all come up in West's exploration of his newly discovered world. Again each of these issues is ultimately related and hence resolved through economics. Women's equality remains an unresolved although tremendously improved issue (an understatement). Women's issues are in some ways resolved because they are no longer the unpaid domestics that they were in Bellamy's day. There is less need for lawyers and understanding the law because things have been resolved with economics so that people are fighting over civil issues and since everyone has they same economic status then there is no need to steal. There is a great sense in Bellamy's writing that social Darwinism plays a significant role. Clearly there is an idea of eugenics (reminiscent of the Oneida community) where the bad parts of society are simply bread out of society. &quot;Like the social Darwinists of his day, Bellamy viewed character traits as inborn and believed that the morally as well as the physically unfit must be weeded out if human beings were to evolve to a higher state.&quot; (Strauss, 76) What must be addressed about this particular work is the influence that it exhibited on other writers in Bellamy's day and after. &quot;It influenced movements of Christian socialism wherever they appeared it positions echo and re-echo on George Bernard Shaw, Veblen, Debs, Norman Thomas and the early Zionists.&quot; (Halewood, 451) Although the book is missing from today's list of important contributions to American thought, the book's enormous popularity at the end of the previous century must be acknowledged. &quot;Looking Backward was possibly the most popular utopian novel ever written, igniting a nationwide social reform movement and leaving an enduring mark upon the rising generation of American intellectuals and writers.&quot; (McClay, 264) The problems that it raises for us, as readers near the end of the twentieth century, are in areas of middle-class elitism, overt ideology, and the lack of demonstrative communal activity. This book is, however, a powerful example of a novel that moved from text to social reform movement. It has been said that the book is not a well-written piece of literature but that the significance of the text is in its effect on the society in which it was consumed. A utopian vision of a future world does two very important functions. One, it shows a more perfect vision of a happy world. But inherently in that vision is the need to discuss or point out all of the elements of the current world that make for an unhappy world. This book had profound influence not so much in the literary world, although numerous other utopian texts were produced in the years following its publication. With Bellamy we find a book that influenced nationalism throughout the United States and lead to socialistic reforms in policy in the early part of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I really wasn't expecting much out of this book. I'm not a socialist or a communist, so I figured I'd be sneering at much of what Bellamy had to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself genuinely attracted to the book. Bellamy wrote a socialist tract in the form of a novel. He gets his points across and weaves in a romance tale along the way. I should say that the ending was no surprise to me, as I kind of figured out what was going to happen along the way.The book begins with our hero, Julian West, who is a quite successful gent in 1888 Boston. West is quite the dandy, and is engaged to be married to a lovely young lady. West has trouble sleeping, so he regularly employs the services of a &quot;mesmerizer&quot; to help him sleep. The problem with this is that someone must be around to wake him up or the mesmerizing process might cause a long slumber. You can guess what happens. West is discovered in 2000 in a world that is a far cry from the world of the late 19th century. The world has changed in a radical way, and the family that finds West, the Leetes, want to know all about his old world.The new world is a socialist/communist utopia in which the old problems of unemployment, war, inequality and the like have been solved forever. The rest of the book is a discussion between West and Dr. Leete about the new world and how it contrasts to the old world. In this one has to be fairly impressed with Bellamy's predictions. Bellamy predicted credit cards and even interactive music that can be piped into a person's room.A romance between West and Dr. Leete's daughter Edith eventually blooms, but I won't spoil the surprise this entails. The romance theme was put in to make the socialist text more palatable for the 19th century reader. It could conceivably do the same for the modern reader, although if you're reading this book you are probably reading it for its political value.I certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in utopian works, or 19th century political views. What is really neat is while you read this book you can easily find yourself believing that this could work, until you remember something that Bellamy never knew about. The utter failure of the Soviet Union, and Communism in general. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. The fact that it was published in 1888, is mind blowing. It is still very much relevant to today's society. There are ton of great ideas that really make the reader think about. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is open minded to new ideas, a forward looking thinker, and/or interested in the structure of society. This is easily one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The first thing that stands out from Edward Bellamy's 1887 socialist utopian novella \\"Looking Backward\\" is that this is NOT a good book. What it is instead is one of those literary fads that temporarily grip the nation but lack any real staying power beyond some historical significance or maybe as part of a class on the history of popular fiction, American intellectual thought, or progressive politics in the USA. Of course, a lot of great fiction was written in order to make social or political point: \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" \\"Catch-22,\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" all come to mind. But what makes these works succeed is the fact that the message seems secondary to a powerful, moving, or darkly humorous story. \\"Pecado de Omisi&oacute;n\\" by Ana Mar&iacute;a Matute, for example, hides strong criticism of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in what appears to be a surrealist tale of a shepherd and his tyrannical cousin. Overall, I got the impression that \\"Looking Backward\\" was the result of Bellamy's awareness that most people are not going to read an economic treatise.\\"Looking Backward\\" is just that: a treatise thinly disguised as science fiction. On the one hand, in the information-driven society of the *real* twenty-first century it's certainly not unreasonable for any random citizen to be able to offer an adequate explanation on what makes our society tick. Yet Dr. Leete, a physician, rambles on and on about the minute workings of the government and economy for six uninterrupted pages. The \\"plot\\" itself is as dry as his lectures. For one, the world of 2000 is never fully realized beyond a platform for Bellamy to espouse his economic theories. (Some of which are astonishing in their hypocrisy. In order to eliminate corruption, for example, he imagines voting restricted to only a few \\"honorary members\\" of society.) Bellamy provides no description of the Boston of the future except that it's apparently very grand, splendid, clean, and orderly. There is simply no feeling of SETTING: the feelings and images evoked by descriptive prose. The characters, meanwhile, are as flat as the pages, exhibiting no unique personality, no true emotion, no life as anything other than cardboard props to people a plot.So needless to say, learning of the book's extraordinary popularity was rather surprising. Not only because Bellamy just couldn't write, but the message as well. Quite frankly, I found Bellamy's vision of the future extremely disturbing. A quote at the end of the book sums it up: \\"Some time after this it was that I recall a glimpse of myself . . . looking at a military parade. A regiment was passing. . . Here at last were order and reason, an exhibition of what intelligent co&ouml;peration can accomplish. The people who stood looking on with kindling faces, - could it be that the sight had for them no more than but a spectacular interest? Could they fail to see that it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under one control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were, able to vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly, could they fail to comprehend the scientific manner in which the nation went to war with the unscientific manner in which it went to work?\\" In other words, Bellamy's ideal society is essentially one big military organization.In the Year 2000, the state supplies everything, down to the awnings that automatically come down to cover the sidewalks during rain. In other words, there is no conflict: no reason to exercise emotional strength, no learning experience, no reason to take initiative or be innovative, and absolutely nothing to inspire art or literature. How can you compose a compelling story when everyone is satisfied and happy? Everything is regimented, everything falls into place. \\"You're just another brick in the wall,\\" so to speak. The superficiality of the Leete family characters was not merely the result of poor writing, I feel, but the lack of room in their society for individuality. (What if you WANTED to walk in the rain?) But even in Bellamy's own time, people expressed unease with his vision. There were several unauthorized dystopic sequels to \\"Looking Backward\\" that were published shortly afterwards. Several deal with revolution and an overblown socialist bureaucracy on the brink of collapse; in another, Julian West's warnings about the threat of Chinese military invasion are ignored by a populace unable to think for itself and dissent from official state opinion.In the end, \\"Looking Backward\\" is fascinating from anthropological and historical perspective. It was intriguing to see how visions of an ideal world have changed and what is Utopia to one era is Dystopia to another. (Definitely check out the Thomas More story that inspired the entire genre.) But as actual literature, \\"Looking Backward\\" is epic fail."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Julian West is put to sleep by a mesmerizer (a quack) in 1887 and wakes up again in the year 2000. He encounters a Dr. Leete who explains to him in great detail how the world has changed - mainly how it has been transformed into a magnificent socialistic Utopia where everyone is the same. There is no war, no competition, and everyone lives in peace and harmony. Bellamy was a true believer in Marx and his theories and he wrote this book as a pleasing presentation of Socialism and, to him, its saving graces. When the government controlled everything and everyone, he believed everyone would be treated the same and there would be no class/economic differences and struggles. It's kind of laughable, in a way, because it depicts people in a way that seems contrary to human behavior. Bellamy also didn't have the benefit of the 20th century and the horrors inflicted by Stalin, Mao and others in the name of Marx to temper his overly optimistic views. It's a classic, though, of Utopian literature; one might even imagine it the last of its kind, but Utopia will always beckon a fevered imagination that sees great unhappiness in the world."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Written during the era of the worst excesses of the \\"gilded age\\" and some of America's worst early labor upheavals including the Great Strike of 1877 and Haymarket and just prior to the Pullman and Homestead strikes. Looking Backward is an expression of Bellamy's faith that the industrial age and industrial cities could be made to work for all, not just the few. The book, a top seller of its time, above all shows that our ancestors believed they could reach the future without perishing."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Having never really heard of this novel or its author before, I was rather surprised to discover how immensely popular it was at the end of the nineteenth century. Edward Bellamy does an excellent albeit sometimes pedantic job of communicating his socioeconomic views and provides an interesting and informative read, despite the fact that the utopia of his fictional creation is a socialist nightmare in the realm of my own personal philosophy. It is very important to understand the time in which Bellamy was writing, especially for a conservative-minded thinker such as myself who holds many of Bellamy's views as anathema. It was the mid-1880s, a time of great social unrest; vast strikes by labor unions, clashes between workers and managers, a debilitating economic depression. Bellamy, to his credit, in no way comes off as holier than thou; his wealthy protagonist recognizes his own responsibility in seeing the world in the eyes of the more prosperous classes, basically ignoring the plights of the poor and downtrodden, having inherited rather than earned the money he is privileged to enjoy, etc. This makes the character's observations and conclusions very impactful upon the reader.While I do respect Bellamy's views and understand the context in which they germinated, I cannot help but describe his future utopia as nothing less than nave, socialistic, unworkable, and destructive of the individual spirit. Indeed, it sounds to me like vintage Soviet communism, at least in its ideals. Bellamy is a Marxist with blinders on. I should describe the actual novel at this point. The protagonist, an insomniac having employed a mesmerist to help him sleep through the night, finds himself waking up not the following morning in 1887 but in a completely changed world in 2000. His bed chamber was a subterranean fortress of sorts which only he, his servant, and the mesmerist (who left the city that same night) even knew about, and apparently his home proper burned down on that fateful night and thus his servant was clearly unable to bring him out of his trance the following morning. It is only by accident that Dr. Leekes of twentieth-century Boston discovers the unknown tomb and helps resuscitate its remarkable inhabitant. 20th-century life is wholly unlike anything the protagonist has ever known, and the book basically consists of a number of instruction sessions by the Leekes as to how society has been virtually perfected over the preceding 100 years. There is no more war, crime, unhappiness, discrimination, etc. There are no such things as wages or prices, even. All men and women are paid the same by virtue of their being human beings; while money does not exist, everyone has everything they possibly need easily available to them for purchase with special credit cards. Every part of the economy is controlled by the national government, and it is through cooperation of the brotherhood of men that production has exceeded many times over that of privately controlled industries fighting a war against each other in the name of capitalism.Bellamy's future utopia is most open to question in terms of the means by which individualism is supposedly strengthened rather than smothered, how a complex but seemingly set of incentives supposedly keep each worker happy and productive, how invention or improvement of anything is possible in such a world, and how this great society does not in fact become a mirror of Khrushchev's Russian state. Such a society consisting of an \\"industrial army\\" and controlled in the minutest of terms by a central national authority simply sounds like Communism to my ears and is equally as unsustainable. Of course, Bellamy wrote this novel many years before the first corruptions of Marx's dangerous dreams were made a reality on earth. As I said, I disagree with just about everything Bellamy praises, and I think almost anyone would agree his utopia is an impossibility, but I greatly respect the man for his bold, humanitarian vision and applaud his efforts to make the world a better place. In fact, many groups organized themselves along the lines of the world Bellamy envisioned, so the novel's influence on contemporary popular thought is beyond question. Looking Backward remains a fascinating read in our own time.I should make clear that the novel is not completely a dry recitation of socioeconomic arguments and moralistic treatises. Bellamy makes the story of this most unusual of time travelers a most enjoyable one, bringing in an unusual type of old-fashioned romance to supply the beating heart of a novel that had the potential to become overly analytical and thus rather boring reading otherwise. He also managed to grab me by the scruff of the neck and shake me around a couple of times with his concluding chapter, quite shocking me with a couple of unexpected plot twists. This great humanist of the late nineteenth century can teach us all something about what it means to be truly human, although I fear that his socioeconomic theories are themselves far too romanticized to have much practical relevance in the lives of modern men and women."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I continue to rate the skin medica products very highly.

Something that absolutely irked me about it is how even this book, written before George Orwell was already forecasting \\"some of us are more equal than others\\".The author begins by describing a young man in the 19th century who sleeps into the future and retains his current state. He there finds a doctor who's bent on mocking his barbaric culture of the past. The doctor describes a \\"utopia\\" in which every man works, no one is exempt from the working force. Sounds fair until you read a bit further....When an author prints a successful book, they are then exempt from service. They are excused from the working class. Even further, when you read about the politics the author deems the working class incapable of electing the President. Only the elite are capable of making that decision, which includes these successful authors. What a nice little utopia the author has dug out for himself.Edward Bellamy wrote this novel in a time of civil unrest, at a time when the classes were fighting amongst easy other. He deemed it very possible that his ideas may be implemented. Personally I think he was being very opportunistic. People of this era were looking for new means a of social class, so Edward handed them something he knew they would see as a fair solution.I think this book, by attempting to uphold socialism really shows why you it always inevitably fails. People are greedy and corrupted, and an all controlling system like this just invites people to take advantage of it.If you read this novel, prepare for a sneering tone and a mockery of typical culture. Rather hypocritical of the author really, he mocks people of wanting to take advantage of situations for their personal gain, yet at the same time, that's precisely what he did with this novel."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I found an 1898 edition at a local antique store and picked it up for fun. Wow, I am surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed this book! Bellamy wrote the book in 1888 with such promising hopes for the future of America---and the world. As I read it, I struggled to remember that this was written from the point of view of a man who really HADN'T time-traveled to the current day! In the last 30 pages or so, I was met by a big shocker---but then it all turned out alright! Great story full of love, compassion, hope, and some really great ideas.A few points that really stood out to me:In Mr. West's day, menial jobs were held in contempt. The \\"higher class\\" imposed even more contempt on those in menial jobs by looking down on them for holding those jobs. They \\"permitted people to do things for which (they) despised them for doing.\\" Wow...what a huge eye-opener. How sad that Bellamy had hope for our generation to finally have changed that.In the future that Mr. West travels to, library books are accessible to all patrons without having to go through any red tape!In the future, most criminal \\"trials are few, for in most cases the guilty man pleads guilty. When he makes a false plea and is clearly proved guilty, his penalty is doubled.\\" Wow---imagine how society would benefit from that law!Mr. West is shocked to know that in the society of the future, people marry purely for love!One thing I really appreciate about Bellamy's hopeful point of view is that America is still a nation under God. The citizens respect the importance of that even more than they did in Mr. West's past.Such a great book all together!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This book is bad. The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush.

Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"As pointed out in a recent review of this book in Harpers' Magazine, &quot;utopian&quot; writers are often unfairly branded with the brush of the holocaust (or as my fellow Chicagoan says below, Stalinism). This is simply untrue: Stalin was a power hungry thug, and to paint utopians with the racist brush of Hitler is to paint democrats with the racist brush of apartheid (the South African government was democratic as far as whites went). Moreover, Bellamay wasn't alive during these times. ANd nowhere in this book were those who disagreed eliminated - it claims that popular thought evolved to this vision.What I remember most from this view wasn't that I agreed with its ideal society but a feeling of sweetness from its faith in the ultimate goodness of humanity and a willingness not to turn its head from the worst problems of our times or admit defeat to them."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The utopia envisioned by Bellamy is so outrageous that I cannot help but to think that this was a satire. Even without the knowledge that socialist utopias would fail miserably wherever tried, surely no one could possibly believe what Bellamy, who does seem intelligent, pretends to believe. Did he really think that mere love of country, and of fellow man, would inspire everyone to be economically productive? Surely, anyone who believes this has no understanding of human nature. Did he really believe that we would want to live in a society in which a man couldn't sell a five-dollar item to his neighbor without going to the federal government for approval? Did he really believe in a world without war? If this book was meant to be a satire, give Bellamy credit.

I purchase copies to give to friends."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I originally read this book because Isaac Asimov said it was the most boring book he had ever read. In a way he was right. Like \\"Moby Dick\\", the book is much more interesting to have read than to read.The author's purpose was to describe what he thought was the ideal society. Since in 1887 he was living in a society which had resolved seemingly intractable problems like slavery, it seemed to him that a future society might also have solved problems that seemed intractable to his contemporaries.In his imagined society, there is no conflict. Everyone chooses a job, and in return is assured of the necessities of life.Perhaps the best way of describing the defects of the book is to note that the author argues that authors should not be part of this system, but should still be capitalists: in other words the socialism he advocates is for OTHER people. This is an easy pattern to recognise: left-wing politicians today send their own children to private schools, but insist that the public schools are perfect for other people's children. Then they get in their chauffeur-driven limosines to go to a meeting to plan to tax impoverished West Virginia coal-miners to pay to extend the Washington metro system on the grounds that other people shouldn't drive cars."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I happened across this book while reading &#34;the politically incorrect guide to the 60's&#34;.It was noted as a utopian fantasy where the government solves all problems, spreads the wealth around, and all corporations and capitalists are evil.Classic Marxism and typical liberal fantasy!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Oh how lovely.

Much like 1984 by George Orwell, many of the prophecies have fallen short of the mark. The Utopian strain of Bellamys vision is apparent but we have not nearly evolved that much. This book contains a lot of the naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era. Human nature, alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an enjoyable, well written novel. Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does not detract from the story. Julian West is a sympathetic character in spite his aristocratic origin. It should also be stated that some of the predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass. It was stimulating and thought provoking to read this book in the year the story allegedly took place. It should remind us that we have come a long way but we still have a long way yet to go."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"As a novel: there are three characters. The ostensible narrator exists to listen. Dr. Leete exists to preach -- except for one chapter where an actual preacher delivers the sermon (but don't worry, he sounds just like Dr. Leete). And Dr. Leete's young, beautiful daughter exists to fall in love with the narrator. In fact, she was in love with him before she ever met him.One chapter at the end of the novella actually does have human emotion and colorful images -- just one chapter out of dozens.As a prediction of future material progress: failed. Bellamy posits that countries all over the world will introduce radical social reorganizations leading to unbelievable economic progress. But the actual progress shown is paltry: four channels of live music delivered over telephone lines; roll-out awnings for city days. No improvements in transportation. Very little in communication. No new fabrics, no new foods.Dr. Leete does mention, in an aside, that healthy humans in the year 2000 usually live to 85-90 years; and the longer lifespan does figure into his economic plan. In 1900, the average lifespan of people in developed countries was 40-50 years. Even for healthy adults age 60, life expectancy in the US has roughly doubled from 1887 to 2000. So that prediction of increased lifespan and improved health is actually a radical prediction on Bellamy's part. Credit for that. But it's just one thing.In contrast to the lack of material progress, humans have changed their nature more in 100 years of Bellamy's world than in thousands of years of history before it. No more war: no country has an army. They just decided that not having armies would be better for everybody. Similarly, no more corruption. No more greed. No drug addicts, no alcoholics. (They were plentiful in 1887 -- what happened?). No featherbedding. New Bellamy Man just doesn't do these things.Last, on the political economy. Bellamy posits a socialist state -- there's one owner, and most workers work for the single benevolent owner. Except for writers. And magazine editors. And preachers. There's an escape valve in his single-owner socialism: any group of people can hire one of their fellows by agreeing to pay his ration costs out of their own, thus releasing him from the industrial army. But only for certain professions, such as Bellamy's own."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"In sharp contrast to the raving, misanthopic Capitalist who gave this excellent book one star, Bellamy laid out his vision for a humanistic society... one which was natural and beneficial to humankind, rather than one which takes advantage of the poor, weak, or less talented. It is sad that Bellamy's vision for the 20th century only saw some chance of coming true with the New Deal and some of the social movements of the 1960s. Today, when crony coporate capitalism, fundamentalist religion, and evil seekers of oil, money and power rule the mindset of this once hopeful country (USA), the chance for humanism is slim indeed. If only the likes of those misanthropic capitalists who mock and distort Bellamy were to dissapear, we'd have a much healthier planet.And by the way, what we saw in the former USSR or in China today is NOT what Bellamy had in mind; but itself a misantropic, power-based dictatorship-based government which was/is just as unhumanistic as the U.S. is now."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"An interesting read for dystopina literature. Maybe a bit dated to teach today, but is thought provoking and will drive discussion as a comparison piece."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The author Edward Bellamy was the cousin of Francis Bellamy the author of the Pledge of Allegiance, which expresses the ideas Edward Bellamy's socialist utopian novels. Both cousins were self-proclaimed socialists and members of the \\"Nationalism\\" movement and its socialist auxiliary group, whose members touted Military Socialism and wanted the federal government to nationalize most of the American economy. They saw government schools as a means to their socialist \\"Nationalism.\\" Francis wrote the Pledge of Allegiance to promote socialism in the most socialistic institution -government schools.The early Pledge of Allegiance used a straight arm salute, not the modern hand over the heart. The Pledge was the origin of the stiff-arm salute that was adopted later by the National Socialist German Workers Party. Edward Bellamy's book was an international bestseller that launched the nationalism movement worldwide. Edward's book was translated into every major language, including German. They wanted government to take over all schools and impose robotic chanting to flags. The Pledge's early right-arm salute was not an ancient Roman salute, and the 'ancient Roman salute' myth came from the Pledge. In addition to the notorious salute, American socialists (e.g. Edward Bellamy and Francis Bellamy teamed with the Theosophical Society and Freemasons) also bear some blame for the notorious symbol usd by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The same symbol was used by the Theosophical Society during the time when the Bellamys, Freemasons and the Theosophical Society worked together. They also helped spread the stiff arm salute via the Pledge at their meetings.The symbol was used as alphabetical symbolism for socialism, and adopted later by German socialists as their flag symbol. Although an ancient symbol, was altered for use as overlapping S-letters for 'socialism.' It was deliberately turned 45 degrees counter clockwise and always oriented in the S-direction. Similar alphabetic symbolism is still visible as Volkswagen logos. People were persecuted for refusing to perform robotic chanting to the national flag at the same time in the USA and Germany (to the American flag, and to the German symbol flag). All of the above are modern discoveries by America's leading authority on the Pledge of Allegiance, the author of \\"Pledge of Allegiance Secrets.\\"Francis Bellamy lived long enough to see the Pledge's salute and a similar philosophy espoused by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The ominous parallels in Edward Bellamy's book are terrifying.Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward\\" is about a man who sleeps from 1887 until the year 2000. The United States has become one giant socialist monopoly. The book openly portrays men treated as military draftees, from the age of twenty-one until the age of forty-five, in the USA's \\"industrial army.\\" Bellamy's glorification of the military includes government assignment of all jobs. Everyone is issued ration cards which are used to draw goods from government storehouses. Everyone is permitted only the same amount in value annually.Of course, all of the preceding is portrayed as a dandy utopia just as it was portrayed by so many apologists for the military socialist complex of that led to the socialist wholecost (of which the Holocaust was a part): the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics killed 60 million killed; the People's Republic of China, 50 million; the National Socialist German Workers' Party, 20 million. There were millions more elsewhere.Did Bellamy foresee soviet-style rationing, or did he inspire it?Bellamy's is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 7 million persons who perished from 1932-33 in the famine that resulted in Europe's \\"breadbasket\\" after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics imposed collectivist land management in the Ukraine. By the spring of 1933, an estimated 25,000 people died every day in the Ukraine. It is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 27 million people starving to death in 1958 in the so-called \\"Great Leap Forward\\" in China. Was the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" inspired by \\"Looking Backward\\"?"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"although initally i believed the book had promise, i became increasingly frustrated at the depth of detail, the commentator for Bellamys utopia, spent on explaining it. the overall structre is generally sound but can become tedoius. as for the world as bellamy envisons, well he can have it. give me the harsh, unequal, but despite this, real ninetenth century. as a vision good; as a reality no chance. but to be fair to bellamy he probably accepts this and this is why he artculates his philosophy through literature. a book that encourages you to think but it works best as a critque of the ninetenth century."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I needed this book for my history class and not only was it in great condition, I received it quickly after placing my order."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"You can get this book, and many other out-of-copyright (public domain) books, either in Kindle-compatible text or mobipocket format or easily-converted HTML, for the great price of $0.00 from source such as Project Gutenberg, The Universal Digital Library, and others.Kindle is great, BUT I don't think we should tolerate anyone applying DRM to public domain material."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The problem with this book isn't the silliness of its socialist utopian vision, in which economic and social equality are brought forth by a wave of the author's bizarre magic wand over the masses of humanity. Goofy utopian societies have been invented by writers using the trite mechanism of &quot;if everybody would just agree with my ideas and get along, all our problems would mysteriously vanish&quot; going back at least to Plato, and they pretty nearly always spawn little cults or big movements of starry-eyed followers who just can't understand why everybody doesn't agree with the writer and thereby make the world a warm fuzzy place, tra la la. The movement propelled by Bellamy's folderol was certainly no little cult, and its silliness plagues us still, but that, too, is not really the problem with the book, per se.Nor is the lack of scientific or technological foresight the greatest shortcoming of this book. After all, it's no crime for an author to be subliterate regarding the physical sciences and engineering, particularly when that author was writing at a time before the pace of technological change had accelerated to twentieth century levels. Bellamy gets near the mark in a few cases, and the reader really shouldn't expect much more than that.No, what makes this a truly dreary, tiresome, wearing book is rather the one single crime for which no writer can be forgiven: he does not write well. Bellamy was a lousy writer, plain and simple, and regardless of one's social or political or economic church, a fair and impartial judgement of any novel should be based first on the quality of its writing. Edward Bellamy had no ear for language or dialog, no feel for wit or humor, no talent for description of a scene, no aptitude for characterization, and no capacity for engaging the reader and drawing him into the printed page. He was just not a good writer, and consequently the book is laborious and wearisome to read.Some twenty years after &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, H.G. Wells wrote &quot;The Sleeper Wakes&quot;, about a fellow who, like Julian West, takes a Rip Van Winkle-ish nap and wakes up to a future society vastly different from the Victorian one he knew. Wells' vision of the future is rather different from Bellamy's, and some of his notions might have been just as goofy, but at least he could write. A dyed-in-the-wool socialist looking for tedious paralogia to support his pet notions might find some value in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, but a reader looking for a well-written Victorian look forward would be better off with Wells."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"** spoiler alert ** This book reads more like an economic manifesto than a work of fiction.

He finds that Boston and even the whole world have been transformed to a great utopian society. A man by the name of Doctor Leete along with his wife (Mrs. Leete) and daughter (Edith Leete) take care of West in adjusting him to life in the year 2000.The story itself turns out to be more of a distraction to the main point of the book, which is to explain the economic and social workings of the utopia found in 2000. Everybody is now paid equally for their work and no work is considered menial. Rather than working for individual companies, everybody works in what the author calls the &quot;Industrial Army.&quot;To keep everybody contented with their lot, measures are taken. For example, everybody wakes up every day to some music that rouses them to feel great about the greater cause they work for. The city streets are clean and there is no crime. Things like this make the book, for me at least, entirely creepy.Unfortunately, the status of women in the book is not a whole lot better than it was in the 1880's. Women still leave the room when men begin talking politics. In addition, people have a tendency to talk in the book like they did, apparently, in the 1880's: with a disposition towards long-winded speech. As a result, the book has a tendency to drag on at times.Since the book was written in the late 1800's, it is understandable that the author has no history of socialism to look back on, much less the failed experiment called the Soviet Union. Despite that, it is enlightening to see the goal of Socialist thinking play out in the story of &quot;Looking Backward.&quot;The introduction in the Penguin Classics version is well done and gives the reader a good background before reading the book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Ok, i got this book as a gift. I had never heard of Bellamy and was worried that I would not like this book at all. But my apprehensions were soon soothed by the most interesting background story written by the editor Laura Bonds. The prologue she wrote about Bellamy sparked my interest and,honestly, I could not put the book down.The book is about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes up in the year 2000 (113 years later). The boy intellectually struggles with the facts of his old world and this new world utopia he has awoken in.The fictional utopia created by Bellamy birthed several utopia movements in America.I would recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Edward Bellamy's vision of the year 2000 from the author's vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander's hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, &quot;How can we do this better?&quot;All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G. Wells' &quot;A Time Machine&quot; or Thomas More's &quot;Utopia,&quot; then there's a good chance you'd like this book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I was forced to read this book over the vacation, during the summer.

The end result is a great book that is hard to read."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"From what I hear, one of the first organizations of so many radical ideas into one place. Many of the ideas are clever, and there are a few that I had never heard before, some that actually have the illusion of being plausible, until I give myself a reality check. I don't blame Bellamy for not knowing what would happen with many of his socialistic ideas, I blame him for not thinking. Complaints: 1: Apparently the improvement of working standards have eliminated all hate and crime. What!? 2: With equal reward for work in every job (except in the case authors), people are expected to be more motivated for honor's sake. That sure has worked well in the past. (rolls eyes). 3: The characters are nothing but vessels to transmit Bellamy's ideas. The main character awakens after a century long sleep with everyone he ever knew or cared about dead, and after a moment of shock, says 'hey, let's go find out how the new social system works, and spends the rest of the book doing just that. I realize that this was probably the most effective way Bellamy could find to convey his ideas, but if utopian novel were presented in this format today, regardless of the ideas put forth, I think it would be called a piece of trash. Out of respect for history and some of the good ideas in this book I will give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I originally read this book while taking a course that examined the evolution of Science Fiction. To appreciate this book you have to understand a few things before reading it. First Bellamy is using this book to advocate this novel system of social organization call it Socialism meets market economics, which is actually an interesting system. At the time the book was written it was a sensation and many groups were formed with the aim of bringing about the same Utopian social system described in the book.Second when trying to predict what life will be like 100 years in the future, your gonna get some stuff wrong. Some other reviewers seem put off by this (I don't see anyone slamming Clarke for getting 2001 wrong though) but I think it is more interesting to see how many things he got right.Third, this is no action novel. The story is set entirely in Boston and there are no legions of attacking androids or well anything that is terribly exciting. So if Stainless Steel Rat is a staple of your literary consumption you may want to stay away. Then again you might not, the maxim that states that to know where you're going you have to know where you've been holds true for the genre of SF and Looking Backward is a formative part of that past."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The main reason why I bought this book, was the optimistic tone on the cover. It's quite hard to discover books like that and when I come across one, it's mine in a second. As far as this is concerned, 'Looking backward' certainly met my expectations. It has faith in human nature and is quite optimistic about the future. The author has put great efford into figuring out a society that could maybe work if we put our minds to it. I cannot help but compare it to Huxleys 'Island'. A significant thought in that book was that people can't be happy before some basic living conditions are fulfilled. While Huxley focuses mainly on the total pursue of happiness after these basic problems are dealt with, Bellamy tries to work out a way to bring bread on the table for everybody. To me, this is the most valuable feature of 'Looking backward'. The system he describes however, seems to me somehow unatainable, unless human nature changes greatly over the years. Bellamy made the common mistake : He forgot about people. The people he describes in 2000 are aliens to me. Surely people cannot live in a ready-made society, where everything is taken care of for them. They need their goals in life and the freedom to choose their own path towards these goals. Where can teenagers who just want to travel around a bit after finishing school go to in Bellamy's utopia ? According to his presentation, they go into jail. Needless to say I can't agree with this at all. Moreover, people could never be as unselfish and pure as Bellamy describes them. In theory, this is a beautiful system, put real human beings into it and it falls apart. Why is it that most 'dreamers' can't accept the ways of human nature ? It's perfectly allright for people to be a bit selfish, confused, slobby, and so on... . Why not create an utopia that is really adjusted to US, instead of to something we will/can never be ? This I found very disappointing. Nevertheless I give this book a quote of 3 stars for making a really good try for a description of Utopia and offering people the insight that our main goal should not be saving ourselves, but saving everybody. This insight could be the start of something wonderfull... ."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"The book is very interesting on his perspective of how 2000 would turn out, however, it is mostly a conversation making it a little hard to read purely for enjoyment. But I am enjoying it"},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I read this book at the age of fourteen and ended up scratching my head, wondering, who would ever go along with that? Forty years later this question still persists. This book is not only unoriginal in borrowing its leitmotiv from H. G. Wells and Washington Irving, it completely denies the power and unchanging quality of human nature. Nobody is truly motivated by altruism... for long at least. Altruism always provides a person with a direct benefit that outweighs competing self-centered interests; it might be enhanced self esteem or the esteem of others, standing in the community, etc., but it can't credibly be argued that people will indefinitely suspend self interest or the interest of their loved ones to serve a greater good. Society has never worked that way in good times, and it's every man for himself when food is being rationed. That is why socialism can only be maintained for long at the barrel of a gun. It goes against human nature, it goes against reason, and it goes against every concept of personal liberty.As an object lesson on the mental disorder that is liberalism however, the book performs admirably. But I suspect this was not the author's intention."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"My first experience with this book was in college. As my professor lectured us to the smallest detail and never asked questions, I didnt bother reading it. My prof made this out to be a shining blueprint of how we should live. Finally broke down and read it myself recently. Im glad my teacher didnt have his way!Julian West is a well to do Bostonite who goes into a deep trance induced sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Dr. Leete, the man who revived him, and his family become Mr. West's host and guide. Shortly after West went to bed, the United States government took over the entire enconomy and brought Heaven on Earth.I really cant bring myself to be to harsh to Mr. Bellamy's socialist leanings. He did write this novel a full 30 years before the first workers' paradise started terrorizing its citizens and neighbors. Actually, Mr. Bellamy should be commended. He does a great job at picking out the major woes of his time and gives a brief but surprisingly comprehensive look at one of the two logical alternate solutions we could have taken. Of course we took the alternate route. That being to legally discourage monopolies and set up a minimal social safety net while still allowing for private property ownership and economic competition. Thank God we went this way!\\"Looking Backward\\" also gives us an interesting look into the socialist mind. Nationalizing the economy and abolishing private property ownership solves every woe in this alternate universe from starvation to diaper rash. You also often see the near religious ferver of a dyed in the wool socialist in West's conversations with Dr. Leete which often go something like this:West: Goodness, this is some fine strawberry jam!Leete: Well of course it is! Our jam makers are fully educated with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree from your awful, evil and backward times. What do you expect?As others have noted, this society is completely unworkable. While reading this book, I tried to figure out how I would operate in Bellamy's world. Personally, I would get a low stress job and work just enough to get by. Why do more? You get paid the exact same amount as everyone else and can live in a mansion if you want! I know what Bellamy would say. Im just a cretin from an unenlightened alternate universe. Everyone in his world strives for their best out of their undying love for their fellow man. Yeah, whatever. Heres another gem I note nobody has picked up on. North America, Europe and Australia subscribe to this socialist model but not the rest of the world. Its safe to assume they follow Bellamy's US model of having no armed forces or legal power to wage war. So whats to stop nations not on this little love fest from moving in and taking over?

While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel. It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society. The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.We are more than just capitalists and workmen.

However, it is resolutely national. Everything in it is about how the nation by 2000 has taken over the direction of production and distribution and done away with not only money, but also spitefulness, sexual jealousy and claims of blood.It is no excuse for Bellamy that Veblen was yet unknown. He was writing in Boston, where Mayflower descendence was worth its weight in gold.The bloody shirt was being waved to effect at the time, too, and there is nothing here to explain how links to the Society of the Cincinnati or the GAR were eroded. In fact, the evolution of the 20th century is very much a black box in \\"Looking Backward,\\" except that it occurred with less bloodshed than the change of government in a minor state.The whole tone is strange. It is all about Bostonians and Americans, but the word America does not appear. The proper Bostonians, then very conscious of their role in foisting democracy in the form of manhood suffrage on the world, are said to have given up democracy without a fight. Strange.It is no fault of Bellamy's that he could not foretell the disappearance of the horse, but even taken as a vision, he does a much poorer job than Jules Verne. The editors of the Applewood edition (\\"publishers of America's living past\\") try to make something of the fact that Bellamy introduced the term \\"credit card,\\" but his credit cards had nothing to do with ours, and in fact he is relentlessly anti-credit.As an analysis of the ills of his time, Bellamy is pretty much a damp squib. About the only trenchant observation he makes is that \\"interest on investments was a species of tax in perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry.\\" If he had said \\"land\\" instead of \\"investments,\\" he would have been close to the insights of Henry George, writing at the same time.As a prophet he is a wet blanket. His hatred of individualism -- never exactly defined -- is complete, but one doubts whether even the resentful proletarians of his turbulent era would have welcomed a future based on \\"the strictest discipline in the army of labor.\\"Bellamy would have loved Mussolini.As for the book as a book, he chose to cast it in the form of a romantic novel.

In over a hundred years(the book was written in something like 1887) the only change is that all of humanity has learned to work together. The funny thing is that is all this time the mode of dress has stayed the same. So somehow man has changed his entire inherently selfish nature but hasn't been able to come up with a better shoe style in a hundred years. Give me a break.

He is shocked by the utopia he encounters, and spends time acclimating to the new moral climate. His Utopian society is economically and socially egalitarian, without being totalitarian - imagine a combination of libertarianism and communism mixed and done properly. Of course, the 20th century has lead this book to seem, well, unreasonable; we gain few insights into society. However, as an early work in science fiction or magic realism, this work stands out; the man-out-of-his-own-time has been done since, well imitated and improved, but this is one of the foundations. A must for sci-fi and magic realism readers."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"First published in 1888, Looking Backward was one of the most popular books of its day. It inspired several utopian communities and hundreds of \\"Bellamy Clubs\\" across America. Reading it today, it's hard to see what all the fuss was about.Through a convoluted series of circumstances, wealthy Bostonian Julian West falls asleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Upon awakening he is greeted by Dr. Leete, who will serve as his host and guide in this future society. The social order has changed drastically since West's day. America is now governed by an idealistic form of socialism, though Bellamy avoids the S-word in favor of terms like \\"cooperative\\", \\"rational\\", or \\"brotherly\\". It's not a strict Marxist socialism, but rather Bellamy's own brand. The overall governing principle is that cooperation is more efficient than competition. The trusts that dominated America in the late 19th century have eliminated each other through competition and consolidated into one giant trust, now governing all industry. This trust has somehow become the U.S. government, and now beneficently works for the interests of all citizens. The military has been replaced by the Industrial Army, all industry has been nationalized, money has been abolished, and all citizens receive identical wages in the form of credit which they are free to spend however they choose. Bellamy's society of the future sounds a lot like an early prospectus for the Soviet Union read through rose-colored glasses. In reality, its existence would require the total negation of all human greed and sloth. It is also heavily reliant on a benevolent ruler who wields absolute power. Unfortunately, as history has shown us time and again, those who wield absolute power are seldom benevolent.My main objection to this book, however, is not directed toward its political ideals. I generally enjoy reading the socialist literature of this time period, and I'm usually up for a good utopian novel of any political stripe, no matter how far-fetched. What I object to is the writing. Once West wakes up in this brave new world, how does he spend his time? Sitting on the couch talking to Dr. Leete, chapter after chapter after chapter. Occasionally they go out to a restaurant, store, library, etc. where all they do is talk, talk, and talk some more. What's the first rule of good writing? Show me; don't tell me. If your intention is to teach us about an ideal industrial society, why not give the man a job? Julian West is not an active participant in the society being described. He doesn't interact with it at all. He is a perpetual bystander. This is really not a novel at all, but a series of dialogues in which Dr. Leete is the mouthpiece spouting the imaginary Constitution of Bellamy's ideal America. Would we all be happier living in Bellamy's world? Probably. But that doesn't make it a good book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Although this novel lies nearly forgotten today, when it was first released in the late 19th century, its impact on society and the imagination (and expectations) of that society were so immense as to be immeasurable. This book did more than strike a chord of hope in a population craving better times and trusting in humankind's capacity to make things right, it created a sensation. Clubs were formed in dozens of cities, which hailed Bellamy as a hero and prophet, and Looking Backward was quite simply embraced by millions as prophecy and a blueprint for what was certain to come. It all sounded so good, didn't it? The year 2000 would arrive upon a world at peace, where everyone had sufficient food, had dignity, where crime was heeled, where equality was a reality. It was, in short, both a utopia and a realization of the fantasies of Karl Marx. In fact, today this book seems both impossibly nave and touchingly---humanistically---idealistic. Communism was tried in the decades after Bellamy's death and the 20th century result was nothing like what the 19th century Bellamy suggested it would be. Instead of equality and liberation, it brought a new species of class stratification and suffocating enslavement to nearly a quarter of the globe. Looking Backward is neither a great novel nor a bad one. In retrospect it lacks the importance which in its early years it seemed destined to have. Today Looking Backward is an interesting read, especially when the context of its creation is considered, and we with perfect hindsight can know how flawed its fantasy of an Eden-like worker's tomorrow was."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Like most Utopias, Edward Bellamy illustrates his ideal society through a light narrative designed to both deliver his point and entertain the reader; in this case, the narrative evolves from suspense (kinda) into, of course, a love story. The tale centers around Julian West, a bourgeoisie-of-sorts from late 19th century society, whose hypnotic sleep leaves him lying peacefully until he is awoken in the year 2000 by a doctor and his family. The plot is obviously not meant to be particularly realistic, but as framework for Bellamy to build his theory upon it serves him quite well.For this review and others, please check out www.yourwords.caThe title, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; is derived from the dialogue between the main character and the family that found him, throughout which aspects from the &quot;current&quot; society of the year 2000 are contrasted with that of the past. The dialogue evolves to include Bellamy's theories on economics, production, political agendum and other less defined, though no less well-conceived, philosophies on social direction and operation. I found it most interesting that he was able to foresee the rise of corporations and their monopoly over production and distribution at a time when industrialism was at its infancy.I could write pages upon pages about the ideas in Looking Backward, but instead I'll just point you to the text itself. As a reviewer, one is always tempted to incorporate their own bias into the review. For instance, I have read reviews of this book that dismiss it for promotion of what later became known as socialism. This is most absurd as such a narrow minded dismissal not only blames a text for the faulty implementation of a faulty system in despotic hands but ignores the intent of the author, which was to illustrate a society based upon unity and equality as opposed to the current system disunity and inequality. I have also read reviews that suggest the book to be 'incomplete' for not elaborating upon the details in which the society of 1887 transformed to the Utopia of 2000. I put forth that such a task should not and cannot be undertaken by an author whose intent is to outline their ideal society, as it is to the rest of us who would see the ideal realized that would need to undertake its practical development and application. The task of all authors is to spread ideas, not necessarily to implement them.If you are looking for a good story to read, skip this book. The story is pretty weak and the writing is in most instances overly technical at times when simple language would suffice. What makes it the classic that it is are the ideas expounded within the text. The most admirable and practical example of such to me was his views on concerted production, where the extreme wealth of the state is achieved through the industries working together towards a single cause (the wealth of the state, of course) instead of against each other, profiteering from the collapse of their competitors. I also envy the idea, however unattainable it would seem, that since all wages are equal for all citizens, each pursues his vocation solely for the genuine love of the field.Time and time again while reading through this text, I could not help but pause and ask myself why such a system as described by Bellamy couldn't and doesn't exist. Perhaps it is too unrealistic. Perhaps it is too idealistic. But as I like to think, perhaps it just makes too much sense for such a flawed species to accept."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I was assigned this book for a class, but I am SOOO glad. The Utopian approach is refreshing, even from the vantage point of 1887. The view of the future is suprisingly accurate for technology, and the reasons for a change from the past go far beyond astute.Many cynical people think today is the way life HAS to be. This book gives us an alternate view of our reality and hope in humanity for the possibility of progress in the future."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"Other reviews have described the plot, so I won't spend much time on it. A man, Julian West, goes to sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. He finds a socialist utopia.At first, the book is quite interesting. Bellamy does a good job of capturing the protagonist's surpise and confusion at the new world he discovers. The fact that Edith Leete looks like his fiance back in 1887 Boston is a neat twist. The socialist state the author describes is appealing to me, and as someone who believes that socialism can work, I found it thought provoking.The problem is, there is not enough story or character development here. Bellamy's ideas aren't really suited to the fictional form. He'd have been better off to write a solely political tract. Because the author can't seem to decide if he wants to write a novel or a political essay, both the narrative and the politics are oversimplified, and given short shrift. The introduction by Cecilia Titchi (pardon my spelling), was excellent. In fact, the book fails to live up to it. If you know nothing about socialism, this book my enlighten you as to the philosophy. If it is an option for a political science class, it would be a good pick because it is easy and quick reading. Otherwise, I wouldn't rush to read it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"This &quot;novel&quot; is an excellent description of socialism at its best (written, incidentally, decades before Stalin or the USSR). The story is pretty irrelevant, consisting of your basic heterosexual narrative thrown in simply for the purposes of getting published, I imagine. The ideas about what socialism would look like are presented almost entirely as dialogue in the form of explanations to a knowledge-hungry gentleman who has been in a hypnosis-induced comma for a hundred years, and awakes to find himself in a futuristic utopia.It's interesting to note that Bellamy wrote a sequel to this book (long out-of-print) that addresses the problems with his socialist vision. There is dissent in this new world, and Bellamy describes an alternative anarchist society rising on the fringes to address the lack of freedom in his socialist model."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I liked to read this book because it contained very unusual or old words. The structure of the sentences reminded me of an era long gone in which people actually had to write to communicate. Nonetheless, the book serves its purpose by condemning his \\"present\\" of the 1880's and praising the future that he wakes up in even though it takes the entire book to do it. The main interest I had with the book is that Mr. West wakes up in the year 2000 and I wanted to see what Bellamy thought about it. Bellamy had no knowledge of cars and, therefore, weren't in the novel. Odd by our standards, but so were the flying cars in 1950's theorists' eyes.Its also a great novel because it completely changed my way of looking at a socialist utopia. You work for the greater good of everyone and if you don't work then you get tossed out. I like socialism and thought this was a more moderate stance. However, it was a great point to clarify and will hopefully push more into the realm of socialist style government.If you enjoy a short read, took me about a week due to work schedule that week, then I suggest you read this. His ideas about a modern utopia instead of the monopolistic capitalist exploitative world in the 1880's are wonderful and truly make you see the good in socialism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Looking Backward.\\" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."},{"Title":"Cliterature","review":"The clitoris has over 8,000 nerve endings and Cliterature electrifies every single one of them! This collection of erotica is the ultimate literary menage a trois, braiding together craft, creativity and climax. Between the red covers of Cliterature, I discovered the poetic, surreal story Precious by Miriam R. Sachs Martin, who writes, \\" She is woven into my skin . . . My fingers are stained with her.\\" What woman would not want to be woven into her lover's skin? How I chuckled while reading Female Vacuum Pumping by CM Hurt, who writes about enlarging the female genitals through a pumping mechanism, enhancing sensitivity. But it is in Sweeter by Madelena M. Christian, that Cliterature is simply defined. The beautifully written story blends desire, confidence and imagination - \\"But I am beautiful too and I enjoy myself. . . \\"I like my mind. I like were it takes me.\\" And it is this last sentence, \\"I like my mind. I like were it takes me.\\", the mantra for anyone who loves to read erotica, that floats through the pages of Cliterature, threading together each story like an erotic constellation in the night sky."},{"Title":"Cliterature","review":"It tastes, smells, and feels good to read this book. You put it down and can wait to get back to it moving around through it, being a part of the story . . . sometimes from the inside of the story sometimes viewing, watching waiting to see what happens next. Read it!"},{"Title":"Two Leggings;: The making of a Crow warrior","review":"This book was prepared by Nabokov from notes from interviews between the ethnographer and collector Wildschut and the aged Crow warrior Two Leggings. Those looking for a general account of plains Indian life in the mid to late 19th century may be disappointed. This book deals almost solely with Two Leggings spirtual pursuit of 'power' or 'medicine' to give him success in horse raids. And by extension status within his tribal society. The book highlights the significance of dreams to the Plains Indian and the impact they had on the real world. The book documents Two Leggings various attempts to acquire 'power' through fasting or vision quests and also gives accounts of numerous horse raids he made against his tribal enemies. The end of the days of freedom on the plains and the reservation period are largely ignored for, as far as Two Leggings was concerned, nothing of interest happened after the buffalo disappeared and horse raiding ended.All in all an excellent book which reveals how the spritual world and warfare were so interwoven in the mind of the Plains Indian."},{"Title":"Two Leggings;: The making of a Crow warrior","review":"In 1919, anthropologist William Wildschut, living in Billings, Montana, at the time, befriended Crow Indian chief Two Leggings, who was living along the Bighorn River. Wildschut was interested in gathering Two Leggings's reminiscences. Bringing translators with him, Wildshut met with Two Leggings at his homestead over a lengthy period of time and wrote his memoirs down. The final 480-page manuscript was deposited in the archives of the Museum of the American Indian, where Peter Nabokov discovered it. Nabokov reworked Wildschut's manuscript somewhat, usually tightening up his expansive style, and this is the result.The most striking thing about these reminiscences is how Two Leggings is not nearly as interested in Indian-white relations as he is with his raiding adventures against other tribes, especially against the Piegans. It seems his whole existence is centered on this activity. Almost equally important are his vision and dream quests; all important decisions are based on what are conjured in dreams and visions. Raiding enemy tribes, gathering coup, stealing horses - all these activities were primary to anyone wishing to be a great warrior chief. Possessing strong medicine that produced powerful visions was also important. Two Leggings relates his story up to about 1888 when the Crows were restricted to their reservation; he concludes, \\"Nothing happened after that. We just lived. There is nothing more to tell.\\" His memoir is a fascinating one, and one that makes little acknowledgement of or concession to the white man's world."},{"Title":"Two Leggings;: The making of a Crow warrior","review":"If you are interested in learning about spiritual power--sometimes referred to as medicine--amongst the plains Indians, then this book is for you. It discusses Two Leggings search for power through traditional vision quest and his inability to receive anything substantial. Ultimately, he receives something of value extended to him by his father-in-law. Also covered is what happens when a person makes a committment to spirit then dishonors that committment--the colapse and end of Sun Dance for the Crow people until it is returned years later through the Shoshone people."},{"Title":"Two Leggings;: The making of a Crow warrior","review":"When I toured Little Big Horn battlefield in August 2009, the tour guide noted that there have been 5000 books written on this battle and that they all contradict each other. Faced with that overwhelming variety of views, I asked her which account of the battle that she recommended. Her response was to purchase the book about Wooden Leg. Wooden Leg was a Cheyenne Indian who grew up before the destruction of the Indian way of life by encroaching whites. His memory for names and details was incredible. He gave explanations for many of the Indian names, including his own. As a runner, he seemed never to tire, so his fellows considered that his legs must be made of wood. My favorite name was Buffalo Dung. This poor fellow ended his days on earth when he was gored by a buffalo. I am sure these names suffer in translation. They seem strange to my ear, but must have seemed quite natural to the Cheyenne.Wooden Leg tells the tale of the attack on the Indian camp by Custer and his men. Actually, it was an abnormally large camp because the Cheyenne had allied with most of the tribes of the region in order to try to deal with the threat of this invasion by the blue coated cavalry. Years after the battle when the whites (who had no surviving witnesses to the battle) interviewed the Indians to learn details of this momentous event, Wooden Leg notes that many were still afraid to give a full account expecting to be punished for their part in the battle. This fact may account for many of the contradictions noted by our tour guide. Wooden Leg's account seemed quite believable due to the many details given of his own part in the battle. In spite of repeated inquiries, he was unable to give any clarification regarding what happened to Custer because he had no idea who any of the attackers were and had no understanding of rank markings on US Calvary uniforms and could take no notice during the heat of battle. Wooden Leg noted that the elder chiefs were trying desperately to move away from the US forces and avoid battle, but the young men including Wooden Leg, were eager to engage the invaders. (I learned from other sources that Custer was determined to invade the heart of the village to take the women and children captive. In spite of having been told by his Crow Scouts that he was hopelessly outnumbered, Custer led his men directly into the heart of the camp.) Wooden Leg observed that as the Indians moved close to a cavalry defensive position that the soldiers suddenly \\"went crazy\\" and started shooting each other! He attributed this incredible turn of events to the \\"strong medicine\\" that they had developed for the battle. Other sources noted Custer's order to his men was to save their last bullet for themselves.This book gives a rare and authentic account not only of this famous battle (the second most visited battlefield in the US after Gettysburg), but a fascinating account of the life of the plains Indians."},{"Title":"Two Leggings;: The making of a Crow warrior","review":"This book is among my all time favorites in Native American studies. Two Leggings was not the greatest or the most famous of the Crows, but he seemed true to his culture. This gave the book the very rare feel of cultural and spiritual authenticity.

Be careful about giving children a very large inheritance lest they fail to learn to work for their wealth.3. Do not separate your religion from your business.4. Know what people need, then invest yourself where you are most needed.5.

Read and enjoy. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Acres of diamonds","review":"Russell Conwell's book, \\"Acres of Diamonds\\" was developed from a speech he delivered to church congregations over 5,000 times. The proceeds he earned from this speech are reputed to have given him a fortune, which he used to found Temple University in Philadelphia.\\"Acres of Diamonds\\" is the story of a successful farmer in India named Al Hafed. Hafed is tempted by the allure of wealth and sells his farm to search the world for diamonds. Years later he dies penniless, having not found diamonds. However, back home the man who purchased Hafed's farm accidentally discovers a huge field of diamonds on Hafed's former land.Conwell uses this story to illustrate that success often lies close at hand, if you are willing to open your eyes and mind to opportunity. Conwell further suggests that most people are \\"pygmies of their possible selves,\\" rarely achieving the potential of their innate abilities or local opportunities. Conwell also discusses his basic philosophy of business and gives several rules, or suggestions, for budding entrepreneurs:1. The seeds of fortune are close at hand. Stick with what you know, find your niche, and don't be swayed by the allure of \\"greener pastures.\\"2. Find out what people want, and fill that need. This sounds obvious, but many entrepreneurs start with a product or service, and then try to find a market for their product or service. Conwell advises finding the market first, then developing a product or service to meet that demand.3. Make the best possible product and provide them to a large number of people.\\"Acres of Diamonds\\" was first published in 1921.

I will not reveal how he suggests this can happen but I agree with Mr. Conwell's approach and logic. Helping people meet their goals will have a good effect on your ability to meet your goals. However, I feel that only works if you are dealing with good people. Ethical imbeciles don't play fair and have fun doing it.

Written by Baptist minister and founder of Temple University, Russell H. Conwell, this book originated as one of his sermons, which was so popular that it was published as a book.\\"Acres of Diamonds\\" is based on a parable told to Conwell by an Arab guide during a trip to the Middle East. The parable tells the story of a man who sells his farm to search the world for diamonds. The man dies in poverty and wretchedness far from his home, not knowing that his farm sat on the richest diamond mine in the world.It is easy to think that great things are only accomplished by other people in faraway places. Conwell argues that we can all accomplish great things wherever we are. He gives many examples of regular people who accomplished great things. After all, he says, even a great man like Abraham Lincoln was just \\"Abe\\" to his neighbors.I believe this book was first published in the early 1900s, so the writing style is kind of old-fashioned and Conwell refers to people and products that were prominent during his time, but have less meaning to people today. There are no chapters or other structure to the book (of course it's only 64 pages long).Despite these minor complaints, the book has a great message. You can accomplish great things where you are right now. You don't have to move to New York, Los Angeles, or Paris.

Not wanting this person to feel their efforts were unappreciated I decided to read it. What a waste of time. Conwell is a pontificating windbag intoxicated with his own ego. I guess that's what happens when you have a captured audience and they are compelled to listen to dribble ad nauseum. Basically, Conwell's point could have been made (and understood) in ten pages or less. Why his ramblings continue onward is because his listeners were too polite to stand up and walk out.

Indeed, this lecture has become a study in psychology; it often breaks all rules of oratory, departs from the precepts of rhetoric, and yet remains the most popular of any lecture I have delivered in the fifty-seven years of my public life. I have sometimes studied for a year upon a lecture and made careful research, and then presented the lecture just once -- never delivered it again. I put too much work on it. But this had no work on it -- thrown together perfectly at random, spoken offhand without any special preparation, and it succeeds when the thing we study, work over, adjust to a plan, is an entire failure.\\" He then went on to explain to each audience that \\"acres of diamonds are to be found in this city, and you are to find them. Many have found them. And what man has done, man can do. [They are] are not in far-away mountains or in distant seas; they are in your own back yard if you will but dig for them.\\" These comments provide an excellent introduction to Conwell's book. As I read it, I thought about Dorothy in L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz. Only after a series of adventures far from Kansas did she realize that \\"there's no place like home.\\" What Conwell has in mind involves far more than such appreciation, however.

Through this lecture, Conwell debunks the idea that it is noble to be poor, an idea that far too many Christians share. He illustrates that it is our duty as Christians to use our gifts to honestly earn riches, because you can do more good with riches than without.Conwell successfully illustrates the difference between the popular expression &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot; and the complete Biblical passage which states &quot;the love of money is the root of all evil&quot;. The love of money is idolatry, but money itself is neither good nor evil. It is simply a tool which may be used for either good or evil.In these pages we learn the virtues of earning money through honest, hard work. We learn to look for opportunities to serve others in our own back yard by simply finding a need and filling it. If you wish to be great, begin with who you are right now, where you are right now. Follow these principles, and you will uncover your own acres of diamonds.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"Title":"Acres of diamonds","review":"Think about a simple lesson you may have learned in your life.

The message is you don't have to go searching the world for the success that awaits you wherever you are. Great point. The stories at the beginning are delicious irony of people who went far and wide but missed the obvious.The second half rambles far and wide from the main points, going into politics, and they go right to points you pretty much anticipate. Although enough can never be said about the vital need for character and savy over a mindset that thinks greatness will adorn a man's void of effort.Everyone should read the speech. But if you're reading this, you can easily google the text in PDF or html, and read the Acres speech before you could get delivery of a hard-copy book.

Short and powerful (the book is much like \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" in that it is brief, but contains an important lesson told in the form of a story) \\"Acres of Diamonds\\" will force you to take a new look at your own backyard when looking for opportunity. The basic story revolves around a Persian farmer who loses his life and significant wealth looking for a mine of diamonds when, ironically, his own farm land (which he sold to finance his search for diamonds) literally contained acres of diamonds. Conwell gives several other examples of similar stories revolving around gold, oil, etc. The grass isn't always greener on the other side...don't discount where you are, what you know and the relationships that you already have too quickly.

That is, while it does contain specific information about building doors, frames, etc., I doubt anyone who has not done so, could use this information to actually DO it. The information given is way to sparse to do any real good, it's more of an intro or overview.The book does at least give some actual designs which might be helpful if you happen to like those designs.One thing none of the cabin books I have found do is to give info about cost. I realize that costs vary in different states and that the book wants to be valid years from now when prices change. However, it seems reasonable to me that if the author were to state \\"At the time of this writing the prices were $x.xx per board foot for [type of wood] and so on, and the final cost to build this was approximately $xx,xxx.xx, that would be very helpful. Even if this info were only in an appendix!People like myself on a limited budget would really like to know how much $ it will cost to build, and even a ballpark idea would be very helpful.I think this book tried to do too much. Rather than give sparse info on cabin construction that does not really give ENOUGH info to actually do the work described, I'd rather it had given more designs with blueprints and talked about the relative variance in price among the different designs.The bottom line here is that it seems to me this book does not give ENOUGH info to be entirely useful, in ANY of its chapters, and could have been much more useful if it had eliminated that aspect and concentrated on a thorough discussion of designs and cost and subjects such as plumbing and septic tanks, or other important info one needs to know such as best ways to heat a cabin, which stoves or heating systems are best, etc.I feel this book is nearly useless in that it does not cover ANY aspect in enough detail to really be useful. It's more of an introduction and if it were titled as such I would not give it so much negativity."},{"Title":"Cabins: A Guide to Building Your Own Nature Retreat","review":"Lots of good info to get you started designing you small rustic cabin.

It contians all the information you could possibly need for building a cabin, whether you want a one room hut with no amenities, a two-betroom beach house with running water, electricity, and a bathroom or something in between. It covers everything I can think of and gives clear instructions for projects.This book lives up to its title: it really is for someone who is serious about building, with more diagrams than &quot;arty&quot; pictures of the wilderness.

But it's still a great book."},{"Title":"Cabins: A Guide to Building Your Own Nature Retreat","review":"As others have noted, this is a useful book for generating ideas and getting the creative juices flowing. I bought it to obtain those features, and it did not disappoint me.The Stiles are, apparently, a prolific couple on this and similar topics, and they certainly deserve credit for effective packaging and marketing. David Stiles has filled the book's pages with material--some good, some irrelevant, and some good for entertainment--but he certainly has filled it nonetheless. The layout and tone of this book is vaguely reminiscent of a copy of an early 1970s Mother Earth News. The reader's challenge is to extract the kernals of insight from the volumes of chaff. What the book lacks in detailed engineering and construction discussion and techniques it makes up for in peripheral and, in some cases, funny advice. Consider the detailed description of the electronic vehicle-arrival and gate-unlocking monitors--this in a book purported to find ways to get one in touch with mother nature and perhaps forego electricity entirely. Or the sketch plan for the garden-hose remedy against racoons infiltrating your metal trashcan. The advice is intriguing enough, but one suspects that a bit more discussion on well-installation or obtaining running water might be in order before turning to a technological solution involving the use of pressurized water for a racoon problem. Given the Stiles' ties to Manhattan, maybe the accepted security measures of their current environment don't seem quite as ridiculous or irrelevant as they probably do to anyone who actually lives in a rural area. Or consider their admonition against Coleman lanterns being \\"Scary and hard to light.\\" Hmmm, I, too, have fears and I'm certainly not the most dexterous fellow, but I've learned that five minutes of hands-on practice can turn even the most hardcore urbanite into a safe and proficient Coleman-lantern lighter. Something tells me Mr. Stiles has not taken the time to do the same, and this casts a disconcerting pall over the value of much of his other advice. How much of it has actually been tried?But this book is valuable for the focus it gives to architecture and perhaps encouraging one to pick up a tablet of graph paper and start sketching floorplans or facades; extract those ideas and use them as fodder for formulating your own. Read the rest with a grain of salt. For a more focused, pragmatic, and obviously tested perspective on cabin-building, get a copy of G. Wayne Fears' \\"How to Build Your Dream Cabin.\\""},{"Title":"Cabins: A Guide to Building Your Own Nature Retreat","review":"This book has been quite valuable to me as I plan my cottage in Canada. While it is not totally comprehensive, it does a very good job of explaining many of the relevant concepts of cabin planning, design and a fair idea of the building process. Some useful details concerning construction techniques are provided, as well.Other reviewers have argued that much is left out--correct, given that the book only runs 240 pages. I think that those reviewers misunderstand the intent of the book: to give the reader ideas, not to hand-hold them through every single step of the process. For example, many of the building plans that are provided are lacking in some key details. So what? I intend to have an architect draw up my plans anyway.At minimum, I know a heck of a lot more after reading the book than I did beforehand."},{"Title":"Cabins: A Guide to Building Your Own Nature Retreat","review":"A very well written book.

As such, I have bought hundreds of audio programs over the last twenty five years. This one, by Joe Caruso, was the best I have ever puchased.

And, perhaps I was just ready to hear the message that we shape our lives by the stories we tell overselves (good stories, bad stories but all stories). Steve Chandler's excellent bookThe Story of You: And How to Create a New Oneand Debbie Ford's excellent audio programThe Answers are Within You: Unveiling Life's Greatest Spiritual Secrets in the Shadow of Your Soulare other worthwhile products making the same point about the impact of the stories we tell ourselves.Caruso's prescription for a better life is to have us move beyond our stories and to develope authentic power by making clear distinctions between what one can control, what one can merely influence, and what one needs to simply accept.

The book is not aimed at those using Irelands public transport.The itineraries are not based geographically but on three historical periods:-Pre celtic, neolithic and Bronze age-Pre Christian celtic and late Bronze age-Early Christian, Irish golden age and medievalThe first itinerary covering 4000BCE to 700BCE starts in Dublin and takes you to the following principal sites: National musuem of Ireland in Dublin, Bru na Boinne-Newgrange and Knowth passage tombs, Loughcrew hilltop passage tomb complex, Carrowkeel and Carrowmore neolithic cemetery complexes near Sligo, Knocknarea mountain top cairn, Creevykeel court cairn, Ceide Fields neolithic farm settlement, Pulnabrone portal tomb and wedge tombs in Burren National Park (south of Galway), Lough Gur neolithic settlement site, Grange stone circle (largest in Ireland) and nearby wedge tomb (all south of Limerick), Fourknocks passage tomb and Pipers Stones stone circle, and thence back to Dublin. In my opinion it is a good selection of the sites from that period.The other two itineraries take you to such sites as the Hill of Tara, Croagh Patrick, Clonmacnoise, Gallarus oratory near Dingle, Skellig Michael off the west coast, Ardmore, Rock of Cashel, Jeppoint Abbey ( I loved the wonderful carvings), and Glendalough ( just south of Dublin). Again I think these are a good selection of the best known sites.There are maps of the individual sites. However there is just one overall map that shows the 3 routes on one page. Most travelers will want to see sites from all three periods as they tour around, and the book really offers no advice if you wish to do this. But you can do it, as I did, with help of good maps. There are few suggestions of many additional sites to visit if you are keen and have more time. A short gazetter of such sites and location at the back would have been useful.The book also offers no suggestions for further reading on particular periods or sites if you wished to do so.With these reservations aside, as a colourful travel introduction to ancient sites of Ireland, it is a very good book.For more advice on other sites worth visiting try Peter Harbisons \\"Guide to the National and Historic monuments of Ireland\\" 2001 edition with map references you can link to the very fine 1:250,000 scale touring maps produced by the Irish Ordnance Survey which show lots of such ancient and historic sites as named small red dots (and lots of tourist sites as well).

One of my friends is touring Ireland by car this spring, and I sent her this book and the Ireland AA road atlas. All the popular guidebooks include the famous places, but the quiet, secluded ones that are not accessible by tour bus are the most evocative. For example, Newgrange (wonderful) is crowded and full of tour buses and shuttle buses, while Carrowkeel (the best) is just you and the sheep (be sure to close all the farm gates). I would not choose to take a trip and visit only sites related to one era, as presented in this guide, but I selected the places and marked them on the map, then used this book to help find them.

A little tedious writing but worth staying with it."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Somehow, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" doesn't make it on to many lists of \\"the world's greatest novels.\\" I'm not sure why.There is a specific edition of this book which I love, and which can be found easily among used-book dealers. This edition was issued by The Heritage Press, and contains a remarkable introduction by Theodore Dreiser. The introduction is something which I have re-read many times. As a beginning, Dreiser recounts his interaction with an intelligent American engineer, aged about 40, who was looking for a book \\"with some meat to it.\\" After long hesitation, and after compiling a list of some dozen books, Dreiser finally decided to recommend \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"Six months later, he met the engineer by chance while strolling along a street in San Francisco, and the engineer immediately started praising the novel. \\"Now there is a book which is honest! I can't think of another book from its time which contains more honesty, and more direct dealing!\\"And indeed, this may be the main thing working in favor of \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\" Samuel Butler read Darwin, and became a believer in the theory of evolution. He was a penetrating observer of the cruelties of Victorian society, and of its hypocrisies. Few people will read this book without being able to remember this startlingly honest portrayal of a man who has just lost his wife, whom he did not love in the slightest:\\"Theobald buried his face in his hands to conceal his want of emotion.\\"Oh, touche!But other themes are extremely interesting: the idea of taking up a Christian vocation and going into the slums to dedicate your life to serving the poor -- it might work, but it might be a dreadful idea if you don't know what you're doing.And how about the narrator's bald statement:\\"I know of no better thing for a young man than an independent income.\\" (!!) That sentiment is not going to sit well with the people who believe that only a lifetime of wage-slavery is worth living! But Samuel Butler spoke from experience: when he was in his twenties, he escaped to New Zealand and took up sheep-farming, of all things. But... he did WELL as a sheep-farmer, sold out five years later at a very nice profit, and cleared eight thousand pounds. He invested it at ten percent and therefore had an independent income of eight hundred pounds per year. He returned to London, rented an apartment, and devoted the rest of his life to his intellectual life: writing, painting, and music. He is well-known as the author of \\"Erewhon,\\" as well as \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"You should really take a look at this book. In some ways, it has shaped my life, in ways that sometimes surprise me. There's a lot of good, honest meat in this book -- and that's probably why it has been continuously in print for over a century, despite the fact that the academics pass over it in silence.Extremely high recommendation!"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"This book tells the story of three generations of men in the Pontifex family. Theobold is unable to resist the domination of his father and acquiesces to following the ministry, as his father desires. Theobold's son Ernest, the novel's main character, is not exceptionally bright, motivated or gifted. Yet he succeeds in throwing off the religious and moral mantle he inherited. By doing so, he rejects the values of the age.This book is most interesting read in it's historical context. The discursions and lengthy sentences make it a slow read. But if you are in the mood for a classic, this one is enjoyable."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I've now read this book at least ten times, and every time I do it seems to get better. Butler is a bridge between the Victorian and 20th century novelist--although the book has some of the heavily stylized writing of the 19th century, the thinking is pure 20th. I read it first as a teenager, and was pleased to see that the hero's parents were depicted as well-meaning but foolish, and ultimately harmful, people. (This was in the late 1960s, and I thought, \\"Wow, just like mine!\\") Likewise, other 1960s thinking peered out from behind its Victorian curtains: organized religion is scorned, as is too much conformity and too little curiosity.Yet when I read it again last year, it seemed like the perfect antidote the Bush years, with its high degree of common sense and empathy--just as it seemed like a warning to the excesses of the 1980 Reagan years. Like most classics, this book works for every era, and for every reader.It's also funny, smart, and psychologically years ahead of its time. If I had only one book to take to a desert island, this would be it. You can read it over and over and always enjoy it."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Flesh is what governs the soul. Much of the book contains a scathing, satirical appraisal and condemnation of church, clergy, christianity, and the hypocrisy, dogma and deliberate self-delusion of religion. Pretty outrageous for 1884.\\"the story that Christ died, came to life again and was carried from earth through clouds into the heavens could not be accepted ... He (Ernest) would probably have seen it years ago if he had not been hoodwinked by people who were paid for hoodwinking him.\\" p.293\\".. he had been humbugged and the greater part of the ills which afflicted him were due to ... the influence of Christian teaching..\\" p. 298Of Ernest's clergy parents: \\"They had tried to keep their ignorance of the world from themselves by calling it the pursuit or heavenly things and then shutting their eyes to anything that might give them trouble.\\" p.288It matters little what a man professes \\"provided only that he follows it out with charitable inconsistency\\" ... p.314 I love this profound observation - that principle can be an ugly thing without charitable inconsistency.The book is about a slow witted bumpkin who, because of his genteel birth, must be saved from poverty by a secret inheritance. Ernest, the hero, learns at a painfully slow pace that his beliefs are mere witless prejudices devoid of truth.The author has Ernest find salvation later in the idea that expediency of belief trumps veracity - that accepting christianity is expedient, its truth is not relevant. I'm sure Butler, the author, would exempt his personal finances from that principle - that expediency trumps veracity.Unfortunately, those not endowed with a class birthright - like Ellen, Ernest's false wife - are not worth saving.Writes Butler: \\"We set good breeding as the corner-stone.. That a man should have been bred well and breed others well ... so that no one can look at him without seeing that he has come of good stock .. this is the desiderandum.\\"The class divide is as unbridgable to Butler as is the theological divide to his Theobald Pontifex character. Thus the book itself ends up being a monumental hypocrisy. Exactly the kind of unthinking narrow prejudices that his anti-hero Theobald Pontifex has about religion, the author, Samuel Butler, has about class. He has Ernest cured of his idiotic stupidity by having money thrust upon him. He has poor lower class Ellen condemned to be incurable from drink. To be in poverty is to be uncivilized. Ernest, upon getting money, gets back to civilization. (Butler's phrase)"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Butler's stodgily paced and, at times, slow moving novel is perhaps less compelling now that it once was; yet still presents an interesting picture of the paradoxes and hypocrises of Victorian society. Butler does not, as once reviewer claims, employ the &quot;straw man&quot; to defame Christianity. What the author does (and sadly that reviewer seems to have missed it) is demonstrate Christianity's place in justifying elite conceptions of their own purity and morality. Ernest Pontifex's quasi-puritan parents believe themselves to be the very picture of piety - when in actuality they are emotionally cruel and questionably Christian-like towards their own kin. Really, these characters, who are so imbued by their own sense of righteousness to ably examine their own lives, are a metaphor for all of Victorian society. Perhaps this metaphoric critique, no doubt very biting in its time, has lost its edge in a time of less subtle criticism. Still, worth the time to read if you're interested in the changes in both English society (and self-image) and modern literature at the turn of the century. Usually classified as a &quot;modern&quot; novel, it more aptly lies somewhere in between."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"A slow, difficult read yet not without merit. At times scathing at others jocular yet always insightful.The tale is of one Ernest Pontifex and 4 generations of his family beginning with his great-grandfather told by a family friend, Overton.The reader is exposed to the hypocrisy of Victorian values inevitably consequential in the development of our protagonist and his overbearing bible thumping father.Butler describes the twisted growth of the Pontifex family tree; one limb overshadowing the next letting it shrivel in darkness. One wonders whether the tree was planted outside the Munster residence.At times I couldn't help but hate Ernest's father and reel in disbelief in Ernests' naivety. These conflicting emotions make the book enjoyable."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is full of insightful generaliztions abou the human race embellished in a character which is so well-developed that the reader can feel pity for him for the situations which he is eveloped in are ones that we can be trapped in everyday.

His insight almost made me want to sob at times, because my own life had strong similarities to that of Ernest with his parents. I felt through Samuel Butler's words that somehow I had been healed. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"The Way of All Flesh I am sure it is a great book.... but I personally did not think it a good &#34;read&#34;I REGRET BUYING IT..."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"There's a truism coined by someone in years past that you will best appreciate a novel when you are at approximately the same age that the author was when he wrote it. Now that I've begun my second half-century, I suppose I'm pretty close to the age Samuel Butler was when he began to write his masterpiece, which probably explains why I was better able to appreciate the supreme intelligence and common sense that fills this book from start to finish. (Although it does turns out that Butler continued to work on The Way of All Flesh for more than a decade and left it unpublished before he died, so it certainly contains the accumulated wisdom of an entire life, not just that of a middle-aged man knocking on the door of his golden years.)That said, I am quite certain I would never have been able to finish this book if I had tried to read it in my twenties or even my thirties. This is certainly not a fast-paced action novel, but rather the collected musings on human nature of an older man, organized loosely into the form of a faux biography for a rather foolish young protagonist named Ernest Pontifex, as told by his elderly godfather, Mr. Overton. Butler actually begins the tale several generations back to establish some background for Ernest's eventual appearance, and the plotline of the story moves along slowly and steadily, with numerous pauses as Overton/Butler ruminates on different aspects of human nature and human culture. Some of this, admittedly, goes on overly long, but those rough patches are more than made up for by some supremely well developed sequences in the lives of the primary characters, with intelligent, often witty analysis and reflection then provided by Mr. Overton.There is one passage that I personally consider one of the most brilliant sequences I have ever come across in literature. Young Ernest, fresh from college, unworldly and foolish and pure as the driven snow, newly ordained as a man of the cloth, has decided to take rooms in a boarding house inhabited by numerous working class people, including, literally, a pair of \\"working girls.\\" He decides to convert the working class free-thinker who lives on the first floor, unaware that this man, though relatively poor, is still literate and actually rather well-read. The sequence where the avowed atheist, who has long outgrown any fire in his belly to harangue others who disagree with his world view, but instead is happy to live and let live, gently and kindly disabuses the nearly clueless but well-meaning Ernest of the idea that people are so easily swayed, is one of the more remarkable passages I have ever read. The book is full of wonderful moments like this - where we learn almost everything we need to know about incidental characters in just a few short but deftly written paragraphs.In short, virtually every personality type and every moral and philosophical situation one will ever come across in life is tackled with humor and intelligence in this book. If you are looking for action and mayhem, this is not the book for you, and I'm sure there's plenty of Robert Ludlum type novels out there that would better hold your interest instead. But if your goal is to sit beside the fire with your wise old grandfather for a few evenings and really learn about life, this would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"i guess anybody who reads this book should personaly identify with the main character.I myself loved Ernest in his struggle to find himself and leave the path forced upon him by his parents,religon and comunity. the result is an enchanting some what funny novel that is hard to put down when read and even harder to forget when finished reading it."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"According to my edition (Penguin), a large part of the credit for this book is due to Eliza Savage, Butler's close friend and unofficial editor, who died before she could improve the conclusion. I think I can spot the moment where her influence ends.Up until then the book is great. The hero is Ernest Pontifex, but Butler begins *three* generations (along the male line) before Ernest, spending considerably more time on each succeeding generation. This works wonders. For one thing, it enables us to feel alternate loathing *and* sympathy for the book's ogre, Theodore Pontifex - often simultaneous loathing and sympathy. Every single generation shows a kind of promise which is nipped in the bud, in a different way each time. Also we get a good feeling that the story is the story of the nineteenth century as a whole.Once Ernest is born the author begins to slow down, dawdle, digress and meander, never in a boring way, until a several perfectly believable crisis points follow each other in rapid succession, after which ...... after which Eliza Savage dies, or something of the kind happens, and the book collapses. It's a pity. I was certain Butler was on to something great, but he doesn't really know how to end it all. We get the kind of unsatisfactory solution that H.G. Wells, at his laziest, would come up with. Ernest even begins to behave like one of Wells's supermen.There *had* been one flaw before the collapse. Butler would often make keen observations, and then use them to launch into philosophy. Although Butler was am intelligent man he had all the philosophical ability of a taxi driver, and a taxi driver's willingness to share his thoughts. We can easily forgive him as long as the narrative is still strong and he prefaces the philosophical twaddle with intelligent remarks; but not otherwise.There's also the feeling that Butler is reigning in his horses at the end, unwilling to get stuck into Christianity and the Anglican Church as they really deserve to be stuck into. We tend to forget how much power these institutions had, and how much they abused it. Once we are reminded, Butler's willingness to allow the abuse to continue is puzzling. (Butler's remarks on Christianity are not nearly as disturbing as his remarks on art. That the official doctrine about the resurrection of Christ is absurd, is old news, and was old even when Butler wrote. The claim that Beethoven and Shakespeare were pretentious humbugs is much more shocking.)A pity about the ending - the book could have been great. Read it all the same."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I really had to keep making sure that this book was actually written in the late nineteenth century because aspects of it reflected such a modern type of dissatisfaction with one's upbringing. In other words, I might anachronistically say that the author was snarky! But whenever I was confused about the time period the book was written in, I had to think that the peculiar brand of Victorian hypocrisy displayed by the narrator's parents was, indeed, well grounded in the time period, though updated versions of this certainly persist today. Seriously, this book is hilarious on so many levels, but it's also insightful, moving, and nearly a self-help book for anyone living today: how to survive an utterly dreadful upbringing and the kind of disillusionment inevitable in young adulthood with your sense of humor and self, along with your joy for living, intact. There's just no way to describe this book, how entertaining and perceptive about human nature it is; you have to read it to believe it."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I have been working my way through the classics on my commute and I picked up this audio book because of the good reviews and I have always enjoyed satire. It turns out that I was very pleased with both the content of the novel and the reader of the audio book.The audio book was narrated by Frederick Davidson, who has done many classic novels and always does a good job. He has a British accent that has the perfect tinge of sarcasm for a novel like this. He did an excellent job with having a different voice for each character and this helped me follow the novel and distinguish easily who was talking. The voice he used for the father was especially good and sounded like the uptight, unfeeling minister that he was.I feel that the novel deserves to be on the many lists of classics that it is on. It truly is a great satirical work of fiction and it effectively pokes at many of the institutions in Victorian England. I also liked how he pointed out many truths while he was poking fun. I found myself agreeing with many of the points he brought up and sometimes I noted flaws in his characters that I have myself.This novel taught me about human nature and interaction as a great novel should. I highly recommend this book and audio book."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I'll share all the book details momentarily but here's the core of the story first:Over the course of a century three generations of the Pontifex men transpired from solid and esteemed, to religiously fanatical and noxious, to nave and repressed. Their respective spouses pretty much mirrored the husbands in both their outlook and their temperament.The ultimate protagonist, (it takes a few chapters for him to clearly emerge as the human object of this compelling yarn), Ernest Pontifex, was the eldest son of an odious Church of England clergyman, Theobald Pontifex. Whatever amount of respect Ernest had fostered for his grandfather was notably exceeded in dimension by his contempt for his own sire. Theobald constrained even Ernest's most insignificant activities throughout the lad's youth and during his subsequent college years where this young unfortunate was compelled to study, (of course), theological subjects. Ernest's self-indulgent father also derived a perverse brand of joy from the Draconian disciplinarian acts that he perpetrated without cessation against his wretched son, ergo: \\"...spare the rod, spoil the child.\\"[But I must insert here that this is definitely not a gloomy Dickensian-type novel so don't quit reading quite yet!]Ernest's most remarkable teen experience occurred on the day when an attractive, young household domestic was hastily driven from the home when it was revealed that she was soon to become a mother and the father was yet unknown to any but herself and her paramour. Ernest felt so bad for the girl that he chased after her carriage and gave the poor lass his watch and what little money that he possessed. This altruistic act, perceived as outright rebelliousness by Theobald and his nasty shrew of a wife, was rewarded with even further tyranny and psychological domination.During his years away at a small but prestigious private school under the tutelage of one Dr. Skinner, an old profligate who ranked on a scale of malevolence only slightly less prominently than Theobald himself, Ernest's blameless nose was kept firmly applied to the collegiate grindstone although his marginal grades never reflected any marked fruits of such devoted toil. Only a singular figure within Ernest's extended family gave rise to hope towards any promise of future happiness: he had an aunt, (Theobald's sister), who in addition to being kind and motherly, was wealthy as well. She was also quite close to our narrator, Mr. Overton, a man of equal understanding and tolerance, tenoned with the highest of ethical standards.And so it goes... Ernest works his way through college, into the clergy, (where he was as inept as he was miserable), and thence down numerous of life's pathways, chiefly as a consequence of events. Think of Ernest Pontifex as a Victorian version of Holden Caulfield, (the youthful and puerile protagonist of J.D. Salinger'sThe Catcher in the Rye.)My copy of this remarkable novel is the Classics Club (Walter J. Black, New York) hardcover edition (no copyright date but pretty old), with a helpful Note by R.A. Streatfeild prefacing the work, the man who saw Samuel Butler's manuscript through to its initial publication (all with Butler's deathbed permission) in 1902. Butler actually completed the book in 1884 but Streatfeild had to re-write the fourth and fifth chapters following Butler's death from the original working notes as that small segment of manuscript had been lost. Streatfeild did a fine job with this brief but enigmatic task and I could detect no inconsistency whatever in this transitory text. There are eighty-six chapters in all, spread out over 389 pages.This fictional account is conveyed in First Person, (all from Overton's perspective), and the prose and dialogues flow as does warm honey. The story is bulging with a subtle brand of typically British wit, all nicely mingled with a notably robust account of period English culture, with a marked emphasis on (fictional) prominent figures associated with the Church of England. One unique caveat of Butler's writing style was his clever literary handling of the principals: the protagonist is not the narrator as we traditionally encounter in First Person novels.I'm pretty well read in this particular era of European fiction and Butler's work much parallel's many of the positive features which we encounter in Thomas Hardy'sThe Return of the Native (Modern Library Classics); Anatole France'sPenguin Island, and; Ivan Turgenev'sFathers and Sons (Penguin Classics). This is first-rate literature -- during his lifetime Samuel Butler (born, 1835) also penned the well-known Utopian satireErewhon.In summary, this book is one of those little treasures which devotees of classic literature have to occasionally pry out of historical obscurity. It's nice that this superlative work has now seen various reprintings. I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who, like me, foster an unbridled appreciation for outstanding literature of this compelling era."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"It has been frequently observed that those who write history define it, and so it is with this wonderful novel which is, in large part, Butler's autobiography. Reviewers speak of it as having blown the lid off Victorian society; in fact, it is timeless, ruthlessly dissecting the behavior of several generations of an abusive family where the only rule is \\"Every man for himself.\\" Those who grew up in that kind of family will find it truthful and insightful, those who grew up in happy families will be perplexed.As some of the other reviews indicate, this is a book that is likely to offend conventional, especially fundamentalist, Christians. Butler's father was an ordained Anglican priest and he himself came close to being one (opting instead to run a sheep station in New Zealand for five years, an experience upon which he based \\"Erewhon\\"). Butler excoriates the hypocrisy and cant of that profession while questioning the Church's key doctrines.If you can, purchase an edition with Theodore Dreiser's introduction.Make no mistake, this is a great book.

The story is sad and painful as much as it is funny.It also has a dickensian tuch (which is always good),but it sounds more like a biography than a victorian novel.I strongly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn somthing and enjoy at the same time."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Samuel Butler wrote the main content of The Way of All Flesh by 1867, although it was not published until 1902, in order to avoid conflicts with the prevailing societal norms, institutions and individuals. It tells the story of Ernest Pontifex's personal growth through age 28 in Victorian England, as the son of Theobald Pontifex, a Christian minister who represents the social institutions of his time. The story is narrated by Ernest's godfather, Edward Overton, who plays the role of the modern, well-informed critic.Butler highlights the momentum, conservatism, self-interest, cruelty and lack of self-awareness of the core institutions of family, church, education, marriage, class and gentlemen. Centuries after the enlightenment, in the midst of the industrial revolution, but before Darwin, Freud and Marx, the children of the privileged classes know that the old institutions and solutions no longer work, but struggle to find new answers. Ironically, Chinua Achebe's 1958 novel Things Fall Apart, documenting the disruption of classic Nigerian societies in the face of western missionaries, addresses the same strain on institutions and individuals.Butler wrote for the enlightened audience of Victorian England, taunting the Church, professors, financiers, society, mothers and gentlemen. The novelist prefers the honest common sense of the working class, farmers, carpenters and sailors to the theory of academics and clergy or the speculative results of the emerging business class.Yet, he provides realistic portraits of the characters. They are human, striving and failing, educated but short-sighted, secure but concerned, generous but protective, innovative but sensitive, aware but limited, idealistic but practical. Ernest is the hero, but he is not lovable. His father Theobald is the villain, but it is difficult to demonize his shortcomings, for he is incapable of modern self-awareness. The narrator provides insights and commentary, but no real solutions. Even Ernest's mother and supportive aunt are tragically limited by their roles and social conventions.Butler's picture of the constraining role of social institutions is eye-opening for anyone who came of age after 1970 in the West. The Church is incredibly focused on sin and perfection. Parents are focused on obedience. Educators are focused on personal advancement and student compliance. The upper classes keep the lower classes in their place. Men keep women in their place. Children are burdens to be managed. Butler anticipated the post-modernist view that power preserves power by 100 years.Butler chronicles the growing conflict between faith and reason. He documents the tendency of religious institutions to take absolutist views in the face of scientific and practical evidence to the contrary. He outlines new attempts to regenerate more effective religious views which inevitably fail.This novel resonates because it portrays the essential modern conflict between a youth who desperately, deeply, intuitively desires to understand and change the world and a world which cannot simply be reduced to a formula or a faith. Butler anticipates the existentialist dilemma that requires individuals to make choices in spite of the lack of compelling evidence in one direction or the other.Read this book to reflect on the last 150 years when enlightened individuals have struggled with existential choices that are not resolved by simple religious or secular solutions. Think about the tea party and the Islamist responses which desire a return to the simpler world of certainty. In spite of the lack of certainty, what do we do?"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"A great book. This is a piece that is deserving of its #12 rating on Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels. And I would readily recommend this book to a friend.The prose was very easy, though at 736 pages it is not a fast read. Basically, this book takes a good hard look at all that is wrong with society, the church, and the role parents play in their children's lives and in the lives of future generations.The main theme is the way in which parents control and manipulate their offspring, how easy it is to be brainwashed by your parents, how difficult to break free from that grip and the way in which it all repeats itself in the next generation.Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book, some comic, some insightful:*** 'My boy,' returned my father, \`you must not judge by the work, but by the work in connection with the surroundings.*** We must judge men not so much by what they do, as by what they make us feel that they have it in them to do.***Now, look here, my lad,' he continued, \`some boys are born stupid, and thou art one of them; some achieve stupidity--that's thee again, Jim--thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy birthright--and some'(and here came a climax during which the boy's head and ear were swayed from side to side)\`have stupidity thrust upon them...'***the greatest nuisance to mankind is man'***Mr Pontifex never lacked anything he much cared about. True, he might have been happier than he was if he had cared about things which he did not care for, but the gist of this lies in the \`if he had cared.' We have all sinned and come short of the glory of making ourselves as comfortable as we easily might have done, but in this particular case Mr Pontifex did not care, and would not have gained much by getting what he did not want.***Earnest on his first day out of prison:It pleased me to see the delight he took in all about him; the fireplace with a fire in it; the easy chairs, the Times, my cat, the red geraniums in the window, to say nothing of coffee, bread and butter, sausages, marmalade, etc Everything was pregnant with the most exquisite pleasure to him. The plane trees were full of leaf still; he kept rising from the breakfast table to admire them; never till now, he said, had he known what the enjoyment of these things really was. He ate, looked, laughed and cried by turns, with an emotion which I can neither forgetnor describe...... This is the type of book this is. It shares with the reader some valuable insights the author had found out for himself and I feel it is a must read for people wanting to improve their minds."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"The main character, Ernest Pontifex,is a pathetic weakling, variously oppressed and exploited by his parents and acquaintances. He fails at everything and relies on others to get him out of difficulties. The other primary character, Ernest's godfather (another &quot;voice&quot; for the author) spends his time despising Ernest's parents and saving Ernest. Yet, since this is an autobiographical novel, the author would have you believe that Ernest is actually a brilliant iconoclast whose writings disturb Victorian society. Humbug! Butler demonizes his parents so heavyhandedly (all the characters are cardboard, etched with bile) and is so smug about it, that he, not they, comes across as the Monster. Of Human Bondage, by H. S. Maugham, touches on some similar themes and is a vastly superior work. Anything by George Eliot would also be a vastly better read from 19th C. English literature."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"An autobiographical novel about a Victorian boyhood and early manhood, The Way of All Flesh centers around the question of how to act when everyone loves your parents except you:&quot;There are orphanages,&quot; he exclaimed to himself, &quot;for children who have lost their parents--oh! why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"it's a grower. it took me a long time to summon the patience to read further than the 50th page or so. it took far too long to get on with the story. when it did though, i begun to really enjoy the book. the characters are excellently portrayed, especially ernests parents. in my humble opinion, it is very well written. my only criticizm is the tendency of the narrator to go off on tangents, mainly at the beginning of the book"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Written in the 1870's and 1880's, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is a semi-autobiographical account of Samuel Butler's life as the son of a clergyman and his attempts to abandon the religious influence of his parents. The protagonist, Ernest Pontifex, is the oldest of three children of the rector of a small English town. His father, Theobald, beats and browbeats his children into learning their hymns while his mother, Christina, solemnly and unsympathetically condones the excessive discipline.Ernest is not much of a scholar and shows a predilection for music (nothing more modern than Handel, though), which his father deems a decadent waste of time. For lack of a better calling, he chooses to become a clergyman like his father and is ordained a deacon after completing Cambridge. As a young man, he runs into some misfortune: He gets suckered into giving much of his money to a smooth-talking charlatan named Pryer, a fellow theologian, to invest, and a turbulent encounter with a prostitute lands him a few months in jail. It is here that he decides a religious path is not for him, which is just as well since he is more of a pragmatist than a dogmatist. He becomes a tailor, but his business fails; he gets married, but his wife turns out to be a lush and a bigamist. If this indeed bears any resemblance to Butler's own life, I shake my head in pity.The narrator is not Ernest himself but his godfather Edward Overton, a close friend of the Pontifex family. Butler probably thought such third-party commentary would provide a more valuable perspective, but it doesn't ring true for Overton to be privy to every single detail of Ernest's life which would not be so easily discovered or revealed. However, Butler is a good writer who peppers his prose with sly sarcasm and humorous observations to counteract its Victorian-style stodginess.For a novel that has a reputation of deconstructing and satirizing the piety of Victorian society, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" feels innocuous and tame; what could have been a fiery tirade against religious hypocrisy comes off more as a gentle prodding. For a satire to be successful, the target must be odious and obvious; the book's tone is too dull and soft to inspire the reader to hate the Pontifex family and the religious furor they represent. I respect Butler's motivation for writing this book and I wanted to symphathize with him, but I got nothing more out of it than a recounting of the irrelevant misadventures of an average man from an average middle class family."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I found myself alternately loving and hating this book. I loved it when Butler was busy telling the story of Ernest, a boy brought up in a Victorian household by overbearing parents, who feels stifled by them, the Church of England, and academia. I rooted for Ernest every step of the way, wanting him to find the love of a woman and work suitable to his talents.I hated the book when it delved deeply into philosophy and the vocabulary, rich in Victorian rhetoric, went over my head too frequently.I absolutely loved it when Ernest could thumb his nose at his pompous, overbearing, nasty father and live his life on his own terms. I could understand his hatred of church life and university life but wished that he could have kept a child-like Christian faith for himself although he certainly upheld Christian values. I was proud of him when he visited his mother as she lay dying.I would have given this book four or five stars if I could have had Ernest's story with only about a third of the philosophical discussions written in modern language.As it was, I found myself very frustrated and very anxious to get back to Ernest's story every time Butler erupted with verbal diarrhea. Ernest, although sometimes exasperating, is such a loveable character--I could have taken a lot more Ernest and a lot less discussion."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Butler finished this book in 1884, but then like Isaac Newton, left it in a drawer for twenty years and it was only published posthumously. It tells the tale of the unhappy upbringing of Ernest Pontifex; unhappy because his parents aren't nice to him & his father insists on a strict theology. The critics, Shaw, Pritchett, etc., hail it as the novel which destroyed the Victorian facade of the happy family. I guess noone had read Dickens or Trollope.I honestly don't get it. I know that the elites loathed Victorian England, but it's intellectually dishonest to pretend that contemporary authors, like Dickens and Trollope, didn't question the pretensions and conventions of their day. They act as if there was a huge conspiracy of silence and everyone believed life was perfect, until books like this one exploded onto the scene. This is patently untrue.Butler seems more important as a key figure on the road to the interior or psychological novel. It's easy to see the debt that authors like Joyce owe to him. Pretty much nothing happens and the whole book turns on Ernest having (...) parents.Tom Wolfe is giving hundreds of interviews right now decrying the psychological novel and begging authors to go out into the world and observe the life and energy of the country. We can only hope someone's listening.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Though beautifully written, The Way of All Flesh is pathetically lacking in aesthetic appeal. The plot is only mildly interesting at its peak moments, and usually not even that. What is worse though, is the lack of sympathetic characters. The closest thing Butler manages is the kindly wealthy spinster aunt - who appears but briefly, and then for the sole purpose of providing the necessary &quot;inheritance&quot; which will later set Ernest Pontifex (our &quot;hero&quot;)free from his poverty. This good fortune is presented as a great injustice finally being righted... as if Ernest was somehow entitled to explore his own naive, narrow-minded, reclusive habits at leisure.The highlight of Ernest's life is when he begins to succeed in business on his own merit - but Butler clearly does not see that. Butler is lauded as a &quot;radical&quot; social critic, but apparently clung to the belief that working as a merchant could bring joy to commoners but not to the &quot;gentle born.&quot; Am I mis-reading this text?I must believe that the book's high critical acclaim comes from its historical position as one of the first novels to present an apparently &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;rational&quot; position of secular humanism. Butler seems to be saying: &quot;If we get free of all this religious nonsense we might have a chance at a little happiness in life.&quot; How naive. How reactionary. Worse, how utterly boring.P.S. I was delighted to see that other Amazon reviewers did not feel compelled to praise this useless historical curiousity."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"This book just didn't stand up for me. The problem with social satires is that once the culture changes its hooks and barbs lose much of their rhetorical force. As accute as it must have been a hundred years ago, Butler's critique of 19th century English culture just isn't as relevant today as it was when it was first written, and so for me the book was a disappointment.Nonetheless, Butler's insights and (often) insults on the nature of the parent-child relationship make the book eminently readable, and occasionally quite illuminating. And the glimpse into the struggle that went into making a man during that time of industrualization was similarly fascinating. The juxtaposition of the economic realities which faced a young man then versus now was, for me, the most interesting aspect of the novel."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Book is what my husband wanted. He read it when he was a young man. Just a review."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"The honesty is great. He nails the depiction of a dysfunctional Christian family, and its warping effect on the protagonist.But the resolution is shallow. It all adds up to, \\"Life gave me the shaft, so I threw out the baby with the bathwater.\\"If you want a modern take on the same story, check out Craig Thompson's \\"Blankets.\\" It reads a lot faster, and says pretty much the same thing. Family dysfunction, perversion and warped sexuality, lost faith."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"A very important novel of the 19th Century. How it is included in the best novels of the 20th Century by the New York Times is beyond me. The book was begun more than 30 years before 1900. Although completed in 1872, it lay unpublished for nearly 30 years; presumably until such time as some of its anti-Victorian ideals would be more palatable to the British public.The story principally centers around the life of Ernest Pontifex, an impreesionable and naive young man who is reared by devout Anglican parents. Their well meaning cruelty shelter Ernest and cause him to make bad decisions and derail his ambitions. As a result of the consequences of these bad decisions, Ernest learns to manage his own life and becomes a success despite his early failures.Although important in its time, the novel is brutally slow."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Ernest Pontifex/The Way of All Flesh is a fabulous book. It's almost sickeningly personal, and therefore ahead of its own time and so influential as to be trite or &quot;boring&quot; in ours. Understand, though. This makes it no less of an achievement. It is the memoir to end all memoirs, yet it preceded all memoirs."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"Recommended as a classic, I found this book to be dry and uneventful as a book could be. I was only mildly captivated by the character of Ernest and the rest of his self-rightious family. This book is more of a psychology work than a novel."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first. Butler's pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"&quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; seems to be best known as the Victorian novel that thumbed its nose at Victorian novels. For this reason, it's frequently mentioned in talks of literary history, but I don't ever hear of anyone praising Samuel Butler's novel from an artistic perspective. Actually, I find the book more interesting for its story than for its place in the development of 19th and 20th century literature.I tried to read this novel once and only got through the first 100 pages or so. I found it remarkably dull and dry, and the tone of the first-person narrator (Mr. Overton), who stops the action every 10 pages or so to offer personal asides that reveal more about him than about the characters he's writing about, I thought to be snide and irritating.But I hate not finishing a book, so I picked it up again, this time understanding that it would be a dry read and prepared to appreciate it for its historical context. To my surprise, I found myself caught up in the story and thought the whole thing very funny. I can't believe I missed all the humour the first time through.I hesitate to give this novel too much credit for deflating the pompous bubble of Victorian morality, because other authors writing at the same time as Butler were doing the same thing (Dickens for one can be incredibly caustic). But there is a maturity to Butler's writing that is not present in other Victorian writers. This novel feels much more modern than anything else written pre-1900, and even feels more modern than some books written after. Unlike Dickens, whose characters are either all good or all bad and have about as much depth as the characters you'd find in a comic book (this isn't a criticism--I like Dickens), Butler's characters (at least Ernest, his protagonist) seem very much alive and flawed. Ernest is easily influenced by everyone around him and makes decisions based on how he thinks he should act rather than how he wants to act. He doesn't know what he wants out of life, he's a screw up, he's got lousy luck. All of these things make him quite endearing because they make him so human. The scathing criticism of religious hypocrisy and moral bombast exhibited by the majority of people in Ernest's life can be funny, especially if you agree with it (as I do), but the story itself is much more interesting than the social commentary.I would definitely recommend this book. It's not necessarily a page turner, but it consistently held my interest. Just remember that it's supposed to be funny. Think of Butler as a 19th century Evelyn Waugh, and you should do just fine."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"The Way of All Flesh covers six generations of strife in the Pontifex family, and spans a period from 1750 to 1880. However, the bulk of the story concerns the life of Ernest Pontifex, from about age 5 up to age 28, and describes his unsatisfactory relations with his parents, his school, his church, his wife, and his friends. Sometimes we feel sorry for Ernest, because many of his problems are caused by unbelievably cruel or thoughtless people, and sometimes we're furious with him, because he himself is the author of at least half of his troubles, but either way his misfortunes make him stronger and move him steadily along the path to maturity. Throughout, the book remains an easy read, although the writing is very witty and often rewards close examination.Even today, 100 years after the book's publication, a reader finds many things to identify with. Anyone who felt unjustly treated by his or her parents or teachers will find much to sympathize with here. Anyone who has wrestled with the conflict between Reason and Faith will find much to think about here. Given how much change the last century has seen, it's surprising how many of the issues still seem fresh and relevant, and the book definitely makes you think about them. It is easy to see how many people have described reading The Way of All Flesh as a turning point in their lives.A point worth keeping in mind: the characters are all described from Ernest's point of view. Several clues tell us that Ernest exaggerates the cruelty of various characters - some of whom seem evil beyond belief, and I think it's quite clear that, at these points, we're supposed to smile at Ernest - not shake our heads at the author. This is most obvious with Ernest's schoolmaster, Dr. Skinner, whom Ernest consistently sees as a pompous fool, but who we also know is very popular with the best students, and who shows other signs of being a much better man than Ernest believes him to be.The footnotes in my edition (Penguin Classics 1986) are very skimpy, focusing on comparing elements from Ernest's fictional life to Samuel Butler's real one. The failure of the notes to translate passages in French or Latin, or to explain very contemporary references, is inexcusable. (E.g. but for the recent controversy over his Beatification, we'd have no clue that \\"Pio Nono\\" was Pope Pius IX.) Hoggart's introduction (1966) is decent but a bit dated, not having weathered as well as the book itself!"},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I read this book after reading all the reviews on Amazon not knowing what to expect: Incredibly boring or amazing insightful? I have read many books written in that same time period. I believe this to be the most mature work to come out of England in the late 19th Century(although it was published later). I enjoy Dickens, Hardy, and Eliot very much, but Butler makes their works look like grocery store fiction. I can see how many people might be bored if they were expecting a great story. While the story is excellent, it is more a book about ideas. Butler uses his hero to voice his commentary on Victorian ideals. Most of it is still very relevant today, though. I think it will be most relevant for people that have been exposed to the religious right wing who still hold many Victorian values. I enjoyed the characters and the story was compelling. There are many beautiful passages. It was very funny at times and somewhat sarcastic. The narrator reminded me of Hemmingway born 50 years earlier in England. What impressed me the most was Butler's modern style of writing. Much less wordy than Dickens. Dickens would have taken 800 pages to express the same thoughts. I also felt a real kindred to the main character Ernest. This is ultimately a coming of age book which most people will be able to relate to in one way or another (unless you haven't grown up yet). I would recommend it to all serious readers."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"This is a book written ostensibly by a godfather, chronicling the family history and the unusual life of Earnest Pontifex, the only son of a very upright and religiously correct Christian minister. It is reportedly an almost autobiographical account of the author's own life and reflects his own lifetime revelations with regard to society, religion and morality. It goes extensively into the lives of his parents and their parents, allowing the reader to fully appreciate the inevitable life into which Ernest is born. The Way Of All Flesh explores the difficult struggles of a naiive young man coming to terms with his parents' and society's expectations of him while he endeavors to find his place in the world. His life begins as an avalanche of yesteryear--Victorian and Christian values are laid out, explored, tried, tested, examined and rejected as Earnest muddles his way to true happiness and a life worth living. If it were published during Samuel Butler's life, it would surely have resulted in some kind of social or legal censure as a shocking indictment of the establishment of the day. In many respects, it is still as revealing, shocking and valid as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"A rich, intelligent, historically informative masterpiece that tells the modern reader about the concerns, delusions, pretensions and prejudices of Englishmen of the 1700s and 1800s.Much more than just a novel, this work offers Butler's opinions upon philosophy, child-rearing and religion. The events of the novel serve to illustrate and reinforce the points made. It is a hybrid, a novel/essay, and rare at that. More essayists should spice up their arguments by dressing them with vivid characters and a decent plot, as Butler has.Rich in wit, satire, sarcasm, humor, insight, and not without flashes of bitterness and anger.If you read only a hundred books in your lifetime, this would not be such a bad choice for the eightieth or eighty-first. Towers above most novels that cover this long period in history (some hundred years or so, spanning four or more generations)."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"This book did cause quite a stir when it was published. Samuel Butler wrote in a \\"no-holds-barred\\" style that attacked the Victorian era at its core. He shows the family as a tormented assembly bound together by illusion and make-believe, or even by hatred, fear and hypocrisy. As shocking as this was at the time, Mr. Butler was actually revealing secrets from his own family. He doesn't stop at the family. He put holes in the marital institution, the Church and at educational facilities. I know this sounds like a toxic book, but it is really not. Only true genius can write a book like this one. It is a book where the author's temperament comes shining through its pages. If nothing else, it's an honest a picture that you'll get anywhere of Victorian life."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I won't pretend that this book is a quick page-turner, full of sparkle and a romp. In fact it gets bogged down rather too often in discussions about how ironically we conduct our lives and what would be the intelligent alternative. But it is a fine achievement nonetheless and a good cautionary tale about people taking themselves and their lives way too seriously. The depiction of family life reminded me of Satykov-Schedrin's \\"The Family Golovlyov,\\" that savage recounting of the ultimate dysfunctional family: Some of Butler's exposing of each family member's real agenda is a supreme hoot, and very perceptive indeed. Please know too that \\"The Way of All Flesh,\\" published in 1903, is an acknowledged precursor to much of our greatest Twentieth Century literature. George Bernard Shaw has admitted his debt, but I also wonder how James Joyce must have been affected, and many, many others. But for us, as we begin the Twenty-First Century, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is at least a delicious book to savor and to open our eyes."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"There is nothing remarkable about the literary style of Butler's book; it reads like a million and a half other 19th century British novels. What distinguishes \\"The Way of All Flesh\\", however, is its honest and at times funny portrayal of Victorian society. With great wit, Butler's narrator, Overton, and main character, Ernest, expose the stuffy, staid, hypermannered, insipid Victorian middle-class mindset.What is especially nice is that Butler doesn't take too many cheap shots. The characters here are very well-drawn. Ernest's father, Theobald, though clearly representing all that Butler seeks to skewer, is enough of a three-dimensional foil that I could feel some sympathy for the poor old man. (He's not evil incarnate, just a sorry product of his time.) The same goes for the rest of the supporting cast. I like the narrator's voice; it's distinctive and wry enough to be unique, but not so intrusive as to distract from the plot.Parts of the novel are funny; parts seem to drag. I don't know that I liked the end of the novel--everything seems tied together a little too perfectly; but an explanation may be found in the fact that Butler did not edit this portion of the novel before his death.This is a solid book. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about this book after just reading it. I feel that Butler was able to capture the complexity of familial relationships tainted with puritanical religious beliefs. I think he really does a good job of showing the hypocrisy of certain religious beliefs. I think he challenges one not to blindly accept things without questioning them. The only problem I had with the book is that it is filled with Victorian and religious allusions that I did not understand. Also, there is a fair amount of Latin phrases that I could not translate myself. Those parts of the book will forever remain a mystery to me."},{"Title":"Way of All Flesh","review":"It's a hoot to read the clipped, sullen dismissals of this book by readers from Topeka to Boston. They obviously hate Butler's novel, and for good reason: the mealymouthed, Christian, moneygrubbing Victorian family on which he spits with such accuracy moved west in the course of the twentieth century. It is now only rarely to be found in England; its true home is...Topeka...and Boston...and a thousand other American whited sepulchres. One reviewer whines that this is the &quot;irrelevant&quot; story of &quot;an average middle-class man from an average middle-class family.&quot; What an interesting form of &quot;irrelevance&quot;!In fact, the novel is brilliant and has endured surprisingly well. To see its relevance, all you need do is move its setting 3.000 miles to the West."},{"Title":"The Way of Life","review":"Beutifully translated version of the Tao Te Ching!

Not only does Blakney misread the Chinese grammar in several places, his interpretations are both under-thought and under-written. If an inexpensive translation is what you're looking for, Penguin has a $5 D.C. Lao translation that isn't all that bad. If, however, you want really excellent translations, here's my advice: For a more interpretive Neo-Taoist reading, pick up Victor H. Mair's. This is a good place to start reading the Tao Te Ching, in my opinion. If, however, you want a truly excellent translation, Philip J. Ivanhoe has done quite nicely. Moss Robert's translation is just as good overall, but also includes notes on the differences between the MaWangDui and Guodian texts compared to the Wang Bi (which is what he and everyone translates), so that'd be my ideal choice. Don't buy this book, it's a cheap way for the publishing house to try and score some sales from nothing at all.I'm currently working on a research piece on translations of P'u in the English texts, so these critiques come as the result of my working with all these books."},{"Title":"The Way of Life","review":"I was in the People's Bookstore on the East Side of Milwaukee in the 80's.

R B Blakney's insight about the mysticism is quite quite informative.

That being said, it does give one a different perspective and is well worth the read.

Again like Carus, however, Blakney's language is often dated, and the paraphrasing that appears at the bottom of each poem, as if in translation of the translation, is distracting at best. For enthusiasts of Lao Tzu who like to study the development of our understanding of this marvelous view of life in the history of its articulation into English, having a copy of the Blakney is essential. But for those who wish to simply enjoy Lao Tzu's voice in a modern English rendering, the work of Ursula LeGuin, Stephen Mithcell, or Feng/English would be sufficient. ..."},{"Title":"The Way of Life","review":"This remains the best translation of Lao Tsu.

I have family from the areas she writes about and can envision them as young vibrant people with hopes and dreams, it makes me want to research my family history more. A great read!"},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater (Prosecutor Helen West & Detective Geoffrey Balley Mysteries)","review":"It was a good book...really it was. I mean, I read it in 2 days. I was just a little disappointed in the end. There wasn't an epiloge (or how ever you spell it!) to tell me what happened to Thad and Jill. That's why I was disappointed. Usually, Garlock tells you what has happened to the characters in an epiloge but this time she didn't. Sigh...I guess I have to make up my own ending.

The characters are endearing, the setting and description of history is great, but the plot is so predictable. It is like many of her past books, well to do man in town is always the bad guy, has the wool pulled over the town town, take hero/ine who is from wrong side of tracks to figure it out. I read it because it continues the story of the characters from The Edge of Town, but it isn't as good."},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater (Prosecutor Helen West & Detective Geoffrey Balley Mysteries)","review":"All of Dorothy Garlock's series are excellent.

In it, we are reintroduced to old characters, Jill, Joe, and Thad from the first book (they, with the exception of Thad are siblings of the main character) and are introduced to several new characters.Jill has traveled to Rainwater, an oil town, to take over the running of a Motel while her namesake Aunt is sick. Not shortly after she arrives, Thad comes along to look after her until her brother Joe gets there.Unfortunately, while she and Thad are out on a walk, they find the headless body of a woman. All signs point to the rich oil baron of the town, at least the signs pointed out by Lloyd Madison, a lawyer with a strange red devil mark on his face.Madison doesn't just cause trouble for the oil baron though, he also seems to like to antagonize Jill's aunt for a reason unknown to all but the aunt. He also likes to stir others into a frenzy when it suits him.The story revolves around finding the killer and the budding romance between Thad and Jill. There's a lot of drama and mystery with just a touch of a love story thrown in.Like the other two novels I've read by her, this one shares a common theme. In each of the three books thus far in the Missouri series, at least one girl is a victim of a rape. There is also a great deal of mentioning breasts. While I can understand these as use for plot motives, does it have to be in every single book? Some variety would be nice. In addition, this one's language and the character's actions still don't fit with the time period.Garlock's writing is nice but I wonder if she wouldn't be better suited to write about a different time period. Her language and the character's actions would much fit better for around the fifties or sixties. She does tend to be pretty crude at times and has no problems with profanity or sexual descriptions in her books.I'm not sure if I'll be reading any more books by Garlock. It might be tempting just to see if she adds the same elements to every other book she writes. But anymore they are just different variations on the same theme.A Place Called RainwaterCopyright 2003404 pages plus notes"},{"Title":"A Place Called Rainwater (Prosecutor Helen West & Detective Geoffrey Balley Mysteries)","review":"This is a good book about a hotel owner, Justine Bryers, who was raped and had a son with a red mark on his face that was very angry and out for revenge against her.

The amazing uptake of cellphones worldwide in just 10 years has shown this. But in such markets as India, cellphone usage is still in its infancy. Plus, in developed countries, the introduction of more powerful cellphones and other wireless devices has driven ever greater bandwidth consumption.The papers in this book give suggestions on possible directions that may unfold. The papers covering ad hoc networks are especially fascinating, for these merge into existing ideas of smart dust and pervasive, nomadic, wearable computing.It's probably true to say that each major topic in the book has vast commercial applications. As just one example, it describes significant difficulties in deploying a wireless net inside a building. Yet, just in homes, the market is huge, as attested by the domestic usage of WiFi. Plus, of course, inside commercial buildings, wireless is attractive because of the cost of the cabling alternative.To some readers, perhaps frustration may result from reading the text. Some of the vistas suggested are indeed glittering. Still, if that is how you feel, perhaps you can use this book to help bring about that future."},{"Title":"The Duke decides,","review":"Again tunis proves he is one of the greatest writers for boys.

I'm Ok, You're Ok if and only if I am given a Processor that enables gaining ALL the Information before rushing for analysis and Judgment.!

Harris has published the results of his pioneering work in this best selling book. This is probably one of the best books that explains how to use this theory in improving all kinds of personal relationships.Dr. Harris starts off by going into the history of Transactional Analysis and the theories of those before Dr. Eric Berne. The second chapter explains the basic of Transactional Analysis which is the concept of the Parent, Adult, and Child ego states that are supposed to compose each and every one of our personalities. The Parent ego state contains all the information we accept as true that we have gathered from authority figures including our parents. The Adult ego state is the collection of all information that we have proven to ourselves as being true (using some sort of logic). The Child ego state is our natural good and bad side of feelings - love, anger, greed, empathy, etc. The author extensively uses the phrase P-A-C (Parent-Adult-Child) through the rest of the book.Dr. Harris then introduces the concept of the four different life positions that each of us adopts at any given time. All of us apparently go through four life positions ending up with the last one in a sequential manner except some of us get stuck in the earlier stages (this results in problems that typically need therapy). These four positions are -1. I'm Not OK, You're OK2. I'm Not OK, You're Not OK3. I'm OK, You're Not OK4. I'm OK, You're OKThe next few chapters of the book focus on the fact that we can change no matter what stage we are stuck in and the theory behind how to change. The chapters after that focus on a few specific types of relationships - with spouses, children and adoloscents. There is then a chapter discussing when treatment is necessary and the book wraps up with a couple of chapters on P-A-C with regards to moral values and social implications of P-A-C. These last two chapters are more subjective and probably the author's personal views at that time. I have typically tried to take the information in these two chapters with a grain of salt.Overall, this is an excellent book on using Transactional Analysis in improving your relationships with the most important people of your life. I found this book easier to read than 'Born to Win' or some of the original works by Dr. Eric Berne. This seems to be a common sentiment among those who have read and like books on Transactional Analysis. More than most self-help books out there, this book promises to lead to the most amount of positive changes. This is probably due to the systematic approach that is followed through out the book and the fact that it is very easy to follow and implement at almost any age.Enjoy this life altering book!"},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I read this book, and I would have to say that it is one of the best tools in understanding how and why people act the way that they do. I work with the public every day, and was at my wit's end with my customers and the way that they act. After reading this book I have a deeper understanding of their and my inner workings and have found my work life to be more productive and less confrontational. Great book."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I believe I found this book abandoned in a box on my street, or was given it, or possibly even paid a dollar for it at a used book store clearance sale.However I got it, I wasn't expecting much: I had heard the title & assumed it was some coddling, outdated '70s feel-good hippie crap, to be perfectly honest.Instead it is about the most useful \\"self help\\" book I've ever read by far, though I haven't read many of that genre... let's just say it is the most useful book I've read in quite a while, one that I actually understood & was inspired by &, even more amazing, find myself applying.The gist is, we all have competing forces in us, except that instead of the Freudian Id, Ego & Superego (which I never felt too excited about), we have P-A-C, Parent, Adult, & Child.Now I'm not sure, but I think this might be the origin of the irritating & irrelevant (to me, at least) concept of \\"getting in touch with your inner child,\\" but the way this is presented in the book is anything but facile or condescending, & relevant to just about every human being I know.We start off as a child, obviously, and this Child voice seeks instant gratification, & pleasure, it avoids pain, & it thinks it's the Center of the Universe.As the child learns it can't have its way, as it is blocked in various ways, limited, as desires are denied, it creates the Parent, the Voice that Knows, knows when to punish, to withhold, to control, to prescribe, to explain, etc.The idea is that most of us are existing as little more than those two forces fighting it out inside of us, moment to moment. The Parent that wants to be in charge & control & know it all, & the Child that wants to relax & indulge & have it his way, right away.[Uh-oh, I'm going into this too deeply, losing reader's interest...]In short, the Adult is the part in us that can consciously examine itself, ourselves, both the \\"mindless\\" hungers & fears of the Child, as well as the authoritarian, simplistic, inflexible & often archaic voice of the Parent. It can pick & choose &, in the moment, do what's best, what's really appropriate.When reading this I noticed all sorts of things that harmonize with Buddhism, & realized at one point, after finishing the book & giving it a lot of thought, that the Parent-Adult-Child concept is more or less perfectly analogous to the Clinging-Mindfulness-Aversion concepts, respectively.At first it seemed a fusion, a synthesis of Buddhism & Western psychology, but now I just think that it contains ideas from both, & goes in its own unique direction with them... and goes far.Hopefully I've not rambled too much. I think this book applies to every human being, describes all of our struggles, & gives some pretty decent answers to how we might better approach them. & that really says it all."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"This is a must read for people who want to understand themselves and other people better. I agree that the idea of child-adult-parent may not reflect the exact way how our brains work but it provides an easy-understandable terminilogy to describe and think about our behaviour.

It really works for me, thanks to Thomas Harris and Eric Berne."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"Thomas Harris' book is on my top five list of books dealing with how to live a full and complete life. In an age when self-esteem is a major problem for so many people Harris has given a useful, easily understood, and applied solution. In this book he talks of the four options for our life stance, and then develops in a very convincing way why I'm OK-You're OK is the most reasonable, rational choice. In my counseling practice spanning 35 years this was the book I most frequently recommended.Bob Pavelsky, Ph.D."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I recently finished reading this book. This is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour. It would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book.Some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself. While I am not qualified to comment on these reviews, one thing I can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it. A theory, that too developed quarter century ago, can not be expected to stand 100% vindicated today. The more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to. So may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things. After reading this book I could find out why I behave the way I behave mostof the times. To a certain extent I learnt to control my responses. Also I have a feeling that the claims made by Dr. Harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge, then prevalent.Second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people. I think this conclusion is far from correct. Dr. Harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to \\"I am not ok and you are ok\\" category. Out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual. The objective here is not to merely categorize, but to show that how most of us have the common position \\"I am not ok and you are ok\\". Now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature, but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses.Third critisism on this book stems from the fact Dr. Harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100%. It seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon. I don't think Dr. Harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100%. The books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals (with whom he does not agree 100%) for the benefit of the reader. To call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself.I feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers. Read this book with an open mind. Read the chapeters on PAC and marriage, PAC and children, PAC and social implications, PAC and moral values. In this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day, it tries to teach something good (and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute). Thanks."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I was put off by the title of this book until someone I respected a great deal recommended it. The first chapter is a little hard to wade through as the general principles are explained, but after wading through that I found myself exclaiming &quot;Yes! Exactly!&quot; as I read through. It gave me a great deal of food for thought as I recognised aspects of my own personality and the people around me. Because the basic principles were simple yet effective, the book's message has stayed with me, helping me communicate more effectively with family, friends and workmates."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"The author starts the book with a chapter on experiments that were performed, involving electrical stimulation to certain areas of exposed brains during surgery. These experiments purportedly yielded some of the first and most important discoveries ever made into how our minds work. Then he uses the findings to explain the rest of his theories. But, further research by me into these claims showed that the claims were exaggerated, speculative and did not have the acceptance of modern day neuroscientists. I continued reading the book making allowances for the fact that nuggets of Truth may still be hidden under mounds of speculation and media hype.The author borrows from Eric Berne, MD, the ideas of Transactional Analysis, which assumes the basic scientific unit of psychotherapeutics to be \`The Transaction'; and the concept of \`Parent' \`Adult' and \`Child'. Then Dr Harris theorizes that we live our lives according to one of four life positions.While all this may seem to be true at the first glance, a moment of rumination indicates that this is a gross simplification of the human nature. It is indeed audacious on the part of Dr Harris to categorize all the 5 Billion plus individuals into four, albeit dynamic, basic types. Like a modern day \`scientific' version of the 12 zodiac signs, readers are sure to go through the book minutely wanting to classify themselves into the categories and seeking to look into their own nature and their angst ridden past present and future.Next he seems to say, \\"Wait, you are not condemned to live in any one of these four categories, you can change. Come to me, I shall teach you how..\\".The most interesting and useful part of the book is when the author talks of children, marriage in the chapters \`P-A-C and Marriage' and \`P-A-C and Children'. The chapter on marriage is particularly insightful. The impact of TA can be felt in the most intimate relationships, as they are fully embodied in day-to-day transactions. Cross indexing with the classic TA book \`Games People Play' makes the reading even more fruitful and offers amazing angles of analyzing and bettering our relationships. I was amazed by the range and depth of Dr Eric Berne's \`Games People Play', specially the last chapter - Beyond Games. Dr Harris does a superlative job in the section \` The Establishment of Goals' of the chapter \`P-A-C and Marriage'. Here he talks of various issues that threaten to rupture the delicate fabric of a peaceful and loving marital life. -the balance of realities of life like materialism and desire compared to mortgage and bills. -the long term goals, -the considerations of moral values, ethics and religion. The Author offers solutions to the posed problems and they are worthwhile. The passage describing the complex P-A-C interactions in a marriage is masterly and is a comprehensive solution to the many ills that plague almost all the marriages at some point, in some form.Another pitfall of Dr Harris is his propensity to quote a range of philosophers to suit his need and context. He quotes Sartre and Srren Kierkegaard but dissociates himself from their Phenomenologic Ontology, inspite of the fact that TA is an offshoot of Phenomenology. The Author cannot be classified to belong to any known system of thought nor does he propose an alternative. But that does not stop him from taking their words in bits and pieces, perhaps to lend him an aura of wisdom. After all an MD has to play the wise old man. The most disturbing is the attempt at presenting the Christian Theology in a twisted way, for example, by drawing parallels of the Original Sin and Grace to his games, and getting away with sweeping generalizations.Perhaps, the real gem of Dr Harris' book lies in its message that even the mundane transactions have psychological underpinnings that might indicate dysfunctional childhood experiences and unhealthy adult thinking patterns, all of which can be changed for a better and enriching future for each of us. But his claims that TA is a complete theory of psychotherapy and the solution to all the psychological and psychiatric ills of the day is exaggerated and is not supported by the modern day shrinks. This book typifies the multitude of books on pop psychology, self-help and self confidence -good for a two week boost, and one gets down to one's old self."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I read this book when I was eleven years old, and somehow, I was just old enough to understand it. While Freud uses smoke and mirror terms like &quot;id&quot;, &quot;ego&quot; and &quot;super ego&quot;, Harris uses simple terms like &quot;child&quot;, &quot;adult&quot; and &quot;parent&quot;, meaning roughly the same thing but being more accessible. He starts the book off with a chapter on experiments that were performed, involving electrical stimulation to certain areas of exposed brains during surgery. These experiments yielded some of the first and most important discoveries ever made into how our minds work. Then he uses the findings to explain the rest. This is good stuff, beautifully done.

At the time it was first published more than 40 years ago, \\"Transactional Analysis\\" was in its infancy. Harris brought it into the mainstream \\"pop psychology\\" realm, and helped many people understand their fundamental problems in troubled interpersonal relationships.In my professional work counseling recovering alcohol/drug addicts, I use much the same techniques, but we now call it \\"codependency\\" -- a term popularized by Melodie Beattie in the '80s in her seminal work \\"Beyond Codependency: And Getting Better All the Time.\\" (Beattie has subsequently expended and enlarged on this concept in later books.) Harris also laid the foundation for understanding aggressive/assertive/passive-aggressive behavior. In fact, I use his exact words \\"I'm OK, you\\"re OK\\" in my class as the fundamental concept underlying assertive (healthy) behavior. Harris lives on!Just because it's \\"pop\\" doesn't make it wrong. Harris's book may seems quaint and dated compared with what we know now. But it had serious impact in its time, and opened the door to greater popular understanding of the dynamics of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships.Yesterday I ran across a first-edition with an undamaged dustcover, and bought it for $10.

In all this book serves the perfect example of amateurish attempts at pop psychology that has done more harm than anticipated."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"It is a good descriptive book on the subject but it is salted with a politically liberal bias.

I have a friend in Los Angeles who used what he called the \\"10% Rule,\\" which somehow how to do with making it 10% of the page count of the book. Personally, if I'm not enjoying a book enough to continue, I just put it aside. Sometimes I restart them; more often than not, they languish.This self-help book by Harris was a recommendation from the Lutheran minister who married Jill and I. It was a requirement of his that we do some pre-marital counseling with him before he would conduct the ceremony, and though neither of us felt it necessary, we humored him in this request. As it turned out, we enjoyed the experience, because it helped us talk about some things that we had conveniently swept under the rug for the many years we had spent together. We also enjoyed the little self-assessment test that he made us take-- we maxed out the \\"Equality\\" section, an indication of how much we view each other as full partners in our relationship.I wish I could say the same thing about I'm OK - You're OK, but it just wasn't as much fun or as enlightening as even that simple test. I felt that the book was extremely dated, and, given my feeling of equality as an important issue, quite sexist in its own way. I remember having some difficulties with another self-help book of this same period years ago (I believe it was Gail Sheehey's Passages), where the examples were so flamingly early seventies that to read them was like seeing people wearing gold chains and bell-bottom trousers. And throughout the book, I found myself wanting to be reading Games People Play, which is referenced many times within this book, and sounded like a much more interesting treatise."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"This is a simple catchall book. However cursory as the detail is about achieving the state of all round OKness, many of us, myself included were helped by this book. it illustrated the 4 key states of Ok. it has helped me resolve conflict among others since I can Identify what's the matter and see if i can rectify it. This is a critical book and should be a cornerstone to build upon. Even in a Seinfeld episode, I saw George Castanza with an I'm Ok You're Ok book, although he was ashamed that Jerry should see him with it. I say, why should one be ashamed to be reading a self help book. To act as though you are perfectly all right and that you are perfectly well adjusted without reading anything to identify you're personal strenghts and weaknesses is a sign of conceitedness and shows a superiority complex; not a good thing. This shows me that you aren't ok since you need to cover up your insecurities under a mask/facade: I'm better than you and I'm always right, don't correct me, did I ask you? etc... not only reflect your insecurity, but will drive people AWAY from you. oh yeah.

Transactional Analysis is a timeless process because the human mind doesn't change. TA's psychology is as useful today as when it was first developed by Dr. Eric Berne. Dr. Harris not only explains TA throughly, but extends it by creating a higher level of psychology based on it. This book is not \\"psycho-babble,\\" but a powerful method of understanding social interactions between oneself and others, and is written in plain English! This book may not be too useful for hermits that live alone on some Pacific isle, but if you live in the real world, this book will help you relate more successfully to others."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"I really enjoyed the illustrations of relationships this book had to offer. Basically, there are different combinations - usually between 2 people but can be more - in which certain mindsets or stages of ego-consciousness (Parent, Child, and Adult or Superego, Id and Ego) engaged in dialogue will result in certain reactions and responses. There are consistent patterns in this, a sort of script if you will. In analyzing one's own scripts, one can break free from them and find a third way, that is, of the Adult, and attract other Adults; or at least, be able to effectively resolve issues that could easily be avoided. This is an attempt to mature one's methods of communication.

It is a journey that you must discover and rediscover where you came from. Thomas Harris ferrets out the dangerous yearnings we have failed to comprehend as adults. He gives us a place to see how it all began, a way to find ourselves, an approach to understand our predicament. Equipped with an understanding of background, we can build a lifetime of hope upon it.In his concept of the self-awareness/self-worth paradigm, he clearly identifies four life views: I'm not OK, you're not OK, I'm not OK, you're OK, I'm OK, you're not OK and I'm OK, you're OK. How we feel about ourselves and how we relate to others really determines how well adjusted we are in the world. Reflecting on these four views, the book gives us hope.The book, however, gives us more than hope, enriching our spirit with a wonderfully crafted writing style, entertaining us at the same time. I found that I could not put the book down until it was finished. I think I read the whole thing in one sitting.

And while I have generally very little regard for \\"self-improvement\\" manuals, I believe that the technique of \\"Transactional Analysis\\" and the underlying framework of the Parent/Adult/Child psychological model makes this a very valuable book for anyone who genuinely wants to understand and modify their own relationships with other people whether in brief encounters or lifelong."},{"Title":"I'm OK--You're OK","review":"One of the best books I have read till date.

He explains how interpersonal communication is based on three roles, parent, child, and adult. We struggle to maintain an adult role and not revert to the finger-pointing, rigid, and rule following parent, or the overemotional, irrational presentation of the child. Our goal is to stay in our adult role as much as possible. Overflow between roles can create delusions and prejudices. He notes that one way to maintain the \\"adult\\" role is to be aware of when you are reverting to the parent or child, to note the triggers that bring on these less helpful or useful roles.Another way to maintain and use your \\"adult\\" is to essentially know who you are and who you aren't, to determine what are your personal genuine and authentic guidelines, rules, judgments, preferences, and ideals. Knowing who you are in a big way can make the smaller decisions we all make on a daily basis easier and more automatic. I especially enjoy Dr. Harris' explanations of how the P-A-C model affects us socially and morally not just in our 1:1 interactions with family and friends but in our interactions in society as a whole.Ellen M.

My experience of the genre taught me that the best way to learn to dislike a writer or a historic figure was to read their biography. There are too many lives of celebrities that are written in a plodding, confusing way and that offer nothing more than a disjointed collection of gossip and boring lists of people the person whose biography one is reading met in the course of their life.And then I read Victoria Glendinning's biography of Anthony Trollope and realized what the genre was supposed to be about. Glendinning had a difficult task ahead of her. Trollope is not the most fascinating Victorian writer, and his life is, to be completely honest, quite boring. He worked for the Post Office, lived in Ireland, married, lived happily with his wife, wrote books, they became popular, wrote more books, they became even more popular, and so on. Only misery makes for good basis for a book. A successful, mostly contented existence such as Trollope's looks uneventful and pedestrian to his XXIst century fans.Glendinning, however, manages to make this 500-page-long biography read like a mystery novel. Victorian era comes alive on the pages of this fascinating book. We meet Trollope's extraordinary mother, his not very endearing brother, his unsuccessful sons, and many of his friends from the literary circles of Victorian England. Trollope's extensive travels allow us to visit Italy, the United States, Australia and the West Indies and catch a glimpse of what they were like and how the were seen by a conservative English writer of that time. Glendinning gives us just enough details of Trollope's novels to make us want to read them but not as many as will spoil our future reading pleasure. In the Preface Glendinning states that if the readers of her biography of Trollope decide to reread one or several of the writer's books after finishing the biography, she will consider her goal in writing it fulfilled. I am pleased to say that the author achieved her goal. Right after finishing Glendinning's book, I ordered a Kindle copy ofThe Way We Live Now, the novel that Glendinning (and many other fans of Trollope) consider to be the author's masterpiece."},{"Title":"ANTHONY TROLLOPE","review":"After looking at reviews of Trollope biographies, I chose this one and am glad I did. It is informative as well as extremely readable. Also has photographs which help illustrate the book. It helped me to understand Trollope better. While I was not always sure I would have liked him as a person, I admire his dedication to his craft. Some dislike Trollope because he wrote for money (he even published in his autobiography how much he made from different novels), he is not different there than many best-selling novelists today. But he is a master at character. Some criticize deficiencies in his attention to plot, but I find his novels hang together rather nicely. I finished The Barsetshire novels after reading this biography and enjoyed them immensely - even more than I would have because of having read Glendinning's book.

She takes 11-14 pills a day, is in Special Education classes, and sees a psychiatrist, she also has to attend anger managment classes, and has been to juevenile jail because of her 'troublesome' history!! She has NEVER been tested for food and preservative allergies or metals and vitamin deficiencies (all talked about in this book.) Such NON-evasive tests and discovery of 'hidden toxins' in our homes could have been the culprit. If we only read this book years ago we could have led her to lead an entirely different life. If we only knew then what we know now. I truely believe had her doctor checked her diet and other environmental factors that should would not be taking pills 'until she learns to act her age!'

Instead the author would have you believe that almost no child had ADHD and that soaking in an herbal bath is just the ticket. Perpetuates the myth that ADHD is just overdiagnosed and that children are being overly mediacted because of a conspiracy by drug companies, CHADD, and/or physicians. Expected a little more form a health care professional but should have questioned how relevent when saw it was written by an optometrist.

Written eighty years ago, it is still bang on the spot on the subject of the dilemma facing translators of poetry - in this case Russian into English - viz. how to capture the flavour of the original without departing too far from the (in this case Russian) text. In this regard Nekrasov is a particularly hard nut to crack.The poem I have been asked to deal with is not included in either of the two Hyperion volumes currently available but Abercrombie's wise counsel is worth the ticket price on its own for me. If you do buy it you will be meeting one of the most respected(now at any rate) voices from the latter part of 19th. century Russian literature - a man who gave Dostoevsky his first published opportunity.Nekrasov was not over popular in his day - his concern for working people was deeply unfashionable. That said the first two poems on this selection concern the plight of wives of the aristocracy whose husbands have been sent to the mines in Siberia after a failed coup.The women's heroic and ultimately successful attempts to reach the far Eastern camps are vividly portrayed, though in the 21st. century incessant rhyming couplets used by Juliet Soskice in her translations made in the first decade of the twentieth century may not be the ideal medium in English in the twenty first. Nevertheless,better to read those than not read the poetry at all. Nekrasove is too good to miss."},{"Title":"Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland's Industrial Schools","review":"This book presents a portrait of 20th century Ireland that will debunk any nostalgic or sentimental view of the so called 'Emerald Isle'. No shamrocks and leprecauns in this book, but a history of cruelty, abuse and power. It tells the story of how Irish children were incarcerated in huge numbers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in reformatory and industrial schools which were managed by the Catholic Church. Based on detailed historical research and interspersed with gut-wrenching first hand accounts of survivors of these institutions, it shows how an alliance between a power hungry Catholic Church and an indifferent Irish State resulted in the incarceration of the children of the poor. Rather than helping poor families, Church and State removed these children to bleak institutions where large numbers were sexually and physically abused and tortured by their Christian carers. I don't think that I will ever think about the Catholic Church and Ireland in the same way ever again. Anger, saddness, frustration, disbelief, but above all anger - why did this happen? I experienced all these emotions when reading this book. If you want to really understand Irish society, this book is essential and harrowing reading."},{"Title":"Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland's Industrial Schools","review":"This is a heart-wrenching book, a rollercoaster ride through the misery of what happened to thousands of Irish children during the 20th century. It is also so surprising and so unexpected that Ireland could have treated so many of its children with such terrible cruelty. If you were a child living in poverty, you had a good chance of being picked up by the courts, locked up in one of the country's many 'industrial schools', where children suffered terrible abuse at the hands of the Catholic priests, brothers, and nuns who rans these child prisons. This book is full of detailed historical research as to how and why this system was so large and so vicious. Weaving throughout it in the most compelling way are the individual memories of the victims or survivors of these child gulags. Some of them would break your heart, others just leave you lost in admiration for the courage and resilience of people who were subjected to such cruel abuse. By placing all of this in the context of Irish society and its development from colony to independence, this book raises profound issues about how societies deal with the evil within them, how they continue to deny their own complicity and lack of courage in defending their most vulnerable citizens. It also raises deeply disturbing questions about the nature of the Catholic Church in probably the most Catholic country on earth -- namely Ireland. How was it that so many of its chosen brothers and nuns could so openly abuse children, with no one seemingly having the courage to challenge them within the religious orders. All in all, a disturbing but vital book for people anywhere in the world to be able to understand how social institutions can fail the most fundamental of tests, can continue with universal complicity to victimise and abuse those with no one to defend them."},{"Title":"Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland's Industrial Schools","review":"This is a shocking and rivetting book. It deals with the enormous scale of child abuse in Irish institutions during much of the 20th century. This included severe sexual and physical abuse, together with emotional bullying and serious neglect. It was carried out mainly by members of Catholic religious orders. This book shows that the abuse was not secret -- Irish society knew about it, but denied that knowledge to itself and didn't act to protect the thousands of children literally locked up in this incredible system. But most importantly, this book is fascinating on the international connections of all this. It shows that some of the Irish-based Catholic orders exported this terrible system to abuse children all over the world. The Irish Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy set up institutions for children in Australia and in Canada, and 'Suffer the Little Children' provides us with a unique insight into the terrible cruelties visiting on these children as well. This is the most comprehensive telling of a child abuse system that I have ever read. It is essential for anyone who cares about how societies fail to protect those who most need that protection, and the awful consequences of that failure. While it primarily concerns Ireland, this book has a universal and widespread importance."},{"Title":"Suffer the Little Children: The Inside Story of Ireland's Industrial Schools","review":"This book presents a portrait of 20th century Ireland that will debunk any nostalgic or sentimental view of the so called 'Emerald Isle'.

I could not put it down. I was disgusted and angry by the end of it. I am ashamed to be Irish and ashamed to be Catholic. How this could have gone on for so long with no help for these children is beyond words. If there is a hell, then open arms to all those sick and sadistic Brothers and Nuns, all of whom were operating in the name of God....! How dare they call themselves charitable and merciful. They are some of the most vile human beings in existence. Between that and the sex scandal in America, the Catholic Church owes many people an apology and some sort of restitution. For shame the Church still chooses to cover up it's misuse of power. If the Nuns and Priests and Brothers were not so sexually frustrated, maybe they wouldn't be so evil. Sorry to vent so strongly.

It is well written and a most revealing expos&eacute; of a very dark, sick side of Irish history. It also includes personal testimonies which make the book even more gripping as they exemplify and confirm vividly the revelations of such an appaling system.It also discloses the indifference and conspiracy of silence on an official level which brings to mind Moli&egrave;re's words \\"It's not what we do, but also what we do not do, for which we are accountable\\". And for bad history not to repeat itself, we must keep informed.

However, as this book reveals, they got away with it because the State and the community turned a blind eye. This book mixes the personal testimony of many of their victims with documentation from the Dept. of Education uncovered by the authors. I agree with another reviewer that I will never again look at the Catholic Church the same way. Although I was never brainwashed into thinking that all those involved with the Catholic Church were infallible, as so many past generations seemed to be, I was raised to believe the core of the church and its mission was admirable. I no longer believe this to be true due to the wide spread cover-up of many, many abuses around the world. Hopefully there will be a lesson learned from what happend in Ireland so a tragedy such as this never happens again. This is a heart-wrenching story of organized child abuse that went on for decades.

Quoting from the ECONOMIST about German attitudes towards the untermenschen, Segal wrote: \\"The Nazis appear to regard the Polish race in rather the same way they regard the Jews. Unlike the blood of the Scandinavians or the Anglo-Saxons, the blood of the Poles is not only negatively inferior in that it is not German, it is positively pernicious. The Poles cannot by losing their separate racial consciousness become merged in the Germanic blood stream. They must be rejected by the healthy Teutonic body as the Jews are rejected.\\" (pp. 74-75).The Germans, besides isolating the Jews in ghettoes, wanted to isolate them further in a Lublin-area reservation (pp. 61-63), and the German press had hailed this as being \\"a solution of the Jewish problem in Europe.\\" (p. 64). Madagascar was also mentioned in this regard. In contrast, foreign nationals who were Jews were generally exempt from the Nazi anti-Jewish laws, and didn't have to wear the Star. (p. 69).What if the Holocaust had never happened? Mass emigration of Poland's Jews was proposed not only by the Zionist Jabotinsky (Jabotinski) and the Endek (Endeck) elements in the Polish Government-in-Exile, but also by Joseph Retinger, General Sikorski's secretary. (p. 275). In addition, \\"However, even some leaders of the Peasant and Socialist Parties believe that because of the faulty social and economic structure of Polish Jewry, a Jewish mass emigration will be necessary after the war.\\" (pp. 273-274).The destruction of the Polish intelligentsia needs no comment. The German occupation led to near-starvation of Poles. (p. 181-on, 185-on). The Germans closed or restricted many churches and murdered or incarcerated countless Polish priests. They also used priests as hostages whenever peasants were under-compliant in delivering their goods. (p. 83). The Germans forced priests to say things from the pulpit, including prayers for Hitler. (p. 78). (It is easy to see how it came to be that some priests preached obedience to the German authorities, later even with implicit or explicit denunciation of fugitive Jews, as misrepresented by Jan T. Gross and other Polonophobes.).Was there no Polish Quisling because the Germans never wanted one? Hardly. The Germans approached Professor Stanislas Estreicher, a lifelong Germanophile, as a prospective Quisling. In the absence of proffered Polish autonomy, he refused, and was dispatched to a concentration camp and murdered. (pp. 92-93).In his FEAR, Jan T. Gross has falsely portrayed lower-level administrators as collaborators. In actuality, the mayors and other Polish locals were unilaterally appointed by the Germans and, unlike their counterparts in western Europe, they had no powers of autonomy or self-government, and their sole role was to transmit or fulfill German orders. (pp. 23-24). The Polish Blue police (Policja Granatowa) under German rule dealt with criminal matters and traffic control. (p. 34). It was not a collaborationist police.In hisThe New Poland and The Jews, Segal had painted a bleak picture of Polish agriculture, and the alleged government's unwillingness to rectify it, in the context of Poland's Jewish problem. In this book, he sings a different tune. The prewar Polish government did consolidate many inefficiently-small holdings (pp. 141-142), and Poland had been a food-exporting nation all along. (p. 193). In the Reich-annexed provinces, for all the scorn of Polnische wirtschaft, German settlers' mechanized agriculture could only modestly improve upon the land's prewar Polish output. (p. 137).The Ukrainians received many privileges in German-ruled areas. (p. 93, 158-159, 172). Segal could not have known about the future role of Ukrainian collaborators in the Nazi extermination of the Jews, and the later OUN-UPA genocide of Poles, when he wrote: \\"The Nazis met with great success among Ukrainians in their anti-Jewish propaganda...Although there were sincere democrats among the Ukrainian nationalists, the Ukrainian nationalist movement on the whole has been, especially in recent years, dominated by the Nazis and their tools.\\" (p. 73).The 1939 war was only the beginning of Polish resistance, and Segal alludes to Hubal (p. 237) in his discussion of the endless Polish guerilla warfare. Polish pilots, \\"considered among the best in this war\\", were responsible for over 10% of the German planes shot down over the British Isles. (p. 269)."},{"Title":"Presenting Tanya, the Ugly Duckling (Picture Books)","review":"This a beautiful rendition of ballet and the folk story about the Ugly Duckling.

The drawings really capture Tanya's metamorphosis from the shy, insecure girl who is puzzled to have been chosen to dance the lead role in &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; to the joyous, confident dancer she becomes during the dress rehearsal. In the beginning of the book, Tanya is drawn in awkward, frightened poses, but she is able to open up and dance freely by the end of the book. I think the illustrator just does a very nice job of visually presenting the central character.How many times do we ask a child to read a book and to put himself or herself into the main character's shoes? This book allows the young reader to really step into Tanya's toe-shoes, the way I rememeber feeling like I was in Ellen Tebbitts's dance class when I was in the fifth grade. (Remember that book? It was great! It's a chapter-book and I'd recommend it for kids who read on a grade-level higher than those who would find &quot;Presenting Tanya. . .&quot; appropriate.)As for the written narrative, &quot;Presenting Tanya the Ugly Duckling&quot; is a nice change of pace for a fairy tale. Like me, you probably remember the standard tale as always being told from the point of view of the duckling. In this book, a little girl is the duckling, and it makes it even easier for a young reader to identify with the feelings of the protagonist. All readers will be intrigued by Gauch's use of the French terms for the ballet steps danced by Tanya and her fellow dancers, just as my generation was intrigued by the ballet positions described and illustrated in &quot;Ellen Tebbitts.&quot; Any young dancer would enjoy this modern rendition of &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paris (Marion Boyars Modern Classics) (French Edition)","review":"This is a lovely, dreamy book.

You will enjoy the characters and certainly the vivid descriptions of this beautiful area of California. However....This novel exemplifies the state of the art in publishing today and I do not mean that as a positive statement. Sadly, we are moving furher and further from the days when publishers recognized fine writing, sifting through silt to find gold. What publishers look for now is marketability. What an ugly, quasi-word. In order to have one's work published by a big house today, a writer needs the calling card of either a prestigious education, participation in one of several exclusive writers workshops, or a gimmick (such as, 'based on the true story of my life as an undercover agent for the CIA at the age of 13'). Note: When creativity fails, lying, dishonesty and fabrication are apparently helpful in creating a gimmick. And when those publishers of years gone by would find those gold nuggets, they were willing to invest time and money and energy into refining them, sitting an author down with an editor whose background was the English language, not marketing.Gone are the days that were so divine. The bottom line for On Kelsey Creek is this: Chances are, no big publishing house would ever have 'taken on this project,' as we hear in the publishing world today. And that's sad. Ms. Taper's descriptions are wonderful, but her characters are even more alive. She has a clear handle on the character-driven pace of this fiction; it flows just like the water of the creek--placidly carrying her characters along until life suddenly curves around a bend and they find they are headed for a patch of rough water that simply has to be navigated. Such is the stuff of life.If Taper had found an established publishing house for her novel, her work would have had the opportunity for some much-needed refinement; on nearly every page there are mechanical errors--mostly commas out of place (lots and lots of commas out of place), but sometimes typos, words missing, and incorrect grammar. For a reader like myself, these things mar the overall experience of the book, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I bought this book because I am a California native, and I love the geography of this state. But I liked the book because I appreciated how, like Dickens, Taper presented believable and often flawed characters whose lives were woven together into the tough fibers of life."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"Although the author traveled throughout the Middle East during the 1990s (as a roving foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal), this book is based on his travels through various Islamic countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Mali and Bosnia, in 2001-2004. With his knowledge of Arabic he was able to have direct talks with many Muslim leaders and civilians. He was always diligent in asking almost each individual as to why they disliked U.S. military personnel in liberating Iraq from Saddam, and why they wanted the U.S. military out of Iraq and quickly as possible. He notes how the average Saudi's income has \\"shrunk by as much as three-quarters in one generation.\\" Explained why Saudi's fear the U.S. presence there to control the Middle East and keep oil prices low (okay, sounds fairly reasonable, besides the pro-democracy pitch). One Saudi holy man didn't want to talk to the author because he didn't want to \\"be defiled by direct contact with me.\\" Trofimov noted how Saudi's don't like visitors, and journalists even less. Saudi's like to know which Islamic \\"sect\\" you belong to. He noted that Saudi officials don't like foreign businesses to have an \\"X\\" it their name, because it \\"looks too much like a Christian cross\\" (pg.8). Trofimov notes how Islamists dislike the Sufis. The author notes how Hindu workers who live in Saudi cannot be cremated there because the practice is barred by the Sharia; so the Hindu corpse has to be shipped out (pg.13). Non-Muslims cannot be buried in Saudi Arabia, because they would defile the land. So some are buried in the semi-secret non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah (p.14). While women can't drive cars, they can drive small dune buggies at parks. There are literally hundreds of these small, personal \\"snippets\\" that one doesn't read in U.S. newspapers; they alone are worth buying this book. The author notes how he traveled behind U.S. military forces that invaded Iraq; and the perils of driving unescorted by the military. The author discusses the road blocks, the aftermath of some of the suicide attacks, and being shot at. This is not a history book on Arabia; this is really more of a \\"travel adventure\\" book -- but of your worst nightmare: in the Iraqi combat zone. There are so many fine things to say about this book, written by an individual who \\"was there\\" during the liberation of Iraq, and one who witnessed the building frustration by some Iraqis to the American presence there. Nor to be overlooked are the findings by Trofimov about how Muslims in the other Arab countries that he visited view the American adventure into Iraq. Many, many personal anecdotes written by a reporter who got away from Baghdad's \\"Green Zone\\" to talk with the villagers."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"First of all let me say: I love first-person accounts of events and activities. There is nothing more fascinating, in my opinion, than reading about the experiences that someone has endured firsthand and who is providing an interpretation of those very experiences. Even more fascinating and, for that matter, relevant, is someone who is providing us with a diary or journal about contemporary events that we are watching or reading about on the daily news via television, radio, magazines, and the newspapers. Yaroslav Trofimov, in his book \\"Faith at War,\\" is doing just that.While I may contest the author's interpretations of the experiences he has had, I cannot in good faith dispute the \\"facts\\" of his experiences. He is, so to speak, \\"telling it as it is and as it was,\\" and I cannot argue with that, considering the fact he has \\"been there\\" and \\"done that.\\" I have not experienced what he has, nor have I gone where he has gone. I have to listen to what he has to say, as does every reader of his book. He has, however, provided me with an insight into much which I didn't understand and which, I hope, others who read his book, can begin to understand as well.Considering what is going on \\"really\\" in our world today, Trofimov, in his \\"Faith at War,\\" does provide a window that all of us need to consider and contemplate. There is no question about the relevance of his subject. Islam and what is going on in the Middle East is important to us all. Trofimov, who covers the Middle East and Islamic culture for the \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" gives us an insightful look into what is going on and what may be anticipated in that part of the world.I think what impressed me most about Trofimov's book is the lack of an obvious political agenda, a problem which afflicts most books about the Middle East \\"problem\\" today and which he seems to deliberately avoid. His appears to be merely a \\"sane\\" account of his own experiences as those experiences occurred. While no personal narrative is completely free of some editorial position, Trofimov certainly doesn't, in my view, flaunt any particular political prejudice.I was particularly interested in his discussion of Mali, a \\"democratic\\" country in Africa where most of the people are Muslim. This was news to me; but, then, I don't currently study African nations or society. While I was under the impression that almost every country which was Islamic was \\"undemocratic\\" by nature of the religion, it was refreshing to learn that that was not exactly true.The journey that Trofimov takes is actually awesome. The book begins in Saudi Arabia (and he provides some information that every American needs to know), proceeds on to Tunisia (\\"Teaching Freud to the Mullahs,\\" 'nuff said), then on to Yemen and Kuwait, then on to Iraq (very, very interesting to say the least), then on to Afghanistan for two chapters, ending with chapters on Lebanon, Mali (the \\"Muslim democracy\\"), and finally Bosnia (which is primarily Muslim in case you have forgotten or not watched the news for the past decade).This book is a personal journal or diary. There is no getting around that. But it is an interesting and intriguing account from a first-rate observer of the contemporary scene. There is, in my view, no getting around that. The author also provides an interesting and valuable glossary of religious and political terms related to the subject he is discussing, an index of topics, and a number of maps so the reader can place geographical areas and regions in context. Hurray for those tools, especially for the ordinary reader who is not a specialist.Altogether, I recommend this book just on the basis that I enjoyed reading it. Like I said, I enjoy reading first-person accounts. Maybe it's the psychology of the \\"vicarious\\" experience. Whatever, Trofimov's book is a good read and an exciting adventure and I think most readers who are interested in what's going on in our world today will like this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This beautifully reported and written book give readers a real on-the-ground feel for how people in the Muslim world view America and how 9/11 and our intervention in Iraq have intensified feelings about American power, consumerism, and intentions. Particularly compelling are this book's insights into how religion defines so many aspects of life and how others are viewed. Even as you are disgusted at some of the abuses perpetrated on the Muslim world by its own leaders, you will be ashamed at the insensitive behavior of American soldiers and strategic mistakes that undermine the benevolent image that many Americans want to believe characterizes our efforts to \\"bring democracy\\" to the Middle East. The author does not let either side off the hook. Reading FAITH AT WAR will help readers understand why the results of the Iraq invasion fell so far from what was hoped for. This is a much-needed critical view of the Middle East from the point of view of those who live there."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"I was anxious to write about this book, but the other reviewers have beat me to it.I found this book to be as arresting as a mystery that grabs you from the first sentence, and has you wanting more at the end. I even liked the forward & the acknowledgements. The book is also a fascinating travelogue; a \\"you are there\\" war story; an easy to read & understand coverage of Islam & current politics in the Middle East; and conversations with a wide range of people - poor, rich, religeous, political, and military. It is extremely well written, and shares a gamut of emotions - had me from tears to laughter.Read it!!!"},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This is a remarkable book. On one hand it is written as a travelogue that makes for pleasant reading and on the other hand it contains observations and interviews that provide a significant insight into what is happening in the Moslem world. Most of the time the author does not offer his own opinions explicitly, but lets readers draw their own conclusions. Even when he does they are mostly pointers to facts that the other side ignores. For example, when Muslims rail against the Crusaders the author reminds the reader: \\"Nobody in the (West) dwells on how Muslim armies, before and after the Crusades, burned and pillaged Christian towns all the way from Budapest to Bordeaux, or how lands from Tunisia to Turkey used to be Christian.\\"About one third of the book is devoted to Iraq (four chapters) and this part provide significant insight on what is happening and why. For example, he describes how Sunnis detonate a roadside bomb near a Shiite village and U.S. troops search for the culprits there. Some villagers are killed and now the villagers are hostile towards the U.S. His account of the events in Iraq left me with the impression that the U.S. campaign was poorly planned and several poor decisions were made afterwards. As a result, even Iraqis who were happy to see the Americans in the beginning became unfriendly, if not outright hostile, eventually.Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan have two chapters each, while Tunisia, Yemen, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mali, and Bosnia one chapter each.The book shows that bin-Ladden's version of Islam is not mainstream even though he would like the West to think otherwise. Western actions that ignore that distinction and are directed against all Moslems serve as a recruiting tool for al Qaeda.The author was a colleague and friend of Daniel Pearl and there are touching references to the latter's ordeal and tragic death."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This remarkable book is Trofimov's journalistic Haj to almost every Muslim country from Bosnia to Saudi Arabia where he manages to interview every prominent Islamist, evading bullets, as history unfolds around him. Secondly, and perhaps more disturbingly, this is Trofimov's quest to understand the Islamist psyche and his analysis of why Islamists hate the West. The most surprising part of this book was that the rational part of the collective Islamist psyche, the part that the West assumes is simply masked by \\"extremists\\", is to be found in Mali! I had to check my atlas. Certainly this book will change your perspective of the post 9/11 world with a harsh dose of reality served with ceremonial roast lamb, rice and the smile factor."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"Popular contemporary Islamic culture gets an airing in Yaroslav Trofimov's FAITH AT WAR, and the the non-islamic world is subject to a rude awakening 312 pages later. The author is very much a part of and participant in his inquiries into the attitudes that fuel resentment against the West and the US, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan or Bosnia.I was astonished to learn of the paranoia and proclivity to believe the wildest conspiracy theories throughout Islamic societies. Indeed, and as a validation of Trofimov, a personal friend of mine recently visited Iran with his Iranian wife. On a mountain climb above Tehran with his Iranian-American daughters, he encountered two AK-47 wielding guardians of the Islamic revolution who were keen to ply my friend with all manner of anti-semitic conspiracy theories, including the long-discredited Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the \\"Israeli plot\\" to blow up the World Trade Center. Similar notions abound in Trofimov's accounts of his travels to \\"the frontlines of Islam\\" in the wake of the September 11 Al Qaeda attacks in the US.FAITH AT WAR is a model of engaging journalism, with its riveting insights and Trofimov's determination - even at great risk to the writer's life - to get Islamic spokesmen to speak with him, revealing their livid concerns and lurid fixations. The paperback edition comes with an updated afterword and there is a helpful glossary of terms as well. The book is a fine primer/introduction to the contradictions inherent in the contemporary global Islamic resurgence largely fueled by the fanatical, retrogressive Saudi Arabian brand of Wahabist Islam. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This is a good book filled with personal experiences of a talented journalist who has travelled extensively in the arab world. It contains haunting images of people and suffering and explores the ironies and contradictions of the Arab world. One is presented with an image of a hypocritical Saudi Arabia, which uses Islam to keep its people down, and comparisons with a more secular Mali, which has found a way to reconcile modernity and religious values.The book is unflinching in its critique of the American invasion of Iraq and the unintended consequence of the occupation. It is harrowing in its depiction of the vehemence of anti-Americanism from the wealthy suburbs of Cairo to the slums of Yemen. It create different looks at the seeming monolithic Hezbollah, unified by both public service and violent opposition to Israel.The one drawback is that the book is totally framed by the perspective of the author. To say it is an uncomprimising look at the contradictions of Modern Islam and the failure of US foreign policy is to overlook the subjectivity of the writing. Choosing to focus on mismanagement or soldiers gloating over Arab deaths, the author ignores the nobility of others who struggle to make a positive impact. Some things in the book are taken at face value, when more thorough inspection should be required. For instance, at some point the book claims American forces shot and killed an Iraqi man for discharging his gun, thinking his house was being burglarized. How did the author arrive at this conclusion ? Ask the dead man ? The conclusion to be drawn is that Trofimov took representations of others at face value, but when Trofimov experience pro-US sentiment, he assumes it to be the result of toadying rather than genuine sentiment.In the end, you have a well written book, containing fascinating yet selective experiences of the author. I recommend it as a fascinating journalistic travel journal, but like any journal one shaded by the authors subjective opinions."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This is great first-person journalism, an excellent accounting of what life is like in Muslim lands. Trofimov's insight into the world of the Middle East shows us that the extremists in the Muslim world are not necessarily the poor and downtrodden, or those from traditional backgrounds. Rather, it is those who, as his opening chapter point out, eat at McDonalds and test drive new Mercedes who are ironically enough the greatest haters of the West.But Trofimov also shows us another more tolerant side of Islam when he takes us to Mali to witness an election in that country, which has been Muslim for centuries. Mali shows that Islam need not necessarily be oppressive to its adherents.The chapters on Saudi Arabia are an excellent introduction to the country for anyone who is not familiar with it.The book also has some great pieces of adventuring that Trofimov gets into."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"I have always fantasized about being a world traveling journalist living a life of adventure and bringing my unique point of view to my readers. Alas, that is not to be. However, I certainly have a deep appreciation for up-close and personal viewpoints of world events. That's why I absolutely loved this book and devoured the entire thing in one big orgy of uninterrupted reading.Subtitled \\"A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Bagdad to Timbuktu\\", Yaroslav Trofimov, an Italian citizen, is a Wall Street Journal reporter whose knowledge of languages, including Arabic, gave him access to people and places often denied to Westerners. He wrote this book between 2001 and 2005 and his writing style is simple, personal and full of facts, history and perspective. As I turned the pages, I was right there with him as he traveled around the Islamic world talking to clerics, ordinary Muslims and heads of state about their views on the current \\"War On Terror\\" that has brought attention to their perspective and, especially in the case of Iraq, has turned their lives upside down. He visited Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Mali and Bosnia. That's quite a lot of places for one small book. They are all different, of course, but all share the Islamic world view, which, to my western eyes is a fresh perspective which gave me the chills as I slowly grasped the mounting significance of the present-day conflicts in all of these regions.The clashes have been going on for thousands of years, but modern technology has accelerated the process and there is a culture class on a grand scale happening all over the world. The author devotes four full chapters to Iraq, and, to his credit, acknowledges the difficult job of American and British military personnel whose presence in the region has created a whole new set of problems for the Iraqi people who once viewed them as liberators. Those days are gone forever though. I knew all this before I read the book, of course, but it's one thing to read newspaper accounts and watch a small sound byte on CNN or Fox News. It's another thing entirely to feel I was in the shoes of this reporter, eating the food, dodging the gunfire and talking to individuals. My own sensitivities have also been stirred deeply and I know I will never quite view the Muslim world the same again.The book is short, a mere 303 pages, but the author's skill managed to enlighten me about so much. Bosnia is very different from Timbuktu or Yemen, and sometimes it seemed as if these peoples have little in common. But the Islamic point of view is always there and very different from the Western world view. I applaud the author for clarifying this for me. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"This is one of my favorite books--fascinating and informative.

These include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan and even Bosnia and Timbuktu in Mali. Through a wide range of interviews, Trofimov seeks insight into attitudes in those countries toward the West and America in particular. It is not a pretty picture.Much of today's Islamic fundamentalism stems from Wahhabism, a movement that not only arose in Saudi Arabia but helped bring the Saud family to power. Therefore, Trofimov's book begins there, exploring the history of that movement, the Sunni-Shiite divide and the political issues boiling under the surface in that country and how it could become the source for much anti-American feeling.As Trofimov travels to Yemen, Kuwait and other countries, we begin to see just how widespread anti-Americanism is and how equally widespread is support for violent jihad. As he notes after a Kuwaiti killed fighting for the jihadists in Afghanistan was described as being a humanitarian aide worker, \\"In an ideology that sees America as the enemy of mankind, killing Americans can be easily described as humanitarian work.\\"The depth of and pride in the violence of some of the Islamic movements is shown in almost exaggerated style in Trofimov's visit to Lebanon. Leaving Beirut and heading toward a former Israeli security zone, the view borders on unbelievable.Now, a huge advertising billboard towered on every spot where Hezbollah had carried out a successful attack against Israeli troops. .... Each one, in gaudy Islamic-kitsch style, was written in Arabic and in English, and carried the \\"martyr\\" bombers names and mug shots. It also displayed the details of the attack, as well as clippings from Israeli newspapers showing the incident's victims and their weeping families at funeral wakes. In the two decades of Israeli presence, there had been plenty of attacks in this area, so a new billboard appeared after every twist of the road.As we're now seeing in Iraq, suicide missions were not just a Hezbollah strategy to fight Israeli occupation of part of Lebanon. In fact, Faith at War gives an indication why we are seeing such missions in Iraq. Trofimov followed U.S. and British troops into Iraq during the 2003 invasion and spent time there later that year and the next. He interviews clerics and ordinary citizens in what were or would become insurgent hot spots. The interviews show that, even among mainstream Iraqis, what is now called the insurgency did not come as a surprise. One Iraqi analogizes it to a Texan fighting back if a foreign country occupied that state, even if for good reason.When read with Trofimov's accounts of time he spent with U.S. troops in Afghanistan, this political travelogue reveals a lack of cultural awareness may also be causing great damage. Some of our actions not only pour salt into open wounds, they generate even more opposition to U.S. presence and, hence, even more anti-Americanism.Trofimov's background gives him a unique perspective. He was born in the Ukraine, spent part of his childhood in Madagascar and lived much of his adult life in New York City, before being based in France, Israel and Italy while working for the Wall Street Journal. He currently resides in Italy and, thus, while employed by an epitome of capitalist America, did not have a US passport and had the ability, if asked, to simply say he was a newspaper reporter from Italy.Whether that also meant interviewees were more open with him, he just hit a streak of rabid Islamists or his interviewees are a fair representation of sentiment in the Muslim world is unclear. Yet the ultimate learning of this book is that, whether self-inflicted or not, Muslim views of America are bad and getting worse. And what makes Trofimov's work depressing - if not frightening - is that it gives no reason to hope that relations with the Islamic world will improve enough to ease or quell the insurgency in Iraq or that we are likely to see meaningful detente with Islamic fundamentalists in our lifetime."},{"Title":"Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu","review":"If one only reads the editorial page of the WSJ, one would never expect it to be or call this one of the world's great newspapers. Trofimov is one of the Journal's star reporters and has written an outstanding travelogue of one of the truly exotic regions of the world, countries no longer open to or safe for Americans. He expertly demonstrates why George W. Bush has made a major portion of the worlds people, not only Muslims, hate the American Government and the American military. Once the United States was viewed by a major percentage of the people as \\"the last best hope of mankind.\\" George Bush and the Bushies have seen to it that we have become one of the most hated and feared nations in the world. In his conversations with both ordinary people as well as governmental higherups, with men and women devestated and infuriated by Bush's war, he allows us access to what is really going on and being indoctrinated in the minds and hearts of the people in the countries he describes in his book. Trofimov's chapters on Saudi Arabia and the Iraq war as well as his visits to Afganistan, Yemen and other Muslim countries since 9/11 and the start of the ill fated \\"War on Terrorism\\" - which should have been named the \\"Bush's amazingly successful effort to create new terrorists\\" - is alarming and informative to any nonright wing ideologue who reads this book. I am amazed that so few people have read and commented on the book so far. It is an absolute must read for anyone concerned with the future of our nation and of mankind in general.

Following the pain and successes of these unusual young people over the course of 20 years gives the reader tremendous vistas from which to gain perspective of the way society treats the highly gifted...and what that does to them.If you already think your child is gifted, but she or he isn't \\"fitting in\\" you just might have an exceptionally gifted child. Since the intellectual level of these children is high, even compared to other gifted kids, parents don't generally have any true means of comparison. They often have never met any other kids like theirs.Instead of guessing, read this book. You will know--quickly--if you see your kid there. This is NOT a book about \\"perfect,\\" high-flying, academic achievers. To the contrary: it is a painful examination of how enforced academic underachievement has hurt these kids, and how appropriate intellectual challenge (when they could get it) helped them feel comfortable in their skins.Read this book if you think your child is gifted. Read this book if you \\"just knew\\" there was something special about your child when they were little, but they've never fit in school. Read this book if you work with or care for the gifted."},{"Title":"Exceptionally Gifted Children","review":"I read the reviews about this book and bought a used copy (old edition) expecting a book that would change my life. Now my only regret is that I didn't spring for the current edition right up front.First, this book isn't about gifted children - it is about exceptionally and profoundly gifted children. There is a difference. If your child falls into this special group, this is one of the few books you will find that discusses your child - with all the good and the challenges that accompany these extreme gifts.The book has very BORING sections if you are reading for the sake of reading. Be prepared. I didn't skip anything and I don't regret it - but some sections were hard to wade through. In the end, however, some of the charts and tables gave me the insight that I was hoping to get. Also, each chapter has a high level summary - so if you do have trouble wading through a particular chapter, skip to the end of the chapter and figure out what you are supposed to be learning. Decide whether it is worth going back to deal with the details.I started reading the book with the goal of convincing myself that my son didn't belong in this group. The first few chapters with their amazing stories of each child's most wonderful accomplishment left me thinking that I was right. However, as I read further along and got into the meat of the book, I recognized my son in its pages.Ms. Gross holds out hope in her numbers for allowing a very special child to grow up happy and well adjusted. It isn't politically correct to allow a child like this to go at their own pace, but it is healthy - and her data shows it. Quantitative evidence (albeit on a limited sample) to show that these children are not normal and we should celebrate that rather than trying to force the issue.I'm much more prepared for the future with my child than I was before reading this book.

The unique way they organize collectible magazine people into Sleepers like OZ artist W.W. Denslow or Stars like F.Scott Fitzgerald makes me want to haunt local yard sales. My major problem with the book was that I became so fascinated that I wanted more. The book could easily have been double in size and information and kept my interest as both a reader and for use as a desk reference. With what I've learned, our next home will hopefully be an 1890's Victorian with a basement full of Godey's Lady's Book magazines."},{"Title":"Antique Trader Vintage Magazines Price Guide","review":"I've been interested in old magazines for a few years now, and have been looking for a helpful price guide. I just bought this, and I highly recommend it. There's a lot of information, not just about the magazines most of us are familiar with, but also about many lesser knonwn older magazines that have great value due to authors who published their early work in them--e.g. Edgar Allen Poe. It's not just helpful information as a price guide, it's very interesting reading! Lots of great color photos also. I looked through another magazine price guide in a bookstore, and this one is much, much better."},{"Title":"Antique Trader Vintage Magazines Price Guide","review":"I picked up this book to learn more about vintage ads and magazines I was interested in.

There are also quite a few nouveau nature screens (dolphins, parrots, seascapes, tropical fish, etc), which is not surprising considering that this is the &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot; edition. I was really impressed with the &quot;Grand Entryways&quot; and &quot;Abstractions&quot; sections; some of the designs are truly amazing.The book has 78 pages, and every other page is jammed packed with photographs of actual stained glass windows, doorways, and transoms. The photos are all extremely well done and inspiring. The other pages are filled with scaled patterns. I especially liked the fact that all of the patterns are shaded to indicate colors and textures. Two negatives about the book are: 1) not all of the scaled patterns have a corresponding photo of the completed panel, and not all of the photos have corresponding scaled patterns (this gets very confusing a times) and 2) the binding is of a poor quality (the pages started to fall out almost immediately)."},{"Title":"Naval Camouflage 1914-1945: a Complete Visual Reference","review":"Exhausting, Exhaustive, Maddening, Intriguing\\"Naval Camouflage 1914-1945, a Complete Visual Reference\\", by David Williams, NIP 2001I cannot decide whether to recommend this book or not. It has lots of pictures of ships (good), but a lot of them are poor. For example, one of them is captioned \\"Although not that evident in this photograph, the ... carries ... Measure 32...\\" Well if the picture is so poor that you cannot see what it illustrates, why not drop it in favor of a better picture?There are only 15 color photographs. Even here, there is waste. Six of them are modern photographs of two memorial ships painted to match WW2 colors. That is probably a good way to see the colors. Not bad, except that there are two photos of HMS Belfast showing the same scheme (alternate sides to be sure, but when there are so few color slots we'd be better off with a different picture) and there are 4 modern color photos of the ORP Blyskawica; two are of the same side on the same day. Inconceivable.Then there are other irritations. Captions which say (I paraphrase) \\"here is measure xx, a true dazzle...\\" but nowhere in the book does it say what the difference is between \\"true\\" dazzle and other dazzle. The author also distinguishes between disruptive and dazzle, again without explaining the difference.OK, so I cannot recommend it as a reference book. So, close it up. Put it on the shelf. Wait a couple of days. Get it out and open it up. Only this time, instead of expecting a reference book, expect an art book. If you simply look at the photos (even though poor), the craft of the original artists comes through. On this level, this book is very enjoyable. Just look at the pictures."},{"Title":"Naval Camouflage 1914-1945: a Complete Visual Reference","review":"The author presents a well researched account of (mainly) allied naval camouflage through both world wars. I commend his effort, however I feel he was let down by the publisher in the production department. While the text is informative & near comprehensive, the photos are of very poor quality. They were obviously not retouched with Photoshop which I would consider mandatory in this day & age. If the author is reading, I'd suggest Schiffer or another publisher that knows how to do historical photo books. The price of this Naval Institute Press book is obscene considering the poorly put forth photos, which are far too small & far too dark (and fuzzy). For the modeler, I'd suggest the handbook by Patrick Hreachmack, supplemented by the appropriate Squadron/Signal books, etc."},{"Title":"Naval Camouflage 1914-1945: a Complete Visual Reference","review":"Being a miniature wargammer, I have a great need for a reliable referance book that shows naval camouflage schemes. This book has numerious black and white pictures and several color photos that are a great help for painting. The book is somewhat lacking on describing the base of some schemes, but if you have basic knowledge in colors each navy uses, it is not very hard to asign colors to the paterns. This book is espically useful in showing several uncomon to rare Axis camo paterns.

Both volumes of Jedin's Trent are some of the best of historical reflection. Catholics are often busy these days trying to re-write history. Funnily enough they sometimes cite this great work, because of its monumental reputation. But often, especially online, they do it by twisting the very complex meanings the author absolutely emphasized in the book. If you try to cover- over Jedin's insight that the Papacy's initial impetus and problem-solving strategy was all to avoid actual reform, well, you have missed a key part of this author's honesty. What I like especially about Jedin is that he displays a characteristic of all interesting scholarship, as opposed to tendentious apologetics and propaganda. Namely, that it lays out the facts, and of course does so in congruence with his own point of view. There is no doubt that Jedin was everywhere interested in bolstering the Catholic Church. But it is proof of the depth of his engagement, that his construal of the facts leaves a open the possibility of other interpretations. That is always part of the discourse of historical reflection. If it is not there, that is how you know you are dealing with mere propaganda, and hackwork. Simple as that."},{"Title":"Mine Work","review":"Written with a compassion for working men in much the same vein as John Steinbeck, &quot;Mine Work&quot; treats the ruins of memory and the need for family reconciliation in the backdrop of desolate mining country in the Southwest. The author, Jim Davidson, deftly inerweaves the present (in which a tormented son despeately attempts to piece together three generations of family tragedy) and the past (in which a compelling narrative of injustice, racism, and personal pain) seamlessly.One of the significant themes of this beautifully-paced first novel is the disgraceful treatment of Native Americans by rapacious industry and racist individuals. Markus Cottin's quest for knowledge and inner-peace cannot exist without a coming to grips with this aspect of history. The author has not written a polemic, however; Mr. Davidson's language is elegant, spare and precise."},{"Title":"Mine Work","review":"MINE WORK is not your standard western fare. It combines mystery with an episodic quest for a middle-age man's family history and identity. The story focuses on the plight of Markus Cottin and his search for a reason why he's estranged from his father and why a troubled younger brother committed suicide. Along the way, the author weaves in many little known historical and social elements of the 1940's and 1950's American West, including the struggles of the socially disenfranchised Navajo Nation, a dimension which lends this story a Hillerman-esque feel. The novel was a little difficult to digest in the early sections, however after a few chapters this reader was absolutely enthralled with the story. The writing is vivid and accomplished - the story itself, heart-wrenching.Small company politics and manipulations mangled many laborers' lives during this bleak era, including the parents of Markus Cottin, about whom he knows almost nothing. Physically and emotionally alienated from a father who lives as a hermit and spits venom on the rare occasions they meet, Cottin pursues all leads in the hope that someone can give him some idea of who his father is, and why he's so consumed with bitterness and hatred. Revelation comes at last when Cottin is made to understand the horribly tragic experience of the oppressed working-class Colorado miners, second only in emotional devastation faced by the economically hapless Navajos. The author succeeds wonderfully in bringing these peoples' heroic struggles to life, allowing the reader to look back at a excruciatingly tragic episode in 20th Century American history.MINE WORK is a powerful &quot;western&quot;. I'd recommend to my friends of the most sophisticated tastes. This novel is as go"},{"Title":"Mine Work","review":"This is the story of a young man's journey to discover the mystery behind his family's troubled history. It is rich in its description of life in the Colorado mining towns, including the mistreatment of the miners, and the degradation of the Navajos. The characters are well-developed and the reader is left feeling like she knows each one personally. However, I did feel that some of the descriptions were overly dramatic, and some of the prose seemed redundant. I enjoyed the book, as it enriched my knowledge of the Colorado mining towns and the shameful politics that surrounded that life; however, the book was full of misery from start to finish."},{"Title":"Mine Work","review":"Excellent book that takes you to the mountains in a firm grip.

The poetry of Rumi has touched North Americans because its language and references feel modern, relevant, humorous and inspiring. The spirituality contained in both images and words in this book celebrates life, while it also reminds us that we can become more than a \\"common denominator.\\" We can be both ordinary and extraordinary. The images alone will give extended experiences of insight, wisdom, guidance, serenity, and hope. This is a book to return to over and over again."},{"Title":"One Song: A New Illuminated Rumi","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated sequel to the Illuminated Rumi by Coleman Barks and Michael Green. Included is a CD by the Illumination Band which interprets the poems musically in American roots style(bluegrass, blues)which sounds strange but works. Not the greatest recording, but the point gets across. There's a longing in those American art forms which somehow is a good fit for the poetry. There has been criticism about these non-literal translations of Rumi's words but I think the point of the poems comes across nicely. There are certainly plenty of copies of Nicholson or Arberry out there if someone needs a more literal version, and they can decide for themselves. One Song is definitely recommended."},{"Title":"One Song: A New Illuminated Rumi","review":"Spectacular! I am a Rumi scholar and I learned a great deal more from this fabulous presentation of the thoughts and works of Rumi as brought over from Persian by Coleman Barks.

I highly recommend this book for the military student, political scientist and the armchair strategist alike.Insurgency &amp; Terrorism was one of my textbooks when I attended the U.S. Army's Command &amp; General Staff College. The author systemically dissects insurgency and terrorism so that one may understand the causes, effects and very nature of revolutionary warfare. He examines the nature of revolutionary war (causes and effects)and the strategist's ways, means and ends. He clearly lays out a framework for one to understand the nature of a particular conflict. O'Neill then goes on to examine various strategies used by terrorists and insurgents. He discusses such critical factors as popular &amp; external support, governmental response, and the political conditions that created the atmosphere for insurgency. He uses historical examples to illustrate specific points. O'Neill discusses the Spanish guerrilla movement to combat Napoleon's invasion, the American revolutionary effort, Soviet partisans attacking the Nazi invaders, the numerous Central American insurgencies and Cuba, and Bernard Fall's commentaries on the Vietnamese insurgency of the 50s and 60s. O'Neill also delves into the theoretical, Lenin's theories of revolution and Mao's guerrilla war strategies are particulary valuable in illustrating his points.The value of this book is in providing the student of revolutionary warfare a framework with which to evaluate and analyze insurgencies and terrorist activities. An excellent tool and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"In \\"Insurgency and Terrorism\\", Bard O'Neill has provided his audience (whether a fighting man or a student) with a framework through which to analyse insurgencies, past, present and future. O'Neill states that he believes that insurgencies are likely to remain a key level of conflict in the future. I agree with him. This is an important area and one which receives all too little attention, especially, in my experience, among the armed forces of the United States. Hopefully Dr O'Neill will redress the balance a little.The book is split into 9 sections;- Insurgency in the Contemporary World- The Nature of Insurgency- Insurgent Strategies- The Environment- Popular Support- Organisation and Unity- External Support- Government Response- ConclusionsIn each case, O'Neill splits the areas up into smaller sub-sections for easy reference. He deals with different types of insurgent groups, different ways insurgents operate, the effects of terrain and outside support, the coverage is fairly comprehensive. He also, usefully, uses historical examples to illustrate his points.As O'Neill himself points out, no framework for analysis can be infallible or perfect, but this is a pretty good start, whether you are in a counter-insurgency situation or in a seminar room. Good stuff. It should, of course, be supplemented with further reading (a bibliography would have been useful) but all in all this is an excellent piece of work in a field that has been somewhat neglected in recent times (it isn't fashionable in America at the best of times and many of the classic texts are now out of print).A good piece of follow-up reading to this book (especially for a student) would be Ian Beckett's \\"Modern Insurgencies and Counter-Insurgencies\\"."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"This is an excellent framework for analysis, but you will need specialist information which is both current and validated before you can do much more than generalize in any given situation. Still, even this can be quite useful.I came across this book while reading \\"Peace Operations in an Insurgency Environment\\", a paper written by Major Grootendorst for the CSC in 1997. In this paper he effectively uses the marketing management model of Kotler to combine the Mackinlay and Chapra theory of peace operations with O'Neill's insurgency model. Very nicely done. (I like Kotler - he seems to view business as war by other means!)O'Neill's treatment is necessarily very narrow. Except in passing, his scope does not include pre-insurgency nor post-insurgency. I don't find this a deficiency with his work, but I do find it a deficiency with our thinking about insurgency. A common agreement among participants at the recent Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration course sponsored by the Norwegian Defense Force in Oslo is that we need to move beyond the central focus on insurgency. Necessary as it is to \\"calm the waters\\", current process does not seem to solve the underlying structural problems which then rise to a boil every decade or so -- and in addition the initial societal disturbance creates generational shockwaves that take decades of sincere and costly efforts to reduce to a manageable level. While O'Neill's is the close examination of a particular facet of a problem, we cannot afford to be so parochial.I strongly recommend this book. Much of what we have seen come to pass in Iraq was largely predictable, at least in broad brush strokes, based on competent consideration of his model. (I actually read the book in early 2002 and have reviewed it again just this month.) Just keep in mind the broader picture -- think outside the box. We seem to be doing the same things over and over again, only harder and faster; and then seem surprised when we get the same results -- only quicker. A clear prerequisite is being able to empathize (as opposed to sympathize) with the opponent, no matter how we feel about his actions."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"Since the conclusion of the cold war, insurgency and terrorism have become the primary means for the disenfranchised to demonstrate their global discontent. During the same time, however, the defense and intelligence communities have staunchly resisted adapting to new threats and recognizing the new players on the international stage.Simply stated ...\\"Insurgency may be defined as a struggle between a nonruling group and the ruling authorities in which the nonruling group consciously uses political resources (e.g., organizational expertise, propaganda, and demonstrations) and violence to destroy, reformulate, or sustain the basis of legitimacy of one or more aspects of politics.\\" P. 13. \\"Terrorism is a form of warfare in which violence is directed primarily against noncombants (usually unarmed civilians), rather than operational military and police forces or economic assets (public or private).\\" P. 24.Dr. O'Neill's Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare is one of the best volumes I've found that focuses on cause and effect, along with viable solutions as a whole.Academicians and practitioners alike had long given insurgency and terrorism little attention, instead stressing studies on the military/defense industry's technical structure - particularly ignoring the waning of human assets.So the lack of a comprehensive and up-to-date counterinsurgency program is hardly surprising. \\"A key point to be addressed when evaluating a counterinsurgency program is how well the government knows its enemy.\\" P. 126.This book presents the most important, current challenges facing counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism policy, addressing key issues and analyzing solutions within the perspective of collective expectations and role definitions for both civil and military players. \\"Experience and the experts suggest that the most effective way to deal with internal terrorism and small-scale urban guerrilla attacks against soldiers and policemen is to emphasize police work, good intelligence, and judicial sanctions ...Police and intelligence agencies are also the main instruments for combating transnational terrorism. In today's world the problem of transnational terrorism places a premium on international police cooperation and intelligence sharing ...Numerous cases suggest that the centerpiece of successful counter-guerrilla campaigns are small-unit operations - that is, sustained and aggressive patrols and ambushes in guerrilla-infested zones.\\" Pp. 128 - 130."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"Bard E. O'Neill has made a name for himself within the military community as one of the premiere experts on insurgency and revolutionary warfare. After reading this volume, I no longer considered this to be in anyway surprising. Written in the late 1980s/early 1990s, it is a short book that nevertheless touches upon all aspects and types of insurgencies in a rigorous and analytic manner. Readers should be aware, however, that it is incredibly dry, but to the point - something that a \\"just the facts\\" type reader such as myself can appreciate. Unfortunately, I have not been able to read any of Mr. O'Neill's more modern works, but will nonetheless suggest that readers might want to take a look at them as well."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"If you wish to know/understand how insurgent/guerrilla and terrorists groups function, this is the book to read.Moreover it helps the reader put in perspective insurgent/terrorist groups when reading about current events."},{"Title":"Insurgency & Terrorism: Inside Modern Revolutionary Warfare","review":"Although it was originally published in 1990, this book was the most relevant I read during my tour of Iraq.

The one drawback to this book is that you will need to have a specialized understanding of the art and science of war. If you are a novice, buy the book and continue to do your research and professional reading. This book will become invaluable to you later and you will be grateful that you have it. Side bar... of course you might not agree with everything that this author says; thats ok, look past that and focus on the content of what he is trying to convey.Of particular note, What I like about this book is that it is organized and fits nicely with the notion that there are \\"many\\" centers of gravity. for those that believe, like myself, that clausewitz had more than just a narrow defintion of how the principles of war were tied to more than just the political, then this book will become an excellent source reference for your continuing professional development as you explore the nuances and variables of the many types of strategies.

He spoke 12 dialects fluently!) (As well as a number of European languages. His books (I have 2 of them) one bound in China in the 30's have the seals of approval as great works by Aisin-Gioro Puyi (The \\"Last Emperor)When I have it up-loadable I will add a photo of uncle Harry to his pages here.What my uncle said he had to do was immerse himself in the culture to such an extent in every way, which he did, that he could come to think and react as though he was Chinese, and to learn so much there as to be able to decide how to interpret the ideographs (Chinese characters) which so early could have as many as 10,000 possible meanings.The feeling of these poems are very true to the feelings expressed in their original version, from all I can tell, and some are quite poignant, though many speak primarily of separation of friends, spouses and natural matters of time and seasons. There are exceptions which are very memorable and touching.I am a published song-writer, poet and writer (numerous venues)best known as the collaborative great friend of legendary blues giant Howlin' Wolf, and my own writing skills can be verified at my howlingwolfphotos website, so I say all this not simply because am related. However there is also the fact that Chinese and Asian culture plays a relatively (pun intended) significant part in my family, at least since the turn of the century (1900 that is)I studied the language (Cantonese) for a year at S.F. State University, where in fact at that time he was teaching a course in anthropology (which I am still kicking myself in the ass for never signing up for his class while he was alive and teaching there) and I know of the difficulties of contextual reference of meaning that up to 13 tones of otherwise same-sound, not emotional tones, but vocabulary-related meanings can have plus various slang possibilities. At least the grammar is better than English, reminds me of German grammar, but still didn't come naturally to say the least.I also studied a LOT about many matters of China, Chinese culture, history here as well as there, just about any aspect of any of that you could imagine. I was very active in the Chinese community (as social services developer and in other ways also, on campus, studied a few forms of (Cantonese pronunciation) gung fu, chi gung, calligraphy, brush writing (with squid ink), history, philosophy, medicine, innovative mental health methodology, politics, music, all this and more to some extent ancient to modern through but not so much beyond when Mao was still alive) and was planning to move there and teach English, so took all the M.A.TEFL requirements but was working a hard job and had other grad courses so that didn't get to post-graduate degree stage. I was also then dating a excellent and somewhat well-known (probably more so now) Chinese singer and expert in many matters of Chinese arts and between her as it were and formal lessons elsewhere and a subsequent gf from Taiwan 15 years later learned how to cook about 60 Chinese dishes about half of them home style.My maternal grandfather (making him the brother-in-law of Harry was the only \\"white\\" man who could lead tours through the old Barbary Coast Chinatown secret areas such as connected sub-basements and was most impressed himself by the Tong axe men who could hit a target bulls-eye at 100 feet.

It is, in my view, one of the earliest examples of effective English translations from the Chinese. The style of translation is beautifully flowing and natural, avoiding the pedantry one often finds in translations from the Chinese. Lineation does not follow the original texts. Rather, short lines are preferred, some with just one or two words, giving a more \\"vertical\\" effect that one might say follows the manner of calligraphy of early Chinese texts.What I find especially attractive about these translations is the apparent ease and unforced style, unlike the rhyming verse translations of Chinese poetry one tended to find during this period and earlier. One still comes across such versified translations, usually by Chinese translators attempting to produce a Tennyson-like effect (always with appalling results).Hart precedes the better-known translators of Chinese poetry of recent decades, notably Burton Watson and David Hinton. His translations stand up to the best of their work. I highly recommend this book.

To describe the game or give away much more would be terrible, but trust me to say that the suspense is intense.This book feels like a 1930s Hollywood movie and probably would make a great modern film if only the industry knew about it."},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A. MERRITT: The Moon Pool; The Ship of Ishtar; Seven Footprints to Satan; The Face in the Abyss; Dwellers in the Mirage; The Metal Monster; The Fox Woman and Other Stories; The Black Wheel (The People of the Pit; Through the Dragon Glass)","review":"Readers of Abraham Merritt's first four novels--&quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot; &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; and &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot;--may feel a little surprised as they get into his fifth, &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan.&quot; Whereas those earlier fantasy masterpieces featured exotic locales such as the Pacific islands, the Himalayas and Peru; extravagant purple prose, dense with hyperadjectival descriptions; and living light creatures, metallic sentient cubes, a lost semireptilian race and battling gods, &quot;Footprints&quot; takes place, for the most part, in good ol' New York City and its suburbs, and tells an almost realistic tale of kidnapping and crime in direct, almost blunt prose. Indeed, although &quot;Footprints&quot; first appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine in 1927, and in book form the following year, it almost reads as if it had come from the pages of one of the crime pulps, such as &quot;Black Mask&quot; or &quot;Crack Detective Stories.&quot; In this fast-moving tale, we meet James Kirkham, an adventurer/explorer (and, with a name like that, future candidate for Star Fleet Academy!) who is kidnapped off the streets of downtown Manhattan by the minions of Satan, a crime lord/supervillain/evil genius. Kirkham is forced to play a game in Satan's lair, during which he is made to tread on seven glowing footprints, four of which are &quot;fortunate&quot; and three &quot;unfortunate.&quot; Depending on the steps he lands on, he will either be killed, serve Satan for a year, be given a fantastic fortune, etc. I am not giving away too much by saying that Kirkham winds up a bond servant to Satan, and is compelled to commit various fantastic crimes while in his service. He is housed in Satan's mazelike chateau with dozens of others, and falls in love with a fellow prisoner, Eve. (I suppose having Kirkham's first name be &quot;Adam&quot; would have been forcing things a bit!)Grotesque in appearance, vast of intellect, profound lover of beauty, and sadistic in the extreme, Satan makes for one terrific character. With his strain of Chinese background, he is reminiscent of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu, but also of the supervillains of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Indeed, for much of the novel, it is unclear whether Satan is or isn't the actual article; Old Scratch himself. The scenes in which he is present are quite riveting. Merritt keeps things barely on this side of reality; nothing that transpires in the book--the museum theft, the slaves kept in bondage by the mind-altering kehft drug, the worldwide criminal organization, the high-seas piracy--is beyond the realm of credibility. And, suiting style to story, Merritt, as I mentioned up top, writes in spare, wonderfully controlled, crime-pulp prose. Thus, we get a line such as &quot;I shot from the floor, and ...drilled [him] through the head.&quot; The dropping of the aforementioned purple prose makes the book seem lean and streamlined; it really does move, and keeps the reader turning the pages. The finale of the book is thrilling in the extreme, and concludes most satisfactorily. I have read that &quot;Footprints&quot; was turned into a 1928 film starring Thelma Todd as Eve, but from the plot synopses on imdb.com, it would seem that this film is a very loose adaptation, at best. I'd love to see it one day, just for comparative purposes, but can't imagine it equalling the suspense and excitement of the book. &quot;Footprints&quot; may have been a change in direction for A. Merritt, but it still makes for marvelous entertainment."},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A.

One of the other reviews said that it would make a good Indiana Jones movie and it definetly would. I wont go into the plot as the other reviews outlined it pretty well.

I recently pulled in from our storage area (barn) and gave it a reread. I see why it has been lurking in the back of my mind all these years. Now to be sure, I do love pulp fiction and pulp fantasy, I make no apologies for that. The reading is fast and the reading, to my taste is fun. This is one of the better of the mass. Simply put, it is the story of a man who meet Satan and plays a game against him on his, Satan's, own ground. No spoiler here. The pace of the story is fast, the story telling great, and the imagination of the author is without equal. This is one of those books that you will set down with and not put down until the last page is finished. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A.

Merritt was one of the most popular writers in the fantasy field for many years. He had an unusual blend of elegance, poetry, awkwardness, romanticism and other patchquilt characteristics which, somehow magically, he pulled off. His pure fantasy novels, in the style of H. Riger Haggard, were a youthful fascination with me, a transportation to a never land that seemed at least possible if not hidden in the heart of a volcano somewhere. But 7FTS is altogether different. Though still somewhat stilted by a purple tint it is nonetheless a foreshadow or much more modern approach to suspense. I can seel Woolrich's work already determined. A plot involving white slavery, what seemed a tired artifice when I was a kid, but is already returning; drugs, Satanic overtones and a deadly stairway only equaled by the steps leading to Ming the Merciless, never to be scaled alive. It derives a lot of its horror from a truly surreal relationship between people ending up horribly and yet unable to stop doing what they are doing. A great read for the fantsy it is, part detective, part S&M (thought lightly), and partly the kind of writing where you assume the author saw it all at once and just hot handed his way through the manuscript in the kind of record time a fever dream might inspire."},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A.

A. Merritt was a true master of fantasy pulp fiction. The worlds that he created were in a class of their own, detailed, extravagant, mesmerizing. While some of this may have been due to being paid \\"by the word\\", the results were gratifying to the reader.This particular story is not a typical fantasy. Rather, it falls somewhat into the genre of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Fu-Manchu. \\"Satan\\" is a criminal lord, dealing in vice and drugs. His followers are motivated by the chance to gain Satan's power through mounting a staircase leading to his throne. If they choose the correct seven steps, they win.\\"Satan\\" is NOT Satan, but he IS a gloriously evil character and very hard to defeat. The story is told through the eyes of the good guy. Who wins?

Merritt, but there is one major flaw in this engaging novel, occurring about halfway through the story. \\"Satan\\" sends someone to steal a rare necklace from a museum, also dispatching a trio of drugged underlings to create a diversion while the necklace is stolen. The robbery succeeds, the three end up dead (as planned), and the police find no identification whatsoever on them. Neither the police nor the museum directors see ANY connection between the trio's actions and the robbery! (1) That they have no identification is not considered suspicious, (2) that they appear drugged is not considered suspicious, and (3) there is no attempt to determine their identity (e.g., by publishing their photos in the newspapers). Therefore, a possible link to \\"Satan\\" was lost through sheer indifference - or stupidity. It makes no sense to view the simultaneous robbery and the fatal trio ruckus as a coincidence rather than as a planned diversionary tactic! Sadly, this weakens the story considerably."},{"Title":"THE WORKS OF A.

Think of him as a depression-era Stephen King. The parallel's not all that odd; _Seven Footprints_ was one of the first books optioned for film before it actually came out (the film came out in 1929, starred Creighton Hale as Kirkham and Thelma Todd as Eve, and is probably best remembered for featuring, in a very very small role, Loretta Young).James Kirkham is a professional adventurer who's caught the eye of, yes, the diabolic one. Satan puts him to a test: he's got a game rigged up where there are seven steps from the floor of Satan's chamber to the top of this ziggurat-like thing. A machine randomly assigns four steps to be good and three to be bad. The person playing the game steps on any four of those seven, and depending on how many bad steps he steps on, he pays the piper (zero: you get to rule the world, one: you owe Satan one service, two: you owe Satan a year of service, three: you're up the creek). The person playing can stop, voluntarily, after any number of steps.While in the custody of the big guy, Kirkham meets, and becomes enchanted with, the beautiful Eve, and the two of them try to hatch a plot to escape the clutches of the guy with the big trident, aided by an old friend of Kirkham's who just happens to have found himself in the same situation.Yup, it's sensational adventure-type stuff, easy reading, G. A. Henty for adults. Good for escapism, but is kind of like sherbet; it's close to tasteless, goes down easily, and by the time you're done with the next course, you've forgotten it."},{"Title":"The graphic Bible,: From Genesis to Revelation, in animated maps & charts,","review":"the graphic bible provides a great easy to read overview of the biblical geography and story line intermixed. it helps provide a frame work for which to place further biblical reading. even though the text is old and current scholarship my question some of its details, i still rely on this text as a great book for new bible readers from children to adults. the maps really help you understand the story."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"Readers, scholars and admirers of the Indic epic \\"Ramayana\\" and students and scholars of the Sanskrit language must offer profuse thanks to Prof. Peter Scharf, for putting before us a \\"Labour of Love\\" in his publication : Ramopakhyana, the Story of Rama in the Mahabharata. The work comprises chapters 258 to 275 of the Aranyaka Parvan of the Indic epic \\"Mahabharata\\". But apart from the Ram saga, the book serves as an independent-study resource for students who have completed a basic survey of Sanskrit grammar. Following in the linguistic traditions set forth in the bench mark publication of Sargeant Winthrop's, The Bhagavad Gita, Dr. Scharf provides a liguistic apparatus thatwill delight and amaze even the most astute of Sanskrit scholars.The Devanagari and Roman fonts and the layout of other materials is simply superb on each page. The press of RoutledgeCurzon must be congratulated for bringing forth such a finely edited text. Needless to add such a massive work must include some typographical errors, notably an outstanding one on page 71, but the typographical errors may actually serve to sharpen the astute thinking of students and readers alike. I have no doubts this work will serve as a standard reference source for many years and I hope and pray that other Indic and Sanskrit scholars will emulate this work, to provide in a similar format the entire translations of the the four Vedas, the Mahabharata and the 18 Mahapurans."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"This book is best suited for someone who has at least some Sanskrit, but for the student who has the basics, but is weak on vocabulary, this is an excellent text. The layout is similar to Sargeant's edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but S gives a more complete syntactic overview and each verse has a prose retelling (in devanagari only), which is quite good for the intermediate student to practice vocabulary, grammar, and reading.With over 700 verses, this is an extensive text. There are some typos, but they should not trouble the average student."},{"Title":"Ramopakhyana - The Story of Rama in the Mahabharata: A Sanskrit Independent-Study Reader","review":"In addition to the other reviewers I would like to say something about the general set up of the book.The core of the book is the text of the Ramopakhyana (the story of Rama as it appears in the Mahabharata). There is one page (sometimes two) for each verse. Apart from a high quality Devanagari text of each verse you get:- A transcription of the Sanskrit text in the Latin alphabet.- The resolution of the sandhi used, with an interlinear annotation giving the exact grammatical classification of the word in question (for instance: \\"third person, dual. active, perfect\\" in case of a verb).- A glossary, containing all the words that appear in the verse, including the complete derivation (compounds, nominal derivates etc.).- A Sanskrit prose paraphrase.- Grammatical, textual, contextual and other notes.- An English translation.It would seem that you need to be a Sanskrit scholar to be able to appreciate the book, nothing is less true. If you are only able to decipher Sanskrit from a text presented in a Latin transcription, maybe using some grammar and/or dictionary and want to go ahead \\"doing something\\", this is your book. If you want to practice reading Devanagari, this is your book. If you want to practice resolving sandhi, this is your book. If you ... , well, there is a chapter in this book called \\"Suggestions for Use\\", anyway, this is your book!Apart from the text there is an extensive Introduction covering all kind of aspects connected to the text.The Devanagari text contains some typos. The most obvious one is on page 71, the title page of the text part. The \\"o\\" has changed into an \\"a\\", resulting in \\"ramapakhyana\\" instead of \\"ramopakhyana\\". As up to now, this is the only typo I found I don't expect the text to be overloaded with them.

The author, Moses Coit Tyler, explains his motivations in his Preface.This is a long-since, out-of-print book that is certainly very much worth your read. Be aware at the onset, however, that history from this period can be saccharine, sometimes to the point of outlandishness. You will be pleasantly impressed with the detail and insight in the early chapters and maybe nonplussed with the author's hyper-adoration in his latter chapters.This author has a point to prove - that being that Governor Patrick Henry is one of the MOST laudable of the Founders. Most 21st century readers are willing to accept their heros bearing the blemishes of humanity: in the 19th century, heros were apparently acceptable only in saintly perfection. Tyler is probably correct in his high esteem for Governor Henry; but, the historian who begins his research with a point to prove, often ends as an author who has sacrificed impartiality, leaving readers unsure of where facts begin and end, or how to refine fact from hyperbole.Much of the appeal of the book is viewing history from a different chronological perspective, but as good as it is...don't let this be your only biography of Henry. You will find a very appealing Patrick Henry with a less mawkish delivery in Thomas S. Kidd's:Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots.-----kindle edition-----Well done, given the analogue to digital transfer process and the editing that goes with it. Page numbers are awkwardly left within the text and while there is a Table of Contents - it does NOT transfer to the kindle's menu choices.

It is an excellent read and it shows some insight into Temujin's personality (he is strikingly similar to Yoshikawa's Musashi, e.g. the mountain climbing, desire to be the best, etc). This book also goes beyond the history centered around him and into the Golden Horde and post-Temujin Mongols.

It is a wonderful book written in the best Gothic tradition. Those who love the works of Anya Seton, Barbara Erskine, Victoria Holt, and Catherine Cookson, will love reading &quot;Mariana&quot;. It is, without a doubt, a great read.The book takes the main character, Julia Beckett, to a past life, after she purchases &quot;Greywethers&quot;, a beautiful old sixteenth century house. She has loved the house and been drawn to it ever since she was a young child. Once she moves in, however, life as she knew it ends, and life as Mariana, one half of a pair of star crossed lovers, begins.Mariana lived in the seventeenth century. She and her beloved, Richard de Mornay, the lord of Crofton Hall Manor, were never to live happily ever after, as their life together came to an abrupt end. Yet, they were to be reunited, as his dying words prophesied.It awaited Julia to make things come full circle. As Julia undergoes a past life regression and relives portions of Mariana's life, she ultimately realizes that the past is often found in the present. More important, what once went wrong in the past, may be made right in the here and now.This well-written, spellbinding book is sure to captivate the reader. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Mariana.","review":"That one word sums up my elation at finishing this book. I took this book at a leisurely pace because I didn't want to rush it, and it wasn't so engrossing for me at first to have to rush into. I'm glad I did this because this is one that lingers. I read \\"The Shadowy Horses\\" first and can honestly say that I enjoyed this one more, I also read \\"Splendour Falls\\" but it lacked the depth of character that this one has.Ms. Kearsley does justice to both Mariana and Julia. The blend of History and Romance is dare I say it?.... Sweet. I loved the relationship between Julia and her brother. I love the whole \\"soul mate\\" feel in this book. It reminded me of \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" by Jude Deveraux although this moved at an entirely different pace and the ending brought tears to my eyes. When I read this I remember rereading it throughout the weekend and since then I have loaned it out to many friends and they have adored it just as much. It was JUST THAT GOOD.FYI the book is hard to find you might have to locate it on auction sites.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"JFK: the case for conspiracy (Manor books)","review":"these two men have done a great job as co-athors,in doing research that was not biasted,nor built on speculation.little book,lots of info and a easy reed."},{"Title":"JFK: the case for conspiracy (Manor books)","review":"Congressman Thomas N. Downing introduced a resolution to reopen the investigation into the assassinations. He explained his viewing of the enhanced version of the film of the assassination. Peter Model is a magazine staff writer and editor specializing in government, business, and the arts. Robert Groden is a multi-media technician specializing in photo-optical image restoration and enhancement. A photo of the Texas School Book Depository shows the window at the 6th floor southeast corner was half-closed (p.71). This would block anyone from firing all shots at the limousine. The authors explain why that posed photo of Oswald was a fake (the pointed chin). The drawing on page 200 shows where 5 shooters could be stationed. The death certificate shows JFK was struck in the back (p.194) and not the neck (p.196). These are the facts that dispute the long-gunman theory. The Warren Commission was the cover-up; it prevented the State of Texas of the Federal Justice Department from investigating the assassination (p.16).John Kennedy had conflicts with the \\"military-industrial complex\\". Robert Kennedy attacked organized crime (pp.20-21). The nuclear test ban treaty meant a reduction in fear of a nuclear war. An end to the Cold War would affect military budgets. The authors have other suspects (pp.22-24). This chapter mentions the many strange facts in this crime. After attacking Jim Garrison the authors admit he \\"may have been on the right track\\" (p.49)! Watergate taught America that their government can't be trusted (p.55). [Many learned that in May 1960.] The second chapter explains the problems with CE399. This hard jacketed bullet could not have struck both JFK and Connally. The trauma doctors at Parkland hospital saw a massive exit wound in the back of JFK's skull. This suggests a soft lead bullet (p.85). Many of the witnesses died a violent death afterwards (p.90). \\"I never believed Oswald acted alone\\" (p.93). John Connally said he was hit by the second shot (p.137). A photograph of the limousine shows what looks like Oswald in the TSBD doorway (p.148). After Oswald's arrest there was no record or tape or transcript of his interrogation. None (p.210)!The chapter on \\"The Cuban Connection\\" is very interesting, How could the Bay of Pigs been a disaster when it was produced by those who had so much experience (p.216)? [Could this have been deliberate to discredit JFK?] Was Oswald sent to New Orleans as a double agent (p.211). They tell about Jack Ruby (p.236) and his past connections (pp.242-244). Did the US government only do business with organized crime since 1942 (p.247)? How could Oswald be killed while in police custody (pp.257-258)? Another lone gunman? How did Ruby die (p.259)? Was the evidence against Oswald produced only by the Dallas police (p.261)? There are problems with Oswald's actions (pp.271-278).The last chapter discusses \\"The Rockefeller Commission\\" and the actions of David W. Belin, who covered up the testimony of Charles Givens (p.283). The bootleg copies of the Zapruder film were widely available, it suggested a frontal shot. The Parkland Hospital doctors always said this. You can't believe everything in the \\"Rockefeller Report\\" when they changed facts (pp.291-292). They were discourteous to witnesses (p.293). The failure of the Rockefeller Commission led to the Church Committee investigation. This was followed by the House Select Committee that reopened the investigation into JFK and Martin Luther King (but not RFK). This 1976 book could not include this investigation."},{"Title":"JFK: the case for conspiracy (Manor books)","review":"The first section of the dvd is one of the most comprehensive collections of film footage documenting Kennedy's fateful visit to Dallas: beginning with the arrival of Air Force One at Love Field, and ending with the shocked and saddened crowds at Parkland Memorial Hospital reacting to the news of the President's death.Analysis of possible conspiracy follows. While intriguing, it is not entirely convincing. Some of the statements attempting to debunk the Single Bullet Theory are self-contradictory: First, the narrator establishes a *maximum* of 0.75 seconds between the time if Kennedy and Connally's wounds, and then claims a delay of 1.6 seconds between Kennedy and Connally's wounds when describing the Single Bullet trajectory. By contrast, the Zapruder film shows a near simultaneous reaction by Kennedy and Connally to being shot around z224.The clincher is at z335. This frame shows the clearest view of the President's head following the fatal shot. The right front part of his head is clearly blown outward while the rear of his head is relatively intact. This is consistent with a shot from behind, and stands in mute contradiction to all of the eyewitness accounts and claims of photographs showing that the back of Kennedy's head was blown outward.Other possible theories such as the \\"badge man\\" and \\"black dog man\\" are presented. While interesting they are inconclusive as well. In any case they are not compelling evidence against the mainstream Lone Assasin theory.The video is interesting and even entertaining. Mr. Groden seems sincere in his presentation of what he believes. However, the evidence ultimately points away, rather than from, the alleged conspiracy."},{"Title":"Jessie's Outlaw","review":"Jessie Stuart landed herself an outlaw.

His other translated collections of Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, and Greek poetry are equally beautiful. It should be noted, though, that \\"Marichiko\\" was in fact a pen name. In his later years, \\"Marichiko\\" was an experiment on Rexroth's part to write completely separated from himself as a central figure, switching culture, gender, and language - and then writing poetry from that new perspective. It wasn't until after his death that it even became clear the two were in fact the same person."},{"Title":"One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese (New Directions Books)","review":"Rexroth must be praised for two reasons. One: his translations are razor sharp (in the Japanese style), yet retain all the profundity and the humanity of the poem. And two: the selections are excellent. For all poetry lovers, and indeed for all poetry non-lovers, this is THE collection. You can't go wrong with Rexroth."},{"Title":"One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese (New Directions Books)","review":"Kenneth Rexroth's Japanese poem selections caused a great commotion within myself. Never had such words stir so much emotions within me. As a result, I am able to relate to better with my girlfriend.

I am desire so much to possess her complete works."},{"Title":"One Hundred More Poems from the Japanese (New Directions Books)","review":"I have always loved the simple, yet profound Japanese approach to poetry. The words stir the heart and soul. I have read the first volume in this two-set series of Japanese poetry, and I found this one as moving as the first volume. The author has each poem written in Enlish, Japanese and in Kanji characters. Kenneth Rexroth has did a fantastic job of translating the poetry from Japanese to English. In conclusion, if you love Japanese poetry, such as Haiku, you will want to read this volume. Rating: 5 stars. Joseph J.

He seeks to understand how religious healing might work, and to this end he presents a philosophical investigation of the self, how it is perceived, constituted, reshaped. Along with the central issue of religious healing, he deals with a host of fascinating topics such as the mind-body relationship, ritual, demonic possession, religious experience, the rhetoric and semiotics of religious language, psychiatry, and mental and physical illness.Csordas's method, which he calls 'cross-cultural phenomenology' is both philosophical and anthropological. He includes theoretical discussions as well as ethnography and evidence. Moreover, he is intelligent, broad-minded, and strives to be fair in his analyses. For this reason, readers with diverse interests are bound to find this an intriguing and useful read. This is an important book for several fields and deserves to be read widely. At the same time, it is a well-written and enjoyably readable book. The chapters are titled as follows: 1: Introduction, 2: Ritual Healing, 3: Therapeutic Process and Experience, 4: Emboied Imagery and Divine Revelation, 5: Imaginal Performance and Healing of Memories, 6: Image, Memory and Efficacy, 7: Demons and Deliverance, 8: Encounters with Evil, 9: The Raging and the Healing, 10: Envoi: The Sacred Self."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"This is a great book to read if you don't have the time to check into all the lies that O'Reilly and people like him (on both sides of the political landscape) have stated as fact. There are too many people with the power to say whatever they want and expect the public masses to simply believe them. When the conservatives started taking to the airways (and cable and the internet) I hoped that with a more level playing field more truth would be exposed. Instead these so called 'fair and balanced' programs are no better than the so called 'liberal media'. It's hard to find someone who doesn't have a motive for their position(s).Reading this book should help you discover what to look for when you want the truth. It may also make you realize how many liars there are on both sides (media, public servants). Just don't let these people think for you. If you have the time, check into what you're being told. Get answers to your questions not just 'fluff'. As one TV show appropriately says &quot;It's your money&quot;. Buy this book, well spent money. It will also help steer you from many money mistakes.There is truth, you just can't let it be covered up."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I was never a fan of O'Reilly, due to the fact that 100 percent of the time, he has no idea on what he speaks of. I am not at all surprised that this book was released. In fact, it had to be.Bill O'Reilly is no different tham any of these neo-conservaitve ideologues out there(Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Alan Keyes, Joe Scarborough, Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage, etc, etc) who whine about a mythical liberal media bias. O'Reilly, of course, is a straight up, pathological liar with NO MORAL VALUES WHATSOEVER. And he is by far the last person to be lecturing anybody on moral values considering his recent lawsuit and writing a book portraying teen crack whores.Here's an example of his rants against the \\"liberal\\" media:The New York Times: \\"Primarily a left-wing organization\\"The L.A. Times: \\"The Pro-Palestinian newspaper of record out there in L.A.\\"NPR: \\"A liberal slant... twenty-four hours a day.\\"Foreign Press: 'Well. everywhere else in the world lies.

Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"This book is like going to a fast food restaurant, it is fast, cheap and tasty yet you know the nutritional value is not the best. If you have found your way to this book you probably already have your mind made up that Bill O'Reilly is not your cup of tea. I found this book after reading the authors other book on Rush, which was not half bad. Basically what you get with this book is the authors attempt to classify O'Reilly inconsistencies with either the facts or his other musings. I think a fair review of the book would find that it is not really a negative attack on Bill, other then a few funny shots at his ego. It simply takes statements he has made over the years and then spells out the truth of the matter.I am not a fan of Bill O'Reilly, thus my book choice, so reading books like this that spell out many of his errors are just a laugh a minute to read. Other then the fact that you have to read many of his outrageous and somewhat bombastic comments, the book is easy to read and fast paced. The authors list out their sources and from where the O'Reilly comment came from. I guess my only complaint with the book is that given many of the O'Reilly comments were simple sentences, a Bill O'Reilly supporter could always make the claim that the comment was taken out of context. To avoid that I would have liked the authors to add a bit more of the Bill's words before and after the comments. Yet this is a small complaint on my part and does not really take away from the enjoyment of the book.I felt the authors could have given us a bit more. With the amount of air time Bill has, surly the authors could have come up with another pages of errors. The one thing that I did hit my limit on was that toward the end of the book I kept hearing Bill in my head and after about 100 pages, it was all I could stomach. Overall the book was a nice time waster, not too heavy and fast and easy to read. Did it provide any deep thought or interesting conclusions about the effect Bill O'Reilly has on the current Republican Party or the public as a whole, no. It just laid out many of his more bone headed comments. Would this book change any minds, again I doubt it. If you dislike O'Reilly or just disagree with a number of his positions then you will get a kick out of the book."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I bought this book because I thought I would get a witty almost sartirst bashing of O'Reilly's \\"facts\\". Instead I got a thin overpriced-in my opinion-book that resembles the instruction manual that came with my VCR more than a literary work. While the author does give numerous examples of O'Reilly's spin and self contridicting philosophy it fails to sandwich the examples sufficiently with analysis or give any good \\"lead ins\\". Over half the book is devoted to \\"O'Reilly\\" and \\"Oh really?\\" dialogue type arguments. Hart should definatly emmulate the O'Reilly bashing style in the Bill O'Reilly chaper in Al Franken's new book. And also too bad this book came out before O'Reilly's interview with Terry Gross on NPR."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

Just listen once and any sane person will understand..."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I got rid of cable a few years ago and have not looked back. One thing I certainly do not miss is the plethora of talking heads, rightist and leftist, blathering on to no good effect. But one thing that seemed pretty clear from the few times that I did check in with the likes of Bill O'Reilly, Hannity and Colmes et al. was that this was more show biz than serious political debate or commentary.But of course, some people--on both sides of the political spectrum--still take it all very seriously. And perhaps they should, after all, the influence that a Bill O'Reilly or an Ann Coulter might exert on their fans could prove considerable. And the results negative. Maybe. On the other hand, it's instructive to keep in mind that nobody seems to even remember Morton Downey these days. Or Joe Pyne.A book like this may serve as a good reminder that O'Reilly lays on the misinformation on pretty thick and that his is really anything but a \\"no-spin\\" zone. But, as others have already opined, it's really not about to change anybody's mind. Neither Bill nor his fans will never concede that his misrepresentations are anything more than minor errors. Just as Al Franken could never get much mileage from his revelation that O'Reilly never really won a Peabody. It was an honest mistake insist the converted. And hey, if the subsequent loofah allegations (that emerged a year after the publication of this book) couldn't bring O'Reilly down, then nothing can.Except maybe time itself, which just may consign him, along with Downey, to the dustbin of media history."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I've seen numerous excerpts from this book and was actually surprised at the spin throughout. Can even see that spin in the above product description for this book. To O'Reilly's claim that the USA \\"gives far and away more tax money to foreign countries than anyone else,\\" the response was \\"PER CAPITA the US is near the bottom.\\" Of course, O'Reilly said absolutely nothing about \\"per capita\\" in his claim, but the author, Peter Hart, believes this unrelated tidbit is supposed to somehow fully refute O'Reilly's claim. With only minimal effort, one can quite easily spot similar spin in virtually every other challenge raised by the author.Am I suggesting that Bill O'Reilly is always right? Of course not. Not for a moment. Just like any other person, O'Reilly makes mistakes. Most of his \\"fair and balanced\\" viewers are well aware of that. However, an occasional mistake doesn't mean O'Reilly is a liar, intentionally trying to deceive, or is concocting evidence, as this author suggests. Most viewers are aware of that as well. Likewise, an occasional mistake doesn't undermine the sheer volume of otherwise valid and worthwhile information O'Reilly provides to the public - those things this author (Peter Hart) and his left-wing cronies (the group FAIR) don't want you to hear, so certainly would not tell you.To be honest, I'd rather live in a world with a million like O'Reilly over even one like Peter Hart. The latter (Hart) treats the public like children who cannot think for themselves (cannot use common sense to distinguish right from wrong), while the former (O'Reilly) provides information we can either take or leave (using our own judgement). The latter (Hart) chooses to openly criticize and harshly ridicule those who disagree with his own political views, while you'll certainly never see O'Reilly writing a book like this about Peter Hart and his other left-wing cronies at FAIR."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Actually, my name is Peter Hart, no kidding. Anyways, I bought the book cause of my name, and it was actually really neat."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Since The Factor (and Fox News) has dominated the cable news ratings (even if you combine CNN, MSN, etc. together) for years, people will always try to make money by targeting the top show. O'Reilly always puts up the \\"commentary\\" title (unlike the mainstream media and other cable news networks, i.e., 75% of Americans believe the media slanted their coverage of the recent election to support President-Elect Obama) when puting forth his personal opinion, and if you watch the show he takes on both sides of the issue while still advocating the ethics and values that made the United States a good force in the world. I bought this to see if I was missing something; however, it served to just support my analysis that his show, overall, The Factor is outstanding."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I'm no great fan of Bill O'Reilly, although he does manage to get some interesting guests on his show. (If only he'd let them speak!) But this book is one long case of a strawman argument. For example, by saying that O'Reilly is wrong about U.S. foreign aid by citing PER CAPITA giving is a classic case of making statistics say what you want to. Here's a clue: take a large nation and your per capita ANYTHING is going to be small. O'Reilly is right, though, in saying in absolute amounts in both monetary and nonmonetary aid the U.S. is by far No. 1.And O'Reilly makes no secret of the fact that he offers opinioin on his show. Opinion is not spin. Spin is taking the obvious and trying to make it something else.Still, some interesting points here that would be good to help deflate yet another gaseous bubble."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"One thing that Bill O'Reilly always tells his viewer is to read the left, right and in between stuff...so I try to that, but books like this give me a stomach ache.Since I have actually seen the shows Peter Hart drew his quotes from, I know they were often taken out of context or just not what O'Reilly said at all.I don't always agree with O'Reilly, but I would rather have him \\"Looking out for me\\" than any politician or other pundit.I often go back and check facts that he has presented,and he is usually right. If he's not, he'll come back the next day and apologize, then give the correct information.This writer needs to learn what \\"Fairness\\" actually means, because he didn't give any of it to O'Reilly. But I guess it's easy to take pot shots at the people at the top.I just really feel insulted that he thought he could pass this off as true information to people who actually watch the show...and just because an organization is called \\"Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting\\" doesn't mean that they don't have their own agenda or are not right out lying. This is the same man who has said that O'Reilly is a racist and that is totally untrue.So read it and laugh if you want to, but take everything this man writes with a HUGE bit of salt!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Hey, let's all refer to the book's summary in our descriptions. That is very helpful.I did not read this book, nor will I, and nor should you. You already know what you think about Bill O'Reilly, otherwise you probably wouldn't buy a book that explicitly sets out to bash him.My advice is to buy Al Franken's Lying Liars if you agree with Mr. Hart, if only because it deals with a broader spectrum of Right-Wing vs. Left-Wing conspiracy theories. If you think this book will make you angry, go ahead and buy an Ann Coulter book. Honestly, a book about a single issue in the Liberal/Republican debate doesn't seem to satisfy the demands of the more polarized audiences out there.Buy an angry book if you want, but buy one that goes a bit further than Bill O'Reilly."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},L={key:1};function P(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(M,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-c798c93e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/55.md","filePath":"glossary/55.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/55.md"},q=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{j as __pageData,q as default};
