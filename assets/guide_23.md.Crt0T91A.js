Perhaps I wanted to much, but hey, I bought this book knowing almost zero and now I feel like I have a pretty good start/handle on everything but that area. Other than that, I loved it.Not afraid to lay blame where and when due (read as: Microsoft). I liked the fact that they actually used a final press of the software for the book and didn't rely on the lies, ur.., um, false promises ur.., um, things that Microsoft told everyone and everyone just taking that for face value.

The other author's just may end up helping people instead of just frustrating them more.Great job fella's!"},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"The text is written in a pleasant format punctuated with relevant comments. The topic is Windows 98 from an end-user view point: it is a cross between &quot;Popular Computing&quot; and Cisco &amp; Ebert. Even the frequent characterizations of Bill Gates (&quot;Billie&quot;) and the two short, heavy-set guys (Leonhard &amp; Simon) are tasteful and instructive.If you want to learn about using Microsoft Windows 98 with some good inside tricks, this text is a good beginning.If you want to know the API function calls to write programs for Windows 98, you won't find what you need here. In fact, the book reads so nicely that you will probably need to fight to keep focused on your work, instead of propping your feet up on your desk and enjoying this light read."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"The Mother of All Windows '98 Books is a great reference. It answered most of my questions, including where to find and install Microsoft Fax (it's hidden deep in the CD). Woody and Barry also provide great tips on customizing Win '98, such as the full benefits of the Quick Launch Bar and extra actions to add to your context menu.This book is well-written, and the humour keeps it from getting dry.

I wish they had similar books on other subjects - like Excel!"},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"Woody Leonhard and Barry Simon have made a habit of writing excellent, &quot;insider's look&quot; books about a variety of software. This, their third book about the Microsoft Windows operating systems continues and expands on this tradition. Beginners will benefit from the comprehensive, understandable text and diagrams. Intermediate users will find a wealth of information they didn't know existed, and Experts will find the guts of Windows 98 exposed for their perusal. As a librarian, I am pleased to have this book as part of my collection. As a Windows 98 user, I am grateful to have this resource available to answer my questions."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"Being a huge fan of The Mother of All Windows 95 Books, I was rapidly anticipating the release of the &quot;98&quot; version. Packed full of helpful, intuitive information, Woody and Barry bring their considerable powers of computing to bear and make exploring your system fun and easy. In fact, there are little icons of Woody, Barry, &quot;Billy (gates)&quot; and, of course, MOM to each give a different point of view about Windows 98. Keep in mind that 98 is not an entirely different animal than 95 so much of the information and tips are basically the same. The one thing I do miss is the other characters in the last book. In addition to &quot;Billy&quot; and MOM, we had a Rush Limbaugh-type, MAO, Sarah, Igor, and the ever present bug. They each were distinctively different with their own personality and POV. Not that Woody and Barry aren't unique, but I really miss the banter of the previous cast. They were always entertaining and funny to read, even if the info wasn't especially relevant to me. Still, this is the book for all people who want to do more than just click &quot;start&quot; and play solitaire. Plus, it's based on Windows' final code while ALL other books are based on final beta.

This book is not nearly as useful as it could be."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"Much of the information in this book is useful. But for the sake of being funny (which it is) the book is wordy. I mean really--- when you have repeated error messages or the blue screen of death in front of your eyes do you really want to sift thru page after page of sarcasms and puns to find an answer to your predicament? Not that Mother contains those kinds of answers - it's more a learning tool. Contains lots of useful hints about configuring win98 as well. I was amused by the chapter, \\"Is Win 98 for you?\\". Yah right! Everyone buys a $.... book about configuring an OS prior to actually installing the OS on their system. If you are unsure, this book will not help you decide one way or another because the pros and cons offered will make your head spin. If you already have win98 and you like reading long commentaries with sarcasm and opinionated blabber- which is funny, I admit - you will love this book. If you want a book that will reference answers you need immediately without being too beginner, I recommend \\"Running Windows 98\\"."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"I needed to resolve a problem that resulted from a setup program that crashed.

Previously I had used Woody Leonhard's &quot;Hacker's Guide to Word for Windows&quot; and found it full of valuable info not available elsewhere, albeit poorly written and somewhat disorganized. The writing in this book is even worse, with the authorial voice fractured into four or more personalities, most of them technic-ill; nonetheless, the information provided is either unavailable or unsurpassed in any other books on Windows 98 that I have read or browsed. Someday Woody Leonhard will hook up with a decent writer and put half the non-Microsoft technical help press out of business (here's hoping)."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"I can't rave enough about this book.

I have all the technical information I've been looking for (like, what exactly is going on when a Win '98 machine boots up, and what happened to Microsoft Fax?).What has really made this book a joy to read is the humour throughout the book. My only criticism is that sometimes the humour obscures the meaning of the section headings (a slight annoyance, when trying to find something quickly in the table of contents).I found the dialog between the two authors (and often the words the put into Bill Gates' mouth) entertaining, and occasionally useful (especially when the two authors provided different suggestions)."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"Hey you need to buy this book, you need to read this book, then you need to read it again.

I have and I have seen many books on windows, which are essential, since Microsoft stopped passing out decent documentation years ago, but no book I have seen is as easy to understand as this.Woody takes you step by step through the most complex parts of windows, even networking and DUN, and where he can't make it understandable, he clearly tells you what to do and says that he does not understand why it has to be this way either.A must have book for anyone trying to keep pace with Windows."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"MOM98 is typical Leonhard and Simon: offbeat, irreverent and deadly honest. These guys love to love Windows and love to hate it, and both voices come through loud and clear in this book.

Using both narration and poetry readers see into her world as she reveals some of her most personal thoughts, and secrets. Follow her through the intoxication of love, and despair when love is lost. She displays both the physical and emotional reactions of her encounters through the vicissitudes of life.We read in her poems her personal point of view, and by extension, the point of view of many women. As a man, I am fascinated and enlightened reading her exquisitely written works and understanding that elusive feminine view. She describes her own experiences, in a way that lets her readers identify with the situations as they unfold. She writes of men, of sex and of love, in a way which will draw the readers into the verses to live them as they read.Frederick West Author or 'The Courtship of Abagail Smith' 'Jamaica Flight' 'With Bowie at the Alamo' etc."},{"Title":"LoSing MySelf","review":"LoSing MySelf is a beautifully compiled collection on the thoughts and experiences of the modern day woman in a fast developing western world. The first person singular narrative that runs through the book, from the dedications, introductions to new sections and the gentle and extremely touching poetry tributes to the two most important men in her life, makes this no ordinary 'collection of poems' book.Robbi-Lee McCambridge-Allen has managed to encapsulate and cleverly convey her life story through poems covering love, lust and sex, motherhood, marriage, the struggle for control over insomnia, her realisation of the effects of a serious incident in her life - and then surprises and delights the reader with her character portrayal of a night stalking femme fatale with the taste of doom in her mouth. She writes with great strength, erudition and expression and the lyrical quality of her words leaves the writer sometimes touched, sometimes haunted by her poems.Hetty Nassau"},{"Title":"A Flower Thats Free","review":"From Inside Cover:Exotic as a tiger lily, Kate Kingsley leaves the harsh beauty of her Kenya home as she sets out for London seeking adventure. But the transition from new world to old is unnerving, and Kate chafes against the rigidities of an upper-class English household: her crusty grandfather, shy Uncle Aubrey, and Aunt Dulcie, a fragile femme fatale struggling to reconcile present respectability with past notoriety. Even the frivilous glamour of 1930's London offers little scope for Kate's restless energy.Swept away by handsome Lawrence Drake, Kate views marriage as escape - until their idyll on the island of Malta is shattered by the turmoil of war. Confused by the wild passion she senses in a kindred spirit, rogue journalist Bill Maguire, Kate must summon up all her resourcefulness. Only as the world is liberated from the darkness of World War II does she find a kind of freedom.Against a backdrop of global turbulence - the Berlin Olympics, the rise of facism, the bloody shambles of Dunkirk - Sarah Harrison re-creates a world at war, with characters whose tragedies and triumphs are consistently compelling. Fit successor to her highly popular first novel, The Flowers of the Field, this is an utterly captivating story.It's a thick novel, a little bit daunting at first, but I am glad I finally picked it up. Once opened, the story is captivating enough to keep me going. While there is romance, it would trivialize the book to call it a romance. The tale starts with Kate, but it expands to include many people, directly or indirectly linked to her, from an impoverish family in East End to a woman in post-war Berlin. The essence of that era is authentically captured, rich in little details and emotions. The war images, told from different angles, are especially harrowing."},{"Title":"The Route of the Orange Limited","review":"William Gordon's book succinctly narrates the history of the Rochester &amp; Eastern Rapid Railway which connected Rochester to Geneva from 1904 to 1930. The corporate history of the company and the personal history of its employees share the pages of this book with many photographs, too many of which are unfortunately uncaptioned.The book reflects a mix of boosterism and nostalgia. The early decades of the enterprise bask in excitement which meets the almost unfair reality of progress through the automobile and economics of teh Great Depression.I reccomend the book to fans of interurban transit and other railfans, to historians of the region, and to anyone looking for a slice of life from the first half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ethics (Companions to Ancient Thought)","review":"This collection of nine essays on ancient Greek ethics is the best volume of its kind. Fine collections of papers have appeared in the last twenty years on the ethical thought of Aristotle and the Hellenistic schools, but this volume covers these figures as well as pre-Platonic ethics, Platonic ethics, and ancient theories of moral responsibility. All of the authors are world-class scholars of philosophy: Julia Annas, Stephen Everson, T.H. Irwin, Charles Kahn, John McDowell, Susan Sauv&eacute; Meyer, David Sedley, and C.C.W. Taylor. Stephen Everson's introduction argues, I think rightly, that ancient conceptions of virtue include ideas at the core of the modern notion of morality. These ideas include the notion of a reason for action that is responsive to others' interests rather than to our own interests alone, and the idea that such reasons have their normativity independently of our current desires. Each of the other essays offers an account of its figure's basic ethical ideas but spends most of its time critically and insightfully discussing those ideas. This is an important book for any serious student of the history of ethics. All Greek words are transliterated for those without knowledge of ancient Greek. The volume also has a useful bibliography and several indices."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"Wonderful, strong poetry.

I came back to it after a recent loss (which by a very unfortunate coincidence happened just days after Szymborska's passing), to read again her poem titled 'Parting with a View'. This poem expresses so well my own sadness, the words are alive and true to my feelings, as they cut open deep in my heart they miraculously heal. And then I found myself reading for the thousand time 'Conversation with a Stone' and recognize the way that I myself converse with some people, stones, around me. And then there is 'Under one Small Star' listing my own apologies... And, of course, that 'True Love', which I had and paid the full price for it.... Szymborska wrote about me, for me, and this is why she fully deserved that Nobel Prize... Thank you, Szymborska, and may God rest you in peace!"},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"I adore poetry with a passion, both writing and reading it and this book is high on my list of great reads. Normally I shy away from translated lit because I know personally how important word choice is foe me in my poetry and can't image how different the meaning might come across in another language, but all these poems are wonderfully done, no word seems out of place and the rhythm of the lines is beautifully natural. Some of \\"View with a grain of sand\\" is controversial, some of it thought provoking, sometimes its is even haunting or disturbing but it is always brilliant."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"I have read many poetry books over the years for pleasure and for school, but there are only a select handful of books that I have held onto and reread. This book definitely falls into that category; I have dog-eared so many pages and underlined so many gorgeous lines that you can tell it is a well-loved book.I discovered Szymborska this year through my Advanced Poetry class at Winona State University. We went through many poets and used them as tools to further our writing and our understanding of poetry in general. But out of all the books we read, View With A Grain of Sand seemed to be the most popular in our list. I think any reader, whether they are poetry lovers or not, can find something akin to themselves in her words. I say this because she does not stick to one subject or even a couple subjects. She writes on anything from watching the image come to life under her pen to writing a resume. She writes about life, death, history and even onions. But I think one of the things that is most appealing about her is the way she approaches life with ironic humor and a cultured mind. Her poetry is deep but beautiful even on just the surface. There is so much to be gleaned from her writings and I would highly recommend this book to poet and casual reader alike."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"I take this book with me wherever I go. Szymborska's sentences run through my head like music. If you have never read her poetry, this is the book to start with--the translation team is excellent.

Because I am of Polish descent, I decided to read Ms. Szymborska's poems and I bought this collection. Her poems are very touching and direct. I appreciate the honesty that she uses and how some of her poems were derived from various world events (i.e. Vietnam, the Holocaust, etc.) and I could sense her obvious disdain for the Communism that had taken over Poland. My favorite poem from this collection is &quot;Utopia&quot;. I could just read all of her poems over and over. It's a shame you don't hear much about her. I recommend that anyone read these poems and you will be deeply touched."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"As another reviewer said, even if you don't have the tatse for poetry, you will like this book. The poems are accesible, yet rhythmic. The poems are personal, yet universal. I also enjoy that this is a collection of work from 1957-1993. Her work grows with her. As a writer, I particularly enjoyed &quot;The Joys of Writing&quot;, and &quot;Funeral&quot;. Buy it for yourself, and buy it as a gift."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"...Containing over eighty poems from seven original collections, this book serves as a well-rounded and pleasant introduction to Szymborska's work. This is a good choice for anyone interested in good poetry, women under communist regimes, or Polish literature."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"Ahh... where do I begin to explain why I admire, adore, and revel in Szymborska's poetry? It all began in roughly 1996-97 when I learned that this Polish poet, previously unbeknown to me, had been awarded the Nobel Prize. While I don't consider the Swedish Academy to be the ultimate authority on good literature and count only several of the previous prize winners among my favorite authors (Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak, O'Neill to name a few), I anticipated that an encounter with her poetry is bound to be special. The brief biographical sketches I then read and her photograph emitted wisdom, modesty, and wit. Or at least that what I think I must have sensed at the moment. In any case, after reading several of Szymborska's poems on-line (at a wonderful site called 'Poems from the Planet Earth') I was irrevocably enamored with her verses. Since then I have read and reread them on occasions too numerous to be counted, and I've read them to friends and strangers.I find that Szymborska writes with great clarity, never failing to gracefully walk the fine line between excessive (hmm..) eloquence and ascetic laconism. Her metaphors and characterizations are incredibly precise, and her poetry is rich with aphorisms. At the same time, it has somewhat of a haiku-like quality. Whether writing of grand and global matters or of minute things and creatures she is critical yet humane, and -- very genuine. The poems are sharp and witty but never cynical. Simply put, Szymborska's work is sheer brilliance from a poet with love for the human and the inanimate.I wonder whether the paperback scheduled for release this autumn will contain new poems... On a final note -- all translations I have had the privelege to read (Maguire, Baranczak, Cavanagh) are marvelous -- an occurence that is very unusual, and, hence, very precious."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"This book was and still is my first poetry book; not because I haven't read anyone else's, but it's the first compilation that I was really willing to pay the often outrageous prices for. (LOL) I am not an avid poetry reader, nor am I familiar with the current favorite contemporary poets, but I find that she really does succinctly portray &quot;life's improbability as well as its transient beauty&quot; quite well.As a younger reader , I do have a bit of a problem identifying with the poetry that she writes pre-1972 (that is, the first few sections before the 'Could Have' section), because I don't really know much about it. As a note though, I probably should say that 'Nothing Twice,' which is about the probabilities of chance, from the pre-1972 section has been a real gem. Anyhow, the travelogues, the places, the books are things that frankly, I'd ask my parents and they probably wouldn't know either, or know very little about. I suppose if I researched enough, I would have no trouble understanding her message, but the stuff I really bought this book for was the pro-1972 sections. I can identify the issues because they're fairly general knowledge and have a certain mocking humor to some of them, but the words do just pull you in. The poems are addressed to one, and to all, and you feel like you're part of the whole. There are instances in which you feel like she's writing about you and the instances you've gone through, and that's what makes you feel amazed at the depth of understanding she has on these matters.I first discovered her poetry in my high school English class and was surprised to find this book as the only book available in my favorite bookstore (and costing almost triple the cost of a volume of poetry that must have been 600 pages long, with of course long-dead, long-cherished poets). Oh, wait--I did find another book containing her work (that I don't remember the name of) but I bought this one because there were simply more poems that I liked. After a month or two of muddling around and waiting for the price drop (which it didn't), I just gave up and bought it. I can't say that I've regretted that decision.And...if you still have trouble deciding, the Nobel Prize for Literature she won should be more than enough of a pull to help you decide. It wasn't as much of a deciding factor for me, but it's always nice to know that somewhere in the depths of the blackhole that is my room, I actually have nobel prize literature that I understand and can recommend to others...My favorite poems from her have been 'Could Have,' 'The Onion,' 'Discovery,' 'True love,' 'Under One Small Star,' 'Pi,' of course 'View with a grain of Sand' because of wordplay, but I find that every time I re-read it, I uncover more about the poems and so that favorites list keeps on getting longer and longer.It may sound a little strange, but I keep it with me when I travel for long periods of time away from home and turn to it when I have that rare solitary moment to really think about life and what its inner workings are because it just gives such a realistic criticism that you sort of go...wow. Never really thought about it like that before."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"For those of you who have never had the taste or temperament for a book of poetry, View With A Grain Of Sand is the book that just might change you forever. These remarkably readable poems by the 1996 winner of the Nobel Prize for Poetry, Wislawa Szymborska, gives the perfect voice to ideas that have been quietly alive within us since we were first able to personalize a thought. Our most grandiose moments - birth, death, love - are placed in a common perspective with words of such simplicity as to make the message even more profound. Indeed, it is the very use of this everyday language that makes these poems so powerful.Ms. Szymborska eases humanity off its pedestal. The stars, the sun, the passing of time, and even a grain of sand will continue to go on very well without us, and will do quite well, thank you. Is it new when we are told that we are not the center of the universe - not the most important creation? Surely, by now, many of us accept this. What makes these poems so poignant is that they bring this realization to a deeper level.From the title poem View With A Grain Of Sand,&quot;We call it a grain of sand,but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.It does just fine without a name, ...&quot;Or, from True Love,&quot;True love. Is it normal?is it serious, is it practical?What does the world get from two peoplewho exist in a world of their own?&quot;What makes Ms. Szymborska such a wonderful poet is that her poetry is so enjoyable to read. At first, revelations appear through no great intellectual effort on the part of the reader. They are discovered through the poet's beautiful use of language and our personal identification with her themes. Second and third readings lead to an even deeper personal involvement.These are poems you want to share with others. This is the greatest praise."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"I never cared much for poetry, but this book has changed my mind. I - who some might consider uneducated - am curious about what is experienced, within us and without us, in life. Still, I find a lot of poetry difficult to understand since an education from Oxford or Harvard seems a requirment to get through it. This wasn't the case with the poems in this book. I'm able to digest much of the words and pharses in Szymborska's poetry which evoke different images, feelings and thoughts as easily as reading fictional prose. I even had shivers sent through my body reading a poem in this book. This existential jolt happens only rarely and only when I listen to music which affects me deeply. This is poetry I can appreciate."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"Some of us like it rough. This dame plays the way we used to play in the streets of Philly. There is elegance, there is subtle intelligence, yes, all that, but the best part is that when the ball hits you, it stings like hell. She writes of life and living, but also of eternity and death. She is somber, but never depressing. The language itself is encouraging, even when her message is not. This is a 20th century poet who has seen it all and isn't afraid to remind us of what man is capable of. The techniques are modern, too, but the love of language surely belongs to the old world. This is the kind of poetry we all used to love to read. She plays hard ball."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"Wisala Szymborska's poetry passes the test of intelligibility which is important to me. Virtually all of her poems are self contained in that they do not make arcane literary allusions. In other words, her poetry can be appreciated by the average reader which I consider myself to be. She does not limit herself in subject matter so her poetry contains something for everyone, and also with a subtle humor and an obvious understanding of the human condition. She does not require a lot of words or a lengthy poem to share her own unique insights. Reading this Nobel laureate one thinks how nice it wold be to meet this great lady. Although I devoured this collection the day I received this book, it is one which I will certainly read again."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"This is what we read poetry for, for the sudden explosion of emotion that hits you when you least expect. One of the greatest writers of our time."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"The Nobel Laureate in Literature of 1996 was proudly bestowed on Wislawa Szymborska, the first Polish woman to receive the prize for literature. While they are other Polish recipients like poet Czeslaw Milosz, Wladyslaw Reymont, and Henry Sienkiewicz to have received the honor, Wislawa is the first woman. While she writes poetry mostly, she has written prose. My biggest problem with poetry is that when it's written in another language, I believe it gets lost in translation but rather the meaning is not lost among its readers. The translators have the arduous task of translating from Polish to English. If you anything about Polish, it's not an easy language to translate from especially to English. But Wislawa is worthy of receiving such top honors because she is now well-known, highly regarded and respected. She has not changed much since she was awarded the NObel prize. She still lives in the same three room apartment in Cracow, she still smokes, and she is still the same humble person who despite her own feelings is quite worthy of such a prize."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"At first I thought Wislawa Szymborska took the mundane and made it magical. Then I realized it was exactly the opposite that she did with her poetry. Her poems start grand and end small, rather than the more typical inflation of something minute into a Truth. Take, for example, her poem Nothing Twice, a poem about how feelings and life can be so different from one day to the next: No day copies yesterday, / no two nights teach what bliss is / in precisely the same way, / with exactly the same kisses. Szymborska is one of the great explainers of the Truths; she can explain Honor to a dunce and Love to a child. She uses the analogy of a resume to show what is most important in life: Concise, well-chosen facts are de riguer. / Landscapes are replaced by addresses, / shaky memories give way to unshakable dates. / Of all your loves, mention only the marriage; / of all your children, only those who were born. In the presence of her work, I feel like a child, but one who is sitting raptly at his mentors feet, eyes wide, as the teacher reduces Concepts and other such mouthfuls to bite-size morsels. And this is why her poetry amazes and, ultimately, works."},{"Title":"View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems","review":"Truly a masterpiece of original poetry and its excellent translation. Szymborska speaks with the language of the soul. She ponders simple things as miracles, sees beyond the surface. Filled with irony, beauty, depth, and thought, this book is the true triumph of modern poetry.Being a poet myself, I found myself in this book."},{"Title":"Real Estate Ethics: Good Ethics = Good Business","review":"This is absolutely the best real estate ethics book I have found. It clarifies for the reader each standard &amp; article of the REALTORS Code of Ethics. There are case studies with each chapter. With easily a hundred situations to analyze and disect throughout the book, an agent or broker can probably find answers to many of the typical problems that occur in the day-to-day workings of the real estate industry. Used in a classroom situation, it helps the student understand that sometimes there is no true Black and White, but only many shades of Gray! A must read for every licensee."},{"Title":"Real Estate Ethics: Good Ethics = Good Business","review":"I have read some of Pivar books which were textbooks for my Broker's exam. I like his organization of material, and his completeness of detail. This book is no different. I bought it essentially because Robert Bruss, a noted real estate author/investor/attorney from the SF Bay Area wrote a wonderful testimonial for it which appears on the back cover. That's all I needed to see, as he has never been wrong on book reviews. I was not disappointed. The book sets forth the various concepts of Ethics, then gives different scenarios (probably court cases, as nobody could make this stuff up). The part I thought was most interesting was the chapter on Trust Fund handling, which was very complete and informative, and think most agents would get a huge lesson from it, as it is a soft underbelly in any agent's practice. What I thought while reading it was how many agents would benefit from this book, and it should be required reading in many brokerage offices. Sadly, books on how to become wealthy agents probably exponentially outsell this one. It is a fairly quick read, and should be required by all offices for rookie agents. It covers most everything I could think of having taken many classes on ethics to get my license renewed, and various designations. If anyone reads this, I firmly believe they will be a much stronger agent."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament Theology","review":"Walter Kaiser, does an excellent and very convincing job of tying the Old Testament together by showing the consistent, conscious, and continual theology of God's promise throughout the entire Old Testament. When I began reading this book I was skeptical, thinking that Kaiser was going to force the Old Testament into a convenient boxed way of thinking. I was actually hesitant to even read it, not being that interested in its contents. Now I am convinced that the authors of the various Old Testament books consciously understood the progressive revelation and fulfillment of God's promise of which they wrote.I have to say, the first 70 pages will turn off many. In these pages Kaiser sets out to explain the history behind Old Testament theologies and why he believes many fall short and in which ways. Then he sets out to define how his theology of the Old Testament developed and what hermeneutic he uses (a defining difference between Kaiser and many others is his focus on authorial intent and the message's intent within the context it was written). He ends the first part with a summary of the continuity of the blessing of promise throughout the Old Testament. These pages are very heavy reading. You will probably find yourself dozing. If you are really having a hard time with this section, my recommendation: Read chapter 4 of Part 1 and then move on the bulk of the book, Part II (you can always go read part 1 later). I do not think that Part I is superfluous but it is not necessary to understand and appreciate the message of the book.Part II defines the Old Testametn theology in almost 200 pages. The Chapters are as follows:5. Prolegomena to the Promise: Prepatriarchal Era6. Provisions in the Promise: Patriarchal Era7. People of the Promise: Mosaic Era8. Place of the Promise: Premonarchical Era9. King of the Promise: Davidic Era10. Life in the Promise: Sapiential Era11. Day of the Promse: 9th Century12. Servant of the Promise: 8th Century13. Renewal of the Promise: 7th Century14. Kingdom of the Promise: Exilic Prophets15. Triumph of the Promise: Postexilic ProphetsFinally the 3rd chapter is an 8-page summary of this Theology's connection with New Testament Theology. I do wish that this section had been more through, but the message was there.The very thorough indices (by authors, subjects, Scripture referecnes, and Hebrew words) are very helpful to help you use this as a reference after reading it.A book that I was not too excited about reading has now become on of the most used and dog-eared in my library. This book has come to help define my Old Testament theology.-Jacob Hantla"},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament Theology","review":"This has to be one of the best written OT theology books written from a conservative and evangelical perspective. Trying to study OT theology from a conservative perspective without reading Kaiser's work is trying to study Calvinism without reading Calvin's \\"Institutes\\". This probably being Kaiser's \\"magnum opus\\" book should be read by all students of OT studies and theology. Kaiser writes from a \\"promise-fulfillment\\" perspective and avoids the excesses of both \\"replacement theology\\" and classical dispensationalism. One of his arguments being that the OT authors had multiple fulfillments in mind when writing about the realization of the promises in the future. Thus, though the great promise will be fulfilled in the Church age to a degree, it will be fulfilled in completeness at the Parousia. The book has a nice flow and organization to it. It goes over all the major periods of OT history (Chapters 5-15) and up to the NT (Chapter 16). The first section of the book (Chapters 1-4) deal with OT theological methodology. Many may find these first four chapters dry and technical, but it is a good introduction to get the reader started. It also includes a bibliography and a full index. The only complaint I have is that the pages are made of beige-coloured paper-back novel paper. I hope in a future edition the publishers will print this book with better quality paper. Overall, though, this book is highly recommended to all students of OT theology."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament Theology","review":"This book is a great resource for tying together the Old Testament. It is not, however, light reading. I tried just reading straight through it, but it just wasn't happening. I finally read it taking notes as I went. I ended up with about 40 pages of notes and a new appreciation for Old Testament Theology. (Don't get bogged down by the first few chapters. I think you could even skip them if you want to and either do or don't go back to them later. The only reason I continued after these two boring chapters was that I had to read the book for a class.) I thoroughly recommend that anyone who desires to understand the Old Testament take their time reading this excellent book."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament Theology","review":"The first few chapter are tough, but the book uses a diachronic (Kaiser's term) to present the theology. In other words, he shows how each successive time period builds on the previous time periods. The books presents an exciting unity of the Old Testament using the promises and the covenants. The books helps place each O.T. book in its historical context. This book is fundamental in understanding Walter Kaiser's approach to theology or O.T. theology in general."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament Theology","review":"This is an incredibly insightful book, tracing and understanding the promise(s) of God down throughout history.

I thought he was arrogant, spoiled, and unable to take accountability. However, they were well written. I thought I would purchase his novel to see what he could do in another form. Let me tell you what I think he accomplished. I think he was able to provide an image of life in the South during the depression. In offering this to the reader he offers a tale that focuses on how sex, love, and hate can drive someone to decisions that are less than admirable. This reminds me to some extent of what O'Hara does, but set in Pennsylvania. I love these kind of novels even if I do not agree with what the characters are doing. He paints a great image and reconstructs how the characters found themselves in the positions they did, and what they thought at the time.

In their relative brevity they may lose some of the depth this book offers, but not nearly enough so to render them non-valid. Perhaps this book is original, but it is not unique in its analysis.

I NEED SOME CAFFEINE!!!!!"},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"The political history of the space age in _...The_Heavens_and_the_Earth_ provides a fascinating glimpse of the considerations taken within the Eisenhower administration and the Khrushchev regime regarding the orbital realm. Unlike other authors issuing paeans to Kennedy for his expensive though successful challenge of a manned lunar program, Professor McDougall renders a more sympathetic assessment of Eisenhower's reluctance to commit federal resources to open-ended and prestige-focused stunts. The hesitance in launching the first orbital satellite, although politically disastrous, was prudently based on concerns that foreign countries might object to orbital overflights by potential reconnaissance vehicles. With the Soviet Union launching the first satellite _Sputnik_, such criticism would be rendered moot, although this triumph enabled Khrushchev to persuasively promote Soviet hegemony and stoke American fears of missile delivery for nuclear explosives.Most Americans have forgotten that Eisenhower advocated &quot;open skies&quot; to reduce the potential of overreacting to a perceived threat due to insufficient or faulty mobilization information, as well as reduce military expenditures (comparatively higher than today). Khrushchev, hoping to obscure both intentions and especially the capabilities of Soviet military power projection for preserving options in diplomatic and domestic intimidation. The United States wanted more open information so as to avoid a future &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and the Russians wanted to maintain their eastern-European gains without obligation to show their economic weakness and armed force limitations. Although sharing the information with the citizenry was an ultimate preference (now available thanks to LandSat, SPOT and other orbiting cameras), Eisenhower directed the first reconnaissance satellites as the Discovery series to look behind the Iron Curtain.Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's overtures by upping the stakes, federalizing research towards attention-grabbing endeavors with an eye towards employing technological problem-solving ultimately to social engineering against poverty and racism. Neither Kennedy nor Johnson appeared to realize that engineering solutions and welfare statism address not only different problem categories, but their agents differ -- engineers tend to focus on the measurable and quantitative, whereas social workers (unless flaking for larger budgets) appeal to a more ethereal empathy with their charges. Professor McDougall shows the underlying hubris behind these policies, and how this was integrated into the manned (and unmanned) programs for NASA."},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"Although there were notable forerunners, spaceflight historiography came of age with the 1985 publication this book by Walter McDougall. It received Pulitzer Prize and a host of other well-deserved awards with its analysis of the origins and conduct of the space race. This book explores the Cold War rivalry in race with the preparations for and launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, through the race to the Moon in the 1960s. The author argues that the mandate to complete Apollo on Kennedy's schedule prompted the space program to become identified almost exclusively with high-profile, expensive, human spaceflight projects. This was because Apollo became a race against the Soviet Union for recognition as the world leader in science and technology and by extension in other fields as well.McDougall juxtaposes the American effort of Apollo with the Soviet space program and the dreams of such designers as Sergei P. Korolev to land a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. The author recognizes Apollo as a significant engineering achievement but concludes that it was also enormously costly both in terms of resources and the direction to be taken in state support of science and technology. In the end, NASA had to stress engineering over science, competition over cooperation, civilian over military management, and international prestige over practical applications. Not all agree with McDougall's arguments, but since the publication of &quot;the Heavens and the Earth...&quot; historians have been striving to equal its scintillating analysis, stellar writing, and scope of discussion."},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"I purchased this book when it first came out 20 years ago. At the time, it was very controversial. Author McDougall suggested that President Eisenhower actually wanted the Soviet Union to be the first to launch an earth satellite because that would establish the legal principle of \\"freedom of space.\\" This principle was vital for the interests of the United States, which at the time was moving full speed ahead to develop reconnaissance satellites. Allowing the Soviets to go first would solidify the idea that one nation's satellites could freely pass through the skies of another nation. If the Soviets established such a principle, they would be unlikely to protest when OUR satellites began to overfly their territory. As later books based on newly declassified sources have confirmed, McDougall's analysis of Eisenhower's motives turned out to be right on target. The only thing the President underestimated was the intensity of the American public's reaction to the Soviet's \\"Sputnik I.\\" Detailed and comprehensive, this book remains one of the best single-volume histories of the early years of the Space Age."},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"This is the best political history written about the space program to date. McDougall's book is masterfully researched and written. This is what scholarship is all about! As a doctoral student in space policy, I have found this book to be an incredible reference guide in my studies.McDougall's genius lies in his ability to decifer the true reasons (political, social, and economic) behind the space race. The amazing thing is that he did so before most of the classified documents regarding the opening years of the American space program were released. Almost all of his assumptions have been proven true as those documents have become available to the public.I would highly recommend this book to any true student of the history of the space program."},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"Being a so-called 'Child of Apollo.' I read this book expecting few new insights to the space program's formulative period. Gee, was I ever wrong! This book is filled with nuggests of historic information that provides the reader with greater context and historic analysis than any other book on the topic I have yet to read. Any student of history, political science, or space advocate should read this book carefully to be well-grounded in the Apollo Era. McDougall did an outstanding job in relating to the reader details of the context of the American and Soviet space programs throughout the 50's and 60's. Knowledge of the space age would be totally incomplete without having read this book! I highly recommend it. It is no wonder that this book won McDougall the 1986 Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"...The Heavens & the Earth, A Political History of the Space Age","review":"The Cold War between the US and USSR was fought on multiple fronts. One of the most exciting was the Space Race; first to space, first man in space, first woman in space, and of course, the race to the moon. This is the subject of this book. Unlike other books on the similar topic, the emphasis here is on the internal politics within each nation that occurred as a result of this competition. Due to the lack of availability of data from the USSR, this book focuses on the US side, and examines the politics of the Eisenhower, Kennedy and later administrations.The book examines the various facets of the US space program, touching on subjects such as the formation of NASA, the space shuttle program, the battle between those who wanted to spend money on NASA and those who did not, the doling out of pork-barrel projects as part of funding for NASA, and the dichotomy between military and civilian control and influence.

In most cases using only simple ideas, he follows paths that in many cases must be constructed immediately before traversal. In this, his latest installment in that trek of exploration, he is again at his best.Each subject starts with a simple premise and the author follows it through to a basic conclusion. Many of the topics involve computer programs, and source code is provided. The programs are in several languages, including C, Pascal, BASIC and Rexx. However, most programs are quite short and represent basic algorithms, so it is not difficult to understand a program even if you are not familiar with the language.Some of the topics include:- 10^33, the largest power of 10 that can be represented as the product of two numbers that contain no zero digits.- A debate as to whether there should be a national computing initiative to compute the first trillion digits of Pi.- Fractal milkshakes, or creating a collection of fractal \\"bubbles.\\"Truly fuN with a capital N for number, this is another of the author's superb creations.

Clifford enables the reader to connect an eastern tradition to our western minds... if you're interested in Tibetan medicine, this book is a great on to begin with..."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry: The Diamond Healing","review":"This book is truly and evidently a classic. Clifford presents the methods of Diamond Healing - only by means of letting go of ego-grasping and ignorance might we begin to merge mind, body and spirit with truth.Tibetan Ayurveda consists of the medicine of the tantric vehicle, the dharma, shamanistic practice, and an extensive pharmacopoeia. It includes a comprehensive chart of the beneficial herbs of Tibetan psychiatry. However, most medicines should be bought rather than prepared, for there is an extensive preparation ritual performed by the enlightened healer. Generally, the method of the Tibetan doctor is to treat on all levels by way of profound compassion to reduce negativity.As the most psychological religion, the view of illness seems to be essentially psychosomatic - the repercussion of karma, the poisons of the mind. Other theories which are conveyed include an imbalance of life energy (prana), disorders of the humors - these are wind, phlegm, and bile - toxins, and the demons of the mind. The three humors correspond with various states of internal and bodily suffering. Left open to individual interpretation, however the author concludes that they are interpretations of the inner psyche, or presentations of a psychological state.Phlegm disorders suggest a tendency toward catatonia.Disorders of wind cause anxiety, sorrow and discomfort. They are treated with warming herbs.Disorders of bile - treated with bitter and cooling herbs - cause frustration and rage.Amongst therapies are mandala meditations, the practice of mindfulness so one may come to know that he or she is not the only being afflicted with suffering and imbalance, and powdered formulas, oils and incense. Fascinating the breakthrough which leads to the first major tranquilizer was found within the chemical structure of rawolfia serpentina, a plant used for centuries to treat madness in the east. There are invocations such as mantras and meditation on the Medicine Buddha. These are among the most powerful visualizations for self-healing.There is explicit material on the religion itself, the profound psychology implicated, and the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. When one first finds these concepts may seem esoteric. But as Clifford examines they become profoundly sensical.My fianc&eacute; - who is a Christian - and I suffer from madness. We are presently taking necessary western medicines, and using pre-prepared items such as incense, oil, and dietary intervention thus far. However, we are considering taking reiki, which is a spiritual discipline one of any faith can pursue."},{"Title":"Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry: The Diamond Healing","review":"Presently following the dharma teaching of Buddha, this book has given me a better understanding of the blue Buddha and how Buddhism plays a major role in Tibetan medicine."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"I love Bernard Cornwell's books - having discovered him, as many have, through Sean bean's TV portrayals of Richard Sharpe, I devoured the Sharpe books and then moved onto Starbuck.I'm English, and prior to picking up 'Rebel', I had little knowledge of, or interest in, the American Civil War (we add the 'American' because we had a Civil War of our own). My the end of 'The Bloody Ground' I'd become an obsessive.I've read a pile of factual books on the subject, and am getting Shelby Foote's huge hitory for my birthday, and I have to say, the story of this war is the greatest tale of the millenium. It has the grandeur of Greek myth, and yet it all happened.I have not read a single thing in any other books since that makes anything in Cornwell's books seem false. Experiencing Bull Run and Sharpsburg with Starbuck is real enough for you to smell the powder.I wish he'd write more. I know this series has had relatively poor reviews, by Cornwell's standards, but not series has ever captured mt imagination as powerfully. Perhaps those who bring extensive knowledge of the War to these books will be less impressed, but as an introduction to the most fascinating conflict since medieval times, this can't be beaten.I also will defend Cornwell's telling of this from the Southern perspective - few Southern soldiers gave a damn about slavery, yet their memory often gets damned because, at its core, their cause was unjust. yet the South, fighting for the wrong cause, brought nobility, courage, brilliant and panache to the field, while the North, fighting for the righteous cause, was incompetent, brutal and clumsy - rarely winning by any other means than crushing the Confederates under weight of numbers and superior resources. Its hard NOT to root for the South - even though you know you shouldn't, and Cornwell makes this paradox the core of the series."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"I cannot rate this book without talking about the brilliance of the whole series. Cornwell takes you from your reading room, and teleports you back to a simpler time. And you find out that it's not so simple. Set against the backdrop of the Eastern Theatre in the American Civil War, he portrays the massive carnage and greatest bravery in minute detail. You actually hear the cannons, and smell the rotting flesh of the wounded. Yet, the main plot does not take place amongst the gunfire outside. But, rather, within. It is a story of a soul, and his struggle with God, man, who he is, and what he stands for. Amidst the shouting, crying, blasting, and dieing...is a poor heart, searching for peace. I found Cornwell's protrayal of Nate Starbuck to be no less than perfect. I found myself rooting, questioning, hoping, and praying for this fictional character. For, I saw myself in Starbuck. The same questions, fears, and desires. When done, I walked away from this story with a different outlook on life, liberty, and what's truly important. As will you. Awesome series Bernard!

To escape these pressures and as a prelude to advancement on some other battlefield Starbucks is given a test a most difficult one. He is required to turn a bunch of convicts into soldiers. I have several problems with this book the first of which is that it has been so long between this book and any other new releases in the series. Doesn't Mr. Cornwell have anything better to do then come out with trite books like \\"The Archer's Tale\\"? These were wonderful books sir please get back to them. My second complaint is Luthifer the new character it just seems a little too P.C to have another black guy with a gun rebeling agienst his southern overlords.

But... was I ever wrong. I've been to Sharpsburg, I've walked the Cornfield and west woods, and I am amazed by the accuracy and emotion conveyed by Starbuck and Company. The panic, the sheer bewilderment felt by those brave men on both sides is utterly captured by Mr. Cornwell. Though true &quot;history's&quot; are indespensible, the authors descriptions gave me a sense of being there that I've not experienced for some time. What a ride!"},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"Bloody Ground is the final book in the Starbuck Chronicles and in some ways it's a very strong book and in other ways it's very weak. The plot is almost a rehash of an amalgamation of Sharpe books. That is the problem. Although the book is interesting and fun to read, it's not that original. Major Starbuck is transferred to command of a punishment battalion filled with cowardly officers and corrupt sergeants. His second in command is a situational conformist who wants to rape, pillage and plunder and stay well away from battle. With the help of a drunken but loveable officer named Potter (reminiscent of Harry Price from the Sharpe series), Starbuck must get the battalion in fighting order in time for Antietam. Starbuck has to worry about bullets from behind and in front as the Civil Wars bloodiest day commences. The battle of Antietam is well written and this book is enjoyable enough. In fact, I wish that Cornwell would finish the series and go through the entire war.

Already, the chronicles of Nathaniel Starbuck, a Yankee fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, are proving as popular as Cornwell's previous creation, Peninsular War hero Richard Sharpe. True, the historical period is nicely evoked and the battle descriptions are accurate. But the characters are all too simplistic. We never understand why the upstanding Starbuck is fighting to preserve slavery, why Southern blacks seem content in their place, or why all Rebels are nice and all Northerners nasty. The story of how Starbuck's leadership redeems a punishment battalion also goes nowhere--slowly. Yet whatever I say, I am sure this book will sell in great numbers. Go figure."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"As with the previous books in this series, the battle descriptions are vivid and excellent. I thought pace and supporting character development was a little better than Battle Flag. There are a couple plot turns that worked well, but can't really be discussed without becoming a spoiler. The author seemed to have finally given up trying to provide any plausible explanation for why the son of a Massachussets abolitionist would join the Conferate army. This follows a trend started in the last couple editions. There are a few weak references, but for the most part it's mercifully forgotten.It's unfortunate Cornwell seems to have abandoned this series without a graceful conclusion. This book ends with Antietam, so there's plenty of war left to explore."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"Finally, the 4th installment of the Starbuck Chronicles. As I have reviewed in the other 3 books, I find this series thoroughly enjoyable. Cornwell uses many of the same characteristic traits in Nathaniel Starbuck as he does in Derfel of the Winter King, and Thomas of Hookton in Archer's Tale.I like the way he builds the characters. They are not entirely perfect and they have lapses in judgment, but I find myself rooting for them even in the midst of suffering or trials.I found Bloody Ground to be the best of the 4 books, but not quite a 5 star (maybe a 4.25).

So if you have no idea that this is the fourth book in a series, then you're on the wrong page.The Starbuck Chronicles is like a good TV series that's cancelled after the fourth season, without warning. So there's no resolution. Now I'm not sure why Cornwell dropped the series, he could have lost interest, perhaps the books weren't selling. But whatever his reasons (and he claims now, 16 years later, that Nate is on his mind again), this series has a very unfinished pathos to it. Given that this fourth book only takes us to Antietam, there's still a ton of territory to mine, in what is obviously \\"Sharpe, only American.\\" So be forewarned that The Starbuck Chronicles does not conclude with this book, it's just on a thus far 16 year hiatus. So far.I like Nathanial Starbuck, while not really believing him. His reasons for fighting against the North seem basically to boil down to: A. He happened to be in Virginia when the war broke out......and B. To get back at his father, the loud obnoxious anti-slavery preacher. Either reason by themselves don't really work as much, but together they just barely make it plausible. What's not terribly plausible is that he turned into a great soldier pretty much instantly, with no training other than what little instruction was given him at the very beginning. But all that said, I still like Nate and rooted for him, and was hoping he'd survive (I was aware that there were no other Starbuck books after this one, but didn't know if it was intentional or not). What I really enjoyed though, was that Nate, while a great soldier, seemed to have something about him that rubbed people the wrong way. Too many heroes are 100% charisma, while Nate has some of it to be sure, but he doesn't have a great way with people necessarily. It added to the spice of the character and the plot.Missing from this particular novel, and the last one too if I recall correctly, is Washington Faulconer, who for all intents and purposes is the series antagonist. I didn't like him, but that was the point. He was a typical gentrified dandy, who thought that things that he wanted were right simply because he wanted them. You know the type, the fellow who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. The way he turned on Nate in Rebel was a bit contrived, but I liked their conflict. His son Adam has more to do in this novel, the Southern counterpart to Nate, and I appreciated that he at least had convictions of why he switched sides. Short shrift is given to Thomas Truslow, my favorite supporting player, but there really isn't much more could be done with him anyway.There are tons of places to take the series though, with over 2 1/2 years of Civil War to mine for plots. That's six more books at the rate that Cornwell has gone so far, at least. But they're entertaining reads, and I remain a huge fan of this author, while at the same time not having read any Sharpe books. Yet. I'll get to them, and would love to get to another Nate Starbuck book, if he's so inclined to write one.Four stars."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"This was a unique plot. To see the Civil War from the perspective of the common Southern foot-soldier had me rooted in fascination. The characters were very well rounded for me. Although the writer ties off historical facts too loosely with the book, that is okay for me. It is fiction and is supposed to be fun. What is the old saying? History is written by the conqueror? How true. I found it interesting to see the South being portrayed as patriotic as much as the North. That crimes and debauchery were rampant on both sides. Too often the Southern face of the Civil War is without shape, or demonized at worst. This book delivers with good history a punch of fun. Loved it...although the author ran off on my to do other projects...British be darned...bring out Starbuck again!"},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"In the final book of Nathaniel Starbuck's Civil War adventures, he is given command of a collection of cowards, thieves, deserters and murderers, known as a punishment battalion. Starbuck and his men team up with General Robert E. Lee's army and join Stonewall Jackson at Harper's Ferry, where the Union garrison is defeated. Then they move onto Sharpsburg, beside Antietam Creek, infamously remembered as the bloodiest single day of the war.The Battle of Antietam will be the final showdown for this conclusive novel of the renowned Nathaniel Starbuck series. As to whether Starbuck triumphs or dies, you'll just have to read the book and find out.Originally published on November 4th, 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"The fourth and (probably) final book in Cornwell's Civil War series, The Bloody Ground takes us through the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single day battle in American history.Without enough going on for a novel to ramp up between Second Manassas and Antietam, Cornwell contrives to send our protagonist back to Richmond to pick up a new command, a punishment battalion dubbed the \\"Yellowlegs\\" after they broke and ran in the Peninsula Campaign before they were even fully engaged. Nate of course brings them along and gets them back to the army in time to redeem themselves at Harpers Ferry and Antietam.Cornwell's account of General McClellan sitting on the lawn and drinking tea while mismanaging the battle through his telescope and fretting over how to save his massively superior army from Lee's impossible counterstroke is priceless.I would like to see Cornwell return to this series and write one or two more, but I strongly doubt that he will. For one thing, he has killed off one of the important characters that gave these stories balance. For another, there are not that many more major battles for the Confederates to win. Can you seriously imagine Cornwell's formula changing so radically that the book ended with Starbuck/Sharpe/Uthred defeated?"},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"Precise and palpable details present Cornwell's fiction with immanent force that conjures realistic imagery as real as dreams. This work and this series find his style hitting on all cylinders, and there couldnt have been a better topic than war-fiction based on the war between the states. Cornwell brings the objectivity of a foreigner to the work, and the choice of a copperhead for a first person narrator demonstrates the highest level of storytelling skill.I've read the Saxon series and the Arthur series and a few others, and this series rates on par with the best. However, though the imagery and visual detail of the narrative are the best in the series, the character development lags the other works. In terms of character development and the fascination it creates in the reader, I find the first in the series strongest.Finally I would add that I have been to the sacred bloody groud of Antietam / Sharpsburg, and walked the terrain, and I found this book faithfully bringing to life what my imagination could only suggest. For the Civil War buff this series is pure delight. Buy it."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"Antietam was the bloodiest single-day battle in American history. One thing that stands out about the battle in this fourth book of Cornwell's \\"Starbuck Chronicles\\" is that, for the first time, we see a real pitched battle - one where the Union Army finally stands and fights.Major Nate Starbuck, fresh off the Confederate victory at the second Manassas, is suddenly transferred to an undesirable post, commanding a Richmond unit disgraced by its cowardice at an earlier battle when, as green troops, poorly led, they broke and ran. He is replaced as commander of the Faulconer Legion by Maitland, a high society officer seeking minimal battle experience needed to punch his ticket for promotion.Starbuck uses a ruse to scope out his new command, led by corrupt or brutal officers dedicated to keeping it in perpetual retraining for their own motives. They are thrown back into battle without much warning. Starbuck meanwhile must figure out who supports him versus who might put a bullet in his back, as well as how to handle Potter, a personable junior officer but also a drunk.Meanwhile Adam Faulconer is tasked by his Washington spymaster to make contact with the North's most valuable spy, Richmond lawyer Belvedere Delaney, suddenly close to Robert E. Lee. Delaney stumbles across information that could turn the war, but needs to find a way to get it to Washington. And once he does, will the terminally cautious McClellan know what to do with it?All this leads to Antietam in September 1862. McClellan, as so often before, could win the war right here with any one of several not-overly-bold strokes, just committing his deep and better-equipped reserves to the battle against the ragged and outnumbered Rebels, reduced to raiding the bodies of the dead for extra cartridges. The Southerners are overcommitted to holding a creek line to the east as well as one extending across less defensible open fields, woods and a cornfield to the North. But McClellan dithers as ever about defending Washington and wastes time on elaborate maneuvering while buying Pinkerton's vastly exaggerated estimates of Lee's strength. Even the committed parts of the Union force this day significantly outnumber the Rebs, but this time brave Rebel counterattacks and countercharges no longer break the Union's spirit. The boys in blue keep coming as the bodies on both sides pile up."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"the best book in the series.

Yeah, I know...there's no such title but once you read your way into one of his series you begin to see and feel history in a new light. With BLOODY GROUND you get the American Civil War and the build up to Gettysburg. The war is building with intensity and with book #4 we are in the thick of the fight at Sharpsburg and Cornwell places us right along side of those who were there. Is it fiction? Yes, the best kind because it brings meaning back to the battle sites where thousand died for causes only they could best define. Nate Starbuck has his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy and Cornwell makes them as complex as only real life can be.Awhile back I think there was a push to build a theme park at one of the major Civil War battle sites but it fell by the wayside due to public outcry and protest. Cornwell's fine series offers us a look at why the ground deserves something better than souped up carnival rides or hawkers selling overpriced 'It's a small, slave world' T-shirts.What was lost there and what was gained needs to be preserved.A good read."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"In late summer 1862, the Confederate Army is invading the United States of America.

This, the final addition to the series, is perhaps the one I enjoyed most. Yes, its more of the same but the battle description seems longer in this one than in the others. The theory for how McClellan came to have Lee's plans is interesting and draws in the guerrilla aspects of the war not often touched upon. Cornwell's books are not \\"great fiction\\" in the sense of telling a story with deep significance beyond the story, but they are finely spun tales that entertain and that is of value in itself. But do not expect something original in characters - these are Cornwell-templates fleshed out in slightly different situations as with his other novels."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"I will quote from Cornwell's book, The Bloody Ground, \\" 'There are still yankees in the wood,'Starbuck said, pushing down the lever that rammed the revolver's chamber. ' I shot one,'Lucifer said. 'You damn fool, ' STarbuck said fondly. 'They're fighting for your freedom.' ...'but you shouldn't be fighting. Hell, these ba**rds are trying to liberate you...'\\" -pages 320-321Cornwell, Benard. The Bloody Ground. Harper Collins Publishers : 1996.First off, the yankees were not fighting to free Lucifer, Starbuck's servant, or any other black in the South. In fact, at the battle of Sharpsburg where this scene is taking place, the Emancipation Promclimation was still three months away! And even when the document was signed by Lincoln, it did not free a single slave. The Emancipation Pronmclimation was like saying that slavery can live in the U.S. but in Mexico it will be abolished. The goverment made those, \\"forever free\\" where they had no control and let those who they did control be oppressed. It was a military move, a right for the military forces of the North to conscript free and inslaved blacks in the South. I am not a lost cause revisonist. If you can state one fact contridicting mine about what I have said then go for it. But I look to historical documents, letters, and quotes for historical fact. I have quoted from a scene in Cornwell's fictional novel, The Bloody Ground. Now let me quote from history itself...\\"It is stated in books and papers that Southern children read and study that all the blood shedding and destruction of property of that conflict was because the South rebelled without cause against the best government the world ever saw; that although Southern soldiers were heroes in the field, skillfully massed and led, they and their leaders were rebels and traitors who fought to overthrow the Union, and to preserve human slavery, and that their defeat was necessary for free government and the welfare of the human family.\\"As a Confederate soldier and as a citizen of Virginia, I deny the charge, and denounce it as a calumny. We were not rebels; we did not fight to perpetuate human slavery, but for our rights and privileges under a government established over us by our fathers and in defense of our homes.\\" -Richard Henry Lee, Confederate Colonel\\"We are not fighting for slavery. We are fighting for independence.\\" Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America\\"If the South had only wanted to protect slavery, all they had to do was go along with the original 13th Amendment, offered in early 1861 after several states had seceded, which would have protected slavery for all time in the states where it then existed. This was not inducement enough to bring South Carolina or any others back into the fold. The States of the Confederacy, even today, could block the passage of the 13th Amendment, and certainly could have then. This is why the slaveholders wanted to stay in the Union. Their \\"property\\" was protected by the Constitution.\\" -Charlie Lott, historian\\"The assertion that the South fought for slavery is Yankee propaganda and a monstrous distortion.\\" -Jefferson Davis\\"[Defeat] means that the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by Northern school teachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the War, will be impressed by all influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, our maimed veterans as fit objects for their derision, it means the crushing of Southern manhood ... to establish sectional superiority and a more centralized form of government, and to deprive us of our rights and liberties.\\" -Patrick Cleburne, Major GeneralMy three stars for this book is inspired by the wonderfully illustrated battle scenes. The characters in this book are very fine and mold dramatically with the scenes and the story. Though I do not enjoy Cornwell's slander of the South, though fictional, I pray for a fifth book in the series. I believe that Major Starbuck, Captain Truslow, and General Swineyard have many more glorious and tragic stories to live in the coming months and years of the 1862-1865. I would love to see the series continue after ten years waiting for a fifth novel. If we are indeed treated to a continuation of the series, I hope that Bernard Cornwell will give a little more historical truth to the South's cause and its soldiers."},{"Title":"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)","review":"I never received this book.

As baseball declines, the New York Yankees/Boston Red Sox rivalry has become the axis around which the sport revolves. While most fans know who hates whom, I'm not too aware of the history that surrounds the rivalry. For this 30 year old sports fan, I know Dimaggio was great and graceful and Ted Williams hit .400. Outside of that, the players of this era are part of a mythical past.Halberstam's book does a masterful job of portraying the personalities of the two squads. He seems more comfortable describing the emotions these men felt than describing the actual play by play action. He clearly enjoyed writing this book and portraying the men he worshipped as a fifteen year old in suburban New York. Equally significant, he captures baseball at a crossroads in this book. Baseball wrestles with age in this book. He calls out both franchises for being behind the curve in drafting black players. He disdains George Weiss for being too miserly with salaries and George Yawkey for being to familiar with his players. Mel Allen's awkward transition from sterling radio announcer to grand old man of television seems to be a metaphor the growing pains baseball was making as it adjusted to the growing prevalence of television. From a modern perspective, it is shocking how George Weiss, the general manager of the Yankees, could be afraid that television would steal from the gate and the revenue of the team. Imagine how awestruck he would be at the New York Mets trying to rebuild their franchise based on the *future* revenue of a television network!Ultimately, though this books succeeds because it describes the motivations and idiosyncracies of the players. Players struggle through injury and play with a passion often missing from today's star driven efforts. Men like Peskovich, Dom Dimaggio, Doerr, and Kinder were unknowns to me who I had a real liking for by the end of the book.Perhaps the book could have been a little bit stronger if a baseball mind had some input, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I enjoyed this trip into baseball's past and strongly recommend to those interested in a readable tour through one of the era's highlights.4 stars--SD"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam has created a wonderful look back into baseball history that can be enjoyed by baseball fans from all eras. I became a fan during the early 70's and had season tickets to the San Francisco Giants of the late 80's and early 90's, but this book made me wish I could go back in time to watch the great Yankee/Red Sox pennant race of 1949. I enjoyed this book so much and read it so many times, I had to get a second copy to loan out to friends and fellow fans.From the initial description of the end of the '48 season, through the epic World Series of '49, Halberstam draws the reader into the world of baseball in the time before big contracts and network television. The behind the scenes look at the players, both great and forgotten, is extraoridnary. For most fans, the names of Dimaggio and Williams are well known, and many can recite the great acheivments of their careers. But what makes this book so interesting is the inside look at the teams and the individuals who made up these teams. Reading about these players and the way the game impacted their lives was an incredible thrill.If you are a baseball fan, read this book.

Much of the book was derived from interviews with the players 40 years later, but they seemed to remember well what happend. Since I am not an American League fan and since I have always hated the Yankees the book could have been better but there is a lot interesting stuff in the book, and it provides quite a good insight into the thinking and behavior of players in 1949, when they made a lot less money than players do today"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Like October '64, Halberstam gives a little too much coverage to sportswriters (their backgrounds, bio, etc.).

Both players and teams were in their primes. The pennant race came down to the last game. The Forties were ending and the 50s were just about to begin.

My husband has really enjoyed having this book in his library. Thank you again."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"\\"Summer of 49\\" by David Halberstam provides a retrospective journey through the golden age of American baseball. This book seemed to be a special passion project for the author, whose formative years as a teenager in the late 40's were filled with major league baseball and reverence for the colorful personalities that filled its ranks.This book strikes a pretty good balance between a play by play of the crucial moments of the 1949 season and the unique personalities on the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. I especially enjoyed the emphasis on the personal aspect of each team. Halberstam's strength in this book is the anecdotal style he uses to conjure up the legendary personas of baseball's past. He not only writes for sports fans, but for readers who enjoy human interest stories of a bygone era.Halberstam essentially weaves back and forth between the Red Sox and Yankees respective seasons, which eventually come to a head in September as the two teams face each other for a spot in the post season. In typical Red Sox fashion prior to the 21st century, the team gets ever so close before a heartbreaking loss and elimination from the playoffs.I found the description of the games to be well done, but the real charm of this book is found in Halberstam's understanding of the players and how they represented purity and heroics in American life. It was obviously a much simpler time; World War II had just ended and the divisions of the Cold War era were not yet blatant in American society. Baseball was a return to normalcy for the country and its widening marketability through television brought the game into the homes of millions of Americans. Halberstam writes well on this transition period, as players became sellable celebrities. This brought a real shift to the game and also evidenced commercialization of society, with all its ups and downs.Perhaps the most featured player is Joe DiMaggio, who was probably the first truly publicized and marketed sports figure in American life. Halberstam shows the almost mythic status he held in the eyes of the public but also writes on the complexity of stardom that comes with such notoriety. Ted Williams proves to be the Red Sox's answer to DiMaggio, who is equally as colorful and unique. As both players were among the greatest to ever play the game, Halberstam shows a clear contrast between the two as DiMaggio perhaps shows the joys of baseball's widening appeal while Williams struggled with the press and preferred privacy.These two giants are complemented with a host of others characters, as Halberstam shows a good understanding of a ballclub and how the different personalities work together to achieve success. One of the aspects that I enjoyed was the off field chemistry that the players created. It was truly a different era as they were not held to such scrutiny as the press would refuse to publish defaming stories. Another great angle is Halberstam's description of player-manager-general manager relationships and the more simplistic and ultimate control the owners had over the players in contractual matters. All in all, Halberstam evokes a lost era of American life through the heroes of baseball who reflected time that many hold as sacred."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam's finest gift, among his many as a writer, is his ability to weave a wonderful, colorful, extremely important yet oft-ignored fabric called perspective out of the many-threaded and minute details he uses in his books. (An even better example is the way he swept away history book cliches and \\"Happy Days\\" gloss in \\"The Fifties,\\" but that's another review for another day.)In \\"Summer of '49,\\" Halberstam not only gave us an engaging blow-by-blow of one of baseball's best pennant races, as well as some of the key minor players to accompany the all-star cast, he gave us a feel for why baseball was so important to so many people at the time. Even though the book is about two of the last Major League franchises to racially integrate (the Yankees in 1955, the Sox in '59), the crumbling of the color barrier works its way into the story nearly as deeply as the tales of the two teams' immigrants' sons (the DiMaggios, Pesky, Rizzuto). So do baseball's postwar popularity boom, the suburban flight that would soon force franchise shifts and expansion, and the dawn of the television age. The social perspective Halberstam sewed together is just as important, and colorful, as the fine drama that played out on the book's main stage."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"This book doesn't just talk about baseball, but explores the psyche of the men who played and formed the game. An incredible history lesson of the times that will give a deeper understanding of just how great and how heartbreaking baseball really is.Even if you aren't a fan of the Red Sox or Yankees or if 1949 isn't a part of your life, this is something for any student of the game. Of course, baseball is the main theme but it also ties in how much our culture is and was affected by it. And if you just want to learn more about DiMaggio or Williams, Halberstam offers great insight into the legendary players.Even today, when it isn't the most popular sport in America, baseball still has sociological implications on society. I am definitely getting this for my dad."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"As an American history buff who has long admired the books of David Halberstam (\\"The Fifties\\", \\"The Best and the Brightest\\"), I would argue that the \\"Summer of 49\\" is one of Halberstam's best works to date. I was visiting a friend's house when I noticed a copy of the \\"Summer of 49\\" on his bookshelf. My friend, a passionate baseball fan, told me what the book was about. Although I'm not a huge baseball fan (growing up in North Carolina and following the Duke-Carolina rivalry gave me more of an interest in college basketball), I was enough of a fan of Halberstam that I borrowed the book. And, was I pleasantly surprised! Even if you're NOT a big baseball fan you'll still love this book if you're at all interested in American history. Instead of focusing on ERAs, bases stolen, and the other statistics that would appeal only to baseball buffs, Halberstam focuses on the human side of a great sports rivalry - the New York Yankees versus the Boston Red Sox. And in the \\"Summer of 49\\" he gives the story of one of that rivalry's greatest moments - the breathtaking, down-to-the-wire showdown between Joe DiMaggio's Yankees and Ted Williams's Red Sox. As always, Halberstam evokes a sense of nostalgia for the past that's almost overwhelming - reading about DiMaggio's health problems, or Williams's running battles with the vicious, always-critical Boston newspapers, or pitcher Ellis Kinder's bitterness at Red Sox manager Joe McCarthy - you get the feeling that you're right there with them. When I finished I felt awed by DiMaggio's quiet pride in winning the American League pennant and World Series after all of his health problems in 1949, and a genuine sadness at the emotional devastation the Red Sox felt after coming so close to winning the pennant two years in a row, only to lose in such cliffhanging, heartbreaking finales. If you enjoy Halberstam's style of writing, and you enjoy reading about a golden age of American sports (even if you're not a baseball fan) then you'll LOVE this book. A great read!"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"&quot;Take me out to the ballgame...&quot; One might find themselves singing the endearing, catchy tune after reading, Summer of '49 written by Pulitzer-prize winner, David Halberstam. The reader is drawn into the baseball universe in a time when it truly was &quot;America's favorite pastime.&quot; The era Halberstam captivates is a time when young children played outside the stadium in hopes to catch a glimpse of their favorite players. It was a time when even Red Sox fans cheered for DiMaggio when he was back in the game after recovering from an injury. The era was surrounded with the glamour of baseball in the purest sense. There was something captivating about being at the game, cheering for the team while eating peanuts and hot dogs. From the New York Yankees greatest player, Joe DiMaggio to Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox and the less famous names in between, Halberstam pulls us into the good times and hardships that came with being on two of the most successful teams of the sport. As readers, we are attracted to everything about this great sport because Halberstam makes us care about the individuals and the teams contributing to its success. The great players portrayed in this book not only shape baseball, but are a major aspect in shaping part of US history in the 20th Century as well. Halberstam brings the players to us and makes us appreciate their hard work and love of the game. This book is about excellence, the joy of being a part of a team. We see the importance of not just being good, but being better. Better than you thought you were or what others think you can do. It is about human nature and the nature of baseball."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I know Halberstam has a reputation for being a great writer and nothing I say will change it. However, there are two undeniable facts about this book: 1. Halberstam makes many factual errors. 2. He does not understand baseball.Bill James, who has forgotten more about baseball than Halberstam ever knew, dissects and rips apart Summer of 1949 in his 1991 Baseball Book . There are many errors of fact that could have been avoided with a little research on Halberstam's part. To mention just a few:1. Mel Parnell was not a rookie in 1948.2. Gene Bearden did not win the Rookie of the Year award.3. Jackie Robinson did not steal bases \\"at will\\" against Yogi Berra in the 1947 series, in fact, he stole exactly one base.4. Denny Galehouse was not primarily used in relief in 1948.5. Joe McCarthy was not \\"weary of rookies.\\" In fact, very few managers used rookies as often as McCarthy did.James details other errors in his book, I won't mention them all here. The bottom line is that halberstam is an extremely sloppy author. If he was a college student writing a term paper, he would get an F.Even apart from his factual errors, Halberstam betrays a lack of understanding of baseball. For example, he states:Vern Stephens played an adequate shortstop, though in no sense was he one. Pesky (Johnny) was shortstop, but moved to third base because he had quick hands and feet.Put aside for a moment the fact that Connie Mack said Vern Stephens was the best shortstop in baseball. Mr. Halberstam, baseball managers do not, ever, move players from shortstop because they have quick hands and feet. Players who have great hands and feetare moved to shortstop, which is the most demanding defensive position. Obviously, the reason Joe McCarthy picked Stephens over Pesky as his shortstop is because Stephens was a better shortstop. (His fielding stats were excellent, not that Halberstam would know that, of course)I just hope Halberstam knows more about the other subjects he writes about, e.g.war and politics, than he does about baseball. Also, he really needs to get a fact checker/ research assistant before he writes any more books."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"\\"Old-time baseball players and fans love to denigrate the modern ballplayer. \\"Baseball today is not what it should be,\\" one old-timer once wrote. \\"The players do not try to learn all the fine points of the game as in the days of old, but simply try to get by. They content themselves if they get a couple of hits every day or play an errorless game... It's positively a shame, and they are getting big money for it, too.\\"Bill Joyce, 1916 Ballplayer'The Golden Age of Baseball' began when players returned from the war until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants decided to continue their rivalry in California. That time saw many of the most memorable and significant events in the game's history: in 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier; that same year, the second Yankee Dynasty began with its first of ten pennants and eight championships in a twelve-year span; in 1951, Bobby Thomson hit the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" to win the pennant for the Giants; in 1954, Willie Mays made his spectacular World Series catch; in 1956, Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game in World Series history.For those of us who are Boston Red Sox or New York Yankee fans, one of the biggest baseball rivalries in history, 'Summer of '49' explains much of the history and romance of these two teams. David Halberstam brings to us the glories, the rivalaries, the drinking, the social and personal stories of the players on both sides. The subject is the pennant race of 1949 between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox which wasn't decided until the last game of the season. Is there really any value to another book telling us what a legend Joe DiMaggio was, or what a great hitter Ted Williams was, or what a great team the Yankees were? Yes,indeedy.1949 was the perfect year, because it marked a turning point in the history of American sport, which is one reason why David Halberstam wrote this book. Baseball was the number one sport, but professional basketball and football were beginning to gain acceptance. Television was just beginning to make its mark. The impact of black ballplayers was only beginning to be felt.David Halberstam brings us the day to day spotliughts of the Red Sox and Yankees for an entire year, from the end of the 1948 season through 1949. During the summer of '49, the two teams had one of the classic pennant races of all time. The Sox struggled at the beginning, while the Yankees, took a commanding early lead. But Boston chipped away at the lead until the final day of the season, when the two teams met to decide the pennant. Sound familiar? David Halberstam reveals the characters and gives us a glimpse of baseball during The Golden Age. He interviewed almost every living member of those teams and several people on the outside--fans, broadcasters, baseball executives, writers, relatives of players--over a hundred in all. The one interview he couldn't get, was from the most important member of the Yankees: Joe DiMaggio.Each team was made up of twenty-five men, plus perhaps ten or twelve others who played a little. We are introduced to every one of them, the drinkers, womanizers, country boys, city boys, the marginal players for whom 1949 will be their only season of glory. We feel a part of the team, traveling with them between games. And at the end of the book, he tells us what has become of them.In the conclusion, David Halberstam tells us how enjoyable it was to write this book, to interview his idols, to do research that many would consider fun. \\"I was the envy of my male friends who shared my enthusiasm for baseball in those years. Caught up in the more mundane tasks in journalism or Wall Street or the law, they would gladly have traded jobs with me.\\"\\"But probably the best reasons for Halberstam to choose 1949 were, first, that it was a terrific, dramatic pennant race between two hated rivals; and, second, perhaps most importantly, as he explains in the author's note, Halberstam was fifteen years old that summer and a devoted Yankee fan. The men he describes in his book were his heroes, and he lived and died with the fortunes of his favorite players.\\" David MartinezDavid Halberstam is gone now. However, his writing will live on, and those of us who loved his writing will remember him well.What Summer of '49 does for me is to renew my love for baseball, and in particular, my love for the Boston Red Sox. Ted Williams, after reluctantly leaving the batting practice cage, once said, \\"Goddam, but this is fun. I could do this all day--and they pay me for it.\\"Highly Recommended. prisrob 8-05-07The Best and the BrightestCharlie Rose with Jules Witcover, David Halberstam & David Broder; Ann Druyan; Peter Balakian (July 18, 1997)"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam poses an interesting question in his entertaining book about the 1949 American League pennant race. Did the Red Sox violate the cardinal rule, &quot;Never rile a giant,&quot; when they descended on Yankee Stadium for the final 2 games of the season?Birdie Tebbetts, Boston's ever needling catcher, told Phil Rizzuto early in the first game between the contending teams with the pennant on the line that the Red Sox planned on pitching the new college kid they had just called up in the next day's game. Rizzuto went back to the Yankee bench and proceeded to fire up his team. The Yankees believed that the visiting Sox, who came in 1 game up on the Bronx Bombers and needed but a single win to sew up the pennant, were taking them lightly. The Yanks won the first game and the pennant was on the line the following day.Halberstam then fastens on a controversy that will never be resolved, and which remains a sore point to veteran Red Sox fans. Joe McCarthy, the same skipper who guided the Yankees to so many pennants, and the Cubs before that, started Tennessean Ellis Kinder in the final game. Kinder had experienced brilliant success against the Yankees that season. Behind 1-0, McCarthy lifted Kinder for a pinchhitter. The Yankees then went on to a 5-0 lead before the Red Sox staged a ninth inning rally, but fell short 5-3 as the Yanks won the AL pennant and went on to defeat a strong Brooklyn Dodger team in 5 games in the World Series.The Red Sox were so furious with McCarthy, a manager who achieved the highest winning career percentage in baseball history, that an argument erupted on the train ride back to Boston. The players were convinced that, had Kinder not been lifted, the Sox would have found a way to win. They believed they would still have rallied for 3 runs and that Kinder would have whitewashed the home team the rest of the way for a 3-1 victory. McCarthy was eventually dismissed, never to manage again after a brilliant career.Another interesting part of Halberstam's book is the look into the quiet mystery man of baseball, Joe Dimaggio, and his courageous and determined comeback. With the Yankees behind the Red Sox in the standings as Joltin' Joe was sidelined by an injury, he unleashed furious determination to come back with little time to spare. Halberstam describes how he painfully cut his hands after lengthy batting practices following his layoff before the calluses returned. With Dimaggio back in the lineup the Yankees staged a comeback, forcing the final 2 game showdown for the flag in Yankee Stadium.A touching element of Halberstam's book is the focus on how the parents of Joe and Dom Dimaggio, centerfielders on the Yankees and Red Sox respectively, behaved diplomatically. The proud parents from San Francisco saw that love and attention was showered equally on their famous ballplayer sons, and that they showed no favoritism regarding the Yankees and Red Sox."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Some baseball seasons are more important than others- the 1941 season saw the twin feats of Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak and Ted Williams .406 batting average, the 1951 season saw the incredible comeback of the New York Giants and Robby Thomson's miracle home run, and the 1964 season saw the final decline and fall of the New York Yankees.The 1949 season is a special one for baseball as well. The New York Yankees, poised to begin their glory years, would square off with a talented Boston Red Sox team and defeat it in dramatic style thanks to the heroics of an injured Joe DiMaggio.Summer of '49 is David Halberstam's story of that astounding season. More than a simple account of the season's wins and losses, Halberstam delves deep into the background of the players and coaches. The picture that comes into focus is a fascinating look at the way baseball was played in the 1940s and 50s, when players (many of whom had grown up on small farms in the Great Depression) fought hard to win and played every day as if it were their last. While not quite as interesting as his &quot;October 1964&quot;, Halberstam has nevertheless written a wonderfully exciting account of what baseball was like over a half century ago.This is a book that will make any baseball enthusiast smile."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Halbertam is a great one for capturing incredible detail in bringing the era alive. To read one of his books feels like you are living a road trip with the teams involved for the whole season. Amazing research and written in a style that even those unfamiliar with a lot of the ballplayer names, can still enjoy it.I especially loved the insights into DiMaggio, Toots Shor and Ted Williams. It is amazing how many innings would pitch in those days, even with injuries, and still pitch effectively."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Don't get a statistic wrong; don't you dare make a mistake. Okay, Bill James correctly points out some mistakes that Mr. Halberstam makes in this book. None of the mistakes are important to the story, nor do any of them detract from the book in any way. I can't hold that criticism against this book.This is an excellent baseball book. David Halberstam masterfully brings to life a baseball season and pennant race that otherwise I could never enjoy. He makes you part of the history of the era in the US, as well as in the game of baseball. He introduces you to all the important players in the game and some of the other assorted characters around the game. It is a well written book, easy to read and enjoy by any baseball fan!"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I am not a great fan of baseball, but I am a fan of David Halberstam; having met him in person, seen him talk, and read most of his books. This one, like all the previous works, is a joy to read. Profiling dozens of individuals in and around Major League Baseball in the late 1940's, Halberstam recreates the world of America at this time as he and others lived through it. The featured characters are Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, but many others get a lot of text, such as Jackie Robinson, Yogi Berra, Branch Rickey, Joe Page, and others. The focus is on the men, as there is little mention of the wives, girlfriends, or mistresses of the players. They exist in this book, but only as distractions to the game. This book recreates the world of baseball as seen through the eyes of a devoted fan, and it is excellent and a joy to read."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I think that this book is one of the best baseball books that I have ever read. I think that people who want to know about the history of the Red Sox and the Yankees should read this book. This book is about the1939 to 1949 seasons. It talks about a number of players and it explains everything that they had to go through before they got into the major leagues. The players are all from the Yankees and the Red Sox. Also, it is very interesting because it talks about how hot it was in 1948 while they were playing baseball. I think that all Yankees and Red Sox fans should read this book."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"At times while reading Halberstam's book, it felt as if the literature came to life as if I were watching the final game on ESPN Classic. Halberstam's picture illustrations of players and team personell only reinforces his compelling account of one of the most intense and exciting pennant chases of all-time. Both clubs experienced distraction during that summer; New York, injury proned to DiMaggio and others. Boston, seemed to have \\"eggo-identities\\" with some players. In addition, the great Ted Williams had constant issues with the Boston media and fans, which only interfered with their quest to capture the pennant. Although New York sustained a better Front-Office than Boston in 1949, both organizations remained adamant by refusing to sign minority players to thier rosters. Maybe, if the Boston Front-Office would have up-graded thier pitching staff, history would have written a different page. Overall, I enjoyed another Halberstam classic, it is definitley a keeper for baseball historians alike.-AllotofVision-Marshall University"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"This was a great book for anyone who wants to learn about the 49' AL pennant race!!"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"This is a great book about the good days of baseball before free agency destroyed the game. I've read this book twice, and it is one of my favorites. David Halberstam is a great author and I would highly reccomend checking out some of his other books, although I believe this to be his best work."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"especially for this Yankee fan &amp; fan of the great Yankee-Bosox rivalr"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I read this a couple years back but I still remember the cast of characters and their triumphs, failures, and think about them quite often, much to my surprise. It reads more like Shakespearean tragedy than a &quot;sports book&quot;. It leaves you wondering about the fates of all those players who were forever changed---mostly for the worst. And of course DiMaggio, the hero: you'll understand why he is considered the greatest of all time."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Simply put, this is a great story. From the owners, players and mangers to the vendors and fans, this story truely takes you back in time to when baseball was a great American pastime. Nothing will compare when you finish this book"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I will keep this as succient as possible. Before I read the Summer of '49, I thought baseball was just a game. After reading it, I knew there was no going back. I became a hardcore baseball and Yankee fan. This book almost seems as if it is some ancient Greek myth, but that is the beauty of it: it all really happened."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Halberstam shares with his reader a love of major league baseball. The 1949 pennant race between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox represents the history of baseball at its exciting best. The sidebars that the author inserts into the telling of the storyline add greatly to the narrative. They always seem so germane. This book is a good read for someone who enjoys a well written story."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I've read many baseball books and this is one of the two or three best ever. Never mind the story of '49 which is in itself interesting, this writer brings in antidotes of these player which are pure pleasure, revealing, inciteful and fascinating. By the way, David Halberstam is also one hellava writer. A sure fire hit for any baseball lover especially those who know the player of the early fifties."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"The catalog of work by David Halberstam is outstanding in so many different aspects. It would seem that he is at his best when he writes about sports. While I can recommend any of his works, Summer of 49 is probably the best! Halberstam does a great job of not only painting an era but painting the giants who played in them. Williams and DiMaggio are given special care and shown to be complex and interesting characters in this drama, but then so are the role players like Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr.This work also does a great job of painting a picture of the last gasp of an era when teams traveled by train, were mostly white and played by afternoon. His descriptions of the games themselves are almost like listening to them on television. For true baseball fans, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"It would be be impossible to put the following three things together -- baseball, Yankees vs. Red Sox and David Halberstam -- and not have the result be a masterpiece. I've been a Yankee fan since I can first remember watching baseball in the mid-70s and lived for baseball and the Yankees.I still remember attending my first World Series game in 1978 (Game 3) at Yankee Stadium after the memorable 1978 battle with the Sox. For me, the heroes were different that those of Halberstam, the times different and the game certainly changed by television -- but not yet by the internet. Halberstam vividly recreated the players of the earlier Yankee/Red Sox rivalries, the players I grew up collecting baseball cards, seeing at Old-Timers games and reading about. Halberstam could likely write a book about the most dull subject and inject it with a style and eloquence that would leave me wanting more. Put this type of material in his hands and I couldn't put it down. Certainly, the larger than life stars like Joltin Joe and Teddy Ballgame are brought to life, but the supporting cast adds so much to the remarkable pennant run of 1949. From Joe Coleman, Vic Raschi and Joe Page of the Yanks to Ellis Kinder, Mel Parnell and Birdie Tebbets of the Sox, late 40s baseball jumps off the pages. Television and air travel had yet to dramatically transform the game and Halberstam creates a sense of time and place that is often hard fathom in the year 2008. However, one also steps into this era when players truly played for the love of the game, didn't have the security of guaranteed contracts and the color barrier was finally being broken down and enabling a flood of amazing African-American talent into a heretofore segrated professional sports league.Sure, we know the outcome. However, a measure of a great book or movie is that in spite of knowing \\"how the story ends\\", we remain captivated until the final word or the credits roll. This is what Halbertam does with the \\"Summer of 49\\" and in doing so creates a baseball classic. Even if you are not a Yankee or Red Sox fan, this book is a pure joy for any baseball fan and one interested in the history of America's pasttime."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"\\"Summer of \`49\\" focuses on the rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees as they fought for first place during the Summer of 1949. This was before the days of the wild card and first place meant a trip to the playoffs while second place meant a trip home. The two teams fought for first place all season long and (perhaps fittingly) it all came down to the last game of the season.\\"Summer of \`49\\" is an excellent book about baseball, the men that played it, the men who ran it, the men who called the games on the radio, and the fans who loved the game. Author David Halberstam focuses mostly on the players (rightfully so) and does an evenhanded job of portraying players on both teams. Halberstam provides a fascinating glimpse at players such as Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Ellis Kinder of the Red Sox and Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, and Vic Raschi of the Yankees. Equally interesting to read was the relationship between brothers Joe and Dom DiMaggio (Joe played for the Yankees while Dom played for the Red Sox). Also featured in the book are the managers of the Yankees and Red Sox - Casey Stengel and Joe McCarthy. Another person I found fascinating to read about and wish I had been able to hear announce games was Mel Allen.Halberstam also provides an interesting insight into what the game of baseball was like during the 1940's. It was an age when starting pitchers pitched entire games whenever possible and relief pitchers were not specialists; a time before the designated hitter; and a time before the wild card. I was not alive then, but as a once long-suffering Red Sox fan (2004 changed all that), I could picture how frustrating that year must have been for Boston fans. Halberstam does a good job of describing game action and I could feel the anguish of the Red Sox players and fans after that final game.Published in 1989, \\"Summer of '49\\" is a bit dated at the end (both Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams are still alive at the end of the book and Williams is developing a relationship with and yet to be manipulated by his son John Henry), but it is excellently done and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"In the foreward, Halberstam discussed how he was writing and researching this book in the midst of lecture tours to discuss weighty foreign policy issues before audiences comprised of very serious people. I got the sense that this book was a pleasurable distraction for him as it allowed him to focus on a topic related to a far simpler time and place in our history.I think he's laid it out for the prospective reader with that comment. It's a pleasant distraction for one interested in baseball to get a sense of where the game was at a crucial crossroads both in terms of baseball and our country.In 1949 the nature of the game was changing as was the country. It may not have been evident at the time, but in retrospect the 1950's would represent a new era."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I have read better accounts of dramatic innings, games, and seasons than are found here. However, Halberstam's reporting brings to life many players who were just names to me. Jerry Coleman, Tommy Henrich, Bobby Doerr, Mel Parnell, and others played before my time, and it's clear that Halberstam spent many hours with them and grew to understand them as human beings, and not just as ballplayers.This is not the right book for a statistics buff, I agree -- but it does bring back a very different era to a baseball fan of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"When I read this book I felt like I was a kid again. I grew up in the sixties and was not a fan of either the Yankees or the Red Sox. But, I loved baseball, enjoyed reading about the players from the past and loved it when my dad and others told me stories about baseball from the \\"old days\\". David Halberstam tells us the story of the dramatic 1949 pennant race between the Yankees and the Red Sox. He tells us not only about Teddy Ballgame and Joltin' Joe but also about the other great ballplayers on those teams. I really enjoyed learning about the contributions that were made by Reynolds, Raschi, Henrich, Kinder, Parnell and Birdie Tebbetts. Halberstam seems to know everything about the 1949 race and it appears that he was able to interview many of the players involved in the race. Halberstam is of course a great story teller and he is incredibly good at weaving cultural issues from that era into the book. Some of the items that Halberstam reveals in the book were shocking to me. This is a story from a by-gone era and you'll be surprised at a number of the business decisions that were made by the Red Sox and the Yankees and the impact of those decisions. It took me months to read the book because every couple of pages I found myself reflecting on something Halberstam wrote. For me, this was not a book to rush through. It was a book to savor. If you are over 50 you might really enjoy this book. If you are a Yankee fan, you'll love this book. And finally, if you love baseball and love to read about the old days, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"The late David Halberstam wrote erudite books on a wide variety of subjects. Thankfully, one of his interests was baseball. He has produced several scholarly recreations of some of the most fascinating pennant races in baseball history. In \\"The Summer of '49,\\" the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees were engaged in an epic struggle for the American League title that literally went into extra innings. For Boston, it was the second consecutive season that the team tied for first place at season's end. The Cleveland Indians upset the Red Sox in 1948 and spoiled Boston's opportunity to host a city series (the Boston Braves had won the NL flag). Unlike the National League, which featured a three game playoff series format to break ties, the American League had a one game sudden death tiebreaker.There plenty of information on the Boston/New York rivalry included in the book, but I was particularly interested in the developments that changing the game, not necessarily for the better. Television broadcasts were responsible for boosting fan interest in the baseball games and temporarily filling restaurants and taverns since few households owned their own television sets; within a few years, the same establishments were empty as people chose to remain at home watching television programs and the pace of the games was altered to permit more commercials to air. Announcers like Mel Allen became immediate local celebrities.The 1949 season marked the arrival of Casey Stengel as the manager of the Yankees and witnessed Joe Dimaggio spending a significant amount of time on the disabled list. The Red Sox were managed by former Yankee skipper Joe McCarthy and seemed to rely upon two overworked pitchers, Mel Parnell and Ellis Kinder, almost exclusively. Both teams featured numerous All Stars, including Ted Williams, Tommy Heinrich, Phil Rizzutto and many more. Most importantly, the players in this era cared about winning."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I always wondered how you could make writing about baseball a page turner when watching the game can be extremely dull. David Halberstam does it brilliantly in this book about a pennant rice between two arch enemies that occured nearly sixty years ago. The mix of baseball events and storytelling makes this a great book for everyone, not just baseball, Red Sox, or Yankee fans."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam wrote this moving narrative on the 1949 pennant race, which took place when baseball was king, TV was an infant, and each league had just eight teams. The author shows that the New York Yankees were hobbled by injuries to key players (including Joe DiMaggio) for significant parts of the season, while a somewhat healthier Boston Red Sox team fought for the pennant with a slightly weaker roster. Readers feel the excitement as the late season pennant race came down to the last two games of the season at Yankee stadium - with Boston needing one victory there to clinch the pennant. The author takes a nice look at the major figures in this pennant race; Joe and Dom DiMaggio (on opposing teams), Ted Williams (harassed by parts of the Boston media), Allie Reynolds, Johnny Pesky, Yogi Berra, etc. Readers get a feel for the personalities, the pennant race, and the state of life and baseball in that bygone era. These were two great teams that could have been even better had their front offices not refused to integrate two years after Jackie Robinson arrived in Brooklyn.Halberstam used lengthy interviews with surviving players to write this highly engaging narrative decades after the fact. I give the book just four stars due to some factual errors noted by previous reviewers (and stats guru Bill James). Still, this is an engrossing narrative about baseball when that sport was clearly on top."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"If you are a fan of one of the other 30 teams in major league baseball, you may not like this book. Readers will not dislike this book because of the story. The baseball season of 1949 was a great season. This book does not deliver on the promised story of the '49 season. Instead, it seems to be an epitaph to the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry of the past.As another review points out, many facts in this book are inaccurate. While some of these slips may be acceptable, the pages of fluff that stray from the actual 1949 season are not acceptable. At times, I thought this book might be better titled \\"Ted Williams and the DiMaggio Brothers\\". There were so many side stories that Halberstam seemed to avoid talking about the season for entire chapters while focusing on three players.Perhaps the most enlightening chapter in the book was the last one. Halberstam notes that the Yankees were one of the last teams to embrace African-American players. The slide of the Yankees in the 60's may not have been noticeable had they not passed on May, Aaron, or Banks. Much of today's bandwagon Yankee fan base forget this bit of history.While I enjoyed Halberstam's more recent work \\"The Teammates\\", I could have passed on this book. I never felt the author delivered on what he promised. Particularly for a Red Sox loyalist, I felt Halberstam was quite biased toward the Yankees. While the history of the Yankees is interesting, it was not the reason I purchased the book."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"The book was ordered as a gift, and I'm told by the party that received it that it is a first edition. The seller listed it as being in \\"great condition,\\" however, the book arrived in a damaged package with a damaged cover.

Unfortunately, that reputation is not well-deserved. Though a smooth and absorbing read, SUMMER OF '49 suffers from too many factual and stylistic flaws to be placed in the pantheon of great baseball books.As other critical reviews have pointed out, SUMMER OF '49 is littered with factual errors. Gene Bearden never won Rookie of the Year. Mel Parnell was not a rookie in 1948. Jackie Robinson did not steal \\"at will\\" and embarrass Yogi Berra on the basepaths during the 1947 World Series (Robinson stole all of two bases in the Series, one of which came against backup catcher Sherm Lollar). The list of errors goes on...and on...and on. The mistakes are egregious, they are lazy, and they irreparably damage Halberstam's credibility. It's simply impossible to rely on anything Halberstam writes without verifying it first.The book's other major flaw is its format: Halberstam jumps around too much. Despite its title, SUMMER OF '49 focuses surprisingly little on the actual 1949 pennant race. He glosses over months at a time with often little more than a paragraph and his constant and lengthy digressions give the book a disjointed feel. He gives only the shortest and almost idiotically shallow explanation for the Red Sox's mid-summer turnaround (good hitting teams play better in the heat!). He only mentions DiMaggio's nearly race-altering September illness in passing and never identifies what it actually was (viral pneumonia), how long it kept him out of the lineup (two weeks), or how the Yankees fared without him (6-6, losing 3 1/2 games in the standings). And he barely covers Boston's 11-game late-September winning streak that catapulted them into first place for the first time all season. But we do get entire sections on newspaper columnists, radio broadcasters, and the growth of televised baseball. The excessive attention paid to these ancillary subjects often winds up swallowing the main story. When Halberstam does eventually return to the titular pennant race from whatever tangent he ventured off on, the reader is invariably left disoriented, having forgotten where the central narrative last left off.These serious deficiencies aside, SUMMER OF '49 is not without a few redeeming qualities. Halberstam is a gifted writer and here he does craft an entertaining narrative. Through extensive use of vignettes and anecdotes, he offers valuable insight into the key personalities on each team, bringing to life legends like DiMaggio and Williams as well as indispensable but often overlooked figures like Tommy Henrich and Ellis Kinder. He also vividly recreates the era, making the long train rides, grueling August doubleheaders, colorful nightlife, and warbled radio broadcasts seem like first-hand experiences for the reader. That is no small feat and Halberstam deserves credit for successfully capturing the essence of baseball in the postwar years, if not necessarily its truth.SUMMER OF '49 is not an entirely worthless book, it's just a mediocre one that falls far short of its promise and inflated reputation due to factual mistakes, superficial analysis, and lack of focus."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"The great David Halberstam uses his intellect and flare for a story to write a unique baseball book. He treats the Yankees vs. the Red Sox with all of the respect and awe of the most encyclopeadic account of World War II. Best of all, it is not a typical baseball book, focusing on ERA's, RBI's, numbers, statistics, etc... This is a book about the men who played the game, who lived the game, whose lives were forever intertwined in America's past time. One confuses Joe DiMaggio with Achilles after putting down the Summer of '49.As a baseball historian, only Roger Kahn matches the greatness of Halberstam."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Great book, not only about personalities, but about the era. Always recommend it for both kids and adults, and even for a Worcester, Mass., native, the Yankee stuff is good.One note: reviewer James Maguire is quoting Tennyson, I believe, and not Shakespeare, at the end of his review."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Forget the Yankees and Red Sox, DiMaggio and Williams, and all the great rivalries of the time. They're in this book, but in true Halberstam tradition, this is a book about nostalgia and change. The entire narrative is one long implicit comparison to today's game; the personalities of the game as compared to today's stars, the changing mores of sportswriters, the companionship of teams then compared to looser bonds at present, etc. It's certainly no accident that Halberstam adds a \\"where are they now?\\" epilogue (and a touching, entertaining one) to cap the book, cementing the then vs. now theme.And thankfully, it works. The book centers around personalities more than anything else, especially DiMaggio and slightly less so with Williams, so the narrative isn't quite as smooth as other baseball books, e.g. The Boys of Summer. But Halberstam uses the stories to tie every player and personality to the greater action and themes so that every bit player, backup, and reporter gets to reveal something important about the stars or the way the game was played, So while the season is broken up and the games themselves can be boring, the book stays together well and each character becomes familiar. The success is that the title is exactly what the reader gets: the experience of being a baseball fan, and thus simply American, in the summer of 1949."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Mainly about the pennant race between the Yankees and Red Sox that year, focusing on the players that made it happen. Much is written about DiMaggio and Williams, of course, but Halberstam also deals with some pretty strange characters, like Ellis Kinder, a Sox pitcher who won 23 and lost only 6 games that year, who could only relax the day before working by getting drunk. The book is interesting and nostalgic--but real, too. Among the better baseball books out there."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Prize-winning journalist David Halberstam tells the story of the 1949 American League pennant race. Or at least, he tells his story of the race, with a little help from his friends, the baseball players that he interviewed forty years later.Early on, Halberstam reveals his original perspective on the season in question -- as a pre-adolescent Yankees fan, listening to the games on his radio. He finds several other fans of the day, and gets them to recount the meaning of baseball to their young lives. This perspective is important, because this is where the myth of these giant players began. And then much later on, Halberstam, now a prominent journalist, decided to recreate the myth, but to also use his tools as a journalist to get a glimpse of the forces behind the myths.We are talking, here, about giants that strode the earth. And the giants that manipulated their salaries, and the giants that wrote about them. They are all very pale giants. Halberstam shows us the managerial politics, the salary negotiations, the long road up from the minor leagues. He shows us the families of the players, he shows us the grisly wear and tear of the long season. He shows the bars, with their newly installed televisions. Climactically, he shows us the amazing conclusion of the 1949 regular season, and its devastating impact on the Red Sox.He also inadvertently shows us what was missing. As an afterthought, one of the latter chapters details the 1949 World Series. There, the Yankees make mincemeat of the semi-integrated Brooklyn Dodgers. Oddly, though, the tale of the black Dodgers playing in Yankee Stadium is the most electrifying in the book. That energy, that tension, is clearly what's missing from everything that goes earlier. If Halberstam recognizes this, he only decides to focus it on his follow-up, OCTOBER 1964.One should also note that The Summer of '49 is a fairly gauzy interpretation. Halberstam relies heavily on his interviews, and the accuracy of this book was stridently challenged by Bill James (1991 Baseball Abstract). Ted Williams (may he freeze in peace) died while I was reading this book, which made me grateful for its in-depth portrait of him."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I was very impressed with this book. As an avid reader of sports books I appreciated the expertise that David Halberstam has brought to this book. The book centers around the 1949 American League pennant race but it is so much more than that. It is the story of a Joe DiMaggio in the declining years of his masterful career. The portrait of Dimaggio painted by the author is a powerful one. In this book DiMaggio is depicted as a man who despite his declining physical gifts is able through sheer force of will to still dominate the game and to elevate the play of his team.The research done by the author is impeccable as he interviewed most of the players involved (with the exception of DiMaggio) and you hear their stories as well. The author is able to weave the players stories against the backdrop of the pennant race with fantastic results. From the managers Joe McCarthy and Casey Stengel down to the players this book has many characters that will bring a smile to your face and make you long for when baseball was a simpler game."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"For those of us too young to have seen him play, this book forces you to appreciate the realness and authenticity of Joltin' Joe, especially pertinent based on his passing last week. A great read and history lesson for those of us who long for when it was &quot;just a game.&quot;"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam's wonderful depiction of the great pennant race from 1949, as well as the psyche of the country that was undergoing tremendous change, captured the essense of a bygone era. Whether you're a fan of the game or not, this book is a compelling and highly engaging perspective of life in America; and back then, baseball---particularly New York Yankees & Boston Red Sox baseball---was at the forefront of America's interest.Baseball was truly America's sporting passion, and players like Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams exemplified that passion. In the end, DiMaggio's Yankees began a remarkable string of unparallelled World Series success . Fittingly, Halberstam wrote another great book, October 1964, which captures the events surrounding the demise of that Yankee dynasty.The genius of David Halberstam didn't lie in his tremendous knowledge of the game of baseball; rather, it was his unique ability to use broad strokes in capturing the essense of the prevailing social climate in America; he did it extremely well in this particular book.Quite simply, it's a classic."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"After reading this book you will see how great Baseball was pre 1965. The author describes perfectly the atmosphere, the players, the writers/announcers, how great the game was!"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam recalls his boyhood heroes - their personalities, feats, and frailties - and spins an outstanding tale of yesteryear. Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams are brilliantly portrayed as the juggernauts they were - two generals leading their troops into an epic battle. This novel is not all fun and games, however, as Halberstam recounts the personal hardships many players endured. A note : fifty years from now, will someone be writing about how today's players toiled for &quot;mere&quot; millions? At the current rate, this appears likely. Make no mistake, this work reflects the TRUE &quot;glory years&quot; of baseball."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"This very easily readable book is about the pennant race between perennial rivals Yankees and Red Sox. Half way through the season the Yankees lead the Red Sox by at least ten games but the Sox make an amazing comeback. The last game of the season will decide who will play the Dodgers in the World Series....Besides being a beautiful account of the 1949 season it is also a nice biography of all the players involved. An ailing Joe DiMaggio, a young Yogi Berra, a brilliant Williams and Kinderand Doerr. Great names from a great era.With this book Halberstam again has shown that in America serious historians can also write about baseball, America's national pasttime."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"The details of the games that kept the race tight right up until the seasons end were not as interesting as the behind the scenes commentary. This was baseball taking baby steps across the color barrier. This was baseball in an era when many of the greats were beginning to fade and the next generation of phemons were just arriving. Baseball in the throes of a painful but game saving transition. Halbertstam is especially good at focusing on some long forgotten players such as Ellis Kinder of the Red Sox.Although this book is devoid of the intracacies of the game, it is rich in lore and should elighten both the uninitiated and the baseball afficianado."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"I did notice two errors in the photo section. Main one was a picture of Tommy Henrich scoring after a home run off Don Newcombe. The caption below brings attention to Newcombe walking off the field after the hit. The error is the player walking off is not Newcombe, but 1B Gil Hodges. How do I know that? I knew all the Dodger numbers in those days and the player walking off is # 14 - Hodges. Newcombe was # 36 and not in the picture. The picture above this one transcribes two names, Hodges and Duke Snider I think. Minor stuff. Great book"},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Hearing of the author's untimely death today got me thinking about this book, which I read years and years ago but still remember fondly as one of the best baseball books I've ever come across.Halberstam does a very fine job of bringing to life the feel of the post-war years and of making the reader understand how baseball was a big piece of the social fabric that brought a sense of normalcy back to American life after the end of the war. I also recommend his book about the 1964 World Series, \\"October 1964\\".The author will be missed. A sad day...."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"Halberstam can perhaps be forgiven for focusing solely on the Yankees and Red Sox for the course of the book. The book is gripping, striking a fantastic balance between the games and the men who played them. If you're a fan of the baseball nostalgia genre, this is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"This is a great book about the good days of baseball before free agency destroyed the game. I've read this book twice, and it is one of my favorites. David Halberstam is a great author and I would highly reccomend checking out some of his other books, although I believe this to be his best work."},{"Title":"Summer of '49","review":"David Halberstam captures the essence and emotion of the times in this stunning look at one of the greatest pennant races in baseball histoery. His attention to detial and thoroughness in researching the subject matter are evident in the fact that as you read you feel like you are reading the box score in the morning paper the day after the game to check up on your team. Summer of '49 is one of the best baseball books I have ever read, but it may not even be Halberstam's best effort -- as his October 1964 is equally captivating and well done."},{"Title":"Database Design and Development : A Visual Approach","review":"I am taking a Database class online with my local college and this is the required text. This book is very difficult to understand. The wording in this book reminds me of the political science texts I had to suffer through to fulfill basic requirements in undergraduate school. Many passages seem very circular. I have a master's degree in mathematics and am already familiar with database design and I still am often perplexed by the unclear writing and examples in this book. After reading chapter four I could not even attempt the exercises. (I have a 98% average 1/2 way through the sememter.) So, in desperation, I finally went online to see if anyone else had a better explanation of what should be basic terms and ideas. Within 10 minutes I had found several websites that explained all terminology very clearly with excellent, concrete, consistent, examples.So, I am completely giving up on this book. I will use some of the great websites I have found to learn this subject matter instead. I only need the book now for my class homework. It is upsetting b/c I paid over $100 for nothing.I did read the other review. He must work for the book company or already know a lot more than I do about databases.

making this book a useful find for those who want to learn how to build a complete database solution through a test database project undertaking.Thanks to book 1 and 2, you will have a very solid hands-on foundation in working both the db design theory angle and its direct implementation aspects.A recent other book i found & just finished reading regarding building web-enabled interfaces and building internet solutions around accessible client/server database applications, is a book entitled: \\"Internet & World Wide Web, How to Program\\" (3rd edition) ISBN: 8120328027.

The price was right and the shipping was extremely quick."},{"Title":"The Recorder Today","review":"This is a very good reference, as far as it goes. It covers the recorder's history, physics, and comeback beginning in the 1930s. It has a good list of proponents and performers with basic bios of each, up to the date of the book's writing, 1990 (only brief Michala Petri mention). There are alternate non-standard fingering charts given, some even for the use of microtones; and some explanation of modern notation methods. A basic discussion of technique, old and new. There is a substantial listing of 400 modern classical compositions for recorder.Yet I do find fault here. Ms.O'Kelly has the same problem as other writers of recorder books. The tone of the book is that the recorder is strictly a classical music instrument, although it is capable of use in folk, jazz, or any other music one chooses to apply it to. This is the real recorder today, not just a bunch of Carnegie Hall wannabees playing in the parlor while the butler serves tea.I would love to find a book that explores the recorder's application to all music, with an expert's knowledge and advice on necessary transposition, and working around the recorder's limited dynamics and range. That book has yet to be written.And, this book contains no basic fingering chart. Like a spelling book without the alphabet included."},{"Title":"The Recorder Today","review":"I thought this book contained 400 recorder songs, that's what the products contents lead me to believe.

All three versions of this book look great and are well formatted. Perhaps there were issues with previous releases or with earlier versions of Kindle. I know a LOT of Shakespeare was really messed up in Kindle formats (due to the style of the theatrical text formatting).This is a collection of Japanese folk tales more than anything. The stories collected here are among the most popular. They are varied and quite enjoyable. I actually started reading this due to my interest in Ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world - basically Japanese wood block prints). Many of the Ukiyo-e artists had themes centered on characters and events from these tales. I was surprised that even the very first story was spot on with the summary under one of Yoshitsune's prints. Even the second story was one that was familiar to me.The tales all seem to have a lesson or moral to learn. They are quick reads and quite enjoyable. Most are what I would consider appropriate for all ages, though in the manner of many international tales, there is a bit of violence here and there. But what child doesn't remember the famous tale of humpty dumpty and the violent crash.Best of all it's free to download!"},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Very nice fairy tales. They are not fairy tales in a classic sense, so I recommend read each story before reading to your children because some of them are sad and depends of the age would be OK or not to tell them.

Im very disappointed in that."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"I don't have a lot to say about this, other than it is a very nice collection of Japanese Fairy Tales. At first I was a little put off by the way Japanese Fairy Tales are told. If you are like me, and used to European Fairy Tales, then these will seem a little different, namely, when the hero comes in and does his heroly deed, he doesn't simply marry the princess and live happily ever after, or ride off with his sidekick into the sunset. Apparently, the Japanese need a little more closure about the remaining life of the hero, so there are about 5-10 obligatory pages chronicling the fame and fortune of the hero before the actual ending of the book. This makes the stories seem a bit long winded and fluffy at first, but you get used to it after a while. Its true that the kindle freebie version is a bit lacking in format and spell checking, but this didn't bother me because I figure you get what you pay for, and this is free, so take it or leave it. The one thing that I found very cool, being a avid gamer, and growing up playing all the Japanese RPGs and action adventure video games, I could see many of the plotlines of those video games in these tales. Being a huge fan of the game Okami, I was especially happy to hear some real stories about Amaterasu (The Sun Goddess) and Ry'jin (Sea Dragon King). All in all, I liked these stories, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed reading Norse Mythology."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"I have been on a kick of reading fairy tales lately, and the Japanese tales have been my favorite by far. Beautifully written and slightly unconventional, I will be sure to go back to this book for a pick me up."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Originally published in 1903, Yei Theodora Ozaki's translation of Sadanami Sanjin's collection of Japanese fairy tales has been the introduction of many a young child into the legends and fables of old Japan across the years. Definitely not a scholarly reference or valuable research tool for folktale researchers, Ozaki unabashedly re-crafted some of the stories, translating loosely and adding in elements of unrelated tales, in order to make them more enjoyable and understandable for Western children. She even gave Urashimataro a happy ending!There is something delightfully romantic about translations from this era, due to the unfamiliarity with Japanese culture at the time. Terms that would not be translated today, like \\"oni\\" and \\"samurai\\", are rendered as \\"ogre\\" and \\"knight\\" and other English equivalents. While unauthentic, this makes the stories more approachable by young children who have a mind for fantasy but haven't yet graduated to Japanese Studies.While far from a picture book, artist Kakuzo Fujiyama contributed 66 beautiful drawings to illustrate the 22 tales. Unfortunately, all the illustrations are reproduced in black-and-white, instead of the original color plates included in the original pressings.Many of the stories here are familiar with anyone even slightly interested in Japanese folklore. \\"Momotaro, or the Story of the Son of a Peach, \\"The Story of Urashima Taro, the Fisher Lad\\", \\"Kintaro the Golden Boy\\" and \\"The Ogre of Rashomon\\". Along with these, there are rarer tales that I haven't seen in any other Japanese fairy tale collection. \\"The Stones of Five Colors and the Empress Jokwa\\", \\"The Sagacious Monkey and the Boar\\" and \\"How and Old Man Lost his Wren\\" were all new to me."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"the stories are wonderful. a few of them match some of the stoies we heard while living in Okinawa with the military.HOWEVER, I cannot give the Kindle version a 5 star like I would like to, because the formatting is absolutely horrendous."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"This is a graet book on this set of Japanese Fairy Tales.

However, I do think it would be nice if the free Kindle edition contained the original illustrations. The same is true for most, if not all of the free classics for Kindle. But of course it is free."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"This is possibly one of the worst books I've ever purchased, and I say that in large part because it really feels like whoever made this book sloppily downloaded stories from the Internet and pasted them into a word processor without bothering to do any editing. The paragraphs are spaced oddly, words are capitalized oddly, there are lots of typos, and there are even random numbers in parentheses scattered in the middle of texts. I might have put up with this nonsense if the stories were excellent, but unfortunately a large number of them are really, really boring and have off-putting messages. Whoever put this book together should be ashamed of themselves."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"This was not what I expected it to be. Some of the stories dron on forever and never get to a point. The translation is very odd and there are numerous typoes.

This book was not anywhere near as enjoyable as the Japanese fairy tale book I had as a child."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Japanese Fairy Tales, also known as The Japanese Fairy Book, is a 1908 collection of traditional fables and folktales compiled and translated by Yei Theodora Ozaki.As I understand it, this is a somewhat liberal translation; accuracy to the source material has obviously been sacrificed to a certain extent for the sake of accessibility. Interestingly, words that would not be translated today are translated here for the sake of the Western audience (\\"samurai,\\" for example, is translated \\"knight\\"). Many of these stories are not concise - they tend to meander - and some end rather abruptly. Without substantial familiarity with the original material, it's difficult to determine how much of this is the stories themselves and how much is Ozaki's doing, but I suspect the latter is more responsible.These stories are, nevertheless, mostly quite enjoyable, and the differences and similarities with Western fairy tales are particularly interesting. (Wicked stepmothers, apparently, are a source of plot conflict the world over.)Many of these stories are grim and violent, of the degree of the original un-sanitized Grimm Brothers' tales. There are vicious revenge stories here, and the ones involving animals bring to mind Tom and Jerry (or, perhaps more accurately, Itchy and Scratchy, never mind Happy Tree Friends), even with some obvious sanitizing (\\"The Farmer and the Badger\\" is a notable example). Many stories do not have happy endings. They certainly aren't all for small children.Accuracy aside, Japanese Fairy Tales is a nice little collection of stories, and a decent introduction to Japanese folklore."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"I really enjoy fairy tales and Japan, so I thought it'd be neat to read fairy tales from another country. They're not quite as dark as some of Grimm's tales, but there are cannibalistic ogres, wars, and murders. However, most of them should be appropriate for young kids (and it'll be a break from Snow White and Rapunzel). But I'm 17, so you should probably read the stories before you read them to any kids. Overall, while some of them can be repetitive (the gods give the childless elderly couple a kid as a blessing!), most of them are unlike anything you've ever read before. And did I mention that it's free?"},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Japanese fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Japanese cultural norms (like bowing as a greeting and a sign of respect), the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and dragons are everywhere, and most tales take place \\"long, long, time ago.\\" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"If you love Japan and the culture, this is a good book to help you understand some of the deeper cultural values of this society."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"I enjoyed these stories, but a few I felt may be a little too much for young children (as is the case with most fairytales)."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Would have liked this in a hard cover, but couldn't seem to find it.

While written over a century ago, the English is very readable and the stories very enjoyable. They are not much different from other fairy tales.The first story, for example, tells of a warrior who leaves home seeking an adventure. He climbs over a dragon without fear, which calls after him. He turns and sees a man who says he is the dragon king of the river and asks for the man's help. A large centipede has been killing his family. He needs a brave man to kill the centipede. He assumed the form of a vicious dragon to scare people who are not brave. You, he says, were not frightened. Could you help me?The warrior agrees. The dragon king takes him to his home under the sea, and the warrior is astounded at the beauty of the king's home and the miracle that he was not wet at all, for the water parted for him and the dragon king. The king has a festive meal prepared for his guest, but the meal is interrupted by the arrival of the giant centipede. The warrior takes his bow and finds only three arrows left in his quiver. He shoots one, hits the giant centipede in the head, but the arrow does not penetrate. It falls to the ground. He shoots his second arrow, hits the centipede in the center of its head, but it too does not penetrate the animal's skull. The warrior has just one arrow left.Then ancient superstition enters, as it generally does in fairy tales. The animal circles a stone the magical seven times. The warrior remembers that spit can overcome evil, so he spits on the third and last arrow, and shoots it. It enters the centipede's skull and kills it. The dragon king gives the warrior five gifts as a reward: a bronze bell, a bag of rice, a roll of silk, a cooking pot, and a second bell. All have magic powers, except for the bells. The warrior returns home and gives the bells to his temple. The bag of rice gives out rice without ever being empty. The roll of silk never becomes shorter. The cooking pot always cooks deliciously, no matter what's placed in it. As a result, the warrior became very rich."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."},{"Title":"Japanese fairy tales","review":"Met my needs.

I have been collecting Roman coins for about ten years and this is the book that got me started. Mr. Fox has written a genuinely readable book that, even after ten years, is an excellent introduction to an addictive hobby. Be aware, though,that this book is not (nor does Mr. Fox intend it to be)a reference book. There are appendices and photos to help the novice collector to locate basic information, but their intent is to get you started, not to sustain you over the distance. Once you get hooked (and you will), you will discover that there are enough references available to consume all but the most well-endowed checkbook. To me, the greatest value of this book is that Mr. Fox took great efforts to show me that Roman coins, in addition to being a fascinating window into the Roman world, are both available and affordable. If you have any interest at all in Roman coins, this book is worth any efforts you may have to make to find it. I recommend it without hesitation."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey, Lady Susan, The Watsons, and Sanditon (World's Classics)","review":"Every time I read another Jane Austen novel, I get the insanely anachronistic urge to write her a letter, and tell her how I adore her work. I quite doat on Jane Austen!On a winter holiday in the fashionable resort town of Bath, 17-year old Catherine Morland welcomes everyone she meets into her impressionable, if somewhat dense heart. The refreshingly honest Tilneys (Henry and Eleanor) and the unapologetically vain Thorpes (John and Isabella) form her central acquaintances. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a charming metafiction in which Catherine, living in a prototypical small village, goes innocently into the world, and cannot help but have her perceptions altered.Catherine's obsession with gothic fiction and Austen's 'cliff notes' narrative technique work together to achieve a briskly-paced, and highly amusing story, unlike anything else of hers that I am familiar with. She does indeed satirize gothic fiction, but also uses this forum to poke gentle fun at the very people who read her own novels, and others like them.To that end, the novel is split between two different ways of reading and understanding - that of Catherine and that of her accidental lover, Henry Tilney. Catherine is the all-believing, undiscerning method, willing to equate the superficial with the real. Henry is the more sophisticated intellect, with a view to the underlying realities of situation and personality. One notable result of these competing epistemologies, is Austen's insistence on acknowledging and legitimizing the literary merit of female authors, and the earnest call for female scholastic and social education beyond knitting, dancing, and romance.To have the fullest understanding of &quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; it is advisable to take some time to first read Radcliffe's &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho,&quot; then compare Catherine to Radcliffe's Emily St. Aubert. Those who dislike &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; because it is not like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or &quot;Emma&quot; would place too severe of a limit on the range and depth of Austen's authorial skill. This novel purposely stands on its own as a challenge to the comfort of traditional romance, and is a welcome change of pace."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey, Lady Susan, The Watsons, and Sanditon (World's Classics)","review":"I thought that Northanger Abbey was a capturing read and yet, if you have not read any of her other novels you would find the language hard to grasp at first. I think that she describes Catherine Moreland's naivity very well and there is a very pleasing ending."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"Gaudi, perhaps one of the most important architects of the 20th century, has long been in need of a good account of his life and works. This book finally fills the gap in scholarship surrounding Gaudi.Gaudi was a Catalan from Barcelona. He sculpted the famous La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and a few other works including an apartment building. He was a modernist and his buildings frequently appeared alive, as if from some fantastical dream, crawling, moving, fluid. He was a genius, on par with Goya(who lived a century before and was a painter). This is a wonderful account of the life and times of Guadi. It explorers his passionate faith and his obsessive qualities. It also looks at his unique designs and revolutionary ideas while exploring the cataclysms and social movements which shook Spain from 1900-1940. A important addition to any collection and of interest to anyone who enjoys art and architecture"},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"The book came quickly and in perfect condition. I look forward to reading it, thanks!"},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"This biography is not breezy, light reading. Nor, despite it's unusually elegant printing, is it remarkable writing. It is, however, far more detailed and credible information and insight into Gaudi than one is likely to get anywhere else. I've been fascinated with Gaudi's works since a very young age. The construction work on the Sagrada Familia -- the bulk of which has been during my lifetime -- is something I have been able to measure my life by. That said, my understanding of the architect himself had always been quite vague and contradictory for the simple reason that quality information was never available (at least not in English). Until all the renovations for the '92 Olympics, one certainly didn't learn much useful about him by visiting his buildings. While the architectural sites have radically improved their exhibits, they cannot get anywhere near the depth of this volume. This book is certainly revealing.One significant flaw in the book, however, is the complete lack of visual reference. I HIGHLY recommend that you have a visual reference to the buildings on hand, such as the Taschen book, when tackling this biography. The few photos here are mostly of people."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"My title is a quote from Gaudi himself and it is only something a genius could say. Like Bach claiming his work was 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. What clearly comes through in this book is that Gaudi was an extraordinary man - a creator of unique structures and visions.I have always felt a fascination with things that seem to have some unexpected, almost alien, aspect to them. In architecture this includes the temples at Angkor and the Hindu temples of India; are these the works of humankind? So it is with Gaudi. Where are the precursors? Where are the followers? Perhaps there are no followers because what he did was so exceptional no-one dares takes the same path. And then there is the man Gaudi as described in this book - he is no less alien; banishing intimacy with women from his life, being absorbed in catholicism, following a rigorous vegetarian diet. I didn't want speculation - I hate that in biographies - but I would have liked more information. For example, why was Gaudi a vegetarian - was it a religious tenet he was following, was it a moral one, was it health-driven?Other reviewers have been disturbed by Mr Hensbergens command of the English language. This did not offend me. Perhaps the paperback version I am reviewing had been further edited. But I did find the book slow to capture my attention. Perhaps it was Gaudi and not the prose that finally engaged me - but engaged I was. Another feature that initially annoyed me was the placing of the four sections of illustrations. It seemed to me that I was forever hunting for an illustration for the text I was reading. But by the end of the biography this didn't offend me at all; in fact I grew to love hunting back and forth through the illustrations because as I did so I grew to know Gaudi's architecture better and better."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"Outside of Catalonia and Spain, Antoni Gaudi i Cornet is mythologised as a sort of mad genius . The man, like his work is appreciated, but completely misunderstood. Gils van Hensbergen's intention is to present Gaudi to us in the Catalan nationalist context which formed him and his buildings. Yes, an understanding of Catalanism with its piety, spiritualism, chauvinist patriotism and family values is helpful to understanding Gaudi's life, but not essential to appreciating his work. Antoni Gaudi was a genius. Works of genius communicate themselves. That is all you really need to know admire and love Gaudi's designs.As pure as Hensbergen's intentions are, the book is a failure. Poorly written, haphazardly organized and indifferently edited, Gaudi is painful to read and does very little to improve ones understanding of the subject. To learn about the Barcelona of those days, its politics and players and how they influenced the architect, read Robert Hughes' Barcelona: a magnificent book by a master non-fiction stylist.Gaudi: A Biography is also inadequate in the descriptions of the projects and the buildings. Hensbegen never clarifies what happened at Poblet; how Gaudi worked and what his studio was like; that the model for Colonia Guell was for an entire church, not just a crypt; and most importantly how did Gaudi view space? Hensbergen never discusses Gaudi's mature interiors. He treats the designer solely as a sculptor--a former of symbols--not as a creator of spaces.I was confused as often by the imperfectly written sentences as by the badly explained ideas. The chronology is a muddle. Dates are even mistyped. Names pile up without clear explanation of who they are or why they are being mentioned. And the endnotes...! They are confounding digressions which clarify nothing.Without beauty, rationality and solid construction, this book is wholely unworthy of its subject."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"I have been obessed with Gaudi from the first minute I landed in Spain a month ago. I have been to msot of his major works and am finding my way to his lesser. This book has been an amazing companion to the journey. It is amazing to sit and read about Park Guell while sitting in Park Guell. The author gives you the entire story of each work, and the social, political, and economical contexts that surrounded Gaudi's works and life. I read the book at fast I as could and now am reading it again. If you want to learn not just about Gaudi but the Modernisme movement and the socio-politics of turn-of-the-century Spain, there is no better book than this one."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"I agree with most of what the reader from Buffalo says about this book: \\"Poorly written, haphazardly organized and indifferently edited, Gaudi is painful to read and does very little to improve ones understanding of the subject.\\"The book IS painful to read, if you love the English language. On the other hand, if you are able to laugh about bad writing, there are quite a few chuckles in the book. For example, van Hensbergen tells us about Graner's demon automaton in his cinema threatening customers with death, and comments: \\"This was rounded off by realising, after queuing patiently for one of the two ticket booths, that the usher was a dummy.\\" I love the shift from the passive \\"was rounded off,\\" which points to Graner's plan, to the ticket-buyer's active-voice subjectivity in \\"realising.\\" Grammatically, of course, it's garbage. Imagistically, though, it's a kind of inspired madness not unlike the idea of a demon automaton itself.Van Hensbergen's inadequate command of English grammar provides a constant source of humor. \\"This was the first time a nation - Catalonia - had connected into the history of a much wider Western culture.\\" He means, of course, that it was the first time Catalonia had connected with that history, a broad but at least defensible claim; but of course what he says is that it was the first time a NATION had done so, which is just plain funny.Here's another one that I love: \\"Built up in the Colserolla foothills on the slopes of Mont Tibidabo, Gaudi looked to the mediaeval Christian fort and the Moorish fortified hisn complex of Al-Andalus for his inspiration.\\" I KNEW Gaudi wasn't born, but fashioned out of pipe cleaners and lizard scales, up on the slopes of Tibidabo! Van Hensbergen apparently believes that it's enough to mention the actual referent of \\"built\\" in the previous sentence: Bellesguard.But my all-time favorite comes in the third line of the book: \\"Gaudi, Barcelona and Catalonia were, and still are, eternally intertwined.\\" For sheer malapropist grace, that one is hard to beat. He means \\"integrally intertwined,\\" of course. He just doesn't care enough about words to notice that \\"eternally\\" and \\"were, and still are\\" are mutually exclusive. But look at the economy of that oxymoron! The verbs give us the localized temporal reference, which is contradicted by the universalized adverb. And look at the cumulative effect of the verbs: WERE (and are no longer), and STILL ARE (for a while). He could have written \\"have always been eternally intertwined,\\" but he didn't. It would have been much less powerful that way. The book isn't just badly written. Here and there it reveals a ubiquitous FLAIR for bad writing. (See, I tried to replicate van Hensbergen's oxymoron with spatial reference, and didn't do it nearly as well!)The fair thing to say about van Hensbergen's atrocious writing is that he's Dutch, so give him a break. YOU try and write a book in a foreign language, Mr. Reader from Buffalo, see how far YOU get! The real culprits here are the editorial staff at HarperCollins. This isn't exactly a fly-by-night publishing operation. They should hire copyeditors to fix the kind of absurdities van Hensbergen's book is full of. But they're so busy saving money that they don't care. The book reads like van Hensbergen's first draft -- as if nobody else ever looked at it before it was typeset.Still, I have to disagree with the reader from Buffalo on the book's ultimate value. True, we need more books on Gaudi. But this one is still useful, especially for someone like me who is planning a novel on Gaudi. Every other book available on Gaudi in English is 200 color plates and a brief and fairly pious biography; van Hensbergen has done an enormous amount of research into Gaudi's LIFE. And yes, you have to laugh or grit your teeth at the bad English, but it is pure unadulterated Romantic genius-worship to claim with the Buffalo reader that \\"an understanding of Catalanism with its piety, spiritualism, chauvinist patriotism and family values,\\" while \\"helpful to understanding Gaudi's life,\\" is \\"not essential to appreciating his work. Antoni Gaudi was a genius. Works of genius communicate themselves. That is all you really need to know admire and love Gaudi's designs.\\"If you are determined to treat Gaudi as an untouchable genius whose life is irrelevant to his work, don't read this book. If you kind of enjoy discovering that artistic geniuses are actually human, and fallible, and not a little neurotic, and if you aren't too fastidious with the English language, it's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"I recently finished two architectural biographies, Gijs Van Hensbergen's volume on Antoni Gaudi, and Libeskind's book on himself. Neither is especially well-written (Libeskind's is especially dull), but the situation begged comparison. In Van Hensbergen's hands, Gaudi comes across (like his architecture) as generous and spirited, whereas Libeskind (who chose to write about himself) comes across as self-centered and disrespectful. Gaudi's life was spiritually motivated and this was reflected in his deeply moving architecture; Libeskind also pontificates, but it doesn't ring true, and when I was told he used another architect to design his home, it made me wonder how sincere he really is about the ideas he sells to clients. Gaudi was a quiet, humble and modest man; Libeskind is a braggart who writes about developers, other architects and even his clients, with venom and disdain. Gaudi's architecture remains popular a century later; much of Libeskind's work is hated before it is built. I would like to have known Gaudi, but by the end of Libeskind's book, I feel glad not to have met this petty and selfish man. Van Hensbergen's account, despite its flaws, is a welcome addition to the limited accounts of Gaudi's life that are available in English. It is also a refreshing read about a time when architecture was a civic art and beautification for a common good was the norm. Libeskind's book is the worst kind of indulgent self-promotion and I could not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"This book is all over the place, jumping from Gaudi's life to Spain's history, to his contemporaries, his eccentricities, his architecture and back through it all again. While there is good information to be gained about the man and the architect in this biography, reading it is like panning for gold.This is the first biography I have read on Antoni Gaudi. I don't regret reading the book, but I can't help but think that there must be a better biography of this great architect.If you do read Van Hensbergen's book, I recommend that you have beside you a copy of \\"Gaudi Complete Works\\" by Isabel Artigas. \\"Complete Works\\" focuses on Gaudi's architecture and contains excellent photographs of his buildings. The photos in \\"Gaudi A Biography\\" will not make you aware just how rich, enormous, detailed, organic and important the work of Antoni Gaudi is and always will be."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"This book is phenomenal.

I thought this book was going to prepare me with some incite on Gaudi's character and what was going through his mind and life during the construction of his iconic work. However, Hensbergen's biography reads more like a architectural school essay than a look into the man that was Gaudi. It was confusing, it jumped around way too much, and failed to give me the experience I was looking for. I recommend seeing these genius structures in person, they will speak to you far more than this book ever did for me."},{"Title":"Gaudi","review":"To my mind, this biography is suitable only for the Young Adult audience. As anything else, it lacks---to the point of seriously frustrating the reader---background, detail, nuance, explication, sweep, and insight. Its views, pronouncements, and coverage are static, truncated, and simplistic, and the \\"narrative\\" choppy in the extreme. There are references---such as to Llull, Schopenhauer, and others---that are facile and, where it would make sense, completely undeveloped. There are references that come out of the blue---such as to Havelock Ellis. Mr. Hensbergen I believe knows his stuff, but all in all this bio reads like a term paper written by a clever sophomore. It is not, for instance, Nicholl on Da Vinci or Robb on Caravaggio or Gibson on Dali to name a few recent biographies of creative souls."},{"Title":"Cross-stitch Patterns for Mother Goose's Words of Wit and Wisdom","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books of cross-stitch charts!Interestingly, I first saw the book \\"Mother Goose's Words of Wit and Wisdom\\" in an elementary school library.

I teach macroeconomics to undergraduates, and hope to find a way of using this book as an important supplement to conventional texts.Stein gives us a history of fiscal and monetary policy from the Depression to the first Reagan term. The third edition claims to be updated to the start of the Clinton administration, but this simply means that Stein has added a few articles he'd written for the AEI or for the Wall Street Journal. Essentially, though, the book's story ends in about 1983, with most emphasis being given to the period from 1968. (Stein was at one point chairman of Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors.)It sounds, then, as though &quot;Presidential Economics&quot; has two strikes against it. First, Stein refers to the Reagan administration in the present tense, whereas today's students are impatient with any material more than a couple of years old. It's actually one of my hidden agendas, though, to help students understand that the world hasn't always been as it is today, and that it may well change again tomorrow. Stein's book--indeed, almost any historical treatment--can be used to make this point.The second apparent drawback (at least, to those who share my leftish tendencies) is that Stein is a firm believer in what he calls the &quot;old-time [conservative] religion&quot;. Yet, perhaps because he is so frankly of the right--and, of course, because he writes so well--today's typically conservative student may well find compelling Stein's arguments against Reagan's &quot;economics of joy&quot;. The argument against (certain forms of) supply-side, or perhaps monetarist, positions might be regarded with suspicion coming from someone with progressive pretensions (like me), whereas Stein is more likely to get away with it.Stein's historical treatment allows the instructor to parachute in more technical material at will--the Phillips Curve, perhaps, or ye olde Keynesian Cross--either from a standard text or from the instructor's own notes. In this way the various macro models are given social, even institutional, life, and don't just follow one another as a series of abstractions (as in &quot;if this is Chapter 17 it must be a New Classical position&quot;).The data series used in the text generally end in 1983, but learning how to update them would, in any case, be a useful exercise for the class. I also plan on requiring students to dig up media commentary from, say, the fifties, to compare and contrast it with Stein's narrative. Students must learn that not everything can be found on the web.I've been unable to find any more recent books that cover the last two, post-Stein, decades. I'd even settle for something less fluent and articulate than Stein, if only it wasn't polemic in a narrowly partisan kind of way. So far, though, I've been unable to find anything. (Does anyone have any ideas?) Thus, in putting some flesh on the bones of economic theory--even if, in doing so accessibly, it remains demanding, since economics is never, in that sense, an &quot;easy read&quot;--Stein's book continues to be relevant and useful, even vital."},{"Title":"A Pictorial History of the Fire Engine","review":"This book by Matt Lee is probably the finest book available on the market today about fire engines from the 1920s.

Judaism never proclaimed that God is love. It never proclaimed that God is justice... The teachers of Judaism, knowing man's frailty, taught the love and forgiveness of God. Knowing also man's stubbornness and the frequency of his backsliding, they taught the justice of God and His sure and certain retribution. Social life cannot be constructed on the principle of love alone or on justice alone.\\" (Pg. 124-125)\\"A Jew could question the existence of God ... and go unpunished by any court or any legally constituted authority. It was only the man who cursed God, or who turned to idolatry or led people astray into idolatry... who was subject to the penalty of death.\\" (Pg. 136-137)\\"Judaism could endorse every magnificent word on love which Paul wrote to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 13)...

They point rather vaguely to a conception of higher and selfless ethics in the New Testament. It is difficult to understand why the expectation of rewards for a good life in this world is any more mercenary than the expectation of eternal rewards in the next world. If anything, the former expectation appears to be a far more modest and reasonable return on a relatively limited investment.\\" (Pg. 329)"},{"Title":"Our Mountain State Heritage: West Virginia stories of the people","review":"I enjoyed taking little sips of other West Virginia family's histories as I read through this wonderful book.

It was wonderful to read about him and to learn the history of that special farm house where I spent so many delightful weekends as a child."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"To be sure, this book does not follow Dickens' normal formula. If you only want to read Dickens' finest books that show his best talents, you may do better to stick with books like &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; or &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; All of that aside, I can not understand why this never gained the same popularity as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which also shows a departure from Dickens' standard formula). The opening is quite captivating and the images are well painted. Right away Dickens grabs our attention with the mysterious 'dead man' (who will later prove to be a VERY significant live person). Like Dickens' other villains, Chester is very wicked, but he carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Geoffrey Haredale is a captivating figure who APPEARS cold, but he proves himself to be quite virtuous. Although we don't really get to know Emma and Dolly that well, they do grab our attention at times. Mary (Barnaby Rudge's mother) is memorable as a (widowed?) woman who does her best for her son and displays her fears dramatically. The 'dead man' reappears every now and then to keep us in suspense. The conversations between Ned and his father Chester are quite memorable. Varden is fine in his secondary but significant role. Barnaby is not exactly Dickens' most memorable protagonist, but he does portray someone caught in the middle fairly well. One thing Dickens does quite well is that he first draws personal disputes over religion, and then he draws civil riots over religious differences. Some memorable lines are also present: (&quot;I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands,&quot; &quot;May he die a violent death as I do now and have the night wind as his only mourner.&quot;). The final fight between Chester and Haredale is a fitting conclusion for this excellent work. So we have a great combination of drama, suspense, horror, and even some comedy. My only complaints about this are that I feel some more time could have been spent on the 'dead man' in developing his character and explaining his actions, and I do miss the filial piety that is prevalent in other novels of Dickens. I do not feel that this represents Dickens' best efforts; but it is FAR from his worst creation. This is every bit as good as the popular &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"When one says &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; and &quot;historical novel&quot; in the same sentence, the immediate impression is of the French Revolution adventure &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. But Dickens wrote another historical novel 18 years before, in 1841, the complex and colorful &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, set during London's anti-Papal riots of June 1780, when there was a reaction against the Catholic influence in Parliament. Populated by a large cast and activated by a plot of intrigue and danger, it is one of the best of Dickens in his early period. In fact, it is perhaps Dickens' most under-rated work. As usual with Dickens, the characters find themselves in a labyrinth of relationships. Sir John Chester is an impoverished habitu&eacute; who tells his handsome son he expects the young man to insure the family fortune in the time-honored tradition of decadent nobility: by marrying money. &quot;With regard to our circumstances, Ned, you may set your mind at rest upon that score. They are desperate.&quot; His son is appalled, the more so as he is in love with Emma, the daughter of a country gentleman, Geoffrey Haredale, Sir John's moral opposite. Running parallel to this love story is that of Joe Willet, the good-hearted son of John Willet, the proprietor of the Maypole Inn, where much of the action takes place. Joe is courting the daughter of Gabriel Varden, an honest, hard-working locksmith, a proletarian hero. (Originally he was the book's title character.) Gabriel's daughter Dolly, Joe's inamorata, is one of those human cookies so adored by Victorian England. (All through the 19th Century articles of clothing were named after her: the Dolly Varden bonnet, the Dolly Varden cape, etc.) Touching these families is Barnaby Rudge himself, a strange, simple-minded boy whose navet&eacute; leads him into joining the rebellion led by the Protestant radical Lord George Gordon, who also appears as a minor character. Barnaby's constant companion is a talking raven; their conversations sound like vaudeville routines. His mother hides one of those dark family mysteries Dickens used so suspensefully in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;; and this theme is reflected in Sir John Chester's secret: he is the illegitimate father of ... the story's least likely character. The novel is filled with Dickensian trademarks: ironic drama, an odd sense of humor, and, of course, strong sentimentality. With the bloody Gordon riots as a climax, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, elaborate and absorbing, is an impressive predecessor to Dickens' better-known tale of the Reign of Terror."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Admittedly a lesser known work by Dickens, I found it a great read. Sure, it's a bit slow in the early chapters, but what part of any Dickens work doesn't have its moments. The cast of characters is diverse, as usual, and bring different social circumstances to the Gordon Riots in 1780 England. The chapters devoted to the Riot itself are packed with action that kept me reading far past my normal quitting time. More importantly, Dickens paints a vivid picture of both religious persecution and the irrational and unpredictable quality of a widespread riot. With brief references to the War for Independence, the novel serves as a solid insight into some of the thinking that led our Founding Fathers to enshrine fundamental liberties in the Bill of Rights.The academic review that precedes the novel is a waste of time for any reader for enjoyment and a perfect example of the horrid quality of writing in academia today. The reviewer needs to spend less time assembling critical comment and spend some time learning how to write like Dickens."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge is one of Charles Dickens' lesser known and read novels--and that's a pity. The book is interesting, full of the kind of characters that Dickens is noted for, and full of action and exciting scenes. More significantly, it is one of his most thought provoking works, with a relevance that is applicable to today's world. It will leave you cheering for the good guys and grateful to see that the bad guys (and gals) get what coming to them. The book is divided cleanly into two parts, the first taking place in 1775, depicts the comings and goings of four families and their assorted relations and friends. The second occurs five years later and focuses on an historical event, the riots which shook London to oppose rights for Catholics.The book begins at the Maypole, an inn located just outside London and presided over by John Willet, a pompous know-it-all who intimidates his friends and dominates his son, Joe, to the point that he leaves to join the army by the end of this part. Hugh, an uneducated and violent man works for Willet handling animals. Down the road is the residence of Geoffrey Haredale, a country gentleman, and his niece Emma, a beautiful and gracious girl. Her father was mysteriously killed 22 years previously and the mystery runs through the book. Haredale is a Catholic and an antagonist to John Chester, an oily, Machiavellian, highly ambitious character. The only thing the two men have in common is their mutual desire to keep Chester's son Edward from a romance with Emma. In this they succeed and Edward, too, leaves at the end of part 1. The third household contains the Varden family. Gabriel, the father, is a locksmith kindly and a moderating influence throughout the book. Ultimately he plays a hero's role. His wife, Martha, constants nags him, aided and abetted by their servant, Miss Miggs, a comical character given to hysterics. Their daughter, Dolly, is beautiful and vivacious, but flirtatious and at this point does not return the love that Joe Willet shows for her. Simon Tappertit, an apprentice to Mr. Varden, also resides there. He is a ridiculous person with an exaggerated sense of himself and the clandestine leader of a group of similar apprentices with designs on engaging in violence against their masters. Finally there is the residence of the title character, Barnaby Rudge, who is a mentally deficient but happy and charming young man. He lives in genteel poverty with his mother. Mr. Rudge, who was the steward to the murdered Mr. Haredale, was also allegedly a victim. The cast of characters interacts in typical Dickens fashion for the first 33 (of 80) chapters.The scene and mood shifts abruptly in the second part which gives a detailed and graphic account of the so-called \\"anti-popery\\" riots that took place in London in 1780. The reader would do well to read an independent account of these events before reading Dickens' version. The above cast of characters is joined in part two by an additional group including some from actual life (Lord George Gordon, the instigator of the riots and Ned Dennis, one of the ringleaders to name but two). The riots bring out the best and the worst of all the characters. Barnaby is conned into joining the rioters and ends up in prison condemned to be hanged, the Maypole Inn is sacked and John Willet, humiliated, bound and gagged, the Haredale residence is set ablaze and Emma and Dolly taken prisoner, many houses are burned, people killed, Newgate prison is broken into, destroyed and all the prisoners released. The riots end with a harrowing scene is which dozens of people are burned to death by flaming alcohol.The execution scene, where three of the \\"ringleaders\\" are to be hanged is one of the most powerful parts of the book. Dickens gives a vivid account of the conditions and circus atmosphere that surrounds this event. In Hugh's powerful and eloquent speech Dickens also gives a condemnation of British society that creates such persons. Hugh at this point is the most moral person in the book and goes to his death with bravery and courage. This scene alone is well worth reading the book for.In the end, of course, everything is sorted out, justice is delayed but not denied and we have a happy ending.If the book can be said to suffer it is from the lack of a strong central character around whom the plot revolves. There is no real hero here or even a singular villain. Joe and Edward, either of whom might have filled the former role are largely absent from much of the book and only show up again after the riots have ended. Gabriel Varden comes closest to that role but is more acted upon than actor until the closing chapters. The most likely candidate for villain, John Chester, likewise disappears at the end of part one. Hugh, Simon and Dennis emerge as a trio of rouges joined by Gashford, secretary to Lord Gordon and a blind man who cries plaintively, why must I be good just because I am blind? The murderer, of course, is also lurking around. But none of these individuals stands apart from the rest and the hero versus villain theme is muted. The book is really about events and how these events shape and change the life of the characters for better or worse.In the end you will find yourself thinking about Barnaby Rudge for days afterward and it will leave a mark on your life. Nothing more positive can be said about any book."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is the last of all the Dickens's novels (including the five shorter Christmas Books) that I have either read or attempted. I had saved it until the last because it has not been held in very high esteem either by the critics or the reading public. I was pleasantly surprised.Whereas there are several Dickens novels that I was unable to finish (namely, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, Little Dorrit, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and all the Christmas Books except A Christmas Carol), Barnaby Rudge never dragged even though it is one of Dickens's longer novels. Barnaby Rudge is as filled with memorable characters (especially the secondary ones - Miss Miggs, the Vardens, the Chesters, Hugh, Mr. Tappertitt, Dennis the hangman, etc.); places (the Maypole Inn, the locksmith's shop) and incident (the Gordon Riots) as any of his greater novels.Stylistically, Barnaby Rudge is akin to Dickens's earlier picaresque novels (Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby). After those early successes of the 1830s, Dickens was struggling to find his mature style in my opinion. Most of the longer and shorter novels I was unable to finish come from the 1840s. (The Mystery of Edwin Drood is Dickens's last novel, but it was only half-finished at his death so it is really not fair to blame Dickens for my failure to respond to it.) Even though The Old Curiosity Shop comes between Nicholas Nickelby and Barnaby Rudge, Barnaby Rudge demonstrates all the strengths of Nicholas Nickelby and avoids the weaknesses of The Old Curiosity Shop. Barnaby Rudge is still early Dickens in my opinion.G. K. Chesterton described a taste for early Dickens as similar to a taste for new potatoes as opposed to mature potatoes. Some people prefer new potatoes. Barnaby Rudge is not Dickens at his greatest. (I reserve that description for David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Bleak House. Along with the three novels of the 1830s already mentioned, I place Hard Times, A Tale of Two Cities and Our Mutual Friend and now, Barnaby Rudge, on the second tier of Dickens's novels.) We must remember, that Dickens at his worst is better than most writers at their best. If Barnaby Rudge were a newly discovered work by an otherwise unknown author, or by one of Dickens's contemporaries, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. As it is, Barnaby Rudge is an eminently enjoyable and readable effort by a great writer."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time after about twenty years. Dickens is a writer to be read slowly so that you can enjoy the feast of language, atmosphere, characters and plot. If its not Dickens' greatest, so what?"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I began to read Charles Dickens when I was in my teen years. There is very few authors with such incite in to human character, and the ability to paint a scene that puts our current crop of authors to shame. The present day secular media from film, and books can never compete with a genius for the true art of literature. There are some authors today that might present a popular novel but they usually fall flat and unfulfilling once the book is read. There are always a few whose talent trancend politics, sensuality, and sensationalism. When you get tired of popularism Dickens is the author that fills your mind with memorable scenes and characters who go beyond the present politically correct novel. Dickens brings to life the morality, nobleness, and virtues that an author who lives beyond his century passes on. This novel is one of those that will be one that you will read again, maybe even more than a couple of times. G.K. Chesterton wrote the most profound and honest critisms of Dickens works. I suggest reading Chesterton for incite into Dickens. Barnaby Rudge could be a good start for a reading habit of honestly absorbing and entertaining literature. Put Patterson or Clancy aside and learn to enjoy the talent that will out live both of them."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Dickens' first historical fiction, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is not a big favorite either with Dickens fans or with critics, largely because of its curious lack of the divinely memorable characters for which Dickens is usually known. (There are some good characters, but not the all-star cast we come to expect from the master.) Be this as it may, there's no denying that the buildup and eruption of the Gordon riots in London offer us some of Dickens' most compelling writing. Once the riots finally begin, they sweep us along in a torrent of demonic energy that is suitably appalling to the reader. For this reason, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is certainly worth reading. Even &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; does not conjure the same breathless chaos as &quot;Rudge&quot; does. Also, though it is one of Dickens' earlier books, it has much more evidence of structured planning than do more improvised works such as &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop.&quot; Dickens would not truly master the art of creating a well-rounded novel in serial installments until &quot;Dombey and Son,&quot; but he is clearly on the right track here."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This work by Dickens takes the factual events of the &quot;No Popery&quot; riots of 1780's London,England and uses them as a backdrop for a dozen or so of Dicken's most colorful and well contrasted characters and combines with them a plot that includes a long unsolved murder. The reader can expect the usual thoroughly desciptive scenes, long a hallmark of his writing style, and characters that seem to come to life,jumping as it were, right from the very page. It is a pleasure,not a chore, to read Barnaby Rudge."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"For someone whose favourite literary period is the 19th Century, I have a confession to make. I am 43 years old (young!) and Barnaby Rudge is the first Charles Dickens novel I have ever been able to finish. I had previously made attempts on Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Great Expectations and Hard Times and never got passed more than a couple of chapters in any one of them. Perhaps it was due to having hitherto had many great expectations and more than a few hard times? Who knows?!When I saw that The Complete Works of Charles Dickens was available on Kindle for less that 2.00 I downloaded it and was then left with the decision as to which of his novels I should try first. I went for Barnaby Rudge as I liked the name. Simple as that. I knew nothing about the book, not even, as it transpired, the length of it. That's one of the negative points of reading a book on Kindle - particularly when it is part of a collection. It was only after reading it for a month or so that I decided to check out the length in paperback - 744 pages. For one who had decided to regularly read and post reviews I guess a novel of such length was not a good choice. But by that time, it was too late to stop reading, not least because I was absolutely in love with the book.So where to begin? Barnaby Rudge was apparently scheduled to be Dickens' first published novel but due to various issues including a change of publisher it was originally published in weekly installments from February 1841 to November 1841 in a magazine he edited called Master Humphrey's Clock. By all accounts it is not renowned as being one of his best and there have only been two attempts to dramatise it - once in a 1915 silent movie and again in an early 1960's TV serialisation. To be honest, had I known of these facts before, I would still have chosen it to be the first of his novels I would read all the way through. I do love an underdog!For me, the novel felt like I was engaged in three different art forms. The first third is like wandering around an art gallery, taking in the scenes, observing a time where the world was slower, less intense. The second is like watching an action film - fast paced, frantic, disturbing and entirely enthralling. The final third is akin to watching a series of vignettes on stage - the resolution of each of the many plot strands. This one man audience applauded and left the theatre sighing and fulfilled.The central theme of the novel is how people cope when faced with emotional conflict - whether that be thwarted love, a lusting for a higher station in life, a desire for money or a desire for power. The first third of the novel sets up the conflicts and the central third imposes the incredible anarchy initiated (somewhat unknowingly it must be said) by Lord Gordon's attempts to rail against the Papist Act of 1778. Each of the main characters are caught up in the riots and each is changed by the way they decide to react to them. As you would expect, there are heroes and villains, deceit, wonder and disaster. The description of the riots is absolutely stunning and I could not help but think of the riots in London last year. Over 200 years separates each event yet Charles Dickens' account far exceeds anything I read in any newspaper a year ago. I was moved, appalled and entirely dumbstruck by the connection. I defy anyone not to react in a similar way.The structure of Barnaby Rudge reminded me of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo (1862) - the extensive scenes depicting the Battle of Waterloo substituting the Gordon Riots; and the character of Miggs was very redolent of Miss Clack in The Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins. Other than A Tale of Two Cities, Barnaby Rudge was the only novel Charles Dickens wrote that wasn't set in the 19th Century and there is a feeling of nostalgia in it that perhaps is hard to feel about his 19th Century novels. I have recently begun reading Nicholas Nickleby so I can certainly attest to the fact that his anger against the education system, capitalism and greed is certainly not depicted with any form of sentiment!So overall, having read Barnaby Rudge, I am full of awe, admiration, joy and humility. William Blake is my ultimate literary hero - Charles Dickens, even after having just read one of his novels (a largely forgotten one at that) is already running him a close second."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I'm a little chagrined to admit that this was the first work by Dickens I'd ever read (no, not even \\"Christmas Carol'), but I'm thrilled to say that I loved the book. I went in, not knowing anything about the novel..I'd never even heard of it, which is why I picked it..and was immediately drawn to the characters and the complex, swirling plot. The history of the period..of which I must honestly admit I was aware, beforehand..made the book even more fascinating.This Dickens guy: he has a bright future ahead of him."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I must agree with a number of other reviewers here...don't start your reading of Dickens with this one, but once you start, you need to add this one to your list. This is not one of Dickens' most noted works, but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer. I had the pleasure (?) of first reading this one in a volume, years ago, which was printed in the late 1800s and which was printed for mass distribution. Fine print, two columns per page, printing all the way to the page edge...you get the picture. That was years ago...I am too old to even see the print now, much less read it, but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that I can afford a nicer copy. The work can be criticized, with some justification, for being a bit wordy, but for my taste, that is one of the charms of the novel. It certainly fits the times and the style of the times. Recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the Dickens thing."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Let me open with a quote from the book:&quot;On the skull of one drunken lad -- not twenty, by his looks -- who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white hot; melting his head like wax.&quot;You think Edgar Allen Poe to be the king of horror? Meet the author who far surpasses him in making flesh creep and cringe, in this book more than most. In Barnaby Rudge, Dickens portrays the Gordon Riots, a violent anti-Catholic outburst in London in 1780, supposedly started by the opposition by Lord Gordon to some acts in Parliament which would've relieved some of the burdens of Catholic citizens: the right to directly inherit property and the right to educate their children in England. As usual, Dickens ignores the political pressures, likely brought about by the French allying themselves with the Americans in their colonial war, which would've stirred up suspicions of Anglo-Catholics being in league with the French.In any case, I can see why this book has never matched the popularity of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, as there is no possibility for heroes in scenes of mob violence. Even those who refuse to cooperate with the rioters can do little more than resist. Locksmith Gabriel Varden, being forcibly brought to Newgate prison, refuses to pick the lock for the masses of rowdy men intending to free their comrades and anyone else locked inside; however, his resistence means little as the mob decides to burn down the door instead. Mr. Haredale is often defiant, but he can do little more than beat a retreat when faced by hundreds of belligerent men. None of this &quot;'Tis a far, far better thing...&quot; kind of statement which can be made.Ignore the plot lines. They are cursory, even for Dickens. They are there merely to set up the characters and their own personal motivations so one can see what happens to them when all order dissolves. I could see why the English of Dickens' day may have not wanted to read this book -- it was far too scary, especially as Dickens portraying the fuel to the rioters' fire being the primal urges to destruction and looting. Though there was then (in 1841) a better policing force and better prisons, there still was the unbearable poverty and dissipation alive in London. Then, as now, there were plenty ripe to take advantage of any opportunity to set fire to the town. Think the actions in here too far-fetched for even these times? Consider the fires, destruction, and looting that start in any modern city, once rioters have been given an opening.People are crushed underfoot, men are consumed by the very fires they had set, and decent people stand by because they are powerless in the face of the massive wave of violence. Dickens shirks not one detail. If you're thinking of a quaint Victorian period piece, for crying out loud, don't read this book! Go read Pickwick Papers or Old Curiosity Shop. However, if you enjoy this kind of disaster, by all means, read Barnaby Rudge (or might I suggest Hard Times, which has some pretty horrific deaths)."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is a review of the BBC Radio dramatization version of this book.The story is a good one, filled with politics of religion, sympathetic characters and Dicken's inimitable prose.However, this audio version is WAY over produced, with blaring, overly-dramatic music that seemed reminiscent of the worst grade B silent films.The actors screamed, ranted, raved and wept hysterically more than they spoke. Unless someone already knows the basic plot and characters, they may have difficulty following the action (particularly, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the thick accents will be hard for Americans to decipher.).The entire production needed to be toned down quite a bit for Dicken's voice to be heard above the clamor.It might be better to read the book in this case."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I am a Dickens fan.

Speaking of which, there were entirely too many villains, and they got a bit difficult to keep straight!That being said, when the book did pick up, I found it very difficult to put down. Dickens develops this terrifying, fixating painting of mob mentality. The fire, the attacks on the prison are truly gripping. I just wish we could have gotten to the interesting parts a bit sooner. :)"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Considering it's lack of prominence in Dickens' catalogue, \\"Barnaby Rudge\\" proved a surprisingly good read. A clear-eyed and somewhat personal look at the Gordon Riots, it lacks the idealisation of events and characters that pervades his other historical work, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" - and is the better for it. Certainly a book that for readability if nothing else deserves more attention."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"It surprises me that this is actually one of the lesser known works of Dickens. The truth is that this book displays some of Dickens's strongest writing. We start with some people recalling the horrible murder on 'the 19th of March.' (Undoubtedly, the Ides of March from Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\" was revolving in Dickens's head.) These characters talk of Geoffrey Haredale and his niece Emma. (Emma's father and Geoffrey's brother was the murder victim on 'the 19th of March.')Throughout the story, Dickens maintains the tone of suspense with the fear and presence of the 'dead man.' Perhaps one of the greatest things about this book is that at first Dickens talks of hatred between religions on a personal level, and then it is brought to a massive level. Well, Geoffrey Haredale and John Chester meet, and we can see that they DO NOT like each other. But they do agree that they don't want John's son to marry Geoffrey's niece Emma. So they will work together to prevent it. Haredale and Chester display yet another aspect of Dickens's writing. Dickens knows how to prevent characters from being either 100 % likable or detestable. (Unlike Hollywood!) Haredale is cold, uptight, and stern, but he is virtuous. Chester is vain, self serving, and dishonest. But he carries a charm that makes him likable in spite of this.Well, we soon learn that John Chester and his son are not too fond of each other. Though especially with modern goals, it is hard to disagree with John Chester when he says: \\"All men are fortune hunters.\\" Later, Gabriel Varden's daughter is grabbed by Maypole. (Eventually we learn that Maypole is John Chester's illegitimate son.) His actions would seem to indicate a relationship to John Chester.Later, we learn that the 'dead man' is Barnaby Rudge's father. He makes a visit to Mary (Barnaby's mother). She is frightened of him, but she does provide some relief. Later, Haredale suspects that the man who killed his brother may not be so far away. Moving on, Chester and Haredale succeed in preventing the marriage they wanted to stop, though Haredale does regret the dishonesty involved. This is followed by the complete alienation of John Chester and his son Edward. (Though if we think the thing about keeping people of different religions or from certain families from marrying is a thing of the past, we should THINK AGAIN!)Moving on, a huge Protestant rally begins to form with the intent of destroying Catholic property. (So, Dickens has shown us religious bigotry on a personal level, and then he raises it to a massive level. Good job Charles!) Maypole decides to join this rally. Well, we once again meet Mary and Barnaby. They are visited by a blind man, and it doesn't take much for us to know who the blind man is friends with. (Rudge Sr.)Mary and Barnaby see the Protestant rally, and Barnaby being somewhat naive can not resist joining them. (Though we should be aware that getting people to join a dangerous rally with a few simple words that appeal to a primitive instinct is not all that difficult.) Moving on, Gabriel Varden's Dolly and Haredale's niece Emma are kidnapped in the rally. Later, Rudge Sr. is taken by Haredale. (Young Barnaby as well.) Rudge Sr. does express some regret for his past crimes. His blind friend says that all may not be lost. If his wife declares her husband dead (as many people believe)then Rudge Sr. should get off. In an at least partially touching scene, Rudge Sr. and Barnaby meet, and Rudge Sr. reveals that he is Barnaby's father.Later, against his will, Varden is forced to help the prisoners escape. And Barnaby Sr and Jr know freedom once more. Haredale is injured, and he later finds out that Edward Chester helped him. Poor Sr. Rudge finds his wife will not help him, and to make matters worse, his blind friend is killed. Rudge Sr. is understandably in a rage when he sees his former wife, and we can't blame him completely when she essentially left him to be hanged.In a bit of fierce Dickens's comical style, Dennis the Hangman is arrested and is frightened of who his cell mate may be. But peace is made between Maypole and Dennis. (What's the point of fighting when we are all going to hang anyway?) In a redeeming moment, Dennis tells Maypole of his past and who is parents were. One would think Chester would want to make peace with his doomed illegitimate son, but Maypole has outlived his usefulness to John Chester. In a redeeming moment, Maypole says that he would lay down his life willingly if it would save Barnaby. In an articulate line, Maypole goes out with hatred for his father: \\"I leave the wish that he die a violent death as I do now, and have the night wind for his only mourner.\\"In a sad scene, Haredale admits his faults and leaves Edward and Emma free to marry. 2 lovers coming together is usually a happy ending. But in this case, it seems to take a back seat to the sadness of Haredale. Haredale and Chester have their final fight, and Chester does go out in style. Though poor Haredale only lives a short while longer.But all is not dark. Barnaby is reunited with his mother, and his pet bird can speak again. True, \\"Barnaby Rudge\\" is quite different from the popular works like \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"A Tale of two Cities.\\" But in this case some differences turned out to be a great thing! Don't be put off because this is a more obscure work of Dickens. You'll miss out!"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge is an early Dickens novel, his first historical novel, of the Gordon riots of 1780, about fifty years before his time. The book is a mere 634 pages, that is, two thirds as long as Copperfield but a 100 pages longer than The Old Curiosity Shop. One of Dickens' strong points is atmosphere, and this novel is one of his best in that department. His description of the Maypole Inn and its proprietor, slow John, is marvelous. Much of the book describes the riots and their effect on various characters. Barnaby himself is an idiot, but such an excellent character for all that. The villians actually have good qualities in this book. And by the way, the Raven Grip is supposedly the model for Poe's raven. I would not start reading Dickens with Barnaby, but even though it's not as well known as ten other of his novels, I can highly recommend if you like other Dickens to give this book a read. I intend to reread it in my next round of Dickens rereading."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Dickens is one of my favourite authors, and I took up this book simply because I wanted to read all his books. \\"Barnaby Rudge\\", though is a little different than some of Dickens' other works. For one it's about a true historical happening. The riots of 1780 actually did occur. It's one of his shorter books, and it was written earlier on in his career. The book is really not where a reader should start with Dickens' books, but it should be read nonetheless. It still has the same great characterizations and atmosphere that we expect from Dickens, and it's still a good story. Barnaby is quite the character. We have to laugh at his antics, and Slow John at the Maypole Inn is absolutely wonderful. I read this book quite awhile ago, and while I'm writing this review, I'm thinking I need to reread it again. Wonderful atmosphere!"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This is a well paced and fast-moving historical novel set during the anti-popery riots in London in 1780. Although not as grippingly exciting as Dicken's other historical novel, A Tale Of Two Cities, there is plenty of drama here to sustain the reader's interest.The fictional characters are well woven into the historical setting, and the portrayal of these characters gives the book some of its best comic moments, from the suave Edward Chester, to the vengeful Simon Tappertit, to the spiteful Miss Miggs, to the devious hangman, Dennis. The hero of the book is Gabriel Varden, whom Dickens repeatedly describes, rather clumsily, as &quot;the honest locksmith&quot;. Varden has to suffer constant friction in his own household between himself, his wife, his apprentice and his maid, and this agitation reflects the agitation of the masses in the streets.One of the best features of the book is the way it successfully carries a number of plot lines. The main one of these concerns a murder committed many years previously for which no-one has been convicted. There are several other sub-plots such as the tension between the Catholic Haredale and the Protestant Chester, Joe Willet's love for Varden's daughter, the comical scheming of the apprentice locksmith against his master and the presence of a shadowy stranger who pursues Barnaby Rudge's mother. Some elements of the plot fizzle out a bit too easily towards the end, such as the attempt to kidnap Haredale's daughter, but the overall effect of the book is very satisfying.This is one of Dicken's least remembered novels, but I think it is well worth reading and an excellent introduction to his work."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Having left Dickens until later in life, I just completed Barnaby Rudge as part of my attempt to go through his novels in chronological order, starting with Pickwick. Barnaby Rudge is a very different animal from the 4 prior novels, patterned after it was on the swashbuckling historical style of Scott. It's so different from Old Curiosity Shop, which he was writing at the same time as Barnaby Rudge, that it's hard to believe it's the work of the same author, except for the quality of exceptionally vivid characterizations that pervade all the books.I knew nothing of the historical events upon which the book is based, that, at the time of original publication, were well known to most Londoners, almost as well known as 9/11 is known by contemporary New Yorkers. Dickens seemed to have anticipated this problem, as the historical recreation is so beautifully folded into the melodrama that I never felt left behind. DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION as too many plot points were given away and spoiled some of the dramatic impact for this reader. Save the introduction for afterward.The characters are so memorable, it is painful to have to complete the book and say goodbye to them. Especially John Willet, and his double-chin, which almost deserves billing as a character in and of itself, Sir John Chester, a poetic achievement to whom Oscar Wilde and Shaw owed enormous debts, Maypole Hugh, and Grip the Raven (from whom Poe got his idea for the poem \\"The Raven), are high water marks of achievement.While I preferred some of the intensely personal, experimental style of the latter half of Oliver Twist and much of Old Curiosity Shop, the confident and bold tone of the narration in Barnaby is a shot of adrenaline in every chapter, and the power of description in Dicken's cinematic viewpoint is incredibly powerful and pulse-poundingly entertaining, while the whole time maintaing a savvy, but never cynical outlook when it comes to the socio-political themes.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Focused primarily on the \\"anti-popery\\" riots in London in1780, and filled with wild scenes of carnage involving a large cast of characters from all levels of society, Barnaby Rudge is Dickens's first historical novel, and it includes the real Lord George Gordon, a virulent anti-Catholic who whipped the populace into a frenzy. The author sets the scene for the tumult by first painting a picture of quiet village society in Chigwell in 1775, five years earlier, often using humor to depict the numerous characters.Geoffrey Haredale, a Catholic, has inherited the estate of his brother Reuben, who was murdered twenty-two years before. He has brought up his niece Emma, who is in love with the kindly Edward Chester, a Protestant, the son of the odious Lord John Chester, who lives nearby. Dozens of characters populate the book--including Barnaby Rudge (the developmentally disabled son of Mary Rudge, who works on an estate), the Willetts (who run the Maypole Inn), Gabriel Varden (a locksmith) and his daughter Dolly (who eventually works for Emma Haredale), mysterious strangers, ghosts, a sinister blind man, and even Grip, Barnaby's talking raven.The action takes off when the time shifts from 1775 to 1780, and the focus changes from village life and the sometimes amusing domestic concerns of the people to the growing anti-Catholic sentiment being stirred up in London. The humor, which has been a big part of the first part of the book, ends, and Dickens concentrates on the growing hatred and the battles spawned by that hatred, with good people being drawn into brutality that they would otherwise avoid. Violence and several deaths take place, the populace becomes a mob, and rioting leads to the burning of properties. The love stories, which have been a large part of the first section of the book, are put on the back burner for the major part of the book.Written in 1841, this is Dickens's fifth novel, one which suffers from its original serialization and loss of focus. Though the atmosphere and some of the characters rank among Dickens's best, and some of the humor in the first part is delightful, the tone is inconsistent, changing with the riots and ensuing action. As is always the case with Dickens, all mysteries are cleared up at the end, with Reuben Haredale's murder solved and the whereabouts revealed of several characters who disappeared between 1775 and 1780. With hints of some of the greatness to come, this novel precedes David Copperfield, Bleak House, and A Tale of Two Cities, and shows Dickens experimenting with his themes and ideas. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This book is probably the most overlooked of Dickens' major efforts. It lacks the silly slapstick and joy of Pickwick Papers, and is missing the biting social commentary (at least not as biting) of Little Dorrit and Hard Times. Also, it is always listed in the &quot;about the author&quot; section as being somewhat of a commercial letdown at the time.The truth is that it is a great book. It has enough silliness to let you know that it is Dickens, but is accompanied by a good bit of darkness. In fact, it's almost macabre at times.In the end, this is a great story from a master storyteller. Isn't this the true benchmark of a classic? For all the ingenius stylism of &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; would we love it half as much (if at all) if the styling didn't accent a most captivating tale? Well, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is just that....a thoroughly captivating tale in the classic Dickens style."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I had read most of the Dickens novels, some more than once, but I'd always overlooked Barnaby Rudge. When I finally read it I was amazed it had taken me so long. It turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected from the blurb on the book.Like all Dickens' novels, the characters are drawn to show the nature of human beings, and he does it so well, the characters could be set in modern day and the story would still work. We see the shifty lecherous rogue who covets the beautiful young lady, the dedicated hangman, and the patriotic family man. We see troubled family relationships: mother and son, father and daughter, and father and son. Most important of all, we see the title character, a golden-hearted idiot whose simple-minded exuberance makes him a ready-made pawn for the devious and evil manipulators who stand to profit from division and resentment between Catholics and Protestants.Perhaps the most timeless thing about this novel is the willful manufacturing of resentment between the two primary social political groups of the time. You could simply replace the terms Catholic and Protestant with Liberal and Conservative and you'd be telling our modern story. Turn on the nightly news and you will see a modern-day Barnaby Rudge there enthusiastically reciting the talking points of some divisive talk-show host, all the while completely oblivious that he is but a pawn dutifully serving a sinister master. I'm glad I waited until now to read this tale of Dickens because it's such a timely reminder of human impulse toward the mob mentality.Barnaby Rudge is an ever present reminder that if we lose our ability to think to think critically, we our own identity and our values will be consumed to serve the desires of someone else."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This year, 2010, the Riverside, CA Dicken's Festival has selected Barnaby Rudge as its featured work for its weekend-long presentation. In my view, nothing could be more timely.Most people have not read this book which was never as popular as some of Dickens' other novels, such as Oliver Twist or David Copperfield. However, this historical novel of a tragic period in English history of the late 18th century, was early on a project Dickens wanted to present. Work on it predated his widely popular Pickwick Papers, on a much more serious subject.It was the religious riots of 1780, precipitated by an unstable member of the House of Lords, Lord George Gordon, who wanted to suppress catholicism, even among members of his own monied class. The cause of \\"No Popery\\" was taken up by mob rule which resulted in a horrendous amount of death and loss of property among all the people of London, including the burning of Newgate prison, Bedlam, the hospital for the insane, and many houses of rich and poor alike.As in all Dickens books, there is a cause that the author wants to present and explore. And this one seems to be an analysis of how mob rule occurs and how people who have little factual information destroy and disrupt both the rule of law and the faculty of common sense. If this were only a historical condition, the novel might be of interest. But, we can easily see how today around the world, the incitement of a few with dubious motives can destroy and disorient the lives of the many. Find a discussion group and read it together!"},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This book was not popular when published, the fault of \\"too much of a good thing\\" coming too quickly from the unstoppable pen of the young superstar author. But, please! Ignore the critics of the last 150 years, and just read Barnaby Rudge. I've read 11 of Dickens' major novels, working my way through the catalogue in chronological order. To my tastes, this little sleeper of a book contends well for top spot, right alongside his more famous larger brothers, like Pickwick and Dombey. When I grow up, I want to be like Gabriel Varden -- a man \\"terrifying in his integrity.\\""},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge (1841)originally appeared as a weekly serial in Dickens'weekly newspaper Master Humphrey's Clock. The novel is the most obscure work by the master. The story is well worth reading. It is an exciting story of the Anti-Roman Catholic riots of 1780 led by the eccentric George Gordon a member of Parliament. The second half of the book focuses on the riots in a cinematic depiction of the mobs who ran amok in London during a hot summer of hatred, prejudice and murder.Character rather than complicated Victorian plot is why we read Dickens. This book adds many memorable folks to the gallery of Dickenscharacters. In this long novel we meet:Barnaby Rudge-the title character is a feeble witted lad whose pet is the famed raven Grip. He lives with his mother. We later learn his evil father Rudge Sr. murdered Lord Haredale's brother. The father is hanged but Barnaby lives to spend time at the Maypole Inn. Years before Dostoevsky's novel \\"The Idiot\\" Dickens took a mentally ill person as his hero. Barnaby is pardoned for his participation in the Gordon riots.Gabriel Varden, his shrewish wife and buxom daughter Dolly live in London where Mr. Varden is a locksmith. After Joe Willet leaves England to fight in the American Revolution he returns home to wed Dolly. A charming love story.The Haredale family tells us of the love of Mr. Haredale's beautiful nieceEmma for Edward the son of John Chester. Chester is a Protestant and a sworn enemy of the Catholic Haredales.Minor charactes such as Hugh (the illegitimate son of Chester); Dennis the hangman; Miss Miggs the man crazy maid to Mrs. Varden and others populate the pages of this fast paced tale of murder,mystery and intrigue.Barnaby Rudge is a fine book which deserves to be better known. It is not Dickens best novel,his longest novel or his most famous novel. Yet it still appeals in its exciting look at the events of 1780. It and the much more famous Tale of Two Cities were the two historical novels the author produced.YOu will never forget Grip the Raven (said to be the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\") or Barnaby and his friends and enemies. Curl up with this good book and let your mind and heart wander back to the year of our Lord 1775 when the novel begins.The book is well illustrated by George Cattermole and Hablot K. Brownein charming art work."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I haven't read Dickens since I was a young man and am glad to have begun my reaquaintance by my first reading of Barnaby Rudge. As always, the characters are varied, and spring to life through Dickens's gifts for acute description and memorable dialogue. The plot threads are complex - some admittedly predictable, others full of suspense and surprise. What I appreciate most, however, is the action-packed, central section of the book with its vivid descriptions of the Gordon Riots: terrifying, out-of-control mob violence engendered by religious intollerance. Given the the disasterous effects of rigid religious fundamentalism (across all the major faiths) in the contemporary world, I found this aspect of the novel the most compelling. Add to that the character of the amoral, hypocritical politician Sir John Chester, and we have a work of fiction to remind us that there are lessons to be learned from history. With its relative brevity, compelling ncharacters, and page-turning action sequences, I highly recommend this novel to fans of the author and those new to his oeuvre."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"I've never read Charles Dickens before, outside of having read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in school. I decided, a year or so ago, to read some Dickens and see what I thought. This book wouldn't have hooked me, but I'd already read enough stuff to know that this isn't his best. Though it wasn't that good, there were elements of it that were interesting, and that kept me going long enough that I finished it.Barnaby Rudge is a simple man with a talking crow. His mother looks after him. He lives in a world full of people who are more or less friends, or at least acquaintances. Among these are a tavern keeper and his son, a locksmith and his wife and daughter, the locksmith's apprentice, and the locksmith's maid. The book spends several hundred pages on exposition of these characters, with you getting to know more and more about them as the story progresses. The interplay of the characters, with the author interweaving so many plotlines, is apparently a trademark of Dickens, and he puts it on display here, using it for all it's worth. At about the halfway point of the book the plot begins to form, as one of the secondary characters, a British nobleman named Gordon, decides to foment anti-Catholic sentiment because it will bring him political prominence. Of course riots will result, of course people will be killed, and of course Gordon thinks nothing of this, because he's advancing his political career at the same time. Barnaby and the other central characters in the book are caught up in the riots, and their aftermath, and that forms the main plot of the story.I generally enjoyed this book, but I thought the exposition too long (by modern standards anyway) the plot itself too wordy, and the ending I'm afraid was predictable. What saves the book is the characters. On that logic alone I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"This recording is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place."},{"Title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"The Raven dialog drives this novel.

Plan on reading no more than a chapter a night to absorb this, or you'll start getting foggy from information overload.If you have not faced a contract, this will prepare you for most of what you are likely to be offered, and what you might ask for or change. If you have signed contracts, you may want to kick yourself for not reading this sooner. (I did. One or two light kicks, not bad.) The next contract I go over, with a new agent or not, is going to give me a lot more than the last one. It will also help me double-check my new agent.O wishful beginners, agents are not only not omniscient, they are often looking out more for their interests than for yours. This means that some will try to keep the publishers real happy with them and not push anything you don't demand. If you don't know what to push for or adjust, the agent won't necessarily rock the boat by making suggestions.

He takes very complex, boring legal information and makes it totally accessible.As I read this book, line by line, page by page, I found it an absolute gold mine of information. It covers virtually any situation that could possibly come up in a publishing contract. If you could find an attorney who was willing to give you this much information in person, which is highly unlikely, it would cost you a fortune. That makes this book an incredible bargain that no author can afford to be without, whether contracting your first book or your fiftieth.Even if you have an agent or can afford to hire a top literary attorney to help you look over your publishing contract, you still need to understand what's in that contract yourself. Knowledge is power--and money--when it comes to contracts. Agents and lawyers aren't infallible. And they can't know, if you the client don't know yourself, what sorts of rights that you as a unique individual absolutely would not want to sign away. For example, the rights to your pen name, ownership of your characters if you are writing a series, or making sure it is spelled out in your contract what \\"out of print\\" means for purposes of getting back your rights to a book that a publisher is no longer making any effort to sell.If you only buy one book on literary contracts, make it this one.

Sweet Thunder is the name of a fictional town in the Black Hills bearing a remarkable resemblance to Sturgis. The action -- and, what a lot of it there is! The action centers on events at a motorcycle rally like the one that takes place each summer bringing nearly half a million bike riders to the town of Sturgis, South Dakota where the author makes her home. The characters are various and appealing. Steve Henderson is a New York network TV reporter assigned to cover the rally and ---- wouldn't you know -- he hates motorcycles. Steve's boss pairs him with Cristiana Courtney, an attractive blonde cameraperson. She is from this very same South Dakota town of Sweet Thunder. (It could happen!) I happily grant novelist Hersrud these, and several other coincidences. Experience teaches that life is full of such things; in fact, life's synchronicity is more improbable than any fiction. \\"Sweet Thunder\\" is one great way to experience a motorcycle rally in the quiet of your own home without the heat, crowds, noise, danger or exhaust fumes.

And it may startle detractors to learn that Chan was loosely based on an actual person: the legendary Chang Apana (1887-1933), a Hawaiian police officer of Chinese heritage who preferred a bullwhip to a gun and was noted for his fearlessness in dealing with criminals engaged in the opium trade.In the hands of Biggers, the character emerges as a considerably more thoughtful, more formal personality--and one capable of unraveling elaborate crimes. Originally published in 1932, KEEPER OF THE KEYS would prove to be the sixth and last Chan novel by Earl Derr Biggers, who died a year later. And once more it finds Chan \\"on the mainland,\\" this time at Lake Tahoe, where he has come to investigate the matter of a long-missing child... and finds himself embroiled in the murder of a famous opera singer.In terms of plot, Biggers will never compete with the likes of Christie and Sayers; contemporary readers will also likely find themselves surpressing a smile over Bigger's assumptions in such matters as the nature of color blindness. Even so, and in spite of its occasionally dated quality, Biggers writes with a great deal of charm and dash--and the result is pure entertainment. Fans of the film series will also be interested in this novel's probable influence on such films as CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA and CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO, but this aside Biggers also offers considerable food for thought, particularly in terms of the passage of time, changing codes of behavior, and differing ideas about what it means to be American.Some of this is accidental: in the early 1930s Lake Tahoe was essentially a quiet summer resort, and the state of Nevada was less known for gambling than it was for the relaxed divorce laws that fueled the economy of Reno. Some of it, however, is very much intentional. Several characters in the novel, Chan among them, generally dismiss \\"scientific advances\\" re fingerprints and ballistics--but it will be precisely such advances that give Chan the final proof he requires to solve the murder.Most particularly, however, the novel presents Chan as a man of Chinese birth who has deliberately Americanized himself as much as possible. And in KEEPER OF THE KEYS he confronts another Chinese, Ah Sing, who has refused assimilation and who clings with iron determination to the role of loyal, arrogant, and pidgin-speaking Chinese servant of inflexible caste and code. In doing so, Ah Sing effectively forces Chan to consider the degree to which Chan has abandoned his Asian heritage and the personal cost at which he has done so.As in the other Chan novels, Biggers treats Chan and his other Asian characters with considerable respect; even so, and in spite of five previous Chan novels, he remains more than a little naive about both Asian culture and individuals. Consequently, the novel is also something of a cultural artifact, a glimpse into the way that \\"white America,\\" even at its most enlightened, tended to regard Asians in this period. No less entertaining and readable for that, it is a solid conclusion to the series that created one of the most beloved fictional characters of the 20th Century.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"\\"Man who buries treasure in the snow, forgets that summer is coming.\\" -- Charle ChanCharlie Chan gets his first look at snow in Keeper of the Keys. In another first for the Chinese detective from Honolulu, Hawaii, he will facilitate the flight of someone involved deeply in a murder and it's aftermath. As in all Earl Derr Biggers' fine novels featuring the detective, a little romance can't be far away either, and Charlie facilitates this as well. Reporter Bill Rankin, from Behind that Curtain, a truly fabulous entry in the series, makes a welcome appearance here as well. His arrival becomes less welcome for our favorite sleuth, however, when he inadvertently spills the beans on Chan's somewhat felonious conduct. All this amounts to a wonderful time for the reader, Charlie Chan fans given one more hurrah from the lovable creation of Earl Derr Biggers.On vacation, Charlie gazes on the snow-clad mountains through the train window in awe. The ex husbands of singer Ellen Landini are headed for the same place Charlie is, and soon the snow-capped peaks rising above the blue lake and pines of Dudley Ward's estate will be filled with mystery and murder. Ward has invited Landini, and ex husbands John Ryder, Luis Romano, and Frederic Swan to join him. He hopes, with Charlie's help, to discover if rumors of a son he didn't know he had are true. Landini brings her latest conquest with her, the young Hugh Beaton. Sheriff Holt is immediately taken with his pretty sister, Leslie, and Charlie must keep him focused on the crime when Landini is murdered in the night, as the plane meant for the departure of she and her dog, mask the sound of the shot.Chan helps the young Sheriff Holt in an unofficial capacity, becoming close to his blind father, for whom Charlie comes to have a deep and abiding affection. Not lost on Charlie during the meticulous questioning of everyone's whereabouts in the moments leading up to the crime, is young Holt's blind spot in regards to Leslie Beaton. Constantly reminding him to stay focused on his duty, Chan must fight with himself to do the same, as the evidence against Ah Sing, an old beloved Chinese servant of Ward's, mounts high. It does not help that Sing subtly shows by his actions that he no longer considers Charlie to be a real Chinese, due to his adapting to American ways. This pains Charlie, who has one foot in both worlds.A scarf and other clues point to the murderer being colorblind. It is a seemingly 'essential clue' which proves only to muddle the case further. An unsigned will points to one person, blackmail to another, yet the most damaging clues all lead back to Sing! And what of Michael Ireland, the pilot who once had an affair with Landini and was scorned? Charlie will have a chase through the snow, and send off the bullet in an effort to discover how far it traveled, as the older Holt and he conspire to do the unthinkable. A second murder makes the case take on further urgency. Charlie has no real authority, and is, after all, unofficial. It ain't over till it's over in this one, the mystery and romance wrapped up nicely by Biggers in a satisfying conclusion. This one is quite fun for Charlie Chan fans, and a must if you've missed this one somehow."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"I have read all the books written by Biggers' narrating Charlie's adventures and I am posting this review to all of them in general.Biggers' writing style is unique and easily distinguishable,his characters amusing and very realistic and his star detective (Charlie Chan) one of the most balanced individuals in crime fiction;this guy will make you laugh and he will make you think harder on the values of life,he will praise patience yet he will deliver justice swiftly and effectively,he will be kind and he will be cunning.Having read contemporary as well as older works of crime fiction,I recommend every single one of this books hands down.Just read it!Thank you for reading this review."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"The 1920s and 1930s were the 'Golden Age' of pulp fiction. One of the most popular genres were the mysteries. And one of the most popular fictional characters was Charlie Chan, a Chinese-American detective and the creation of Earl Derr Bigggers. So popular were the Charlie Chan mysteries that Hollywood made many of them into movies. Now Academy Chicago Press has brought out new trade paperback editions for six these time-lost classics for a new and appreciative generation of readers in a numbered series featuring their original pulp paperback covers. Included in this impressive publishing project are: \\"The House Without A Key\\"; \\"The Chinese Parrot\\"; \\"Behind That Curtain\\"; \\"The Black Camel\\"; \\"Charlie Carries On\\"; and \\"Keeper Of The Keys\\". Although each title is available individually, community libraries would be well advised to obtain the entire six volume series for the benefit of their grateful patrons who appreciate well crafted mysteries by a pulp fiction mystery writer who was at the top of his game!"},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"The sixth and last Charlie Chan mystery by Earl Derr Biggers is an unmitigated delight.The plot unfolds with an intriguing scenario. Wealthy and hospitible Dudley Ward gathers together all the ex-husbands of his ex-wife, opera singer Ellen Landini, at his home on Lake Tahoe. Ward is trying to discover the whereabouts of a son he never knew he had until now, kept hidden from him by the capricious star. He thinks the husbands might know something. Charlie Chan has also been invited to help Ward with the inquiry.There are four ex-husbands, including Ward, all of them angry with Landini, who is about to marry a fifth husband, also present, with his sister, at this bizarre gathering.Landini herself arrives on the scene to complete the madness, and is promptly murdered.This book is rich in fun characters, half of them suspects. The French maid is jealous of Landini, who has seduced her husband in the past. The ancient Chinese family servant is always turning up under foot and never knows anything. The handsome young sheriff promptly falls in love with one of the suspects, the sister of the once-future husband.It's all wonderfully complicated, and suspicion shifts with every chapter. Charlie Chan's wise sayings flow generously from the pen of Earl Derr Biggers and are always amusing. I'm very sorry to be finished with the series, and recommend it highly. Earl derr Biggers has created an unforgettable, totally original detective in Charlie Chan, and the books now have a vintage flavor that only increases the reader's pleasure.The new paperback editions by Academy Chicago Publishers are very nicely produced."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"This was the sixth and last book in the Charlie Chan series by Earl Derr Biggers. It is every bit as good as the others, and in some ways (the development of Chan's character and the development of the supporting characters) even better.Set in Lake Tahoe, the story is one of those \\"guests at the house of a wealthy person\\" mysteries that Agatha Christie and others popularized. In this one, a limited number of people are guests of Dudley Ward. Among the guests are his ex-wife, singer Ellen Landini. Ward was her first husband as well as her first ex. Husbands numbers two and three are also present, as is husband number four, from who Landini is seeking a divorce. Charlie is astonished when he learns that Landini has been married four times. When Landini is murdered -- shot while a plane is flying overhead, so that its roar drowns out the report of the pistol -- Charlie feels he must solve the case.Hindering Charlie at every turn is 78-year-old Ah Sing, Ward's servant. It is he who is \\"the keeper of the keys\\" and fiercely loyal to the Ward family. Ah Sing makes sarcastic remarks about the police and about Charlie, whom he considers too Americanized to really be Chinese. In the middle of the night Ah Sing, climbing the stairs in the dark, is punched by somebody. Charlie tells him: \\"Aged men should not consort with ruffians. Eggs should not dance with stones.\\"Through questioning and logic, through thoroughly examining the clues, Charlie Chan solves the murder. A very satisfying mystery."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"Earl Derr Biggers died too young in 1933 of a heart attack at age 48, just a year after The Keeper of the Keys, the 6th Charlie Chan novel, was published. So, instead of living on through his maker's series, Charlie Chan lived on through the movies adapted by other people, with a Hollywood vision, and that's too bad. The book series is a remarkable achievement, one that gives us a singular, well-rounded and complex character in Charlie, that is aware of its times and which slyly comments on American culture. It infuses the stock elements of ing&eacute;nues and rich men with problems out of the past with high wit, intelligence, decent mystery development and evocative settings. In the books, it is the privileged characters--the dregs of the robber baron era mixing with the new rich--who are the joke. Unfortunately, in the movies, Charlie is the joke, an unenlightened joke. Which is to say, forget what you saw in the movies, read this series.In this book, Honolulu Charlie is back on the mainland, at Lake Tahoe on the California/Nevada border. He sets up the lonely lodge on a wintry night scenario, bringing together the ex-husbands of a diva, her retinue, Charlie and the ranch employees. Of the latter, keep your eye on Ah Sing. Biggers does an interesting job of contrasting the two roads an immigrant could take in America, either refusing to take on American values and customs (Sing) or adapting (Charlie). Biggers plays off the impact of the past on the present through all the books, and this is a rich dimension he adds in this volume.Though each stands completely on its own, I highly recommend reading the books in order of their creation, for the way they can grow upon you. I love all the books, authors and characters that came out of the Golden Era of Detective Fiction on both sides of the Atlantic, but Charlie has pulled ahead as my favorite."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"The great Honolulu detective is ensconced at a mountain retreat with a group of men who were once married to a famous singer, who also is invited to this intriguing soiree. Chan's instincts and understanding of human nature bring him to a conclusion fraught with problems. Like Sherlock Holmes, he makes a decision that may disturb those who believe in sticking to the letter of the law.Having recently read all six of the original Charlie Chan stories I'm led to believe that they would make great material for a BBC Masterpiece series--sticking true to the books and forgetting the old 'Number One son' rubbish."},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","review":"Called to the home of a wealthy man high in the Sierra Nevada to help find a rumored son, the local sheriff solicits Chan's help when a famous singer is found murdered.As if four ex-husbands and one ex-lover weren't suspects enough, this story throws in a former maid and mysterious Chinese servant as well. I was totally wrong on the who & how, possibly because some essential information was hidden. Biggers writes good detective stories but completely unbelievable romances: men's men who suddenly come unglued over women they barely know. It's also annoying because after the first couple of Biggers stories, the reader has figured out the romancing couple can be eliminated from the suspect list no matter how suspicious they appear. But the story held my interest and the title was quite good: relevant without being excessively revealing."},{"Title":"Muslim intellectual;: A study of al-Ghazali","review":"\\"Muslim Intellectual: A Study of al-Ghazali\\" by W. Montgomery Watt (1st ed. 1963). Chapter contents: The function of the intellectual; The world of al-Ghazali (the political background, the religious and intellectual background; al-Ghazali's early life); The encounter with philosophy (the philosophical movement in the Islamic world; the social relevance of philosophical ideas, al-Ghazali's period of skepticism, \`The Inconsistency of the Philosophers', the introduction of logic into theology); Truth from the charismatic leader (Ismailite doctrine in its political setting, the intellectual defense of Sunnism); The reappraisal of theology (the achievements of Islamic theology, theologians and governments, al0Ghazali's critique of the scholar-jurists, dogmatic theology from a new standpoint); The bitterness of worldly success (the Sufi movement, the crises of 1095, life as a Sufi, \`The Revival of religious sciences'); The intellectual basis of the \`revived' community (the intellectual class and the conception of knowledge, the new \`Intellectual Structure' of the community); The Achievement (the tension between Philosophy and Theology, the Batinite challenge, the tension between the \`Islamic Sciences' and Sufism), Excursus. Prof. Watt noted: \\"Al-Ghazali has been acclaimed as the greatest Muslim after Muhammad, and is certainly one of the greatest.\\" Regarding al-Ghazali's attack on philosopny, Prof. Watt wrote: \\"If it is thus impossible to say how much al-Ghazali's attacks contributed to the decline of philosophy, there is no doubt about the success of the positive aspects of his work, namely, the incorporation of parts of philosophy into Islamic theology. From this time onwards the theologians (part from those who rejected rational argument, notably the Hanbalites) made use of syllogistic logic and various Greek metaphysical conceptions\\" (p. 173). Prof. Watt concluded: \\"Al-Ghazali seems to have assumed that not merely political decisions but all the outward forms of social life were beyond the ability of a man to control - this fixity of social forms was doubtless the result of the stabilization of the Traditions some two centuries before his time\\" (p. 179). Regarding the Sharia, Prof. Watt opined: \\"In his theorizing he sometimes fails to make explicit allowance for the communalism of the Sharia, but he always presupposes it, and in his practice he effects a genuine integration of individualism and communalism. This is part of his title to greatness and of his achievement in \`renewing' Islam\\" (p. 180).

Along the way, the author shows us a winning sense of humor...Mr. Roberts escorts the reader through the &quot;mostly dismal&quot; history of Washington's primary team, noting that the first Nationals (later known as the Senators) took the field in 1859, rather than when the American League was founded in 1901... There is a gentle chapter on one-time basball broadcaster Ronald Reagan that tells how he wrote Cleveland Indians start Bob Feller requesting an autographed ball for a boy who had been shot by his father, a mentally unstable World War II Hero Mr. Feller sent the ball. More than 30 years later, meeting with President Reagan at the White House, the Hall of Fame pitcher found that the Gipper rememembered the incident...

They were collected from the papers of Anna Kavan after her death in 1968. The novella is said to have been distilled from 90,000 to 30,000 words. On the whole the collection is an admirable showcase for the writer's talent.Whether Kavan or her literary executors are responsible for the novella's weak architecture, I don't know. I refer to the way the novella hopscotchs from one viewpoint to another. Is the story first person or third? The same confusion repeats in &quot;Tiny Thing.&quot; John Gardner the novelist warned fiction writers about interrupting the wakening dream that is a reader's collaboration with a story. Experimentation is fine in fiction but the verities of clarity and coherence still need to be observed. A reader may not know where he'll end up in Lawrence Stern, Kafka, or Joyce but he certainly knows where he is.The inspiration for this tale of a woman's unsuccessful search for happin! ess with a husband and then a lover is the author's own divorce and a subsequent companionship with another man. There is a saying that everyone has at least one story in him or her. That's probably true. It does not follow that every one can make fiction from an experience. Anna Kavan could.Two facts influence most of the stories, one geographic, the social. They are set in the English milieu; they were written during the collegiate turbulent nineteen sixties. Some embody student attitudes of the period: struggle between generations, enmity toward machines, expectation that paradise lies somewhere beyond Earth. Readers are often dropped in a bleak future. In all there is the Kavan prose style, a jeweled examination of people and places.For most of her writing career Kavan was a drug addict. Other writers suffered a similar affliction: Coleridge in the Romantic era, Capote in modern times. What astounds about Anna Kavan is that her talent did not abate. Beset ! by so debilitating a habit, she continued to produce fascin! ating novels and short stories. Were she free of addiction, would her works be more numerous, as probing? A question not easily answered. What we have, though, is enough to wish we had more."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"Point Deception causes me to forgive Muller her less-than-stellar McCone mysteries, published beginning in 2000. These mysteries were filled with setting and location descriptions, more as if she were the set designer for a documentary on San Francisco's history as a city. This would be okay if you lived in San Francisco or were a lover of San Francisco. For those of us where neither is the case, the books were just boring with no real character development. The books leave one feeling that Muller was just fulfilling contract requirements and had lost her muse.In the book, Point Deception, all is forgiven. Here there is the Muller of earlier years, with a new female heroine and very little set design description. The interest here is a very complex set of murders, seemingly unrelated. The characters are very well developed and explanatory of all the events in the complex train of events leading to the resolution of all of the murders. Muller as well makes social commentary, which had been missing in her other novels written in the 21st century. Notable is the comment about the local people wanting to be paid in cash, due to the fact that governments were increasingly taking larger slices from lowering incomes with ever decreasing benefits in return. Writers who bravely make much-needed social and religious commentary in a knee-jerk society that swallows all the propaganda increasingly spewed out by all the bought medias are always a delight in a world where negative social commentary is just not \\"positive\\" enough to be mentioned.

Point Deception gives us a tale about a few of the flower children who tried to create their own paradise and failed. It was sad. The effect it had on their families and all the people who just barely knew them was sad. There are no happy people in this book. No happy scenes, no happy endings. No character without some guilt.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover an intersting mystery. Rhoda Swift is a pretty strong female heroine and Guy Newberry is your classic guy to the rescue. While it was a little cliche at times, it was basically an intersting story with what was for me a surprise ending. It definitely has some twists to it. I am willing to try another one by Muller and see where it goes..."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"The intrigue of what happened to \\"Crissy\\" is there but the back and forth of so many characters made it too confusing. Frustration made me drop the book."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"This book is my 1st Marcia Muller - and last.The plot is old '80's hippy drug CA north-coast retread stuff. The worst part is that the local law (sheriffs) are dumber than dirt and 8 people get killed (unsolved - no wonder) and 13 years later (to the exact date ... dum, dee, dum, dum - hard plot BS to swallow) - 4 more get killed - and leave hairs and tire tracks and Nike tracks all over and - our dumb lady Deputy is - you guessed it - DUMB.Compared to a Robert B. Parker or an Elmore Leonard or a John D. MacDonald or a leCarre or even a Dick Francis or a Tony Hillerman, this author/book/plot/characters/dialog is zero.Do yourself a favor - read them first - then read something else."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"I picked up this book expecting to be disappointed. I have been reading the Sharon McCone series so long that I didn't think that Ms. Muller could write anyone as well. I was wrong. I picked up this book yesterday and couldn't put it down until I read the last word. Rho and Guy are two very sympathetic but human characters with terrible past experiences that they have managed to overcome-mostly. The novel is set in a little coastal town in Northern California. Almost thirteen years ago, horrible massacre occurred in Cascade Canyon. Six adults and two children were brutally murdered. Only one child survived. The tragedy pretty much killed the spirit of the town, and almost destroyed Deputy Rho Swift. Guy Newberry, a writer who specializes in stories about towns in trouble, is researching a book about the murders and their effect on the community. Together, they work to solve the murders and get past their pasts."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"As a mystery author who juggles two protagonists (one for novels and one for short stories)with varying degrees of success, I am amazed at Marcia Muller's masterful flexibility. Sharon McCone is certainly her most famous lead. There are also some books with Elena Olivarez or Joanna Stark in the lead. Each series has its own tone and subject matter, perfectly appropriate for each series. In POINT DECEPTION, Marcia Muller has either written a magnificent stand-alone thriller or a solid debut of a new mystery series. POINT DECEPTION is basically a police procedural starring Deputy Sheriff Rhoda Swift. She is haunted by a mass murder dating from the start of her career and as the anniversary of that murder rolls around a New York writer named Guy Newberry shows up to write about the unsolved homicides. More deaths occur in time present, and Rho wants to solve all of the crimes. Rho Swift is a complex character. She carries this book, and she could carry a series. The plot is complicated yet believable, and Ms. Muller's writing is up to its usual highest standards. We have a terrific book here."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"writes an outstanding, complex tale of murder and betrayal, even when the book does not feature old favorite Sharon McCone.Point Deception tells the story of Rhoda Swift, a young deputy in a rural California location who has been unable to bury the past of her first murder case, a case that has never been solved.A well-known writer is tricked into exploring the area, and uncovering the old case, just as new murders, linked in some wayto the old case, occur. His friendship with Rhoda turns intoa partnership that leads them back in time, and through some terrifying moments, to discover the full truth.Muller uses different points of view, most notably that of the newest victim, explored before her death takes place, to weave her tale. One of Muller's strong points is her character development; many of the characters here are rich with strong opinions, and no one in this small town can cast stones at any of the other residents - all have contributed to the decay and depression that pervades, and the cynicism that arises from that feeling. Also an impressive creator of scenic areas that come alive under her pen, Muller gives us a stark view of the crime scenes and the forest canyon area that contains the murder secrets of the past.You'll find the book difficult to put down once you've started, so set aside some time!"},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"Review Summary: Point Deception is a strong novel, built around a superb sense of place. The context is built up lovingly through eerie scenes, action by the characters, and flashbacks. To this, Ms. Muller has added two powerful situations, a mass murder that occurred 13 years earlier that still haunts the town and a young woman stranded with a broken down car while passers-by ignore her. The action revolves around the parallel investigations of current and past events by the local sheriff's department and county detectives and an expose writer looking to create his next book. The main character, Deputy Sheriff Rhoda (Rho) Swift, will inevitably be compared to Sharon McCone, Ms. Muller's most famous fictional character. I found Ms. Swift to be less quirky and less humorous, but just as appealing and feisty. Ms. Muller is talented in setting up a book about having one or two characters take on a whole town, and Point Deception is her best work in that style.Review: In the best mystery stories, the place sometimes becomes the center of the story. Think about The Hound of the Baskervilles. Rarely do mystery novelists have the skill and the patience to build that element properly. Marcia Muller has done so in Point Deception, and you will feel very rewarded by this richly located story. Ms. Muller always employs place well in her stories, but I think this is her best work in that regard.Many will inevitably compare this book to Bitterroot. Point Deception is much better done in every way, from handling of the place to unfolding the plot to the development of the characters.Signal Port, California is a small town with a past that it doesn't like to talk about. In the fall of 1987, two families and a friend were gunned down on their rural property. The investigation was muffed, in part by not calling in the FBI and in part by some misplaced blood samples. Almost everyone who lived in the town then has seen their lives changed by the event . . . for the worse. As a result, they've withdrawn, taken to more drink, and become mean to each other. Five days before the 13th anniversary of the killings, three women disappear. Could there be a connection to the previous massacre?Point Deception is a brilliantly symbolic name for this novel, because everyone in the book has several major deceptions going on . . . including self-deceptions in some cases. The story opens powerfully with a frantic woman next to a broken down car, anxious to get help. Cars whiz by, including a sheriff's vehicle, but no one helps her. The fog builds, the temperature drops, and she grows frightened. That situation draws you powerfully into the story, and never lets go. That story line continues with flashbacks throughout the book.The main story is built around the daily activities of Rho Swift as she goes about her sheriff's deputy duties. She has seen the woman who was stranded, but was called away by a shooting just as she was about to stop and help. Early in the book, she meets stranger Guy Newberry, who is a best selling author from New York who specializes in writing exposes on small towns. The locals don't want him around, but cannot get rid of him. Rho and Guy develop a wary relationship that contributes to solving the mystery.One of the pleasures of this book is that you can arrive with new characters without any preconceptions. In a long-running series, you have expectations. I hope that Ms. Muller will continue with these characters, and leave them open to changes in their lives, work styles, and characters. In this book, people do change . . . or they are harmed in the process of trying to remain the same. With such a rich beginning, this series could become Ms. Muller's best.After you finish enjoying this fine novel, I suggest you think about how you can be sure that you do not ignore people in trouble. The lesson here seems to be that we should assume that no one else will help unless we do.Seek out ways to help!"},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"All of them passed her along the road intending to help but other matters drew their attention.

There too, she has her regrets.Welcome onto the scene this new character of Marcia Muller's canon of mystery.

Swift is a great character in this new series that will put Sharon McCone to shame. Enjoy Point Deception."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"Soledad County Deputy Sheriff, Rhoda Swift, had only been on the job three weeks when she was called to the scene of the mass murders in Cascada Canyon. A terrifying, grisly scene with eight dead, two of them children, all shot. Mistakes were made, evidence was lost and the case was still unsolved. The town and townspeople of Signal Port had never been the same, circling in a downward spiral ever since that fateful night. Now, thirteen years later, on the anniversary of the murders, New York City true-crime writer, Guy Newberry, has shown up to research the massacre for a book he's planning to write about a &quot;town in trouble&quot;. No one wants Guy bringing attention to what is left of their small town and the infamous event most feel is best forgotten and Signal Port closes ranks. But when the body of a young woman is found, washed up off Point Deception, and within days two other women go missing, the town hunkers down, full of fear and suspicion, afraid that their lurid history may be repeating itself..... Marcia Muller has written an intriguing mystery/thriller that's about to take you on a fast paced, roller coaster of a ride. The tight, compelling and intricate plot and vivid, riveting scenes are full of atmosphere and you can almost feel the damp, chilly fog and smell the ocean as you read. Her well drawn, interesting characters come alive on the page and Ms Muller's indepth knowledge of Northern California and her painstaking attention to detail add real credibility to the story. Add to that a stunning climax and very satisfying ending and you have the makings of a well written, superb thriller that should be at the top of every mystery fan's &quot;must read&quot; list. Marcia Muller never disappoints and she's not starting now!"},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"Almost thirteen years ago, Rhoda Swift's career in law enforcement seemed over before it started. She was a rookie when she was the first officer to arrive at the site of the massacre of two families including children. However, the blood samples needed to potentially identify the killer were somehow lost and the first year cop took the blame though she knew she was innocent.Hard work has helped her overcome some of her loss of credibility with the Soledad County, California deputy sheriff department. Five days before the anniversary that started Rhoda's nightmares, journalist Guy Newberry arrives to write the definitive true story about the crime. October would have been enough to raise fears, but with the New Yorker mucking around followed by a new murder, apprehensions attain dangerous levels, as no one in the county trusts anyone else.POINT DECEPTION is an exciting police procedural that centers on collective guilt and redemption. The townsfolk still feel culpable for the deaths of the two families and the recent homicide while Rhoda sees a second chance to prove her worthiness as a detective. The story line is cleverly designed to highlight emotions and reactions and Guy brings in the right mix of romance and cynicism that strengthens those feelings. However, most Marcia Muller fans will keep expecting for the great Sharon McCone to show up at High Noon. Rhoda is a good protagonist, but readers know McCone, and consider McCone a friend, and Rhoda is definitely no McCone.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"Thinking that I had one of the latest Sharon McCone mysteries, I happily took it home from the library, only to discover that this book is about an entirely new character, Rhoda Swift, a sheriff's deputy. In spite of my negative vibes I proceeded with the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. As always, Marcia Muller catches the essence of the California coast and she weaves a wonderful story into a beautiful background. Deputy Rhoda Swift has never gotten over the multiple murders which occurred in her territory 13 years previously, and old memories are dredged up when another murder occurs near the anniversary of the deaths. A writer named Guy Newberry comes to town with a plan to write about the murders,and he and Rhoda form a bond based on past hurts in their lives. Muller creates a nice blend of mystery and romance and leaves plenty of room for future installments in this series."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"I've read three Marcia Muller mysteries recently. The first two were from her Sharon McCone series, and I found a later McCone much better than an earlier book. Was I astounded to discover that Point Deception (not part of the McCone series) is an awesome story!Point Deception is seen through the eyes of two scarred individuals. Guy Newberry is a writer whose specialty is finding the secrets of towns in trouble. But he's pretty much given up his lucrative career when his photographer-wife was killed on a joint story three years previous. Rhoda \\"Rho\\" Swift is a sheriff's deputy in fictional Soledad County, California. Rho is still haunted by demons from her first crime scene--the grisly murder of eight people living commune-style in Cascada Canyon. The 13 year old crime was never solved, and the county closed ranks to outsiders. The brother of one of the victims convinces Newberry to investigate this unsolved case, and Newberry is intrigued enough to travel from NYC to California.Newberry faces many obstacles in his investigation. Many townspeople continue to be spooked by the murders. Some refuse to cooperate with him. The sheriff's department made multiple errors that hindered the investigation, which calls suspicion to them as well. But there are several residents who have secrets to share that may shed light on this case. When Newberry arrives, it looks like another killing spree may have started on the eve of the anniversary of the Cascada Canyon murders. This opens up the old wounds and brings the nightmares back. But it also unleashes a chain of events that will ultimately help Newberry and Swift to solve the mystery together.It is hard for me to believe that Point Deception is written by Marcia Muller--the same author who writes the Sharon McCone series. The writing is hard and gritty and the characters are more deep and tortured. It's a book I'd expect from Michael Connelly. Muller's husband is writer Bill Pronzini, so it's possible that some of his influence has rubbed off. If I were Muller, I'd start a series with Rhoda Swift. I think she's a much more interesting character."},{"Title":"Point Deception","review":"I just happened upon this book and bought it because it sounded interesting and I was looking for something different. I am happy I picked it up. It was a very good mystery that had interesting and believable characters, and a wonderful atmosphere. I liked the two main characters and their background stories. Everything came together very nicely and it was an enjoyable ending. I will definitely be reading another one of Muller's books. My only complaint was that the narratives were a little choppy at times, but it was only a minor flaw in the book and didn't significantly affect the overall feel of the book. I highly recommend it to all murder mystery lovers."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"A Lifelong Passion is, at its heart, a magnificent love story, made all the richer because, unlike most love stories, it is rooted in absolute truth. Although the dynamics of the relationship between Nicholas and wife, Alexandra, are quite complex, there is no doubt that they adored each other and their five beautiful children. Politics aside, the heart of their life lay in the family. And this was a fmaily undivided. They shared everything: their joys, sorrows, tragedies, fears, triumphs, and ultimately, their tragic and untimely deaths.A Lifelong Passion is not a work of fiction. The authors have meticulously researched the diaries and letters of both Nicholas and Alexandra and their children, then created a compilation that reads like a passionate thriller. We really come to know the Romanovs as well as those close to them: the brothers and sisters of Tsar Nicholas, the Dowager Empress Marie, Kaiser Wilhelm, Queen Victoria, and others.A Lifelong Passion is also a portrait of the decline of a dynasty, seen through the eyes of those who lived it. Filled with political plots and intrigue, the book serves as a sweeping panorama of the last days of the Russian Empire. We get to know Imperial Russia &quot;firsthand&quot; and I found myself thoroughly engrossed.A Lifelong Passion is a long book, yet it is never boring. The pace never slows and our desire to know more never ends. Ultimately, the book ends in a tragedy made all the greater because we have come to know the victims so very well. Whether you agree or disagree with the politics of Tsar Nicholas II, whether you like or dislike the people involved, you can't help but feel you've come to know them, and their tragic demise causes you to grieve.This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's a love story as poignant as The Thorn Birds, as panoramic in scope as Doctor Zhivago. A timeless classic filled with history, tragedy and love. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This book takes one back not just to Imperial Russia, the lost world, but it takes you into the hearts of a man and a woman so deeply in love that their passion cries from each word. It takes you into the minds of their five children: intelligent Olga, sophisticated Tatiana, sweet Maria, wild Anastasia and clear-brained Aleksey. The letters encompass everything--their first meeting between Princess Alix von Hessen and Tsarevitch Nicholas of Russia, when she was 12 and he 16. It shows the love and care they had for eachother even then. It shows how they jumped over hurdles to be together, breaking down every barrier so they could be together eternally. It shows their love and joy at their five children, who were their world. It shows their family members, concerned, sometimes angry, at their actions. It takes you back to a world where you loved and were loved, a world that was vanished in 1918 by the merciless slaughter of these people, these children, who never had a chance to live."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"While reading the love letters and notes Nicholas and Alexandra wrote to each other both before and throughout their marriage I couldn't help thinking how modern day psychologists would probably label their relationship &quot;obsessive and codependent.&quot; Even so, I found this intimate glimpse into the lives of Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, relatives, friends, courtiers, civil servants and even their assassins, most enthralling. But the book is not your so-called 'page turner'. I lingered over each page and even tagged favorite parts and quotes or cross-references with Post-it notes. This is history revealed from within the very heart of the experience. So much so, I at times had the eery sense of actually being present while the words I was reading in print were first being written in longhand or punched out a letter at a time with stubby childish fingers on an early-model typewriter. Except I don't happen to believe in reincarnation. I just think this is history presented the way it should be, through the words of the people who lived it. These people expressed themselves quite well and need no theorist's interpretation of their writing or intentions. Reading this book is not unlike going off into your grandparent's attic and finding all these letters and pictures you never knew existed and losing track of time as you untie the ribbon around the bundle of love letter and discover while reading them how half your family came into being. Only in the case of Nicholas and Alexandra I had a problem with the fact I already knew what the end was and I didn't want to get to it. The people I met in this book tugged at my heart and mind so much I desperately wanted for there to have been a mistake and learn that they had in fact escaped from Ipatiev house and lived out their lives in comfortable exile on the Isle or Jersey or in the south of France. And then I had to ask myself, would I even be here reading about them if they had lived? The lives and deaths of the Romanovs affected so many people it is difficult to fathom what the impact of their remaining alive might have been. And I think it's pointless to speculate despite the fact so many people built whole lives around pretending to be survivors of that hideous execution. Much better to enjoy the memory of what they really left that was inspired and wonderful, learn from their numerous mistakes, grieve their loss and go on to reading about other aspect of history. You see, the real danger that comes of reading this book is the fact you can easily become as addicted to rereading it as Alexandra was obsessed with trying to find a cure for her son's hemophilia, or find ways to spend more time alone with her husband. Then I shudder in realizing how she did indeed get her wish in the end, though certainly not in the way she wanted to."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I have just spent two engrossing months with the Romanov family in Russia, savoring each word in this incredible collection of letters, memoirs, diaries, and other historical documents. What an amazing story, a real-life Greek tragedy, but one filled with so much hope, faith, and love! As a fan of Russian culture and history, it was easy to fall in love with this book. However, I think that it could be enjoyed by anyone who has a passion for his family, his faith, or his country. There are beautiful love letters, revealing diary entries, international secret telegrams, and chilling memoirs of murderers. This book captures almost every emotion humanly possible, and I experienced the full range while reading it. There are parts that will make you laugh out loud, cry out loud, and parts where you'll want to go back in time and warn the characters as you see them walking right into mistakes that will ultimately contribute to their downfall.Besides Tsar Nicholas and the Tsarina Alexandra, this book details the lives of many other fascinating characters who are not as well-known. I felt a connection with Alix's older sister Ella, and I was especially attached to the sensitive KR and his constant struggles with his faith. And I felt disgust for Prince Yusopov, while at the same time understanding his desire to protect the royal family from their attraction to religious charlatans. Obviously, there is no surprise ending to this book. Still, it is gripping up to the very last page and the lives I gained insight on will be with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I own this book, and several others centred on the lives of the NicholasRomanov family. In my opinion, a person's collection of primary-research volumes should begin with this book. For indeed, this book is not simply letters, notes, or personal reflections by the late Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra. It is a revelation. Many people to this day mistakenly believe that Nicholas and his sickly wife were vile and cruel people. An honest look into this book will undoubtedly change the opinions of all except the most virulent anti-Romanovs. Not only will the reader discover that Nicholas was actually a kind and benevolent leader, despite his youth, lack of training and inabilities to effectively cohere a nation spanning 11 timezones, they will discover that he was a fun, winsome, and charming person. Still, Tsar Nicholas could not effectively hold Russia together and Revolution came in the guise of V. I. Lenin and Josef Stalin's monstrously vicious and deadly regime. In all candour, the job of running Russia has remained almost insuperable in the 88.5 years since the assassination of the Imperial family.Additionally, what the reader will discover from this book is that Tsar Nicholas was a warm and loving father to his 4 girls and 1 son, as well as an untiring devoted husband to his wife. To illustrate this, their eldest daughter Olga declined a Royal marriage proposal in order to keep the family close together as World War 1 loomed upon the scene.What about the Objectivity of this book?To use ACADEMIC terminology, this book has both ETICS and EMICS ( or the Outside viewpoint, and the Inside viewpoint), for there are letters, reflections and correspondence from the chldren of the family, Olga, Tatiana, Marie, the famous Anastasia, and her nearly as famous hemophiliac brother, Aleksey, as well as relatives such as KR and GrandDuchess Olga.To add to all of this, there are others outside the family who render their candid reflections and evaluations of the Imperial family, people such as other family relatives, members of the British General staff, King George V of England, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and many others.Lastly, from the emics viewpoint [inside perspective], the reader will discover that the old Bolshevik fabricaion that the Niki Romanov family were lasy, and cruel, and rolling in endless wealth was simply that: a blatant lie. The truth is that the Romanovs were compelled by STATE Customs to maintain SOME vestiges of Royal look and appearances. Do be aware that the monthly allowance of the Imperial children was only about 9 Am dollars/5 British pounds sterling in 2006 money! The children had to wear their clothes until the garments were either worn out or were outgrown. Add to this, the children had to make their own rooms and take care of their own domestic needs. And they had to keep busy, as well as study their school homework as assiduously as possible.Read about the love and devotion between the parents and their children and also get a perspective from the minds of the children themselves. They were simply wonderful children, sometimes humorous and even rollicking, but always sincere and admirable. This book is what academicians call Sine Qua Non---absolutely indespensible. And it is FUN to read. The reader also will find that all of the letters, memoirs, and correspondence are in Chronological order. It is an absolute JOY to read and it is sheer revelation for those who are willing to be honest casual readers or honest scholars. The BEST!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I was captivated by the letters written between members of the royal family and their diary excerpts. It was enlightening to read how they felt while such momentous occurrences were transpiring within Russia during that time period. The authors did a good job of selection which cannot have been an easy decision given the vast amount of material which must have survived the revolution. I wish there had been more photographs of the family in the book, but that would be my only criticism. I would highly recommend the book for enthusiasts, but warn the uninitiated, that without a background and an intense interest in the Romanovs, the going could be tedious."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This is the best Romanov book I have ever read!!! It gives you all of Nicholas and Alexandra's letters and I can understand now how much in love they really were.

Rather than just giving the reader a bunch of historical facts, the author includes letters not only between Nicholas & Alexandra, but also those of the extended family throughout their reign. I was constantly amazed by the insight (or lack thereof) of the entire family. The juxtaposition of the letters between family members & the reports submitted by those who deposed the family was excellent & provided for a very well-rounded inside look at what was actually happening during Nicholas' reign."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This was a great book to read. I found it really amazing that you could take the hundreds of love letters that Nicholas and Alexandra exchanged and make them into such a complete, understandable story. You read their letters and you can clearly tell that they were in love. Each letter plays a special role in how the whole story is set up. This book is a true original, never before has this tragic story been told through the eyes of the people who actually lived it. Not only do you get an insight into the story through Nicholas and Alexandra, but also through their four beautiful daughters and their son Alexei.There are also many letters from several other Romanov family members as well.

It must have been an enormous undertaking to compile it. I'm very curious about all that the editors were forced to leave out for the sake of publishing (by their own admission). While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I find it necessary to point out two big errors on the part of the editors. First,in their footnotes, they state that the daughters of the Tsar did not know German, only English. This is not true, as it was proven in the 60's during the case of Anna Anderson in Germany that the Grand Duchesses studied German seriously. Their school workbooks were found (2 belonging to Anastasia) and contained fewer errors than the Russian lessons.Secondly, the editors state in the historical afterword that we know for certain all the family perished and there were no survivors - also untrue. In the mass grave, the bodies of Anastasia (some say Maria) and Alexei were not found, nor have they been found elsewhere. The entire story remains a fascinating mystery.A good book, but unless you are familiar with all the facets of the subject, you may be misled by the afterword to think that it is a closed case."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This book is excellent,a complete storage of letters between Nicolas II and his wife, his mother and other relatives, and contains extracts of Nicki's diary too.

It also contains the memiors of those who knew them well."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This book is wonderfully easy to read and anyone who loves Russian history will be fascinated by the pure human experiences behind that tumultous and amazing era.The love between Nicholas and Alix truly was extraordinary but at the same time, I couldn't help but find it a little dysfunctional- a little bit too co-dependant and obsessive. Of course when 2 people are so pampered and have no monetary worries, a governess, maids, etc. to do everything for them, watch their children, travel to wonderful and exotic vacation spots all over the world, there are far fewer opportunities for disagreement and discontent, thus an endless opportunity for bliss. Also, after a while, the gushy language used (especially, most often by Alix) in letters to her beloved Nicky, was a little too &quot;mushy&quot; and I noticed how the children picked up some of the same language in their letters. Did people really talk like that to each other, or was it just more a common way of expression which didn't necessarily convey such intensity as the words would suggest? I just can't imagine people talking and feeling those feelings for an endless amount of time. It was a little over the top for me.The book was just fascinating, however, and I feel the authors did a tremendous job of putting it together chronologically and building it up to it's final tragic conclusion. Simply a wonderful book to engross oneself in. I couldn't wait to be able to pick it up again to read whenever I had the opportunity."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"&quot;A Lifelong Passion&quot; is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra. By limiting themselves to the diaries and letters of the Tsar and his circle, the editors have allowed us, the readers, to really know these people on an intimate level, as if we were among the correspondents. By the end one feels as if the Tsar, the Tsarina, and all the kings, grand dukes, and princes were our own family and friends.The editors have made an excellent selection from the voluminous Romanov correspondence. They are to be praised for helping us realize how ordinary these people really were, that they were really just like any other human beings. They are also to be commended for skillfully weaving together the often contradictory opinions that the correspondents had of one another, and allowing these contradictions to stand side by side, leaving the reader to piece together a full picture of the people described.In every way, a tremendous accomplishment: eminently readable, informative, entertaining, and touching. A must for every student of fin de siecle Europe."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This book is a tapestry woven with threads that are intricately entwined - a tapestry that gathers and meshes together the thoughts and feelings of many players upon the doomed stage of the Romanovs. The doomed stage of Russia.It isn't just the passionate letters between Nicholas and Alexandra that flesh out \\"A Lifelong Passion.\\" Letters and journals and diaries written by the people who surrounded the Tsar create an atmosphere so pervasive you almost seem to be there and these people bare their naked emotions. You see Russia from the inside. But you see her as she is viewed by the world, too, in letters by Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm, George V and many others.\\"Passion\\" is the horse's mouth of the Romanov era. Practically everybody except Nicholas and Alexandra saw the deluge coming, because their love for their hemophiliac son Alexei blinded them to the evils of Rasputin. The long very human drama is played out in the charming letters of Anastasia and Maria and the other children to their parents, in the agonizing of Grand Duke Konstantin about his homosexuality, in the conceited memoirs of Felix Yusupov about his assassination of Rasputin, in the cluckings of Queen Victoria over her favorite granddaughter, Alix, in the somewhat phony letters of George V to Nicky, in the sensible attitude of Nicky's sister Olga. And on and on. The horse's mouth.You cannot read this book without being profoundly moved because the demolition of the Romanovs and the triumph of the Bolshevics is a tragedy of the highest order and all built on human frailty, as is all history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I LOVE this book! I think I've read it at least 10 times.Yes, it is long, but there is no better love story on the planet!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra is definitely one of the best books on the Imperial Family! Told through the diary entries, letters, and memoirs of the Imperial Family themselves and some of their closest friends and family, this book definitely gives you a clear insight into the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I own this book, and several others centred on the lives of the NicholasRomanov family. In my opinion, a person's collection of primary-research volumes should begin with this book. For indeed, this book is not simply letters, notes, or personal reflections by the late Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra. It is a revelation. Many people to this day mistakenly believe that Nicholas and his sickly wife were vile and cruel people. An honest look into this book will undoubtedly change the opinions of all except the most virulent anti-Romanovs. Not only will the reader discover that Nicholas was actually a kind and benevolent leader, despite his youth, lack of training and inabilities to effectively cohere a nation spanning 11 timezones, they will discover that he was a fun, winsome, and charming person. Still, Tsar Nicholas could not effectively hold Russia together and Revolution came in the guise of V. I. Lenin and Josef Stalin's monstrously vicious and deadly regime. In all candour, the job of running Russia has remained almost insuperable in the 88.5 years since the assassination of the Imperial family.Additionally, what the reader will discover from this book is that Tsar Nicholas was a warm and loving father to his 4 girls and 1 son, as well as an untiring devoted husband to his wife. To illustrate this, their eldest daughter Olga declined a Royal marriage proposal in order to keep the family close together as World War 1 loomed upon the scene.What about the Objectivity of this book?To use ACADEMIC terminology, this book has both ETICS and EMICS ( or the Outside viewpoint, and the Inside viewpoint), for there are letters, reflections and correspondence from the chldren of the family, Olga, Tatiana, Marie, the famous Anastasia, and her nearly as famous hemophiliac brother, Aleksey, as well as relatives such as KR and GrandDuchess Olga.To add to all of this, there are others outside the family who render their candid reflections and evaluations of the Imperial family, people such as other family relatives, members of the British General staff, King George V of England, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and many others.Lastly, from the emics viewpoint [inside perspective], the reader will discover that the old Bolshevik fabricaion that the Niki Romanov family were lasy, and cruel, and rolling in endless wealth was simply that: a blatant lie. The truth is that the Romanovs were compelled by STATE Customs to maintain SOME vestiges of Royal look and appearances. Do be aware that the monthly allowance of the Imperial children was only about 9 Am dollars/5 British pounds sterling in 2006 money! The children had to wear their clothes until the garments were either worn out or were outgrown. Add to this, the children had to make their own rooms and take care of their own domestic needs. And they had to keep busy, as well as study their school homework as assiduously as possible.Read about the love and devotion between the parents and their children and also get a perspective from the minds of the children themselves. They were simply wonderful children, sometimes humorous and even rollicking, but always sincere and admirable. This book is what academicians call Sine Qua Non---absolutely indespensible. And it is FUN to read. The reader also will find that all of the letters, memoirs, and correspondence are in Chronological order. It is an absolute JOY to read and it is sheer revelation for those who are willing to be honest casual readers or honest scholars. The BEST!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I enjoyed this beautiful and haunting volume as a compilation of letters and diary entries of the Imperial family of Russia. The passion of Niocholas and Alexandra is revealed in all of its grandeur. One glimpses the troubled marriage and love affair of the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia, as well as the struggles of conscience of Nicholas' cousin, KR. This book is an excellent supplement for someone already familiar with the family's tragic story, and adds a whole new dimension of comprehension."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This book shows the way the family lived and what types of people they were. At times it is hard to keep all of the people straight, but there are footnotes and a family tree which help.It's along book, but don't let it's length stop you from getting it - you'll love to read it!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"While merely a collection (albeit a well-put together collection) of Nicholas' and Alexandra's diary entries and letters, this book is better than any novel on the market today. I read it in two days straight, it was that interesting. I have always been fascinated with the story of Nicholas and Alexandra and this book brought it to life for me."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This was a very touching book. It must be one of the greatest love stories (and tragedies) of all time; in my opinion, 'Romeo and Juliet' pales in comparison to the love shared by Nicky, Alix and their children. My only criticism would be the lack of more detailed introductury notes to each 'chapter' (year), and the repetition of 'list of characters' at the beginning of each chapter (by 1917, most readers should have realized who Nicky and Alix were) - a master index at the end of the book would have been much more useful. I would also like to have access to the complete diaries and letters of the Tsar's immediate family, even if they would stretch to several volumes."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"The spirit of the time, the tragic background and the educational value of the book cannot be valued high enough. The quality of the research is superb. Great!"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"There are three conditions under which public facination with a person (or event) can endure long past the normal span of attention: 1) a young and/or tragic death of 2) a glamorous or famous person combined with 3) an unsolved mystery. Amelia Earhart, for example, fits all three categories.The story of Nicholas and Alexandria is an outstanding example. It's all there: Great love and passion. Royalty, high society and decadence. Rasputin. A young heir with a fatal flaw. War and revolution. A massacre. Missing bodies. Pretenders.A Lifelong Passion opens a window into the private lives of these most famous people. Through a remarkably well edited series of letters and journal entries, the past echos again today with the unmistakable love and devotion between Nicholas and Alexandria. And also sadly portrays their inability to truly see and understand the events around them. A beautiful and lyrical book"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"I read this book during a vacation so I had a long time to go over it. I was happy that the book included letters between Nicholas and Akexandra from after they meet at Sister Ella's wedding in 1884. I have never read letters from that period in their courtship before. I was dismayed that most of the pictures were painting. Instead of the thousands of pictures that the family took of each other. I like how they put in the book not just letters from Nicholas to Alexandra but from their children. And from people that were invlved in their lives. Also I enjoyed how they were the authors and that the &quot;authors&quot; of the book gave no comment until the very end. I enjoyed this book very much"},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"A superb account of the personal lives of the last Tsar and Tsarina. Much of the book is taken from their own notes and letters. An easy and enjoyable yet informative read. A must for any reader with an interest in Russian history or any reader who appreciates a good love story."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"This account of the lives of the Russian Royal family and those close to them is well put together and easy to follow. I found myself flipping back to the family tree all the time, which was invaluable. You could not help but wonder at what might have been, had any survived. This book shows as close as you are ever going to get how they lived, what they thought and what a loving environment they lived in. But also clearly demonstrates their sometimes frustrating naivety, which finally helped to bring them down. If you have even just a passing interest in history, this is a fabulous book."},{"Title":"Lifelong Passion Nicholas & Alexandra","review":"Admittedly, I am not an expert nor a scholar, but the story told in &quot;A Lifelong Passion&quot;gave me the depth I have wanted to find about Nicholas and Alexandra. To be able to read what they themselves experienced and to see it through their eyes gives a new life and vitality to the history of Russia. I found their story touching and yet, my frustration with Alexandra's controlling stubborness crept through in light of the advantages of hindsight. Thank you for a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The compleat housewife: The encyclopedia of eighteenth century cookery and medicine","review":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!The Compleat Housewife: The Encyclopedia of Eighteenth Century Cookery and Medicine, Translated To Modern English By Glenda Saxon And Includes A 107 Page Dictionary Of Obscure 18th And 19th Century Cooking, Herbal And Medicinal Terminology Compiled By Kurt Saxon. Atlan Formularies, P.O. Box 95, Alpena, AR 72611, copyright 2002.Where to start . . . Ms Saxon calls herself \\"a gourmet cook: and has no background in 18th-century life or domestic processes. On the back of the book, E. Smith is called \\"a woman of genius\\" and is credited with writing \\"an encyclopedia\\" but we know her as the author of a useful \\"household book\\" available in the North American colonies. Smith did not \\"know about the effects of bacteria\\" and did not have \\"cures for illnesses...such as cancer, the common cold, smallpox baldness, rabies, plague, etc.\\" Nor was Smith's book \\"effectively lost and barely readable for over two hundred years.\\" The Compleat Housewife was one of MANY 18th-century household books available to people here and in England.Moving to Ms Saxon's introduction . . . E. Smith is supposed to be thought of as \\"being the Martha Stewart of her day.\\" She wasn't \\"a healer and herbalist\\" either. Because no title page of Ms Saxon's copy has been included in this publication, she may not have had one. She has concluded that her copy had been printed from a manuscript, not knowing or perhaps caring that the 1758 edition was the sixteenth of eighteen in all, not counting the 1742 Williamsburg edition. The first edition was published in 1727. If you purchased the facsimile reprint from Studio Editions Ltd, London, you have a copy of the sixteenth edition and don't need this version. Your copy has the illustrations of table arrangements, not some peculiar and inappropriate 19th-century pictures.The dictionary is a reprint of The Century Dictionary, published in 1889. Using it to explain material from a century and a half earlier skews time, place, and culture--it's an American, not an English, dictionary. It uses material not available during the 18th century. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary would have been better--or at least the OED which provides period examples of word usage with dates (and also makes it clear that a piggin, made of wood, was not the same as a pipkin, made of earthenware). Medical terminology of the period can be found in The New Dispensatory, published in London in 1753.As historic cooks, we cringe at Ms Saxon's comment: \\"A lot of figuring out these recipes and cures is just plain common sense and guesswork.\\" After saying that the book \\"will prove useful\\" to various users, we are instructed to \\"read Eliza Smith's book for entertainment.\\"This book may have been printed to entertain and amuse. We are clearly supposed to be impressed by Ms Saxon's achievement and to admire her photograph. On the other hand, this version does a tremendous disservice to historic cooks and students of 18th-century life. I consider it worse than Alice Morse Earle's works - and that's saying something! Earle was part of the Colonial Revival and did not know what we know today. Research and interpretation changed as a result of the bicentennial and there is no excuse for a slipshod work like this.P.S.

It reads very much like a text book and might be a good resource if you really need to know the nuances of every type of cable needed in a Residential Structured Cabling System.I purchased this book in hopes that it would have a little more Do-it-yourself information, but was disappointed. The largest problem in my opinion was the quality of the illustrations. There were plenty of line drawings, but they lacked detail and utility. It went into great detail on how to work with optical fiber but left it entirely to your imagination of how to work with Network, Television and Telephone cable.The book is riddled with duplicated knowledge, (several sections are even repeated several times in the same chapter) and makes references to other publications that a home builder or electrician may have.If you are looking for good resource on how to build your own home network/CATV/telephone structured cable system, look elsewhere.

On top of that, the style in which the novel is narrated -- Rao's incorporation of oral tradition and the way in which we gradually get to know the narrator -- makes it an exciting and fascinating read. (It was also innovative in terms of the development of Indian fiction in English.)A note about which edition you choose: at least one edition (published by New Directions, 1963) includes about 50 pages of endnotes, written by Rao himself, for readers unfamiliar with Indian references and terms. (Very helpful if you want to know more, but easy to ignore if you don't need hem.)

What makes it so are two things: detail and duality. The book works on two levels, with one level being a very realistically drawn portrait of the lives of the shepherds of England's Yorkshire dales, and the other being a interlocking tale of two men, one good and the other evil, and their dogs, also good and evil, respectively.What really kicks this story up a notch from the usual dog story is the depth of the good-and-evil theme, with the point being that in even the best of men there are weaknesses, and that in even the worst of men there are strengths.A thinking man's dog story, and a parable of tolerance far ahead of its time.Note: The dialogue is written in the vernacular of the place and time (late nineteenth century England), and is not always easy to wade through. It's well worth doing so, however."},{"Title":"Bob, Son of Battle","review":"I've read all of the usual classic dog stories, ie, Lassie Come Home,Call of the Wild (a personal favorite), White Fang and most of the Albert Payson Terhune books (Lad, A Dog etc). As you may surmise, dogs have been a close part of my life (for over 60 years). I saw the movie (Thunder in the Valley) based on this book, Bob, Son of Battle in 1947 when it was first released. The movie struck home because of the theme which roughly paralled this book and I never forgot it. I had the book in my library as a young boy and tried to read it several times but could not wade thru or understand some of the dialect so I never finished it then. I recently obtained a copy of the book and can say that this is one of the very best novels I have read. It is more than a tale of two men and their shepherd dogs or good vs. evil. The character of Adam MacAdam is more than that of a mean (or even evil) man. The description of MacAdam as he says goodbye to his dying wife will show that. And later in life, his soliloquoy to his fellow shepherders about his loneliness, the alienation from his son, his isolation, the loss of the coveted Dalesman cup etc. gives some insight to his feelings. The very last sentence of the the last page of the book stopped me in my tracks."},{"Title":"Bob, Son of Battle","review":"Bob, Son of Battle is an old-fashioned tale, very enjoyable on a literal level, that rises to nearly epic proportions when examined as a character study. A story of shepherds and their dogs in northern England in the late nineteenth century, this book paints a fine portrait of faithful, skillful Bob and his gentle master, James Moore, but where the author truly shines is in his portrayal of Moore's and Bob's antagonists, the crotchety Adam M'Adam and his evil-tempered Red Wull. A book worth reading for its portrait of a century-old culture; of sheepdogs, their work, and the thrilling annual quest for the Dale Cup; and of a pitiful old man who is more complex than he at first seems."},{"Title":"Bob, Son of Battle","review":"I love any book about dogs and have read pretty much anything I could find. I grew up reading the Terhune \\"Lad\\" series, Lassie, etc. and later I got involved in the Project Gutenberg project and started looking for dog books that were in the public domain that could be included, including some early Terhune books,Beautiful Joe,Greyfriars Bobby, etc. That's how I cam across Bob, Son of Battle. I was put off at first by the English dialect that it is written in, but soon became engrossed in what I soon realized was not so much a dog story, as one about a man and the failed relationship with his son. It is one of the best books I've read that explores the complexity of personality and how there is good and bad in all of us, but how easily things can unbalance to the wrong side. How difficult it can be sometimes for parents and children to communicate well. There are scenes in this book that really stay with you for the emotional impact they have. Anyone that loves great literature will enjoy this book, it is a real treasure that stands up the test of time as well as anything else I've read."},{"Title":"Bob, Son of Battle","review":"I love this book \\" Bob, Son of Battle \\" It is as charmingly lively anticipating as a young boys coming of age, and as satisfyingly tender as an elders moments in memory.

But nothing about Ms. Brandewyne is average. Yet again she is in a class of her own with a rich, complex storyline which this time is cleverly placed in two timelines.

I was hooked from beginning to end!"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"I don't know why anyone has given this book less than a 5-star rating, except that if you want a love story full of a lot of sex scenes, this book isn't that. It is a very intelligent and thought-provoking book that speaks to the human condition and seems more than ever appropriate in today's world. The quest described in this book should be everyone's quest. This book was not just entertaining. It was magical! I would highly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in where we came from and where we are going in the future as a planet and people."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"A wonderful well-written read, filled with many thought-provoking ideas, interesting historical characters and seat-of-the-pants suspense! It was really fascinating to see how the lost treasure book travelled all around the world and how it affected everyone who owned it, including the hero and heroine. Their search for the book took them to a lot of out-of-the-way places that I found very interesting, and their love story was icing on the cake. This was so much more than just a romance. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"I really loved this book, and I guess what I find interesting is that the people who've posted here who clearly didn't like it have also posted a lot of misinformation about it--like they just didn't get the story or something. It makes me wonder if they actually even read it--or just skimmed through what they couldn't understand. Bryony is an archaeologist, and Hamish is a history (not an English) professor. The quest is for the Knights Templar treasure, not the Holy Grail. The historical vignettes are not just there to keep track of the missing book (whoever thought that really missed the whole point of the book). My recommendation is that if you are into intelligent plots and characters, with a dash of wit and romance, you buy this book. You won't be sorry, as it is a wonderful story! Ms. Brandewyne is to be commended for her excellent research, writing and thoughtful conjectures. She just keeps on getting better and better. For me, Destiny's Daughter is definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"I read all the posted reviews of Destiny's Daughter and was interested enough by them (even the negative ones made it sound very intriguing!) to actually read the book itself. Am I ever glad I did! Destiny's Daughter is a truly brilliant, well-written romance that kept me glued to the pages all the way through! The book follows a single story - a search for the missing Knights Templar treasure (not the Holy Grail, as somebody else posted) - in both contemporary and historical times. Its heroine and hero, Bryony and Hamish, attempt to find the treasure in today's time, while at the same time trying to keep from being killed by a secret group (like the Freemasons or Rosicrucians) of chilling conspirators, who have been manipulating world events for centuries and want the treasure for themselves. Far from wandering around aimlessly, Bryony and Hamish follow a set of clues left behind by Bryony's murdered father, along with other clues they gradually uncover and deduce on their own as they travel from place to place, not at first knowing what it is they are looking for, so investigating whatever they think might be of help to them as the plot unfolds. Their idea to expose the conspirators on the Internet is excellent, not stupid, since the group's entire existence and operations are based on secrecy and keeping themselves unknown to the world at large. Once exposed, they have no longer have any reason to kill Bryony and Hamish. Bryony and Hamish's dialog *is* intelligent but realistic - yes, real people who are interested in all the controversial ideas proposed in this book really do talk exactly this way - and, as someone else posted, Bryony and Hamish do feed off each other in a way that is witty and a lot of fun. The book draws on a number of ideas, everything from mythology to angels and extraterrestrials, and cleverly, through past and present, weaves all these different threads into a speculative but fascinating tapestry. I couldn't put this book down and stayed up all night long to finish reading it! I too gave a thumbs-up for the ending, which tied all the loose ends up beautifully and successfully. I heard the music - and it was both sad and inspiring. How very refreshing to read such an intelligent, suspenseful, and genuinely thoughtful, well-researched and presented romance. If you want something entirely out-of-the-ordinary, ambitious, and outstanding, Destiny's Daughter is a must-read! Thank you, Ms. Brandewyne, for this marvelous book!"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"This book was difficult to read and falls far short of her previous works. Although I am familiar with all of the historical references and the speculative ones as well I was falling asleep while trying to get through (and keep track of) all of the extraneous information. The plot was really thin and weak. I respect Ms Brandewyne as a writer and have read almost all of her books but this one is a real disappointment. I was tempted to quit reading it several times but refused to admit defeat!"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book. The plot is interesting and quick paced (sometimes I was overwhelmed by the rapid evolution of the characters' thoughts). Although the romance part was practically nonexistent, the concept behind the book was enough to keep me reading. I was blown away--really. I just finished reading the book and can't get over it. The last few sentences really inspired me. I applaud Ms Brandewyne for taking a tricky concept and doing all the necessary research in order to make it work. I am in complete awe."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"The basic outline for this story sounds intriguing. However, the end result is a long history lesson which drags on through the ages. I have always enjoyed Rebecca Brandewyne's work but this one fell short of the mark. While the history imparted throughout the book could have been interesting and added depth to the story, in the end it just ended up being tedious reading and not worth the money."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"What starts out as a creaper definitely turns into a eye-opening, wake-up-and-watch-out-for-the-bad-guys-trying-to-run-you-off-the-road! Well, that is what I was practically screaming at the book. The action, dialogue and content between Bryony and Hamish reminded me of the old t.v. shows like Remington Steele or Moonlighting which kept a person glued to the tube.I truly enjoyed the walk/run through history and how others came across the treasure box. Trying to keep up the Hamish and Bryony and the theories, practices and theologies were mind boggling. Granted, because I am NOT a historian just an avid reader, I, too, often got a bit lost among all the facts and theories. Still, it was so much fun watching these two feed off each other's ideas. One just kept rolling into another. Okay, so even romancic parts were steamy enough to make the pages soggy! :-)I gave a thumbs-up for the ending. With the grace of the Gods, ExtraTerrestrials, God himself, not to forget the advent of technology, these two were able to protect themselves from any &quot;Divine&quot; retribution delivered as they did to Bryony's dad. It is truly comforting, if not only in a book, knowing justice can be served; and that good triumps over evil once more.So if you love history, suspense, romance and a challenge to the brain, I highly recommend this one to anyone willing to accept on faith as well as fact! :-)"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"This book cannot compare to her previous work. I found the characters uninteresting and somewhat flat. The villians were amateurish and not at all intimidating.

Yawn."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"&quot;Destiny's Daughter&quot; started out O.K., but the last 125 pages put me to sleep TWICE. If I slept this often when reading, I'd be the best rested person in North America."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"Byrony and Hamish had potential to be an interesting romance couple to read about. Byrony was an intelligent archologist. Hamish was a quirky English professor. They seemed like they would be interesting. But this potential was completely lost in Brandewyne's historical expositions throughout the book. Byrony and Hamish were not defined very much. And the action of the book revolved more around historical references than their love story.While there is no doubt that the book was intelligent from a historical point of view, it should not have been marketed as a romance because ultimately that was not what it was. It would have been better to just be described as \\"general fiction\\".Every couple of chapters, there would be a chapter regarding where the \\"mysterious book\\" is throughout time, passing through the hands of Pandora, King Herod, et. cet. I did not like this device, because I couldn't bring myself to care about any of these \\"historical\\" characters because I knew that they were just an outlining device to keep track of where the book was.Even the sex scenes in the book were pretty cliche for Brandewyne. I imagine I've even read the exact wording in some of her other books. I just didn't feel engaged at all.However, don't get me wrong. In the 1980s, Rebecca Brandewyne was one of the best romance writers around. What happened? Try reading ON A MOON-DARK MOOR or AND GOLD WAS OURS. These were exciting passionate romances that were hard to put down. Eventually, Brandewyne started writing science fiction romances which I found to be a bit of a turnoff. And then she deteriorated into historical theses. Oh, how the mighty have fallen."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"Brandewyne takes an interesting and well-researched idea, namely that all of the world's legends and stories are interconnected throughout history, and then sets out to have her romantic protagonists \\"prove\\" this theory against a background of romantic intrigue. The end result is a book that has all the trappings of a highly intelligent, well-researched novel, but is really a plodding, incomprehensible mess.Bryony and Hamish talk to each other as if they are reading out of an encyclopedia (page after page of block text that read like an expository essay), and together the two of them jump dizzyingly from one legend to the next with no external evidence to support their conclusions. The reader is constantly thinking, \\"That sounds really smart, but I have no idea what what they just said, how it connects to the rest of the 'clues', and most importantly how the heck they managed to come up with it.\\" Supposedly Byrony and Hamish's randomly driving around to various historical sites and taking copious notes on \\"everything\\" leads to some incontrovertable proof, but for allegedly well-educated scholarly types, Hamish and Byrony do little in the way of supporting their theories except try to get themselves killed for \\"knowing too much\\".While Hamish and Bryony are continually trying to astound readers with their intellectual acumen in their \\"discussions\\" with each other, their ultimate plan makes no sense at all. They spend their time developing these amazing theories, but only half-heartedly try to decipher the clues that will solve the entire matter which have been *given to them* by her father (the supposed expert on the topic at hand who tells that them everything they need to know is on a couple of CDs). With their very lives in danger, Bryony and Hamish's master plan to thwart their enemies is to write up *a website* that will expose their enemy's secrets to the whole world! These two geniuses assume that a) their website will be immediately accessed by intelligent people all over the word, b) that everyone who reads it will assume their wild accusations are true, and c) that after \\"exposing\\" them online, the baddies will have no power over them and consequently leave them alone. Wouldn't you think that any organization that has thrived for hundreds of years in covert secrecy would want to exact revenge for having all their secrets revealed? Evidentally not in this world.In short, this book is obviously well-researched by the standpoint of knowledge about history and lore, but *Destiny's Daughter* ultimately fails because the characters' only redeeming quality is that they are mere mouthpieces for these fantastic theories. This isn't enough to carry any novel, let alone a romance, especially when in the end the reader has no reason to feel that the main characters are either amazingly intelligent or in any way interesting."},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","review":"After reading all those glowing tributes on the book jacket I thought I'd found a winner. It's opening chapters were intriguing but soon after that didactic boredom set in.Real people do not talk like that! The main characters sounded as if they had somone's thesis in their hands and were quoting from it. The book is like a cross between Stephen Hawking, Erich von Daniken and James Bond.

Andre Gide's presentation of illness is compelling and horrifying, offering a plausible catalyst for Michel's decision to change his life in fundamental ways. It is easy to sympathize with him as he struggles to rearrange his priorities, particularly considering that he is clearly a repressed homosexual living during oppressive times who feels compelled to marry a woman he doesn't love. However, he loses sympathy when he repays her attentive nursing during his own illness by dragging her about on a debilitating journey when she herself becomes sick. In my view, Michel emerges as a cautionary figure. Everyone would like to live a life unencumbered by expectations from others, but the ultimate test of character lies in recognizing the line between legitimate personal freedom and reckless disregard of other people. I fear that Michel failed his test."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Michel's rebirth after his disease is the most fascinating thing in this book.Everything around him is rediscovered: each sound, each caress, each sensation, each fragrance. He is entranced, enthralled, dazzled, intoxicated.\\"I had forgotten I was alone, forgotten the time, expecting nothing. It seemed to me that until this moment I had felt so little by virtue of thinking so much that I was astonished by a discovery: sensation was becoming as powerful as thoughts.\\"Michel's new sensual awareness makes him walk and breathe with more freedom, more happiness, more fever.He trembles and feels with a new intensity.

Less absorbed by suffering now, my life once again became consistent and conscious. Everything was to teach me what still astonished me: I had changed.\\"Now, he despises his erudition, his knowledge, his former studies, his teachers, his colleagues, his family, and even his former self, a bookworm, sickly, weak.

When Menalque is insulted by the rest, he says to Michel with contempt: \\"You have to let other people be right...

I first read it as a teenager and it remains as potent when I read it today as when I did then. Gide uses the first person with remarkable ingenuity and passion. Michel is an complicated man with an intense, raw and possibly reckless desire for the purest and simplest of lives. By having Michel relate directly to his friends (and to the reader) the events of his life, Gide is able to shift some of the weight of Michel's emotions to Michel's immense, but still humanly limited powers of description. The myriad sensations that Michel constantly revels in can never be fully understood by the reader, but because the reader feels how much Michel yearns to make his listeners understand his experiences, to make them understand why he has become what he has become, his words take on a higher, sometimes draining power. Michel's battle with tuberculosis and his success in this fight early in the story is one of the most thrilling and inspiring episodes in literature that I've ever read. The future he invisions for himself in Biskra, though, of endless similar battles whereby he will celebrate his moral and physical freedom, never comes about. He is too foreign an entity in the world he returns to, and even when he tries to rise from the lethargy that consumes him, he finds nothing left to keep him standing. The basic morals of this story (to truly live you must have something to strive for, comfort is dangerous, extreme liberty can lead to extreme malaise), which are so succinctly yet cogently commented on by Menalque (one of my all-time favorite literary characters), never leave the reader. Michel becomes lost although he becomes free - he is at a place where &quot;any exertion is impossible, so closely does pleasure follow desire.&quot; His final sentences to his friends take on a kind of decadent and surreal nature - by overcoming the stifling nature of average humanity, Michel only finds himself stifled even more by the non-sharable liberty which he has created willingly for himself."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I will forego mentioning the underlying themes, which have already been mentioned by many other reviewers (see above). Suffice it to say that the voice of this author is hypnotic, sensual, and the words richly fulfilling as is rare to be found in the literature of any time, or on any theme."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"First off, you should (preferably) read this book only if you've read &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot; first. Anyway, Gide has a marvelous voice; even in translation, the prose pours magnificently from the page. Much has been made of the scandalous homosexual undertones of the book; more interesting is the socialist ideas that are subtly portrayed in the novel's simple storyline. Michel is not a hero; he is simply a man who comes to understand himself only through losing everything. Very similar to Camus - think &quot;La Chute&quot; or &quot;L'Etranger&quot;. Very original...I have heard life changing, though I wouldn't go that far. However, it does make you think. Definitely high on my reading list."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Gide's story is about a married man whose passions for younger men and for an unencumbered life eclipse his duty to his wife who is dying of tuberculosis. Threaded throughout is an argument against following the pattern set by society (marriage, children) and finding one's own path in life. Gide's importance in queer literature is evident with this novel, as well as with &quot;The Counterfeiters&quot;."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Andre Gide's small confession is a key work of French modernism. In a way this novel is a precursor to Camus' Stranger, though it is much more elegant and subtle than the latter.Michel is the titular Immoralist, a man determined to live life fully without the arbitrary constrictions of religion or morality. He is recently married to a woman he admits he does not love; but when he falls ill to tuberculosis her loving comfort wins him over.Together they travel throughout the beautiful coast of Italy, and later off of Michel's inherited farm and land. Gide's prose is both sensual and dark; we know through Michel's subtle ruminations and interactions that he is illicitly attracted to young boys. What is brilliant about 'The Immoralist,' is Gide's refusal to centralize this topic; rather, he constantly pushes it to the margins in the same way that Michel's unconscious remains obscure.This work is an essential and very beautiful work of modern French literature; it will be read and studied for many ages to come."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"This is an extraordinary book. It speaks of conflict of sexual preference, guilt, and is replete with sensual imagery and lyricism. (Fresh mint leaves not included.)

That proves how well it is written. The sentences are very simple, easy to follow. Anyone who likes Camus would love this book. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Gide's book is profound in impact: it's a lesson, futile in its portrayal of Michel, but vital in understanding Nietzsche's overman and Gide's presentation of Michel as a person not to be. A good dose of this book will prepare readers for another good read, THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH, which includes Menalque and illustrates Gide's philosophy more clearly. THE IMMORALIST is merely juvenile when compared to FRUITS OF THE EARTH."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"\\"The Immoralist\\" is the narrative of a dazzling hedonist. He is a self-centered aesthete, narcissistic, exploitative, self-indulgant, and wholly inconsiderate. He marries to please his father, as if marrying were no more an obligation than selecting a particular outfit to wear for a special occasion. During his marriage, he will treat his wife like fine china, with delicacy, but as if placed on a shelf behind glass, like a porcelain doll, displayed for benefit, but never held or interacted with. After marrying, he escapes plebian, boring France for exotic North Africa, and becomes sick, probably with tuberculosis. (At the time of this narration, TB was considered a disease of the destitute, such as in the opera \\"La Boheme\\", which was modernized as the play \\"Rent\\", and the disease modernized to Aids. His disease may indicate that he slept with prostitutes, or generally consorted with unsavory people.) His new wife cares for him deeply, but he whiles away his time following the lives of the local Arab children, not least the little boys, especially one whom he considers especially cunning.They return to France, and he oversees his inherited estate. He takes more interest in the goings-on of some young men who work on and around the estate, and the intruiges of a poaching problem, than in the actual running of the estate. He fails to even deliver the lectures he promised the local university he would do. He quickly bores of this spot, and his wife contracts sickness as well, so they travel to Switzerland for their mutual health. After two months, he bores again, and they travel to Italy, where he hates Naples, embraces Italian boys, travels more, and this time loves Naples. He picks flowers, but his ill wife is sensitive to their fragrance, so he picks them at night. Bored again, he desires to return to Africa, where his wife sickens further. He finds his local children again, but being two years later, he does not enjoy their company any more, except his favorite boy, and now joining the picture, the boy's older sister. The story continues from there, and concludes soon thereafter.This book concerns a vile creature, but we can read it with great interest nonetheless. This is a great credit to the skill of its author, and is also because we are genuinely interested, as fellow humans, to follow the course of the wife's illness and recovery. Andre Gide has written a masterpiece of a monster, with beautiful language and rich narration.\\"The Immoralist\\" is a morality play, not an existential meditation. This is demonstrated by the narrator's treatment of his wife. As for playing with little boys and neglecting hereditary estates, one can say yes, the narrator is not a great person, but he is living to the best of his ability, and living true to himself within his psychological limitations, even if the results are distasteful. His disdainful treatment of his wife, however, puts the story in a new light, giving us a strong moral touchstone to stand upon, and a compass with which to clearly judge our protagonist. Other existential novels might ask you to understand their protagonist despite their distastefulness, but in order to understand the protagonist of \\"The Immoralist\\", we must understand his treatment of his unhealthy wife, a kindly woman to whom he passed his \\"street disease\\" in the first place, and we are justified in judging how he chooses to resolve the story at its end. This book can be recommended to anyone with a taste for good literature."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"It is the fate of every human being living in this world of our making to follow in Michel's footsteps. As he \`unravels' we follow him in his story... the story of us... when we finally decide to give in to a full blown and unabashed critique of everything we think we know, with each step dropping a chunk of the arrogant and happy faade of civilization and all that it entails. (Or should I say entrails?)But it shouldn't be a story of a man's loss of humanity or sanity, the book should more properly serve (among other things) both as a warning to all who subscribe, at any level, to the Machiavellian notion of the powerful over the weak, and as an introduction to the inherent potential of human beings to live as egalitarian gods or perish in the might of oblivion's dust.A powerful book."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Andre Gide's excellent novel is, in effect, a rejection of the more materialistic and shallow urges of the human soul. Our narrator, born into what is a materially privileged life, is left cold by the creature comforts and pleasant social millieus that this lifestyle affords him. Instead he is filled with a desire to throw himself into the seamier side of life.It is in this social underbelly that Gide revels. It would appear that Gide enjoys describing it as much as his protagonist enjoys experiencing it, such is the glee and reverence with which he writes. It is these more low brow and socially left of centre beings that both author and character learn to adore.However Gide does not take the more cliched route of a descent into disorder, followed by the protagonists capitulation and collapse. Instead he masterfully leaves his reader 'dangling over the edge', hinting at the further hedonism to come, but not telling all in the culmination of this memorable novel."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"One evening, Michel calls together three of his close friends from his school days to relate a story to them and to let them decide for themselves what should be done:Michel and his new bride, Marceline, are traveling through Northern Africa on their honeymoon when Michel comes down with tuberculosis. During his recouperation in Biskra, Algeria, Marceline does all she can to nurse him back to health. He slowly recovers, but something in him has changed. Michel loves his Marceline, but disdains her company, preferring to be surrounded by the young boys of the area, in particular Moktir, whom he spies stealing from Marceline.When the weather changes, he and Marceline return to his family farm in Normandy, hoping that this change will evince an even stronger change in him. He strikes up a close friendship with Charles, the 17-year-old son of the farm's manager, and begins to spend more and more time with him, trying to find any excuse he can to be away from Marceline and in the company of Charles.Throughout the novel, Michel struggles with his new yearnings for what may, at the time the novel takes place, be considered the immoral things: his attraction to young men and to the darker side of society, while trying to maintain his marriage. Plus, he has to hide his new feelings behind a false acceptance of society, and it just tears him inside that he must act that way. I alternatley felt sympathy for him as he attempted to understand the new emotions that resulted from his near-death expereince with tuberculosis, and loathing him for his treatment of Marceline who understood what was going on and yet remained by Michel's side.A fascinating character study."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"To comment on a few things not mentioned in other reviews--Gide developed a love of nature very young, and his eye for the subtle--light, air--is wonderful. Most see this as a book set in North Africa, but note the descriptions of the Alps--one can almost hear the cold, crisp air. Although his relationship with Marceline takes a back seat to his own inner voyage, I found his struggle to love her, while at the same time being pulled in an entirely different direction, compelling. His urge to continue traveling at the end, knowing deep within himself that it will kill her; knowing but not knowing how ill she was throughout, was frightening. How different a work from explicit, modern novels that hit one over the head like a ton of bricks!"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I loved \\"The Immoralist,\\" and that surprised me. I read it on breaks at work and couldn't stop myself from sneaking peaks even when I wasn't on break. Gide reminds me of Flaubert and James. He's someone I want to read when I need to feel guilty for being a human.Take a gander at my full-length reviews at litbeetle.com!"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"The novel is a jewel.It's swift, it's addicting, it's layered, it's nuanced, and every word seems more like it was etched than written. There was also an urgency and passion behind every phrase. Not only did every sentence feel necessary, it felt absolutely vital, critical, paramount!On the most basic level this book is about self discovery. The protagonist, Michel, realizes, after he has gotten married, that he likes men. What comes next will tell you the type of person Michel is. Some might call him immoral, others will see that he's a tortured soul stuck in a difficult position. One minute you'll find yourself rooting for Michel, and the next you'll be despising him.Some have claimed they can't make it through the book because they are disgusted by the character of Michel. If that's the case, you as a reader lack empathy. Part of reading means learning about the lives of people who are not like yourself. If people can read obsessively about Hannibal Lecter who eats people for crying out loud, then you should be able to read about Michel's plight. And what a plight it is! In short, the novel is a master class on character and emotional development.So, while the subject matter may be disturbing, delight yourself in the poetry and lyricism of Gide's prose, which will have you dying to read the novel all over again.Without a doubt, I will re-read and unhesitatingly recommend.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I'm really not sure what to make of this. Mostly because I couldn't tell if Michel's nascent attraction to young men was just homosexuality or if it was more about some weird, romanticized ideas about youth with a bit of cheap oriental exoticism thrown in. It's also hard to know how to read people who basically spend all of their time being deathly ill and sulking. Are they repressed because their unhappy or just unhappy because they're repressed? I don't know. It's an easy read, and while it might have caused a scandal when it came out, by 21st century standards it just seems kind of weak"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I was very taken with this translation. It presents a very soft and intimate portrait of the main character. The language is incredibly poetic and a pleasure to read. The introduction is short and concise, yet thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"The Immoralist was an excellent book. I cannot give it a 5, however, because I've also read La Porte Etroite, which I thought was a great deal better. In the Immoralist, Michel is largely the father of the tragedy that rips his life apart; in La Porte Etroite, the disintegration begins from outside the narrator. Michel's feelings are often hidden behind the veil of his actions, making it hard to perceive his true desires and intentions (which even he may not fully grasp). Overall, a good read, but maybe not the best introduction to Gide."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Upon recent reading of The Immoralist, I am very enthusiastic in stating that it is one of the most impressive and enjoyable reads I've ever experienced. Somewhat similiar to the works of Albert Camus, It holds many implied existential qualities, but they are not directly discussed as with Camus. To experience this, for that is the most appropriate of word choices, was truly remarkable for me, and with this being the very first of Gide's works I've read so far, I look eagerly toward further study of this Nobel-Prize winning author."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Andre Gide was always justly famous for writing tight little novels that presented unusual moral dilemmas that do not, as in real life, necessarily get resolved or resolved in a way that one would think. That is the case here with one of his early and perhaps most famous offerings. The story line centers on the bedraggled life of a consummate French bourgeois scholar who is going through a personal crisis after the death of his father and his unsought \`shot gun' marriage in the early part of the 20th century. The couple travels to various outposts of French imperialism. Along the way he becomes sick with a life threatening illness but by an act of will, and the extraordinary care of his new wife, overcomes that crisis. As a result of her loving efforts she in turn gets sick (during her pregnancy). The scholar, in the final analysis, permits her to die by his self-centered actions.Now that he is strong the scholar believes he is \`superman' a la Nietzsche and therefore consciously or unconsciously becomes the agent of his wife's descend into greater illness and eventually death. Quite a dilemma, to be sure, but he is not crying over it. The real question here is whether in a hard world that it was his duty to thoughtfully care for his wife or whether his need to take actions to \`understand' himself was paramount. Some other moral questions concerning his role as landlord in his inherited rural estate pop up along the way, as well. Also, just a hint of homosexual tension in his dealings with the young Arab boys in the neighborhood hovers in the background. This is a subject that then was almost always covered in discreet language so it is hard to tell the full extent of the attraction.I would note that this theme and the book itself at the start of the 20th century may have been somewhat scandalous but reading it after some of the harrowing events of the last century has cut deeply into the impact that it was intended to have. Still it is a great book and a quick read. Any lessons to be drawn about the dark side of human nature take a lot longer."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"In 1921, Andre Gide published \\"The Immoralist\\" in Paris. In the novel, he examined the strength of the obligations put upon us by family and society to: study culture persistently, maintain a steady occupation, develop a stable marriage, and become responsible citizens. This process takes dedication and self-sacrifice that offers only minimal individual satisfaction.It may take a life-threatening illness to show someone that his responsible life is an unfulfilling pose compared to his idealized life filled with unbounded and intense desires. Recovery from an illness causes him to take a new interest in the basic sensuality of life.If society's moral code prevents the expression of the person's new found life joy, then he may become an immoralist. At first, the transition is a slow struggle that can lead to agonizing self-doubt. But once the free expression of desires occurs, he discovers, at last, his \\"special value.\\" His prior responsibility and self-sacrifice were characteristics that obscured his reason for living. The main character, Michel described his driving force as \\"a kind of stubborn perseverance in evil.\\"The appreciation of art once satisfied Michel's driving force and he felt harmony with its symbolic presentations. When sensuality becomes his obsession, Michel does not know \\"what mysterious God\\" he serves. He wants personal experiences of \\"unimagined\\" forms of beauty, and he wants them immediately.You can experience your own moral dilemma as your read \\"The Immoralist\\" and gain some insight into the consequences of breaking the bonds of duty and sacrifice. One of the most poignant lines in literature is spoken by Michel's dying wife as he leaves their hotel room in pursuit of his hedonistic desires. Close to death she speaks softly.\\"Oh, you can wait a little longer, can't you?\\""},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I enjoyed this story because I just love how selfishly French writers deal with the absurd and egocentricity. Michel is a product of a careless society. I think that everything that happened to him really didn't harm him. His hardcore (pride) did protect him from all the problems around him. But at the end he's just another &quot;stranger&quot; in life. Deeply affected by having nothing and being no one."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i like the way gide told michel's story and left it up to the reader to draw their own conclusion about michel. it was great to see a man totally enjoying living and focusing on the things that mattered most to him. and though his marriage to marceline was arranged, he truly loved her. this is a book to strech your mind and will leave to think about the philosophies that are explained. and of course, france always makes a good subject for literature...."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I probably took it more in the way of, &quot;How could he leave his poor wife,&quot; etc., but it's one of the only books I've come back to for a second reading even after getting it the first time around. Absorbing."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Andre Gide's The Immoralist is a lethargically slow, tedious work. Somehow I don't really care about the \\"journey\\" the pompous, spoiled, dullard Michel goes through. None of the characters are interesting, they are all upper class French bourgeoisie who do nothing all day but drink wine, dine and frolic with little Arab children. Andre Gide is writing about his own debauched \\"life\\" in Africa, but it isn't \\"shocking\\", just trite and shameful because it is just as hypocritical as the upper class French bourgeoisie."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"If you see the title and think you're going to get a sticky, homosexual romp or decadence in droves, go look for some erotica. This is intelligent, and yes, sensual literature, but it is not erotica in the sense that you use it for one handed reason. It's the sensuality of freedom, of thought, of doing what one knows one shouldn't. It's not the sensuality of body... though it's highly suggestive in places.What this is can be called the unfettering of a spirit, the freedom given to a man by a brush with death's wing. It's not perfect; the book (as well as Michel himself) has a number of flaws, but it's still quite a good read."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"i have read this book and i found it so interesting in the beginning but when i completed it i found it a strang book because the way which written by was a new language to me. but in the end it is a interesting book to a famous writer .i recommend it to any reader looking for interest and philosophy."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"The Immoralist is straightforward in language and easy to read, but more complicated, more complex are its themes: Man's sense of morality towards society, family, himself. What happens when man's values conflict with those of society's? Whose interests should be served? Gide explores these themes through one man's odyssey of self-discovery. The protagonist is the learned and conflicted Michel who yearns for something more than the stable, predictable, familiar life he has always known, but no longer finds tolerable. It is after a life-threatening bout of tuberculosis that these feelings rise to the surface, intensify, and are more keenly felt.This hunger, still unidentified, takes him on a journey, both literal and figurative, where his search for self-awareness, or self-truth, carries him to distant and exotic locales. New experiences and mysterious encounters give way to a new aestheticism in which weakness, constraint, and life's banalities play no role. Heightened senses, unsuppressed impulses erode age-old human values that were once accepted blindly.A life less checked, though, can have consequences, as is the case for Michel, and for so many others like him. As Michel becomes stronger, his wife becomes weaker. Indeed, society becomes weaker. How can the newly strong fail to quash the weak in their path? The question one must ask, then, and Gide does, is whether a life without restraint has value. Is there something admirable in the old adage, &quot;To thine own self be true&quot;?One of the novel's most inspired moments is found in its ending. Without giving anything away, it is the last passage, after the reader has come full-circle, where Michel's journey seemingly ends. Will Michel embrace his new truth? The reader is left to wonder. The Immoralist is told in narrative, in Michel's own voice. It is self-confessional literature at its highest, and should be read by anyone who reads to think and be moved."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I saw there was a Dover thrift edition for 2 dollars. Hard to argue with the price, but this translation is erudite and has a force of language that seems to me like it must mirror Gide's own impressionist force, despite my personal weakness with the French language. Gide was famous for his ability to invoke a single moment, a single image or feeling that puts the reader inside the existence of a character, even if only for a short time. This ability is translated quite well into this edition, and I must conclude (based on a fairly small sample of reading from both) that it is a superior translation.Who could fail to find some reflection of themself in the deathbed confessions of the protagonist Michel? The premise is that he is speaking in the first person to his good friends, and as the reader it feels like you have known this character for quite some time. His voice is unspecifically familiar, as if you might suspect one of your real-life friends to one day give you a similar account. You feel you have known this man for a long time, and you can't help but be fascinated by both the content of his story and in the loving, precise, and ecstatic way that he tells it.Up against this tone is a story that ends in depravity and woe, without any redemption for the character. To me, this is understandable and realistic. Life is not always an endless succession of learning experiences. At times it is the realization that some compromises cannot be avoided, and that true catharsis of ethics, morality, or emotion is only possible within very short time frames. Why not explore the life of a character who does not learn from his actions, or even repent of them at the end? He accepts his own frailties, his own limitations, and in this respect he continues to dig deep inside of our psyche for hidden insights that might have otherwise escaped us.I almost always prefer first person novels to those that occur in the third person. We live our life in the first person, and an objective narrator is always, at a certain point, a necessary fiction. This book stands with Nabokov's Lolita as a perfect example of the power that is sometimes unleashed by exploring a character through the eyes of the character himself.This is an original and well-written work, breathtaking in its use of language. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Many readers of this book are inclined to compare it with the works of Camus. I grant that The Immoralist does suggest existential questions but, unlike Camus' La Chute (for instance), it simply presents the life and actions of the anti-hero without his actual and deliberate existential questioning. This is the subtle richness of Gide's writing. The Immoralist presents a unique disparity in the lavishness in description of setting, and the relatively spare characterizations. Gide does not glorify, chastise nor condemn his Michel. Michel is simply what he is, what he has become. This novel is filled with brilliant writing, lines of which one can't help but memorize. For instance, &quot;The capacity to get free is nothing; the capacity to be free, that is the task.&quot; and also, &quot;You cannot be sincere and at the same time seem so.&quot; Having read both Bussy's pioneer translation and Howard's later one, I much prefer the latter. It's a far more exact translation."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"I acquired Andre Gide's The Immoralist from a pile of free books set outside a used book store that was closing for good. I brought it home and set it aside for about a month before reading it.The 170-odd pages were very easy to digest, in terms of time and complexity. But the ideas filling them were intriguing, at least at first. A man marries, develops tuberculosis, convalesces, and decides to live life more deliberately, more fundamentally, and expose himself, his emotions, his experiences, down to their very foundation. He embraces the pain of sunburn for it's capacity to make a person feel, for the sensation it produces. He strips away all layers of clothing in the outdoors to plunge into an icy pool of water, to expose himself completely to the elements and the world around him. He gives up his scholarly pursuits to run a family farm, and experience a completely different type of life and industry.But here the intrigue of the premise becomes mired in an obviously closeted gay man (not uncommon for the turn of the 20th century) torn between duty to wife and honesty of desire. The second half of this brief novel is merely an endless parade of boys and men that draw Michel's attention and ardor. The desire to experience all in its most basic, honest form is lost in the lie that Michel obviously lives in suppressing his hidden desires and perpetuating his sham marriage.While Gide's concept was initally enough to draw me in and press me to read on, the latter half of the book left me apathetic to my inceptive appreciation of a very promising idea. I found the character of Michel to be hypocritical at best, and failed to feel any sympathy for his longing after the neverending parade of males that slip through his fingers, and his fickle interest in them. I felt some sympathy for Marceline, Michel's wife, but his narrative portrayal of her as more of an impedence and a nuisance gave me more cause to pity her than feel empathy for her eventually contracted case of tuberculosis, no matter how frail she grew; the author always managed to make her more of an annoyance to Michel than anything else, and her character never really has an opportunity of true definition.Gide has a very accessible way with prose, but not a very clear and concise focus on his story with this book, which is the first of his works that I have read. All in all, this book suffers from \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" syndrome...and disproves its initial 'thesis'. I would not recommend this book to others, save for anyone interested in examining the conflict of a closeted gay married man at the turn of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"A rare book that makes the physical form of man an important thematic element. In the time between nihilistic prophetizing and post-WW dread, Michel (a nerd) experiments with complete freedom after being given a second chance in life. Stripping off the pretense of European scholarship, he tries to gain health in a life free of artificial restrants. Striving towards his goal, but never quite giving up the fear coniditoned into him by his station in life, Michel succeeds only in seeing the possibilities of this life. He is a vanguard for the potentials of freedom. Where Gide leaves us, with confusion and a new burden, Camus and Sartre pick up. This is a very well written novel and should be read slowly (the temptation being to breeze through it)."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"&quot;Knowing how to free oneself is nothing; the difficult thing is knowing how to live with that freedom&quot;- this is the ultimate lesson that Gide gives in &quot;The Immoralist&quot;, even though as he himself has said &quot;I refrained from passing judgement&quot;. As a result this novel will always be open to interpretation, as it presents the classic universal problem of individual freedom, identity, and what constitutes 'life'.Michel, the novel's main character is awakened from his life-long \\"lethargy\\" with a fierce desire to change his mask, or rather to find his real self hidden behind the layers of adopted morality, education, and social obligations. He used to be a strict young scholar interested only in \\"ruins and books\\". Now he wants to be free of all obligation and inhibition to fully experience the pleasure and sensuality brought about by his late homosexual awakening. To do so, he sacrifices wife, career, and wealth. The conflict within Michel is not only that of morality v. sexuality, but mostly that of thought v. emotion, or more simplistically brain v. heart. When he sees his awakened sensuality mirrored in the beauty of nature to which he now becomes aware, Michel discovers that \\"what was the point of thinking? I felt extraordinarily...\\"What constitutes \\"life\\"? This is another important question raised in \\"The Immoralist\\". Michel is reborn when he begins questioning his life: \\"after all what did I mean by \`living'?\\" Even here the flaws in Michel's philosophy are apparent. The Christian doctrine of \\"blessed are the poor\\" goes against Michel's doctrine of a leisurely, sensuous life and that \\"poverty makes slaves of men\\", and yet he strives to get rid of his possessions...Who am I? What do I want? These are the kind of questions the reader will ask himself while reading \\"The Immoralist\\". The author is too wise to give definite answers to such great questions. Neither does Gide encourage the reader to decide who is wiser, Marceline, or Michel? Thus Gide succeeds in being more truthful and believable in the presentation of the problem, in the \\"drawing of the picture\\". As to the answers, who knows anyway, this novel makes you inquisitive about the meaning that is created..."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"...it has to be made to measure.Gide's 1902 novel makes a strong statement on individualism.A \`simple' story, told in simple straight language.Rich young nerd (Michel) without interest in women (or in men, so far) marries to please his dying father. Goes on honeymoon trip to North Africa, falls ill with tuberculosis, barely survives, and then, during reconvalescence, learns to live, to appreciate life, finds a new self, which leads him away from old habits and old convictions. This is a strong part, but it must be said that there is a distinct, if not explicit pedophile strain in Michel's revival.On the way home via Italy he comes closer to his wife, who has been nursing him loyally during his illness, without much attention by the patient. She even becomes pregnant, so that they look forward to a \`normal' life. They spend time on their farm in Normandy, then in their Paris apartment, but Michel drops out: he has lost the ability to function in his old role. He quits his lecturing job; he sells his farm after bouts with low lives.The wife falls ill, has a miscarriage, they travel again; finally back to Tunisia... happiness is not to be found. Michel's tendency to drift off to darker worlds becomes stronger. After his wife dies, Michel reaches the end of his tether. Knowing how to free oneself is nothing; the difficult thing is knowing how to live with that freedom.Structurally, the narration is first person by Michel, but wrapped in a fiction that he tells his story and his predicament to some friends of his, who come to see him in Tunisia.I was motivated to try Gide again (after over 40 years, hadn't read him since high school, and did not keep such great recollections) by his friendship with Conrad. However similarities in narrative style or content are negligible.The Penguin edition that I read has this to say on the back: A frank defense of homosexuality and a challenge to prevailing ethical concepts...Hmm. Is it possible that even Penguin editors don't read the books that they praise? Where is the \`frank defense'? There is nothing frank in this book, probably with good reason. It was 1902 after all. There is no explicitness. We need to guess what Michel is doing. What we see is this: his new found attitudes don't seem to make him happier.That is not a criticism of the novel, but of the simplifiers.While reading this, I was torn between respect for the man's struggles, his attempts to be decent, i.e. not all that much of an immoralist, on one side, and rejecting his spineless lack of direction on the other. The man is a pushover. Once he drops out of his world of respectability, he loses solid ground under his feet.A strong novel about a weak man."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"A common ploy in literature is to hook the reader with an early confession of guilt- i.e. the narrator admits to some horrible act- without revealing the specific details of the act. Then, over the course of the book, the narrator tells his tale and slowly puts together the pieces of the puzzle which predictably concludes with the horrible act which has been hinted at but never fully disclosed. When used successfully, this ploy propels the reader forward and results in a satisfying experience from start to finish. When used unsuccessfully, this ploy also propels the reader forward only upon reaching the climax, the reader does not feel so fulfilled.\\"The Immoralist\\", while well-written and worthy of discussion, ultimately falls into the latter category. The book starts off with the narrator's close friends gathering to hear a sordid tale from Michel, the narrator himself. We are not told what horrible act precipitates this meeting, but the bait has been set and the story begins. Michel is a bookworm, kind of a loner, who falls into an arranged marriage only to experience real love for the first time shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, Michel also becomes gravely ill, causing him to question his whole life and what it means. Upon recovering from his illness, Michel, dragging his wife along with him, sets upon a series of brief \\"life adventures\\" in which he finds happiness in a variety of different ways- ogling young boys, poaching his own wildlife, obsessing over intelligent young men with strong philosophical ideas. A strong current of existentialism underlies Michel's acts as he seeks and contemplates the meaning of life and what it means to be happy.Ultimately, the horrible act which Michel commits is, by today's standards, nothing much. Even in the context of this book, however, Gide treats the atrocities which Michel supposedly commits in such a roundabout way that they do not come across as that horrible. In a way, this serves as a testament to Gide's writing- the existential arguments put forth through his characters are convincing enough to not cast guilt on any of these same character's actions. Unfortunately, considering the hype given Michel's tale early in the work, the sense of disappointment is inevitable.Andre Gide is a great writer and while reading this book, one will not be bored. As a piece of fiction that will be long remembered once the book is put down, however, this book fails."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"THE IMMORALIST (written in 1902) is a predecessor, both chronologically, literarily, and intellectually, to central works such as Nietzche's WILL TO POWER (1903), Albert Camus' THE FALL (1956), among others. If you have already read the nihilists, existentialists, and absurdists, this work is particularly interesting given its influence on Camus and Sartre, particularly. If you have not, Gide's THE IMMORALIST provides an excellent entry point into these distinct philosophical areas. THE IMMORALIST has considerable depth. Gide wrote in the preface to the Vintage edition (Paul Howard translator): \\"One may without too much conceit, I think, prefer the risk of failing to interest the moment by what is genuinely interesting -- to beguiling momentarily a public fond of trash.\\" Gide did tackle the genuinely interesting.Structurally, the novel is interesting in that most of the novel is told in the first person from the perspective of Michel. However, Michel's narrative is related to us secondhand through one of his friends. The novel begins with a letter from one friend of Michel's to a government official. The short letter poses an opening question: \\"Can we accommodate so much intelligence, so much strength-or must we refuse them any place among us?\\"While the question is posed in the context of a letter examining whether Michel could be of use to the state, Gide is really asking the reader about such supermen and society. Gide does not answer the question. As he explained: \\"I wanted to write this book neither as an indictment of Michel nor as an apology, and I have taken care not to pass judgment.\\"The text of the letter is followed by a purportedly verbatim account by Michel. Michel's account begins with his marriage to Marceline, a woman towards whom he felt \\"tenderness\\" and \\"a kind of pity\\" rather than love. While in a small desert town, Michel contracts tuberculosis. Marceline dutifully nurses him back to health. Michel's illness renews his passion for living: \\"Now I would make the thrilling discovery of life.\\" during his recovery, he decides he must redefine \\"Good\\" and \\"Right\\" to mean \\"whatever was healthy for [him].\\" He rejects his formerly bookish ways and sets out to define a new path, wringing from life what pleasure he can.When his health improves enough to leave his sickbed, he discovers that Marceline has been become acquainted with a group of local boys. He starts avoiding Marceline's company in favor of the company of the boys. The boys are, after all, vigorously alive and youthful. This trend is repeated in numerous locales, where Michel finds someone new and, in their way, exotic to him. His friendships usually involve breaking social mores and, often, the law.Michel spends the rest of the novel exploring the world and his newfound philosophy of life. For Michel, \\"sensation was becoming as powerful as thoughts.\\" Gide magnificently manages Michel's transformation from a dependable, bookish man of means to a rather self-centered, erratic, pleasure-seeker. But Michel's pleasure-seeking is not simple hedonism, he is trying to navigate between living in the past (as in his previous vocation as scholar of history) and living only for the future. A man Michel meets, Menalque, encourages Michel to adopt his own philosophy:\\"I create each hour's newness by forgetting yesterday completely. Having been happy is never enough for me. I don't believe in dead things. What's the difference between no longer being and never having been?\\"Gide never spells out whether Michel answers this or any of the other questions so adroitly presented. Readers are left to ponder the weighty issues raised for themselves. This is an idea-driven novel. However, there are compelling plot points throughout, which I will not ruin by detailing. The book is a quick read.THE IMMORALIST has the potential to be life changing in ways that few books are. Gide's Nobel Prize for Literature was well-deserved."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"When I first read this book (at the age of 17), I was ripe for change and this book changed me. When I read it now, I still marvel at its classical perfection and at its core --- the &quot;arduous task&quot; of deciding what to do with one's freedom... This is an excellent book that deserves good readers. It is a book about freedom, courage, cruelty and loneliness. The enchanted atmosphere of 19th century North Africa makes one hungry for beauty and freedom... Gide's own youthful journey to Tunisia, his sickness and his meeting with Oscar Wilde cast obvious shadows in his book... A jewel in the history of literature!"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Just to clarify some of the other more high-toned reviews, this is the story that a man whose inclinations are thoroughly homosexual and inclined toward pederasty tells to male friends who, the reader infers, incline the same way. It is the story of his marriage and attempt toward a \\"normal\\" life. Though Marceline, his wife, is a paragon of sweetness, he cannot maintain a constant affection for her, and when she contracts tuberculosis, though he tries to be sympathetic, distraction and boredom send him off to the boys who infatuate him. The story is told subtley; you slowly realize that this an unreliable narrator who is more of a scoundrel that he makes himself out to be. It's impossible to think of an American politician (Gide held several important government jobs in France) writing a book like this!"},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"Michel married Marceline at the behest of his dying father, not for love. Michel did not know he was rich, the marriage to Marceline brought him nothing, and that he had delicate health. In North Africa Marceline invited a small boy to visit the couple. Michel was amused by the child, Bashir. Michel had a discharge and was seized with a desire for life. Exercise, nourishment, and will became very important.Michel came to appreciate how maternal and caressing his wife had become. As time passed, Michel came to know a great number of children. Marceline's favorite boys were in general better-behaved than Michel's favorites. Nevertheless, one of Marceline's friends, Moktir, was seen by Michel stealing scissors. Afterwards Michel became particularly fond of that boy.From Tunis they went to Malta then to Syracuse. Michel became deliberately disdainful of his scholarly learning and his fastidious taste. In Amalfi he had his beard removed. He let his hair grow. At Sorrento he first possessed Marceline.With his health restored Michel sought a return to work. The young King Athalric attracted him as an historical subject. His father had connections in Rome and Florence and Michel had everything needed to resume scholarly work in Ravenna.Michel returned to his estate in France. He knew little about the conditions there. Six farms belonged to him. Marceline and Michel watched the son of the overseer, Charles, deal with a difficult to manage colt. He calmed the beast with his voice. Autumn was spent by Michel on the farms and writing lectures about the unruly Goths.The couple moved to Passy and resided in an apartment. Michel found his acquaintances tedious and Marceline felt burdened by social obligations. Historians accused Michel of too rapid generalization. Michel encountered his friend Menalque who had a different take on the episode of the boy Moktir and the scissors. There was no theft, there was an elaborate game.Menalque believed that people suffered from a fear of being alone. Marceline was expecting a baby. Returning from a meeting with Menalque Michel learned that Marceline lost the child. Disease took hold of Marceline. She desired to return to their farms in Normandy.At the estates, Michel met the poacher, Alcide, and went out with him on his poaching expeditions. A relative of Alcide appeared drunk. The overseer sought to take action and wanted the backing of Michel. Michel was faced with a dilemma. Charles entered the pictured and he possessed knowledge of the twists and turns of the situation. Michel arranged with Marceline to go away.They covered the ground previously undertaken in their wedding journey. Marceline was ailing. The children at Biskra recognized them. Marceline reached the end of her strength.This taut and psychologically astute tale remains vibrant, bright, through several rereadings."},{"Title":"The Immoralist","review":"It is a generally sound practice to not conflate the author with this work, but, after reading this I am reminded of the quote by Martin Buber: \\"They [the French] are too superficial for a reevaluation of all values.\\" The Immoralist as \\"a confession of French modernity\\" tediously outlines how and why, and as such it accomplishes its aim fair well. Otherwise, this novelette is overbearingly boorish apart from brief, but dull flashes of (dis)illumination all of which can be traced back to doppelg&auml;ngers of Nietzsche. The plot itself is a gross caricature of certain biographical datum from Nietzsche's life, with strange mix of sentimentalism in self-pity and self-love with a certain subconscious homosexual overtones imparted by the author. The main character is womanish and sickly, though apparently brilliant. Synchronistically, he might be considered Raskolnikov's ill turned out patrician son, for whom the shadow of a murdered god weighs too heavily to have hope, or a good conscience.There are better books than this by French authors and even Gide himself, find them and skip this one, because it is probably not what you are looking for and morbid curiosity never fails to avail little vindication for itself in these cases."},{"Title":"My Blue-Checker Corker and Me","review":"I liked this better than the first book in the trilogy. The relationship between the grandchild and grandfather is a warm, lovely one. This book, like &quot;Jack Rivers and Me,&quot; was actually written by Radley's uncle. Radley didn't admit this until 1996, so I've no idea why &quot;Good Mates,&quot; the last book in the trilogy (which I bought in a used bookstore in Australia last year) was never released in the U.S. (Unless publishing-industry buzz suspected it earlier.) Still, regardless of who did or didn't write the books, it's an impressive trilogy."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Stellar Astrophysics, covering from the very start the essential concepts needed to undertake the subject, and gradually building up untill a nice introductory level is achieved. The book is well organized: divided into two blocks, starts by setting a solid basis upon which later presents the subject. In the first and introductory part, the essential astronomical concepts are explained, and in the second part the author gets into the actual Astrophysics of Stars. The book is pleasant on several levels; conceptually, coherently and aesthetically, all this while making use of a clear, straightforward matheticall formalism which is simple enough to follow. It is well suited for an introductory course at the undergraduate level, and one of the few books which actually bridges the gap between the high-level available pieces and the general public oriented literature on the subject."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics","review":"Modern Stellar Astrophysics was a nice book. It was organized very well and presented the material in an orderly fashion. I thought that it lacked depth though. It gave many concepts, but they lacked mathematical examples to go with those concepts. A good book for people who already understand modern physics, but for those without a deep understanding of modern physics it will leave many open questions. Lastly, the homework questions at the end of the chapters resembled those examples throughout the chapters themselves very closely and even identically, thus answering them takes absolutely no analytical skills just mere copying.Update: given that I really enjoyed this book I am updating this review. This book is really excellent for people with advanced knowledge of modern physics. However, it is not a good book for people without at least an introductory course in modern physics and possibly a course in quantum mechanics. This book does not rigorously attempt to teach physics, rather it assumes prior knowledge. Given that said, this book is very enjoyable book to read for those with the background knowledge; it takes a history of astrophysics approach. Really great book and I am scoring this book a perfect 5."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics","review":"I have taught 2-3 classes in astrophysics at the undergraduate level and found this a useful textbook. The book is essentially the stellar parts of the larger one volume text by the authors and it is a lot easier to carry around than the \\"big orange book.\\" The layout of the material is logical and gets the student through the material using basic calculus arguments so it is good for students who have finished their core calculus sequence and have had some exposure to differential equations and are just starting in their upper level courses. The text strikes a good balance between mathematical and descriptive arguments.I think the discussion is thin sometimes as the authors go from one topic to the next with a single sample calculation in between. Having looked at other texts though this is still one of the best at getting the student from Keplerian orbits to stellar interiors in a semester. I prefer it to Zeilik's book. The problems are not so cookbook as the one reviewer makes out and they help the student confirm their understanding of the material. The longer problems make nice short projects. I think they are well chosen and work out nicely _most_ of the time. I like the model Cepheid numerical exercise. One caveat below on the numerics in the text.The authors have included a simple stellar structure fortran code they use for HW problems. Using the formulas derived in the text is surely a good thing. It shows the student how it all fits together... Right? However the code uses a simple shooting method integrating inward from the surface to \\"find\\" the solution that satisfies both the surface _and_ the core boundary conditions for a fixed input mass. This is ridiculously numerically unstable and requires the student to find that the correct solution is, say, between 0.9991 and 0.9992 by trial and error. It would have been trivial to modify the program to try to find a root instead of having the student type in a single mass for a run, have the solution diverge as it goes deeper into the star, and get a useless \\"wow, that didn't work-- please try again\\" error message. The second edition of the book does not fix this, but does add a pretty graphical interface... The students working with this program to solve the suggested end of chapter problems quickly learn there is no way to guess the answer and then stop trying. Why not fix the underlying code?Despite the numerical caveat I like the book a lot and will use it again when I teach the course again (supplementing the stellar code with a lecture on numerical methods to the students so they can fix it themselves - once you modify the code it actually _is_ useful and I have used it in class)."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics","review":"This book is essential to anyone who wants to learn properly stellar astrophysiscs as a sort of \\"dictionary\\" related to this subject."},{"Title":"The Waite Group's Windows Api Bible: The Definitive Programmers Reference","review":"This book has many sample codes and explanation.

Burroughs teaches all about birds and their life. He paints, through stories, what Audubon did with a paintbrush. This is a must read. Not meant to be read all at once; but rather by the fire in winter, down by the pond in summer, sitting on a park bench as the birds sing around you, tucked into your backpack on a hike. Wake-Robin is the takealong guide for bird lovers who want to do more than just identify them by feather or call. This book (I have the old hardback) is one of my treasures. Kindle version is obviously easier to tuck into a pocket and take along."},{"Title":"Wake-Robin","review":"\\"According to biographers at the American Memory project at the Library of Congress, John Burroughs was the most important practitioner after Thoreau of that especially American literary genre, the nature essay. By the turn of the century he had become a virtual cultural institution in his own right: the Grand Old Man of Nature at a time when the American romance with the idea of nature, and the American conservation movement, had come fully into their own.\\" (Wikipedia)Wake Robin is the first of Burroughs' published essays. The title is taken from the common name of the white trillium, which blooms just as migratory birds (including robins) show up in the northern states in the Spring. Burroughs is an ardent reporter of the natural world, and of songbirds in particular. His writing, however, is not that of the well-informed naturalist. Wake Robin reads more like a diary of his wanderings and his casual observations in the woods. Burroughs' reputation as a co-founder of the conservation movement is likely due more to the timing of his publications than on their content. In the modern era we look for more than the musings of an unstudied amateur when we wish to become better informed about the natural world.Clearly adapted from entries in his personal diary, Burroughs' writing is frequently self-conscious, detracting from his message. He labors at his craft, but when it works, it is very good. Speaking of the wood or bush sparrow, he says, \\"It was a perfect piece of wood music, and was, of course, all the more noticeable for being projected upon such a broad unoccupied page of silence.\\" Burroughs wrote just after the Civil War and he frequently references and credits Henry Thoreau, who wrote just before the Civil War. It is difficult not to compare the writings and observations of the two. In fact, Burroughs' writing suffers in the comparison.The early conservation movement needed a few articulate reporters, and Burroughs was ahead of his time in writing of his woodland meanderings. No one will be drawn to Burroughs for his craft at writing, but we should credit him with his inspiration, and appreciate Wake Robin for what it is, \\"an invitation to the study of ornithology.\\""},{"Title":"What is this Moslem world?","review":"(From another's review): What Is This Moslem World? by Charles R. Watson. Friendship Press, New York, 1937. 207 pp.; softcover. This book, although written by a missionary of 35 years service, especially in Egypt, is not as polemical as some others of the same genre. Indeed, there is an effort at fairness not seen in other works by some missionaries of that time, and earlier. Chapter titles and subtitles include: Moslem Folk: Their Way of Life; The Grace and Dignity of Costume and Movement; Pervading Sense of God; Woman's Rights and Wrongs; Where Human Minds Stagnate; The Gripping Power of Islam; Ferment and Revolution; Islam's Contacts With Christiandom; & The Christian Missionary Movement."},{"Title":"Richard Matheson: Collected Stories, Vol. 1","review":"This little delicacy is the first of three collections of Matheson stories picked and arranged chronologically by publication date by Matheson himself. This volume covers 1950-1953 and contains 29 fabulous mind twisting and thought provoking stories from this writing icon. For a special splash of color, these are not just collected famous works, but also lesser known works from Matheson, which gives you a full course of Matheson for your palate.Included in this book are two introductions (1989 &amp; 2003) from the author. The reason is that the collection was first printed in 1989 as a limited hardcover edition. It wasn't until recent times that the idea of a trade paperback came into fruition. Also included are tributes to Matheson by the following authors: Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, and William F. Nolan.Matheson has a knack of making you come full circle when reading his stories, and giving you that ending shock factor in a subtle way. The cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me however, is that for the first time, after each of these fabulous stories, there are personal comments to the editor. I really enjoyed this aspect of the book, as you get to hear the story behind the story. Leave it to Matheson to give 110%Within each story is a different pace, atmosphere, characters, settings, and plots. As stated before, there are 29 different adventures that Matheson takes you through, so to give a general overview of these criteria would not be conducive to this review. I will say however, that in general you get the fill you are craving after reading each story.This book definitely gets 5 stars from me, Each story gives you an adventure that leaves you wanting more. The price on this baby is quite reasonable, so there is no excuse why you shouldn't run and buy it now. And just for the record, the other two vols. to follow will range through 1971. After you read this book, you will want more! I know I do!"},{"Title":"Richard Matheson: Collected Stories, Vol. 1","review":"Yeah, some of these stories are undeniably dated and there are a few that are a bit on the silly side, but this has got too many classic stories to give it anything less than 5 stars: There's Matheson's classic first story, 'Born of Man and Woman', about a mutant child, intriguingly written in broken, invented English; 'Blood Son' about another mad child who wants to be a vampire; 'Witch War', about telekinesis and the use of little girls as weapons; 'Through Channels' an unusual, innovative horror story presaging the tech-horror trend of modern times; 'F-' a nominal sci-fi/time-travel tale with a very amusing central conceit which I won't reveal; 'Death Ship', the inspiration for the classic 'Twilight Zone' episode of the same name; 'The Disinheritors' a clever story about slipping from reality into something else, and so on. Beyond all those stories I have two particular favorites, 'Legion of Plotters' and 'The Last Day'. The former is, as Matheson described it, the ultimate in paranoia, as our protagonist slowly determines that all the minor annoyances that come upon him are part of a vast conspiracy against him. 'The Last Day' is probably my very favorite story in the collection, and truly depressing but also kind of touching story about, you guessed it, the end of the world.Anyway, I could just keep going on and on with specifics as there are still quite a few great stories here that I haven't mentioned, (such as \`Lover, When You're Near Me', \`Mad House', \`Little Girl Lost' etc.) but you get the idea. Very cool stuff, check it out. (The latter two Matheson collections are very good as well, though this one is probably my favorite of the 3.

You'll find the source material for some of the most classic episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in these pages, as well as other stories that read as if they were written in the present, rather than forty or fifty years ago. Matheson frequently lives in his own genre, somewhere between horror, fantasy, and science fiction, and his short stories are truly priceless.

However after seeing the movie and reading a few of his stories i am convinced that the man is a great and compelling writer.I have never been a fan of reading short stories because i always felt that there was never enough time to get to know the characters that you are reading about. However after reading this authors writing i was blown away at how in just a few lines you can be totally absorbed in the little world that you are currently holding in your hands.Of course some of his stories are better then others but when you have so many stories collected in one amazing volume (25+!!!)thats bound to happen. One feature that i really enjoyed was that after every story your given a small paragraph by the author giving you some sort of history of the story. For example after reading one story he explains how he originally wrote that story on a single sheet of yellow legal pad paper as he walked down the block, and he sold the story to a magazine company for $ 50. Again just a neat little bit of info.I also never know that i was already aware of his excellent story telling abilities. Many of the stories written in this volume and in 2 and 3 respectively, have made it to film in the form of \\"Twilight Zone\\" TV episodes.In regards to the reviewer that gave this book a single star for poor grammar and editing, i have to say i failed to notice such mistakes. There are a few stories were it is written from the perspective of a child(or a creature with child like intellect), in these stories the grammar and spelling is made to reflect the persons state of mind and as such is written in a child like sentence structure( poor grammar and obvious spelling errors). Aside from these stories i failed to find any mistakes.Over all this is a great book by a great author with only one problem: it is very hard to put down!!!"},{"Title":"Richard Matheson: Collected Stories, Vol. 1","review":"Matheson is one of the all-time greats, but this edition is just terrible.

His simplistic way of injecting the very brunt of terror into the hearts and minds of so many people has solidified his true and unequivocal greatness, and who I believe should be bestowed first class treatment in the compiling of his unparalleled stories into 3 volumes. Yes, great idea, but poor execution. The word edit obviously lost sufficient meaning in the pen headed mind of Stanley Wiater: the dumb moron who apparently didn't edit worth a s**t Matheson's stories. It's misleading and deceptive to print edit upon a book with myriad typos and misspells and, then, put a price tag on it. What a shame...J. R. Rebuck"},{"Title":"Richard Matheson: Collected Stories, Vol. 1","review":"I always like to describe Richard Matheson as the best writer whose work you know but whose name you don't. Certainly, his name as not been as big as some of the people he's influenced such as Stephen King, but his work is unforgettable. Movies that have been based on his work include the very recent I Am Legend (previously filmed as The Last Man on Earth and the Omega Man), The Incredible Shrinking Man, Somewhere in Time, Stir of Echoes, Hell House and What Dreams May Come. Beyond those are the TV adaptations, including a number of Twilight Zones, Trilogy of Terror and Duel. Then there are his screenplays, most notably his work for Roger Corman with the Poe movies.Collected Stories, Volume 1 (of 3) has a couple dozen of Matheson's earliest short stories, and while not every story is a classic, there is also not a dud in the bunch. I can't describe them all, but some of the highlights include stories that would later become Twilight Zone episodes: Third From the Sun (about a couple families fleeing into space from a worldwide disaster), Death Ship (about space explorers who come across a crashed spaceship with a disturbing surprise inside), Little Girl Lost (about a young child falling into another dimension) and Long Distance Call (involving an invalid old lady receiving mysterious phone calls).Those may be the more familiar stories, but there are other gems as well, including Matheson's first story, Born of Man and Woman, a child's story of maltreatment by his parents. Blood Son involves another child, this one whose sole aspiration is to become a vampire; F--, a science fiction story of a future era where food is no longer not consumed, its very mention is considered obscene; Mad House, about a man whose rage eventually poisons his very home; Shipshape Home, about an apartment complex with a strange janitor and stranger things in the basement; and The Disinheritors, a twist on the Goldilocks story. And there are many more stories as well.Nowadays, when many short stories are artistic slice-of-life stories with more style than substance, Matheson's stories may come off as old-fashioned, but I'll take them there straightforward brilliance any day over more literary efforts.

It is another example of the exceptional and inspired writing of Stephen Arroyo, who covers a very broad range of often neglected issues here. Many of them will be familiar to anyone who has practiced, or attempted to practice, astrology for a number of years, but for those starting out, the observations, insights and suggestions will be tremendously supportive.Arroyo uses many excellent quotes from a vast range of sources to discuss astrology and its position in the modern world. Is it a science, a language, or a healing tool? What can it show you? Can it inspire you? Can it help you understand what other human beings and you yourself are going through in this life? What are the skills and qualifications necessary to be a good astrologer? How much should you charge? What kind of one to one connection can we make with other people? Do we have the necessary listening and communicating skills?Since most of this book was written, I would suggest that in some ways things have got better for anyone attempting to practice intelligent and genuinely consciousness-raising astrology. Most obviously, an increasing percentage of Western society are now aware that real astrology is not about newspaper horoscopes. On the other hand, some changes in society are mixed blessings. As discussed in chapter 7, widespread use of computers by astrologers has cut out lots of tedious calculations, but the valuable period spent pondering the birth chart may be lost, thus possibly lowering the quality of interpretation. Similarly, although not anti-technology, Arroyo observes &quot;there is a general degradation of standards in virtually every field that is widely promoted on the internet&quot;.Overall, an absolute must if you are considering professional involvement."},{"Title":"Practicing the Cosmic Science: Key Insights in Modern Astrology","review":"Practising the Cosmic Science is practical, deep, easy to read book ... it's simply Arroyo!"},{"Title":"In a Barren Land: The American Indian Quest for Cultural Survival, 1607 to the Present","review":"This is an excellent book to read if you are searching for more information about Indian movements west and the details of the movements. I bought the book specifically to find out more about the Cherokee East Indians and their movement west to Join the Oklahoma and Texas Indians already in place. John Ross, of course went to Washington, and tried to use his understanding and influence to affect the longevity of the Cherokee nation. Unfortunately, Andrew Jackson and his Federal Troops saw the world differently and Cherokees were being driven out of Georgia with the discovery of gold. Other tribes were dispersed as well. The movement west was called by some, the Trail of Tears of 1838, but this book describes in detail a larger period of time with a much wider scope to include many tribes, and the details of their destinations and their plight in arriving there. The book is candid about the people who became interlopers, i.e., became so normal to see about the place that they were put to work and became tribal members. Many had married indian women, and the author details that many had no skills to speak of. In fact, the author details, many became blacksmiths for lack of any other trade and the Indians welcomed them to their homeplace to practice such trades. Todays excellent automobile mechanics are of Cherokee or other Indian Ancestory and they possess uncanny analytical skills which are probably due to the Indian Ancestory. You will enjoy reading the book because it has new points of view which you will probably not see in other Indian publications , and it will, no doubt, help you to answer your Indian questions."},{"Title":"*OP MET: Sabbat Guide (Mind's Eye Theatre)","review":"If your looking for new disciplines, rules and additions, then go somewhere else.

Including the five essays in this book, I have read about a dozen pieces of criticism on the novel, and there is virtually no agreement among any of them. Every single essayist interprets names, symbols, events, and passages differently. So \\"New Essays\\" won't lead you to the one key truth of \\"Lot 49\\", if there even is one. What's better though, is that this book will expose you to five divergent ways of thinking about the novel. Reading and understanding various conflicting arguments about \\"Lot 49\\" will only help you in your own quest to understand this book. I would give this book only 3.75 stars, however, because of the quality of some of the essays contained within. Some of the essays are quite excellent. Johnston's look at semiotics in the novel very interesting, thought provoking, and well written. Further essays on \\"disrupting story\\" and the use of metaphor are also very good. The book's first essay, a comparison of Borges to Pynchon, is not as strong. Perhaps my dislike of this essay was fueled by my inexperience with the work of Borges, or the fact that I only took Spanish for six years and was unable to understand many of the passages the author used by Borges. Mainly, I felt that this essay was not as insightful as other essays. Yes, it linked Pynchon and Borges well, but it didn't have too many interesting ideas about \\"Lot 49\\" itself. My biggest problem with the book was its final essay. This essay, written by a professor of American Studies at the University of Paris, attempts to look at the novel in the context of the 60's in the USA. This essay was boring and uninsightful.

But even if those names are unfamiliar to you, I think you'll enjoy this book if you appreciate sophisticated repartee. Incidentally, one member of the select group was Harpo Marx, who never uttered a word while performing as the zaniest of the Marx Brothers.

Robert Drennan, likewise, in his \\"The Algonquin Wits,\\" inexplicably removed what was once brilliantly vibrant repartee from its life-sustaining contexts.The bon mots of Adams, Benchley, Broun, Kaufman, Lardner, Parker & Woollcott are presented in a sterile, single-file order - with little or no preparatory information that would enable readers to know why some of these as-presented lifeless punchlines were, at the time, considered to be clever & funny.Some classic lines still stand alone imperturbably, successfully. But others, as presented, cannot.For example, a suitable preface to Robert Benchley's sardonic \\"Lindbergh telegram\\" entry -\\"Six days after Lindbergh's historic flight to LeBourget [sic; a French airport], Benchley sent a telegram to...Charles Brackett in Paris: \`Any tidings of Lindbergh? Left here week ago. Am worried.' \\"- Would alert readers that the aviator's feat had been the ONLY thing that radio & print reporters & a hysterical public had been talking about non-stop for about one week (after Lindbergh had landed in Paris in 1927, thus completing the first trans-Atlantic solo flight).Drennan also didn't bother to quick-prep readers that Dorothy Parker was QUOTING author E.B. White's punch line assigned to a famous New Yorker cartoon, in which a small child at the dinner table knows that his parents are trying to hoodwink him into eating his vegetables & defiantly says just that:\\"As a writer of book reviews, Parker experienced many tedious moments, but her most difficult times came when [she was] forced to write reviews of novels of \`sensational' appeal.' On this occupational hazard, she once commented, \`It's not just Lady Chatterley's Husbands. It's that after this week's course of reading, I'm good & through with the whole matter of sex. I say it's spinach, & I say the hell with it.' \\"(Parker passed away in 1967. Had she lived, imagine her reaction to the equally revolting \\"Little Gloria, Happy At Last\\" - the 1980 best-selling sob-story/soap-opera biography of Gloria Vanderbilt, by Boo Hoo Goldsmith.)If you're going to quote this sort of complicated fare, do it adroitly. This flawless setup is from Marion Meade's 1987 biography of Dorothy Parker:\\"In years to come, efforts were made to resurrect what...had taken place that day...who had said what & to whom, but by then, nobody remembered much [of a meeting of the Round Table regulars at the Algonquin Hotel in the 1920s].\\"The only certainty was that [theater critic & fey Broadway celebrity] Aleck Woollcott had held center stage recounting his wartime adventures at length & that the others were good-natured about allowing him to spout off. All his stories began with \\"When I was in the theater of war...\\" & finally, Arthur Samuels cut him short.\\" \`Aleck, if you were ever in the theater of war, it was in the last-row seat nearest the exit.' \\"****Drennan was also oblivious to the obvious in that much of what he had harvested had already rotted on the vine.Comedy & humor & satire - each lives a notoriously ephemeral existence, & only a slight percentage of what once provided entertainment survives to amuse later generations (in this respect, the Drennan-selected lumberjack quips & cracks of Heywood Broun are especially wilted).*****AW may have merely been a work of vanity or mundane commerce (on which two magnificent Al Hirschfeld illustrations of the Round Table members & the finest high-gloss, quality paper was [were?] wasted) - possibly created for the benefit of the then-Algonquin owner, Ben Bodne.Or was this a legitimate attempt to equate the Algonquin wits of the 1920s with those in Bodne's dining room in 1968?\\"The Round Table itself...has endured...the famed luncheon spot continues to attract the urbane & sophisticated\\"If so, pointing to the regular presence of the lunching \\"publisher & joke-master Bennett Cerf\\" as proof that the \\"urbane & sophisticated\\" still dine on 44th Street is an oddly preposterous tactic.Cerf's self-conscious & awkward stabs at humor during his stint as a self-log rolling guest of the TV show \\"What's My Line,\\" instead, cemented his legacy as an unintentional straight man - the 2nd Coming of Harold Ross - providing a can't-miss foil for the civil yet stinging tongue of former journalist & host, John Daly.*****Buying the hardcover book? Go ahead. But be forewarned that that will leave you with:Two inside-cover reproductions of that wonderful Hirschfeld illustration of Parker & Pals;A non-fact checked introduction - James Thurber & E.B. White were not \\"later humorists\\" on The New Yorker magazine staff; they were discovered & published almost immediately after the magazine was launched - that also ineptly characterizes Benchley's deadly serious reaction to his first taste of speakeasy booze (\\"This place ought to be closed by law!\\") as \\"self-deprecating\\";Some timeless, excellent quips (that can also be found in many other, more worthy publications);An extensive & useful bibliography (an extraordinary number of the titles listed are today, decades after their respective publications, available via Amazon);And not much else."},{"Title":"Algonquin Wits","review":"This book collects a lot of legendary sayings from legendary sayers -- convenient to have them all in the same place."},{"Title":"Algonquin Wits","review":"This group of writers included people of the sort who will not exist today and that makes them unique and entertaining."},{"Title":"Algonquin Wits","review":"Wonderful reading.

Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"I wasn't born till long after Edward R. Murrow passed away, so I hadn't considered reading this book till I heard Bob Edwards give a interview/talk about Murrow on the Atlanta stop of his book tour. The best way to sum up this fascinating book is with a quote from Bob Edwards the author, himself -- \\"Most Americans living today never heard Ed Murrow in a live broadcast. This book is for them. I want them to know that broadcast journalism was established by someone with the highest standards. Tabloid crime stories, so much a part of the lust for ratings by today's news broadcasters held no interest for Murrow. He did like Hollywood celebrities; they had no place on his news programs. My book is focused on this life in journalism. I offer it in the hope that more people in and out of the news business will get to know Ed Murrow. Perhaps in time the descent from Murrow's principles can be reversed.\\" - Bob EdwardsEven if you aren't interested in the subject of the history of broadcast journalism, or if you've never heard of Murrow, you will still find this book a fascinating read. You can listen to an audio recording of Mr. Edwards' amazing hour-long interview on NPR.org which also includes audio samples of Murrow's historic broadcasts. Bob Edwards uses transcrips from Murrow's broadcasts in his book so you can get a sense of what Murrow's voice was as he reported on some of the most important events in recent history. A truely engrossing and, paralleled with the 'standards' of today's journalism, enlightening read."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"What a timely book, what with CBS mired in a controversy that seems connected with wanting to make news rather than report news.Murrow was simply the best at reporting the news and in informing the reader and viewer of problems which in turn empowered the viewer to be more of a participant in their government, community and world. This is such a great book if only because it speaks to the value of honesty, integrity and ethics. Three elements missing in today's network 'news' that seems geared more to ratings and money than public service via the public air waves.Bob Edwards was such a favorite of mine when he was on NPR which alas seems to be wanting to follow the failed path of the three alphabet networks. Edwards is a rare breed because like Murrow and even Cronkite he came across as trusting the listener to use their own brain to think and reason, rather than in need of a substituted brain on half power.Shy 200 pages I do wish it had been another hundred pages longer. Also read World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and the Broadcasts That Riveted a Nation. Suggest that the powers that be at CBS also read these two books."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"I am too young to have heard the eloquent broadcasts of Edward R. Murrow. But that does not lessen my appreciation of him.In my office hangs a Murrow poster: a Museum of Broadcasting photo of him with the ever present cigarette dangling from his fingertips.From my father's album collection, I inherited one of the &quot;I Can Hear It Now&quot; LPs, and I have listened to it many times. In my videocollection, I own the very first &quot;See It Now&quot; broadcast Murrow did for CBS, which includes a very young Don Hewitt in the control room.Up until recently, it was not possible to locate any of Murrow's original broadcasts, but that has recently changed.For those who teach and want to add a valuable resource to your collection, I recommend: World War II on the Air: Edward R. Murrow and theBroadcasts That Riveted a Nation, a book/CD compilation.Aside from the poster, LP, and videotape, I have the comprehensive biography of Murrow written by Joseph Persico and a copy of &quot;See It Now,&quot;a book that combines images and text from some of the best of those CBS News broadcasts of the 1950s ( including The Case ofLieutenant Milo Radulovich).This spring (2004) I came across Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism a concise book by formerNational Public Radio host Bob Edwards. The book begins by quoting from the World War II broadcast which many will agree isMurrow's most famous from atop a building in London as German bombers approached.The poet Archibald MacLeish paid tribute to Murrow saying: &quot; You burned the city of London in our houses and we felt the flames thatburned it. You laid the dead of London at our doors and we knew that the dead were our dead....were mankind's dead....&quot;Edwards admires Murrow and this revealing book is a loving tribute to the man who created modern day broadcast journalism. It wasMurrow who was brought up to love language; who attracted the best and brightest journalists of their time to help deliver the riveting newsfrom Europe, Asia and Africa to the US; and who fought the establishment when he saw radio and television heading down the path to trivialization and trash.Edwards allows us to know Murrow the man as well as the journalist. The readers of this book will revel in the words of the man who paintedpictures with his writing. This is a book for every student of history and every one of us who is fond of news. It will remind you how good newsused to be and how it might be again, if the industry would focus on what really matters: objective reporting."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"I probably wouldn't have read this book if it hadn't been written by Bob Edwards. (I have a three foot pile of unread books. It used to be four feet, but I slowed my buying rate until I get caught up.)Not reading it would have been a mistake.This is a very readable, well written book. (I was actually through with the first chapter by the time it was my turn to get my book signed.) All of book in this series (Turning Point) are short and intended to be quick reads. Even though it is short, the book gives a good picture of the key events that shaped broadcast journalism today. It's surprising how many of the key people in television news well into the 1980's (and to a lesser extent, even to today) got their start with Ed Murrow.For me, this book fills in the background to the TV news of my earliest memories. It explains how broadcast journalism got from the days of live radio relayed by short wave to the era of instant satellite transmissions around the world.This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Although I grew up with parents and teachers extolling the legacy of Murrow, I never experienced his live broadcasts. EDWARD R. MURROW AND THE BIRTH OF BROADCAST JOURNALISM brings home the man and his achievements. He was one of those rare forces who through the combination of personality, knowledge and will became an agent of change. Had Murrow, whose career aspirations were to be an educator, not come along with the notion that radio could do something other than convey live concerts and other entertainment, broadcast journalism might still be playing catch-up. Bob Edwards does a good job of portraying the state of the media from the 1930's into the 1960's, the period of Murrow's rise and, alas, decline. He may have brought the war in Europe live to Americans and, by letting the truth into every home, unmasked McCarthyism, but he was, in the end, no match for the corporate politics and ratings races that had infused broadcast journalism by the late 1950's.Edwards packs a lot of information into a short text. He often races through the years, providing close-ups of critical times or telling tales of the Murrow persona. Sometimes though, he just stands aside and lets Murrow speak through transcripts of his speeches or broadcasts. In his own words the genius of the man shines through. This book has legs, but it has special resonance as I write, given the fresh loss of Peter Jennings and recent retirements of Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather. At its best, Edwards' book inspires the desire to read more detailed accounts of Murrow and his world."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Edward R. Murrow is to broadcasting news just as Red Barber is to broadcasting baseball. The book is at once a brief history of a new and quicker way of delivering news to people during a critical time in the world's history in addition to profiles of other Murrow Boys such as Howard K. Smith, Richard C. Hottelet, William Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Charles Collingwood, and other members who reported on World War II. Murrow's vivid descriptions of The Battle of Britian during August and September of 1940, and the Buchenwald death camp in 1945 showcase him for what he is, a reporter. Murrow and Bill Shirer had a falling out which Murrow later wanted to patch up, but Shirer would change the subject. Shirer felt Murrow was jealous that his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich outsold Murrow's This Is London, while Murrow felt Shirer had grown complacent in his broadcasts. CBS boss William Paley released Shirer from employment. It's sad that two Giants who reported on World War II had this unfortunate falling out. The book is only 166 pages long, and is certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Bob Edwards' biography of Edward R Murrow is more than the interesting and well-written story of the life of this intriguing man. It is also a thoughtful look at the process by which broadcast news grew from empty entertainment to a window on the world's events that previous generations could never have imagined. In only 160 pages, we get a remarkably full view of what Murrow wanted to accomplish, the struggles he faced in trying to get there, and some of the disappointment Murrow faced at the end of his career, as the excellence and intellectual honesty he had brought to his broadcasts began to be eroded by corporate bureaucrats with lower intellectual standards and an eye only for the bottom line.On the back of the book jacket, Edwards refers to Murrow as \\"someone with the highest standards. Tabloid crime stories, so much a part of the lust for ratings by today's news broadcasters, held no interest for Murrow ... I offer [this book] in the hope that more people in and out of the news business will get to know Ed Murrow. Perhaps in time the descent from Murrow's principles can be reversed.\\"There is real irony in those words, for, no sooner had this book been published, then the corporate bureaucrats at National Public Radio summarily fired Edwards as anchor of their flagship news show, \\"Morning Edition,\\" which he had built over 25 years into the most-listened-to news show in radio broadcast history. The lame explanations about \\"natural evolution\\" of the show made no sense to most listeners, and \\"Morning Edition,\\" which Edwards nurtured for a quarter century, is vastly less interesting without him. It hasn't descended to tabloid crime stories yet, but there are far more silly, feel-good puff pieces, and less rigorous news coverage and analysis than when Edwards sat in the anchor chair.Ed Murrow's departure from CBS left Walter Cronkite as the nation's pre-eminent broadcast journalist, and Cronkite was a giant. But, with a few exceptions, broadcast journalism has suffered in the twenty years since Cronkite's retirement. Now, with Tom Brokaw's impending retirement from NBC, and Bob Edwards' departure from NPR's Morning Edition, we the audience may be in for more and more empty \\"infotainment,\\" and less and less news coverage that lives up to Ed Murrow's high standards. The light that Bob Edwards' little gem of a book has shined on Ed Murrow's life will at least help us to understand what we're losing, and just might help kindle a demand for a return to the kind of journalism that can nurture and sustain our democracy instead of titillating, or simply pandering to the lowest common denominator.Bill Moyers is quoted as saying of this book, \\"Get it, read it, and pass it on.\\" I heartily agree."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Bob Edwards' biography of Edward R. Murrow is by no means comprehensive, but considering the restricted format of the Turning Points in History series, Edwards did a very good job hitting the high points of the life of the man responsible for establishing radio and TV news.Edwards recounts all the notable moments--sprinkled liberally with quotes from Murrow's broadcasts and speeches--of Murrow's career, including his coverage of the development of WWII in Europe and the Blitz of London, and in later years, his crusade against Senator Joe McCarthy's red-baiting efforts for rooting out Communists. The book is very interesting and well-written, and includes bits of information about all the men (and women) whose careers Murrow shaped. Edwards' respect for Murrow is evident throughout the book; he gushes at times, though is not afraid to point out the times when Murrow may have erred in judgment.Considering that one probably couldn't write a complete biography of a regular person in 160 pages, let alone the man responsible for the development of modern broadcast news, Edwards performed admirably in this effort. He covers all the high points of Murrow's career, and more importantly, explains why Murrow was so important, and shows the influence he still has on modern media."},{"Title":"Edward R.

Edwards makes the point that Murrow's legendary influence on broadcasting and media should not be forgotten, especially with some of the dilemmas we see in today's media world. This is a super read and would make a great gift, especially for anyone who's interested in the history of broadcasting or journalism."},{"Title":"Edward R.

Murrow for two reasons: the reports from London during the blitz (which I only remember from more recent re-broadcasts as I was too little), and the 1953 broadcast that finally started the collapse of Senator Joseph McCarthy and one of the more shameful eras in our time which I saw live.Making the change from radio to television, Murrow was one of the pioneers that attempted to develop the full potential of television to shape our lives. Remember this was an era before Sesame Street tought us that a few seconds of attention span is all that's needed, before politicans learned that the few second sound bite was all that's going to get on the air.This was a time when the news was considered important instead of just another aspect of the ratings game."},{"Title":"Edward R.

Yes, Murrow was one of a kind. But going into an extended, whiney complaint about the state of news in 2004 was paper wasted that could have been better spent on the book's subject. Mr. Edwards should sleep soundly rather than toss and turn from nightmares generated by either the excesses of cable TV news or those greedy/heartless corporations. Humankind has more and better access to real news from multiple sources than at any other time in history--given the Internet. The golden age of news and access to knowledge is now.

Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"A good book should create an impact in the reader. It should touch a person or inspire them to take a stand. The story of Edward R. Murrow is that type of story. This particular book follows Murrow's impact in the embryonic industry known as broadcast journalism. Though I sometimes felt the author was too concerned with the comings and goings of Murrow's staff, it does not take away from the overall product. This is not intended to be a thorough biography of Murrow.Murrow got his start in education through the International Institute of Education, which is reflected in his belief that the news should educate. Also at this time, Murrow served as the Assistant Secretary of the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars which relocated displaced German Jewish scholars to America. His work would lead him to become a war correspondent for CBS radio during World War II, providing some of the most influential information of the time.With the new media of television, Murrow would not start behind the camera. But with the backing of CBS boss William S. Paley, See It Now would become the standard bearer for news. Though it is best known for its stand against McCarthyism, the program allowed a multi-sided view of issues. In other words, it served to educate the public.In the words of the author, \\"... Many of today's public affairs programs reflect the polarized political climate and are overtly partisan to entertain listeners and viewers whose minds are already made up. People no longer tune in to a program for a detached assessment of political matters, they tune it to have their bias reaffirmed.\\" (158-159) Today's media thrives in sound bites and shows a topic in black and white, forgetting that there are a lot of shades of gray to an issue.

Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Edward R Murrow was an original and a man of his time. A true American success story from rural NC and WA, he created modern broadcast journalism for radio and TV. He shaped America's view of WW II before, during and after it raged. He highlighted the common man and the common good. He spoke truth to power. He did things his way. He stopped Senator McCarthy and curbed the impact of McCartyism. He developed journalists and built a network news team across three decades.However, he was never truly comfortable in his own skin or self-confident. Mostly career and just a little people. Political. Combative. Competitive. Proud. Too independent. As a very driven man he succeeded, but created waves that were unnecessary. Confident in many of his beliefs about the role of public broadcasting, he defined the profession, set standards, but never understood or accepted the business realities of a growing industry.This book provides a good character study and picture of the US through the 1930's through the 1950's. The growth of the industry is well captured. The author ends with an extended personal essay on the shame that broadcast journalism has changed and that it is subject to corporate goals. This was Murrow's view and the classic view for journalists who came of age in the 1930's to 1960's. The rationale for some kind of objective news program, or true investigative journalism or pointed editorials is not made well. There is a case to be made that the public interest should be served, but this is omitted and more creative solutions to providing this service in a one hundred channel cabel, satellite and radio world are also skipped."},{"Title":"Edward R.

Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"Edward R. Murrow was a giant of a man and more than just the liberal hero of felling Sen. Joseph McCarthy (who went overboard on a very real problem of Communism in the US - see books on Venona), which takes up much of this small book.In actuality, Murrow was a rare quality of a man that shined for a bright moment amidst much darkness. His notion of fairness and character is better addressed in A.M. Sperber's \\"Murrow: His Life and Times\\" (read p. xi and following). Although, the best contemporary view of those times - to be neutral - is now found wanting, as no one is neutral - although he was exemplar regarding fairness, even when he went to defend his associate Laurence Duggan (p. 99), who was not only a KGB informer, but in fact, a KGB agent (this wasn't known to the public until after Murrow's death). Nevertheless, Murrow was a man who stuck to his guns and his character and redefined journalism (earlier journalism had a \\"yellow\\" reputation since the 19th century). My father had worked with him in the 1950s at CBS and told us that he was down to earth and a solid person. He was the ultimate gravitas statesman of journalism. He was not so easy to categorize, which journalism since the Watergate era has done in political terms (when the media was redefined by the Bernstein / Woodward team at the Washington Post - decidedly with a left bent).Bob Edwards, who has hosted \\"Morning Edition\\" on NPR, writes briefly on Murrow and tends to mold him in the image of a contemporary liberal media hagiography, but never really shows the depth of his character and the times that were (again, see Sperber).In his afterward, Edwards comments on the devolution of broadcast journalism. His most telling paragraph is when he writes:\\"If there's a Murrow now among young journalists, he or she will probably leave the business before arriving at a position that gets our attention. If that person shares Murrow's background and training, he or she likely will end up as the president of a small college, enjoy the work, and know the names of every freshman's parents. That would be a very good thing and we should not necessarily mourn the loss of such an individual on a bigger stage\\" (p. 165).Another outstanding journalist of that era to research was the Chicago-based Clifton Utley.I still remember those great weekend days when my father would listen with memory to \\"Edward R. Murrow - A Reporter Remembers, Vol. 1: The War Years, 1939-1946\\", those London broadcast recordings of Murrow starting with the memorable line, \\"This is London\\". He would start his later broadcasts with a similar focused-styled phrasing that captured the imagination and hearts of people everywhere."},{"Title":"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism","review":"I remember very well listening to Edward R Murrow when I was growing up. His was the voice of authority. I laughed in this book when Edwards recounted how Murrow had to call the bingo numbers because his wife, who was the social director on the boat, was seasick. That must have been some bingo game.The history recounted in this book was fascinating, especially the relationship between Murrow and Walter Cronkite. The flame of TV journalism lit by Murrow was already fading by the time of his death and went out with Cronkite. Murrow's fears about the direction television was taking was prescient regarding the state of news broadcasting today. He just didn't know how bad it would get.I was interested to learn that Murrow was one of the forces behind PBS in a final attempt to salvage journalism in TV."},{"Title":"Family kingdom (A Signet book)","review":"\\"This is the true story of a woman who hitched a wild ride for time and eternity with a human rocket - an incredible and moving account of a Mormon family and its fight through heartbreak and laughter for an outlawed way of life.John Taylor, the author's father, was in his way one of this country's really remarkable men. He was a Mormon and an Apostle of the Church in Utah at a time when the principle of plural marriage was going out of favor with the Church. In addition to Nettie May, the author's mother, John married five other women, had thirty-six children, and still managed to remain a heroic, beloved figure to all of them throughout his entire life. Each of the six wives lived secure in the knowledge that she was his favorite and each believed herself immensely priveleged to share, even briefly, the life of a prophet.A magnetic, forceful, tremendously enthusiastic man, John Taylor lived through a time of change and refused to bend. When the Church abolished the practice of polygamy, he didn't. Holding fast to 'the law of Abraham,' he took three more wives and was dropped from the Church for doing so.Nettie May knew that entering plural marriage with John meant taking on a lifetime of insecurity. For seven years after her marriage she couldn't even admit that she was married, although she had borne her husband three children. As politics changed, she was alternately a child-producing 'widow' on the underground and one of the elite of Mormondom as the respected wife of an Apostle. She had married a plunger and a speculator who even without the uncertainty of the times would have given her a chaotic married life. John's grand-scale schemes ranged from land speculation in Canada and the Utah desert to gold mining in Mexico and wild gambles on such unlikely inventions as a rungless ladder. He made fortunes one month and lost them the next. But Nettie May had a wonderful and breathless ride on the coattails of John W. Taylor in a life that was at best precarious, at worst never dull.FAMILY KINGDOM tells a story that is highly unusual to say the least, and tremendously interesting. It is filled with the warmth and humor of a big family that stuck together in spirit no matter how hot the persecution or how far they were physically separated. Both as an unusual and absorbing story and as a unique contribution to a little-known side of American history, FAMILY KINGDOM is an important and extremely rewarding book.\\""},{"Title":"Galaxy Quest","review":"I've not seen the movie yet, but I wanted to read the bok anyway.

It is an original take on an alternate World War 2. Birmingham has everything under control in these three books. Characters are unique, real and very human. No superheroes here. His vision of an Alternate World War 2 is very well articulated and flawless in detail. I would highly recommend giving these books a read."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This story like its the first one in the series was well thought out and planned. I mean the time travelers developing the Ak-47 in three different locations, the Japanese invade Australia but its a trick to waste the future weapons then they hit the Allies with the Surprise and invade Hawii. While this happens The Nazis prepare to do a copy of D-day and hit England with a full invasion with only one future ship stopping them and the RAF of course along with the NAvy, army and some special help from old and new SAS. The characters are very well thought out and many are explained as if right out of the History book like Hoover being gay or Hitler showing how trully nuts and crazy he really was. This is a great book i trully recommended it and cannot wait for book three to find out how the allies and there timetraveler allies beat the axis and maybe the Soviets for good measure."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Note. You need to have read volume one for this volume to make sense.So, this is volume 2 of JB's trilogy. I read and reviewed the first volume and found it good but flawed. It was good in that it made some interesting philosophical comment about the problems civilisations at two different stages of development meeting. It was flawed in that the large number of parallel story lines made progress and comprehension difficult.Sorry JB, but the problem of a huge number of parallel story lines continues in book 2. I found reading volume two to be much heavier going. I could only read it in short bursts. The slow progress in plot meant that the book just didn't engage me. It was like watching a glacier. Large , impressive but sloooowwww moving. No sooner did something start happening than the plot switched to something and somewhere else. The novelty of the 21st century castwaways in the world war 2 had largely worn off.Only one major plot line was completed in the book and that being the invasion of Britain. Everything else was pretty much shadow boxing and in a holding pattern. There was even a new plot of secret troups placed into Russia that was introduced and then was never heard from again. (Indeed as was all of the Russian plot lines early in the book).I felt very much to be in the style of an american reality program. Always promising something after the next advertisment break but never delivering. \\"Stay tuned next week when we reveal the results of Sonia's face lift....\\" etc ...I'll be getting the library to get a copy of the third volume (when published) rather than buying it myself. JB has a lot of work to do to bring everything together to finally leave the reader with some sense of valid completion at the end of the presumably final volume."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"If it takes Birmingham another 20 books to finish this story, fine by me. I'm less of a techno-thriller fan than a story reader. This is a great story told against as fascinating a background as this genre has produced in some time. The only real question is how Birmingham plans to wrap this up with just one more book. Either there will be a change in plans or, a la Turtledove, a series of trilogies spinning off of the same event. One can only hope."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"still fast paced and suspenseful as the first in the trilogy. added further elements of intrigue with unsolved murders, fbi meddling and what is uncle joe going to do with his 21st century toys? a fun read for anyone that likes scifi or military fiction."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Although the technology he describes in the book is unlikely to be in service by 2021 the book is, nevertheless, a fun read and I found myself more than willing to suspend disbelief.It is the middle book of a trilogy and there are many open threads at the end of the book, I wonder how he is going to resolve all the open plot lines in just one more book."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"WEAPONS OF CHOICE revisited the FINAL COUNTDOWN idea of introducing a modern naval force into the mix of World War II. It was a good effort but left many questions hanging. Some of those are resolved in this second volume, many more are not. It does advance the story a little bit but it does not advance it very far. What it does seem to do is set us up for a big finish. Unfortunately, I am going to have to wait and see how it turns out.Do not expect to have a naval task force from the year 2021 wipe out the Japanese, Nazis and other WWII fascists and communists. While such a group couold probably win the war single handed, this fleet has a few more problems to contend with. They are running out of modern munitions and the world of WWII does not have the capability to replace them. The fleet was also damaged very heavily in the time travel event. When these difficulties are added on top of the differing cultures, the guys and gals from the future are not going to have a walkover."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"although the slight liberal slant in this series is annoying i like this series"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Let's see....where can I begin?This book allows the strange continuance of events in the first book of the series.In this book Hawaii is successfully invaded by Japan. I ask how? With the aircraft carrier Hillary Clinton in permanent dock in the continental US it's entire compliment of aircraft would reasonably have been based in Hawaii....including it's AWAC's. How could an invasion fleet (even a rogue 2020 ship) get close enough for a strike/invasion?I applaud Birmingham's idea behind the book series when it comes to social effects, but the difference in military abilities over the 80 years in the span are simply so great that there is no way a 1940's naval force could succeed.

John Birmingham has exceeded my expectations with \\"Designated Targets\\", fleshing out the characters and heightening the danger faced by the Allies from both the Axis and the Soviets, and that of the 2021ers, whose expension of advanced munitions in Book 1 on a \\"mercy mission\\" has severely compromised their strategic capabilities.Birmingham shows he's able to write a plot that grabs you and MOVES, seemingly much faster than in Book 1, but he doesn't skimp on the character moments. You really believe these people he's imagined or drawn from history would think, act and feel as he portrays them. A scene in which MacArthur's massive ego and volcanic temper came into play was wonderful. Further, the 20th century characters are more three-dimensional than in the first book - they're no longer foils, or \\"background\\", but are meaningful personalities in their own right.While I'm giving this 5 Stars, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, to address a few things that bother me:* 2021ers repeatedly reference their \\"favorite\\" TV shows and movies being late 20th or very early 21st. It keeps breaking that 4th wall - reminding us that the frame of reference for their tastes are not 2021, but our own present.* Birmingham's \\"Easter Eggs\\" honoring other Alt History authors seemed more subtle in Book 1. This time it jumps right out at you. Further, he mentions the name of a certain Amazon reviewer in a very disorienting context, which \\"BANG\\" dropped the fourth wall flat in one scene.* While the Battle of Britain scenes are wonderful, I wonder where Hitler got all his invasion craft. It's another universe, I guess, in which Sea Lion preparations were more advanced.* No Harry Truman! His views on race and historical actions make him an interesting confluence of the 19th and 20th centuries, perfect for the series. Further, as the chairman of the Truman Commission, investigating defense efforts, he would have a logical role to play in the setup and supervision the 2021ers new industrial enclave.* Julia Duffy, the primary female character of the book, is like the nightmare sister-in-law from hell. What Dan Black sees in her.........but these are just nitpicks. I stayed up late to finish the book, and couldn't put it down. I'm very much looking forward to reading book 3, and other stuff from Birmingham."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Most of the reviews of this book at very positive. People appear to give the positive reviews a favorable vote while giving the few negative reviews an unfavorable vote. While the favorable reviews do point out the positive aspects of JB's second novel in the trilogy, I think people should pay more attention to the negative reviews: This book was almost unreadable. Yes, there are a number of technical mistakes in both history and technology, but these are minor compared to the flaws in several plot themes and character actions. I started reading the second book to see what happened after the first book ended (which I thought was not great, but just OK). The stupidity of the majority of the characters was just unbearable. While the discussion of the German, Japanese and some of the military characters were interesting and sometimes well thought out, several main character's actions were just plain stupid. After the Transition, the people of future were allowed to do almost whatever they wanted. No one was cautioned about security of advanced technology, the dangers of the FBI and other spy agencies and flaunting 21 century values and morals in a conservative society? People from the future allowed to personally profit from future knowledge of events? Julia Duffy, a very main character, was allowed to sell computers and advanced technology to the highest bidder during war time? She placed high tech-gear in her checked luggage traveling thousands of miles? She is not the only one who is smart one minute and dumb the next. Admiral Kolhammer and Commander Dan Black both have similar shortcomings. How can you empathize with main characters who displays such behavior? Whatever happen to the use of nuclear weapons from the first book? The war would have be over in a matter of days if they were used. Not much is said about China. How would the Japanese deal with several million Chinese equipped with AK-47s? A turncoat French helicopter mechanic with computer assess codes to a stealth warship with nuclear weapons? Yeah, right. It goes on and on, plot flaws that make what could have been an enjoyable ride very bumpy."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"There are only two authors that can get me to read science fiction, Ben Bova and John Birmingham. I'm a mid-fifty avid reader who was all about science fiction when I was younger. My main fix these days are mystery, horror, adventure and historical. Guess what?

I love the complex setup and a couple times caught myself thinking, \\"wow, glad that didn't happen\\"; which mean it has the all important \\"believability factor\\". I'm an American who lives and works in Asia so I know first hand the possible \\"intensity\\" the Asian culture(s) are capable of generating.

You have to read about nine books that are good, ok, sucked until you get-this!"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The author has picked up the pace from his very good 1st book, Weapons of Choice, and plunged pell-mell into a fast-changing WWII now being fought with some unevenly distributed 2021 weapons, strategy, technology, and people. One fascinating twist is the concept of the major leaders of both the Allied and Axis powers in 1942 using their knowledge of what is to come to reshape the future and improve their own personal outcomes. Another twist underlying the entire narrative is the cultural clash between 1942 views of the world and the 2021 cultures, particularly involving women, minorities, the role of technology, and the concept of war itself. Those of us over a certain age only have to look back to the cultural values present when they were children to understand the depth of this conflict for the characters in this series. A third area is the intense pace of change thrust upon 'temps (contemporaries - the people of 1942) by this force from the future. We know that WWII produced large fast-paced change in technology, war strategy, culture, etc. anyway - now the temps are being pushed so hard and fast that most can not adapt and many actually push back. You will not be able to put this one down."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I loved Weapons of Choice and it's great story line, and couldn't wait for this sequel. I was a little disappointed however. I thought the plot progression was a little truncated as if he was saving stuff for the third book in the series. I thought this book could have been longer and finished the story. Birmingham got a little too smug at times with projecting what must be his personal politics into the book: the moderns are all virtue and goodness compared to the poor benighted neanderthal 40's people regarding race, gender, and sexual mores. A little too cartoonish I thought.If you read the first book and liked it, you'll like this one.

You need to read for yourself to make a decision. But I highly recommend this book and the entire trilogy.This entire series is compelling and a great read. As a fan of alternate history the premise of projection back in time is not new. One of my favorite movies is the Final Countdown which project the Super Carrier Nimitz back to December 6th 1941. At the end of the movie she is moved back to 1981 just before she would affect the outcome at Pearl Harbor. I have always wondered what would have happened if Nimitz had stayed.This series is on the same basis but moves an entire 2021 battle group to just before the battle of Midway.I like this series because in addition to being a great war story and challenge it goes beyond that to speculate on the clash between societies. It delves into many of the ramifications of cultures clashing, the economic affects in addition to the technical changes to a 1940's society and a war that continues. I am interested at how accurate in many ways the authors projections are for a series starting in 2004 about 2021 technology. The ubiquitous \\"flexipad\\" use from the up-timers is coming true today already. The use of implants for both monitoring and medical is still testing but I could see it happening for real in less than 9 years from today and being very common for military if not society as a whole."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This series has a lot to like...the premise, for starters I find fascinating. The first half of the first book was very engaging for me as it played out. Since then, I still find a lot of it fascinating but the plot is dragging, and the idea that with all of the advantages handed the U.S./Allies in the opening scenario are squandered in four months with the Germans/Japanese reaping more benefits is not IMO plausible. But two things are really starting to bug me about this book...one, the clash of 21st century \\"enlightened\\" values with \\"neanderthal\\" 1940's ones is intriguing, and a big part of that would be the role of women. Clearly, a lot of progress has been made...but this book is starting to read like a feminist treatise...really hammering the reader on the issue. Two, almost all of the 1940's characters are just seedy, grubby people...and many of the 21st century ones as well. It's getting to be a real drag. Only a few characters to really like, and they're not nearly as well-drawn as the dissolute ones. And they're just sort of dragged along in the plot by the morally bankrupt characters. This is the main reason I'm getting less and less enjoyment from reading the story...to the point where I'm not certain I'm even going to finish it."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"this trilogy has it all. history, future, action and great characters. does not disapoint from start to finish. got the first one and had to order the next two before i was 20 pages into the book. if a person likes action, war, history etc this is a series for you!"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"One thing in a book that relies on so much historical fact and then supposition, is the attention to detail. Do we think that the American and Japanese fleets can return from the area of Midway with damaged ships, settle into harbor in less than seven days and start stripping the new weapons from the future this quickly? Can we see these two fleets returning to their home ports and all the combatants returning to the complacency of routine so quickly?Can we see the events that take place in the book in one day in Pearl really happening in that one day?Can we see a fleet coming from the future and deciding that the Japanese who history tells us would gladly end the war for oil and had hoped that the USA would craft such a deal after the devastation of their initial onslaught are such a horrible enemy that they need to be defeated and that the limited ammunition that the people of the future should be expended on them?If all the great minds of the fleet could know about the attrocities of the Bataan death camps, and the sex slavery of the white women captives, why did they miss this analysis of the Japanese High Command. If the US had sued for Peace, the Japanese would have stopped their war.This then would leave the visitors from the future with enough firepower to destroy all the ships in an entire nations fleet, to pursue the real meglomaniacal ruler of the age, Hitler. How can one weigh the atrocities of the Japanese, verse the atrocities of the US (I can hardly wait till Birmingham with all the discussion of race and sex values of the WWII White superiority structure examines what the US did to Japanese Americans in such places as Manzanar, but I can only think that we may not see that discussed at all.)Getting rid of the Nazi high command (not German, but the Nazi's) would be a service to the world that any time traveller worth hald his salt could be proud of. It would be a blessing for the world. How many died in concentration camps, 11 Million? (The German with the son with the cleft palette sees it cleary-his son will be toast) How many died from Hitlers murderour assault into Russia where the attrocities of the Nazis rival those of the Japanese protrayed in the book.One thing that is bothersome is that we know that war is black, white and mostly gray. Certainly one can not preach a moral superiority in war. The US killed how many thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki? So trying to show righteous indignation over the Japanese attitude to war and not give the US any faults seems to be an imbalance in morality.What does that have to do with the story...Everything... The attitudes expressed in all the modern characters doesn't gel because of it. They end up more self righteous then the white naval officers of 1942... Then with the time continuity thrown off and some things so making no sense (If you have a temporal event, great, and if you have it cenered so it is a circle, fine, but then to have everything conform to that circle so the heroes (you know, the US) ends up with the greater amount of power, and the bad guys end up with a little bit, but only because then the circle has to not be a circle, though everything was in the circle... That is a part of physics that doesn't make sense just for a plot device, bad form...)"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but I found no such improvement when trying to read this one.I figured I owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel.What can I say, for all the hype, this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'Creative Class'. Politically Correct. As subtle as a Hammer. As narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative.

The action is non-stop, but that takes a back seat to the sides rushing to gain a nuclear edge. What is interesting is the outcome is known so leaders try to avoid, enhance, or modify pivotal events in an intriguing paradoxical look at an alleged known future.

None of the books in the series disappointed me.The full \\"Axis of Time\\" trilogy isWeapons of ChoiceDesignated TargetsFinal ImpactIn the first book, \\"Weapons of Choice\\" a multinational carrier battle fleet from the 21st century is accidentally sent back in time to 1942 when a scientific experiment goes wrong. They arrive in the middle of the US fleet which would have been about to win the battle of Midway, which immediately causes a major \\"friendly fire\\" incident; meanwhile the Japanese fleet which should have been sunk gets wind that something very odd is happening and escapes.A different story in which a military unit was sent back to World War II might have given them a dilemma; should they intervene on the allied side, or try to minimise their impact in the hope of getting back through the wormhole to their own time without changing the past? Birmingham never gave his characters that option, as their arrival itself changed events beyond any hope of putting the timeline back in place. In this book his 21st century characters are struggling to make the best of the world they now find themselves in.What happened at Midway was bad enough, although the the arrival on the Western side of a 21st century carrier battle group is more than enough compensation. But a second problem is that, while the great majority of the multinational force is thrown back as a unit and arrive together, one or two ships turn up in other parts of the world and are captured by bad guys so that some modern technology and knowledge of the future which would have happened fell into the hands of the Soviet Union, Imperial Japanese, and Nazis. Once they have overcome their disbelief, Stalin, Hitler, and Imperial Japanese alike resolve not to repeat the mistakes which in our timeline consigned them to the dustbin of history.The men and women from the 21st Century face a continuing struggle both to adapt to the very difficult world they find themselves in, and to persuade the \\"temps\\" (short for contemporary) from their own side to accept such things as an African-American U.S. Marine colonel, and a Royal Navy Commander who is a half-asian woman. I would like to think that my parents and grandparents' generations would have treated members of the 21st century forces better than they are treated in this book: however, no doubt that Mr Birmingham is right that some people would have treated them well and others very badly. The treatment of J Edgar Hoover, who is very prejudiced against the 21st century people and makes a real nuisance of himself, is quite entertaining.Mr Birmingham takes the view that Japanese members of the multinational force, and other people in an anomalous position such as a 21st century Russian special forces officer, would regard the current rulers of their home countries as tyrants and put loyalty to their 21st century comrades before loyalty to country. However, the \\"temps\\" have great difficulty trusting Japanese and this is perhaps the worst of the many problems with the multinational force have in getting on with their new allies.The action scenes in the book are very well done and make it almost impossible to put down; there is also some excellent use of humour. One of the members of the multinational force from the 21st Century is Prince Harry, who has become a Colonel in the S.A.S; throughout the trilogy there are some amusing lines and situations involving him.None of the books in this trilogy are suitable for those of a squeamish disposition. Faced with Axis and Soviet powers who have become even more cruel and ruthless in their desperation to avoid defeat, the allies have to be almost equally brutal to defeat them. I can't remember reading a story in which the \\"good\\" guys kill so many millions of innocent people since E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensman series. (More so even than in the real WW2, which is saying something.) Birmingham rarely goes for the easy answer and this is a series in which horrible things often happen to good people - and in which good people do horrible things.Nevertheless, if you are into alternative history or war stories, and provided you are not squeamish, you will very probably enjoy the \\"Axis of Time\\" trilogy."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Warning! Below, I discuss some elements of the plot. If you do not wish to know these before reading the book, please skip this review.To a science fiction reader, Birmingham's trilogy will be inevitably compared to Turtledove's World War series. Both posit beings appearing in the Second World War, with advanced technology. Each series then draws out how historical figures and purely fictional characters might then respond, and the rippling effects in the course of the war. In Birmingham's series, the beings are humans from the 21st teens. A key difference is that in Turtledove's books, the Allies are trying to play catchup to the newcomers (Lizards), so the human perspective is from the technological inferior. While in Birmingham's books, the Allies have the technology edge while the Axis is attempting to close it.This second book shows Birmingham avoiding a potential pitfall in the first book. There, the 1940s Allies received the overwhelming bulk of 21st century personnel and ships. Enough to make a huge difference, given enough time for the Allies (mostly the US) to make and deploy advanced weapons. Why then the need for a second or third book?Well, this book constantly emphasises the newcomers running low on munitions. Plus the Axis reacts vastly differently from our actual history, because they are aware of how they were defeated in that timeline, and that time itself is against them, if the Allies fully mobilise. This is made easier for them since in 1942 they still tend to dominate the battlefronts.Birmingham uses this to keep a balance of parity and tension in the global scenario. En route, he depicts three invasions that never happened in our history. Britain, Hawaii and Australia. A surfeit of interest to the reader. Each of these has been speculated upon, and indeed wargamed by militaries and amateurs. Entire books have been written on the British and Hawaii cases. Rare indeed to have one book cover all these.Which does lead to frustration. Each invasion could quite easily have been the subject of a book. The coverage in Designated Targets might make you yearn for far more detail.There are some subtleties in the book that add depth to the human aspects. In one scene, a Vietnamese Australian from the 21st deals with 2 white Aussies from the 40s. She thinks initially they might be prejuidiced (those were the years of the White Australia Policy). But they are depicted as very knowledgeable of Asian cultures. In other scenes are Germans from the 21st, who reject the Nazi ideology, in a kulturekampf with their 40s countrymen.Birmingham acknowledges the advice of several others, including Steve Stirling. Fans of the latter should look for 2 references in the narrative that point to Stirling.Frankly, while this series is meant as a trilogy, Birmingham might be doing it and himself a serious disservice. It has wide enough canvas (the entire world) to be unfolded as a longer series. There is precedent for this, in what Turtledove did with his World War and Civil War series. Each may have started off as a trilogy. But the reader response was strong enough to warrant a continued exposition. Given that Designated Targets ends with a lot unresolved, this series might still be extended."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The violent and contentious clash of the worlds of 2021 and 1942 continues in Designated Targets. Birmingham has an excellent imagination and has created an alternate and time-altered world that is full of surprises and interesting scenarios. Incredibly advanced weapons and technology enter the picture and awe the twentieth centry \\"temps\\" (for contempories), but these resources are finite because the weapons or ordnance cannot be replaced until the production capabilities of contemporary world catches up. Thus it becomes a contest of whether modern technology can outlast the mid-twentieth century hordes. Most of the modern weaponry ended up in Allied hands, but the Axis threaten to use their smaller share very effectively. Meanwhile, the piece snatched by the Soviet Union is unknown to the other powers and should enter the story in volume three of the series.Although Designated Targets centers on the effect of the \\"transition\\" on World War II, this clash is not just the Axis and Allies with more advanced weapons under the guidance of the future visitors. As was the cases with the first in the series, the people of the two eras often find the others' social mores from smoking in public areas to women and racial integration repulsive or backward. This tension is always present and always has the potential of turning violent. Birmingham, on the whole, is very hard on the people of 1942. Although he is often correct in portraying the racism and intolerance of the time, the reader should remember that much of what we consider progressive got a huge boost from this generation. The civil rights movement, womens' liberation, the sixties etc. did not emerge from a vacuum. There are also a number of plot holes that have been brought up in other reviews. However, this series should not be taken too seriously because it is a fanciful look at what is in all probability an impossible \\"what-if.\\" For aficionados of the genre, Designated Targets is a must read."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I bought John Birmingham's first book Weapons of Choice while waiting for my younger brother to finish an eye appoinment. After finishing the first book I eagerly awaited the sequal. Now I have it!Designated Targets is just as good as Weapons of Choice! We find Admiral Kolhammer and his group of 21st Cenutry warriors stuck facing a new Axis grand scheme, an invasion of Australia by Japan, and a coming invasion of England by German forces fresh from the now quiet Eastern Front. Besides the problems aboard, the time travels face ridcule and supiscion at home.The battle sceens and tech explainations are first rate as usual and the characters are well described and fleshed out. Karen Halabi's tension with the rest of the Royal Navy are an example. Some of the plotlines though in stroy could have gotten one or two more mentions before the book ends, but I'm assuming that they we come up again in the next book.One of the things that makes Birmingham's books stand out is the fact that the time travels aren't accepted fully. This conficlt plays out between Hoover and Kolhammer slowly but in the right way.So stop reading my review and go pick up a copy! Order from the site above ya already!"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Wow, what a ride! I haven't enjoyed a series this much since Bill Forstchen's \\"Lost Regiment\\". Can't wait for book 3. John Birmingham really brings the characters to life. The story is fascinating and thought provoking at every turn. As a WWII history buff I am continually amazed at Birmingham's ability to explore ramifications of \\"The Transition\\" that I never would have thought of. And so far these ramifications seem very plausible (as well as very scary). The author has obviously spent an enormous amount of time and energy researching and developing his ideas.My only nit-pick is I am somewhat doubtful military technology will be as advanced as depicted by the year 2021. But then again maybe it will be, if terrorist acts grow in frequency and violence. War is an extremely strong driver of technological advancement, as was seen in WWII!Way to go John Birmingham. This gets my highest rating! 5 stars all the way!www.donrose.net"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Any student of WWII wonders \\"What if?\\". This series does that and more. The technical differences of the near future compared to the past coming to play in the past, as well as the social issues makes for a great read. You don't want the book to end. I'm really looking forward to the next book and wish a publishing date for it could be advertised."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"It seems to me that you can't take a novel like this too seriously, as with a film like \\"Independence Day\\" it aims to provide a short fix of entertainment, not to say anything too profound. As with the first in the series, this it does very well. After a slow start, I got drawn in and loved almost every page of it. The good fun extends from two Japanese invasions, one of Australia, the other of Hawaii, to the super stealth HMS Trident with the assistance of No. 303 (Polish)Squadron RAF Fighter Command defeating the 1941 attempted Nazi invasion of Britain, to Prince Harry (Major SAS) seeing off an attempted nazi air landing in Surrey, and preventing the assasination of Winston Churchill by Otto Skorzeny in time for Fish and Chips.Look - what more do you want from this sort of story? I don't understand those who got hot under the collar about the super carrier being named after Hilary Clinton - don't you know when you're being wound-up? As for the reference made by the nazis to the NZ Maoris, it is probably fairly representative as to how nazis of the 1940s would have expressed themselves.Rattling good yarn. Recomended."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I found this book while killing some time in a bookstore. Even tho' it was the second volume of a trilogy, and the first volume wasn't available, I took the plunge anyway. I have not been disappointed in the decently-paced and better-than-usual alternate history aspect of this tale. I'm burned out on Harry Turtledove, so I was pleasantly surprised by Birmingham's easy to read prose. The plot line is NOT telegraphed ahead, and a lot of the chaacters are well developed to a point where readers can actually identify with them.There are a few \\"clunkers\\" as semi-major characters, but I have enjoyed the careful weaving of many recent day celebrities (i.e.: Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and John Kennedy) into the fabric of the story.I will read the entire series without fail.

Looked forward to each evenings read. Rarely give 5 stars but both books in this series deserve it. This is a light read, you are not going to expand your horizons. A little weak in research. Author has a surgeon ranked as a major in the Marine Corps. The Marines don't have medical staff, all are navy so rank would be Lt Commander. Didn't know navy cross was second highest award in naval service. Little stuff like that is often annoying to me but the book was such a fun read it far overcomes this trivia. Looking forward to third in series."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"As a follow on from Weapons of Choice, this was a rollicking good yarn. John birmingham has a natural flair for telling a good tale, combined with the use of past and present notable people in our society. He not only makes the scenario believable, but presents it with a twist that has you imagining this could have happened. As he has presented a story based on true history complete with the characters involved, it brings the story truly to life. I am looking forward to the third book in the trilogy, only wish it was out already."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The author showed tremendous imagination in the first book in this trilogy. In that book, newcomers showed up from several decades into the future, in the middle of a war (near Midway, in 1942). In this book, which is somewhat shorter, we get to see the war play itself out towards its natural outcome, sort of. Well, of course, there are a couple of minor twists, such as the Japanese invasion of Hawaii. And the book does hold one's interest. But we don't have anything like the array of surprises we were treated to in that first book.I liked this book, and I'm still waiting for the conclusion!"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm only giving this three stars. The first book was a 5 star.The reason is that it takes a while to really get into Book 2 and a lot of it seems . . fluffy and non related. About halfway throught the book the military aspect starts to pull things together and FINALLY the book takes off.With that said - I can't wait untill I get book 3."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Second books in a trilogy traditionally leave a lot of issues unsettled. Designated Targets does that on steroids, stopping with little but unfinished issues and questions. That lack of resolution is extremely frustrating--but also a guarantee I'll buy the next book.This book basically covers events in the month of October, 1942, setting up action for 1943 and possibly 1944 in the concluding volume, assuming the trilogy does not turn into several volumes.Designated Targets does adhere to the premise set in the first book, although the continued revealation of what happened to some of the ships in the 2021 fleet does lend a \\"Deus ex machina\\" feel to the story. As with the first book in the series, Designated Targets, continues to be stronger at exploring the personal impacts arising from 2021 folk and 1942 folk and their respective ideas interacting and conflicting than the technology whizz-bang.One downside of the series is the military hardware described as being in service in 2021 is largely extremely unlikely to actually exist in 2021, much less be in service. An exception is some of the featured aircraft. Counterbalancing that issue, the use of the posited hardware feels realistic as are the combat scenes, of which there are multiple.Bottom line: The first two books were fun reads, and I am impatient to read the next one."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Most readers of alternate history fiction delight in the interaction between what they know happened and, given the wild card variable, what could have happened. In DESIGNATED TARGETS, John Birmingham does not fail to deliver a novel that is a worthy sequel to its predecessor, WEAPONS OF CHOICE. In both novels, Birmingham posits a world that begins in the twenty first century with a multinational naval task force that is the victim of a black hole induced experiment gone awry. The task force is whisked back in time to 1942. Most of the ships are recovered by the Allies, but some wind up in the hands of the Axis. It is the use of future based technology by both the Allies and the Axis that forms the plot driven focus of action. The two books suggest that the leaders on both sides, Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, and Tojo, immediately grasp the significance of the unexpected appearance of the future vessels. With DESIGNATED TARGETS, Birmingham focuses more on the Tom Clancy-like battle sequences. There is no one character whose point of view unifies the plot. Birmingham instead uses a collective point of view that allows him to quickly flit from one character to another. Besides the world leaders on both sides, he gives considerable page time to minor characters who impact on the plot. The primary example of this type is Admiral Kolhammer, the leader of the fleet from the future. From his eyes, the reader can see a clash that involves not only conflicting gunpower but also conflicting philosophy. No one on either side seems upset at the paradoxes that the future fleet are causing to the unfolding world of the 21st century. Rather, the conflict is mostly sociological. How can the visitors from the future meld with the racist mentalities of the past? The visitors have a number of politically incorrect ethnics in positions of power. They have women and blacks as commanding officers. Further, their enemies are not limited to those wearing swastikas and the rising sun. There are plenty of contemporary movers and shakers who would like to eliminate the entire leadership of the future fleet. J. Edgar Hoover is depicted as a monstrous cross dressing sicko who sees more enemies behind him than in front.The novel is a fast paced one that holds together as a unit until the last fifty or so pages. As soon as Birmingham shows a world at war that covers several continents, the reader gets lost in a haze of shifting locales and personalities. He tries to avoid the omniscient point of view by focusing more on a long list of secondary characters who present a micro vision of unfolding events. It is their fragmented sense of bullets and bombs that unfortunately allow the plot to dissolve into unmanageable fragments. When the major power players like Roosevelt, Hitler, and Stalin walk on center stage, the plot flows smoothly and reader interest is at a maximum. Still, DESIGNATED TARGETS is a powerful reminder that people and events that we take for granted in our histories emerged as they did in a way that might have evolved quite differently had a wild card not occurred."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm generally don't read Military SF, not for reasons of political or personal taste, but because I find most Military SF heavy on the Military and light on the SF. I picked up Birmingham's first book, Weapon of Choice, on a whim, and I'm glad I did. Like the other military SF authors on my short list (Eric Flint, for example) Birmingham gets deeper into the thought-provoking ideas that come out of a speculative situation.There's some combat and some fun with high-tech weaponry, but there's also real SF, looking at the culture clash between 2020 and 1940, the effects that prolonged ideological wars might have on our current culture, and the impact of a glimpse of the future on course of the war. He also looks at more military topics like the impact that modern military theories of operations and training might have on WW II, as the high-tech ammo starts to run out."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the series.

Without trying to sound like a prude, I was perfectly at ease with the quoted language of the characters. After all, I was in the US Army and served in Vietnam. That is how people talk and it belongs in the story. What I take issue with is the incorporation of the salty language in the author's narrative. To me that diminished the whole work. The narrative should advance us along the story at a level above the down and dirty.Other than that, it was a slam bang adventure and I look forward to reading more books by the author."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is the second novel in the Axis of Time trilogy. I reviewed the first book, World War 2.1: Weapons of Choice over a year ago and enjoyed it, although it did fall a little towards being a stock military thriller, despite the excellent premise. The sequel represents a significant improvement in quality.World War 2.2: Designated Targets picks up the story a couple of months later. Thanks to a wormhole experiment gone badly wrong, a UN multinational taskforce en route to relieve Jakarta from a terrorist incursion in 2021 has been transported back to 1942. Its arrival destroys the American Pacific Fleet just before it defeats the Japanese at the Battle of Midway. Despite this, the arrival of the UN taskforce and its pledge of allegiance to the Allied cause initially looked set to swing the war decisively in the Allies' favour, hopefully ending it months or years earlier than it would have done otherwise. Unfortunately, this proves not to be the case. The Russians, Japanese and the Germans all capture ships from the taskforce which ended up being transported further away and their foreknowledge of the future has enabled them to make drastic changes to their war plans far more quickly than the Allies can adapt.The Germans and Russians have negotiated a ceasefire and now the Germans are concentrating their forces in Normandy and Calais, aware that capturing Britain before the US begins building up its invasion force there in strength is critical. The Japanese have withdrawn significant troops from China in order to launch a full-scale invasion of northern Australia, forcing MacArthur to divert resources to the building of immense fortified lines around Brisbane. The UN taskforce's precious stocks of missiles and advanced ammunition, which cannot be replaced, are running low. However, the US industrial machine is already rapidly adjusting to the information the taskforce has brought with it, with more advanced tanks (to replace the deathtrap Sherman M4s), aircraft and weapons from later in the war being rushed into production early.The book's storyline follows several military campaigns, notably the invasion of Australia and the German preparations to assault southern Britain, but at the same time also concentrates on the sociological impact of the arrival of the fleet from the future. J. Edgar Hoover's authority has been eroded with the revelation of his personal habits, resulting in him using the FBI's resources to try and destroy the UN taskforce commander's credibility, making great comment of his force's use of women, coloured and (ironically) homosexual troops, not to mention the fact that the taskforce includes German, Russian and Japanese contingents. Meanwhile, the Russian and German high commands are undergoing pre-emptive purges in light of the revelation of the 20th July plot against Hitler and those Soviet leaders who later usurped Stalin's chosen succession after his death (Beria gains some revenge on Khruschev in a rather unpleasant scene). There's also some nice gallows humour here, as Hitler's initial rage at discovering the 'treachery' of several prominent Nazi leaders (notably Goering) late in the war is muted by his tearful appreciation of them going to their graves defending Nazism at Nuremberg.Birmingham uses the situation for humour to good effect on several occasions, such as Himmler using grandiose musical accompaniment to his PowerPoint presentations (using a captured laptop) and later berating Microsoft for its badly-programmed products. Meanwhile, an American entrepreneur snaps up the rights to represent the 7-year-old Elvis and 16-year-old Marilyn Monroe long before they became famous in the 'other' timeline. As Britain faces the prospect of invasion, the BBC telecopies prints of later WW2 movies and Kenneth Brannagh's Henry V to bolster morale, whilst wiseguys in New York City become overnight fans of The Godfather and The Sopranos. However, the Allies decide to hold back on showing Schindler's List until they really need to fire up the populace against the Nazis.Birmingham also holds fire on some of the elements he went overboard on in the first book. The poor prospects for black people, women and homosexuals in the WW2 era was rammed home a bit too often to the point where it slowed the progression of the story. In this sequel these elements continue to be pursued, but more subtly through the narrative rather than being info-dumped every few chapters.There are some weaknesses, most notably the idea that Stalin would agree to a peace deal with Germany when he is told that Russia will win the war in Europe anyway seems massively out-of-character and extremely unlikely. Birmingham suggests that Stalin agrees to this to make preparations for the Cold War against the USA, but this isn't very convincing. Mostly, however, Desginated Targets (****) is a more thoughtful and interesting exploration of the issues raised by its impressive premise, whilst still featuring a lot of action.The novel is published by Penguin in the UK and Del Rey in the USA. The final novel in the trilogy, Final Impact, is also available now."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Book was great. If you love alternate history novels and World War Two, buy this book. Its got the makings of a great book well done and its story goes great and flows well. :)"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"_Designated Targets_ by John Birmingham is the excellent follow up to his earlier alternate history science fiction novel, _Weapons of Choice_, a novel that began with the basic premise that a U.S.-led multinational naval task force from the 21st century is accidentally and suddenly transported to the Pacific right in the middle of the Battle of Midway.As most of this fleet came into the possession of the Allied countries (basically the United States), one might think that the advanced weaponry, ships, and trained personnel from the year 2021 would enable the Allied powers to quickly defeat the Axis, as certainly anything they had could outclass anything Germany and Japan possessed in 1942. Quite the opposite occurs, as the Axis, at the heights of its power at the time the future fleet arrived (an event now referred to as the Transition), redoubles its efforts to conquer the world, benefiting from it own captured weapons, ships, and personnel from the future as well as the wealth of information in the computer databases of those ships, decades of analysis and detailed histories of the Second World War and its aftermath, revealing the results of battles, the identities of spies and traitors, failed weapon systems, successful weapon systems that should have been better supported, etc. The Soviet Union and Germany quickly declare a ceasefire with one another (Stalin thankful for the break from the Nazi onslaught and eager to begin work to avoid being the target of later German aggression as well as seeking to avoid eventual Soviet defeat in the Cold War by the United States) and both Germany and Japan rapidly develop and execute radically different plans from what they did in our timeline.The conflict in the book is not just military in nature, as the officers, sailors, marines, and others of the multinational task force continually come into conflict with the culture and politics of the era. Admiral Phillip Kolhammer, as Task Force Commander, is forced into politics and administration in areas and on a scale he never dreamed possible as he became the governor of a new district set up in California to house the men and women of his task force, the Special Administrative Zone (or just the \\"Zone\\"), an area that not only allowed Kolhammer's people to train contemporary personnel and set up factories to rapidly accelerate the advance of contemporary technology, gearing up to provide everything from modern medicine and medical techniques to assault rifles to missiles to jet aircraft but also to be a region of the country that was under 2021 law, not 1942 law. The latter point became particularly important in the book as while political allies, personal friendships, and romantic relationships developed between \\"twenty-firsts\\" (people from the future) and \\"'temps\\" (contemporary people; twenty-first term for people not from the future), enmities developed too. Some saw political threats with the rising importance of Kolhammer and his other officers in the Roosevelt Administration, his clashes with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, or the threat posed to some corporations that were now producing suddenly woefully obsolete items, like piston-engine fighters. Others regarded the culture of the Zone as a threat, seeing it as morally degenerate and reprehensible due to their contemporary views on homosexuality and premarital sex (or at least with their assumptions about what a twenty-first did in the bedroom). Still others didn't like the mix of races and genders in the fleet, nor Kolhammer's and others refusal to recognize segregation as well as obvious and not so obvious aid to support equality for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, nor his vehement opposition to Japanese internment (or of internment for those Japanese and German soldiers serving in the fleet, seen by opponents to Kolhammer instead as dangerous \\"enemy aliens\\"). While Kolhammer and others became heroes to some, leading several outside the Zone to begin tenuous steps towards ending racial segregation and gender bias, others saw him as a great threat. According to one of the characters in the book, these enemies saw the future (in the Zone) and it scared them.The action in the book is worldwide, with considerable parts of the book taking place in the United Kingdom, Germany, Hawaii, and Australia as well as the mainland United States.I found the many ideas explored along the way very interesting, such as the nature of copyright and patent protection for material from the future for instance. Who owns the rights to books, music, and movies say from the 1980s or the 2010s; if the company exists in 1942 that is one thing, but what if no identifiable ancestor to the copyright or patent holder exists? What happens to famous couples, fated in the other timeline to meet, now reading about how they met; do they meet at all now? Or political chances for people reading that one day they will become president?I also enjoyed the large cast of major and minor characters that were celebrities, some pretty obvious choices, like General MacArthur, while others quite surprising.I have no real complaints about the book, though I felt some scenes were a bit gory, the description of the deaths of some individuals a bit too graphic for my tastes. Overall I found the pace quite brisk and the story engaging and exciting; it kept me up the last several nights (\\"just ten more pages\\" I would say to myself, again and again before going to bed quite late). I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"As an avid fan of the first volume of the \\"Axis of Time\\" series, I was among the many fans looking forward eagerly to the release of the next installment. For me this book was well worth the wait, as John Birmingham avoids the middle-volume slump all too typical of trilogies. Picking up the action four months after the end of the first book, he shows how the impact of the accidental travelers from the future has dramatically changed the course of history - the Japanese have invaded Australia, the Germans and the Soviets have signed a cease-fire, and a vast industrial park is blossoming on the outskirts of Los Angeles as the Allies begin to leapfrog their technological development.What makes this book so enjoyable for me is Birmingham's imaginativeness. After reading the first volume, I wondered where he would take events from there. The answer is in surprising directions. On one level, it involves posing intriguing questions: What would the Japanese fighting World War II do with knowledge from the future? The Germans? The Americans? Birmingham's answers break away from the predominantly military focus of the first volume to areas that might be unexpected but entirely plausible. The result makes for an enormously entertaining read and one that kept me enthralled to the last page. The only problem I had when I finished was the same that many others have expressed - the prospect of having to wait for the final volume of the series to be written. As frustrating as it may be, I'm willing to wait as long as it takes for Birmingham to produce a conclusion so satisfying."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"John Birmingham is a bastard.I spotted Designated Targets just before its official release at a bookshop in Brisbane airport, appropriately enough on my way to a meeting in the Forgan Smith building at the University of Queensland (the building features prominently about mid-way through). I had thoroughly enjoyed Weapons of Choice: World War 2.1 (as it's subtitled down under), and had hoped for another good read - airport style - to keep me entertained in the downtime that you inevitably get in a busy week spent away from home on business.Well, what happened was that 2.2 redefined my downtime over the next couple of days - 'downtime' was suddenly comprised of the compact slices of time where I tried to do all the trivial things not related to avidly reading this gripping yarn - work, sleep, drive, ablute, etc.This wretched, brilliant book completely ruined that week, and for that I am deeply grateful to its stupidly talented author.Designated Targets is absolutely great stuff - all of what we love and a bit more besides. Clever narrative, suspenseful design, well controlled scenario, thorough research, insightful invention, perceptive psychology, great dialogue, and terrific action. All in all, accursedly unputfckendownable.Birmingham handles the action genre as an adept - he obviously reads widely in it, and has paid attention to a range of movie genres as well (westerns, war flicks, Hong Kong martial arts, gangster movies, Arnie, straight out action, etc.). Clearly he has also taken a lot of inspiration from the different strands of alternate history, speculative SF and psychodrama that populate contemporary culture, both written and cinematic.There are amusing and perceptive commentaries on the past. Australian readers will enjoy the mischief of seeing the Brisbane Line become realised in policy, and Prime Minister John Curtin's relationship with MacArthur is well drawn, particularly read against John Edwards's recent book on the Labor war-time PM, as well as David Day's excellent biography. J. Edgar Hoover camping it up in a kimono is hilarious, but also a sobering embodiment of the righteous hypocrisy of censorious autocrats everywhere.Much more chilling is the cool precision with which Birmingham imagines the treatment handed out by the totalitarian dictators to those that history has exposed as less-than-impeccably loyal to their doomed regimes. There is perhaps room for more serious contemplation about how the Allied powers would respond to the same phenomenon (what might be the fate of the teenaged Che Guevara, for instance?), although the angle about how a JFK handles his sudden advance celebrity is illuminating.As for the warriors from the future, the speculations about their hardness and brutal pragmatism is clearly a reflection upon current trends and where they are taking us (the people from 2021 are, after all, either us or our children). Particularly poignant is the scene in which the post-postmodern rules of engagement make even the hard-ass Douglas MacArthur blanche.On the upside, our 21C cousins have impeccable aesthetic sensibilities and wondrous design skills, manifest most droolingly in Birmingham's loving description of an achingly cool apartment conversion in Manhattan. I strongly suspect that he covets this sort of place somewhere deep in his soul, and why wouldn't you? I would not be surprised to read one day that - on the proceeds of the richly deserved film rights - he has found for his famous brown couch a gorgeous pad much like this one.Birmingham has a lot more fun deploying names familiar to us from the allegedly real world, sometimes in apt ways - the spectacle of a soldier named Albrechtson going up against an SAS platoon consisting of the rest of the Australian conservatariat (think Bolt, Akerman, et al.) is hilarious.Some characteristic Birmingham turns of phrase pop up - I'm thinking 'the horse they rode in on' from the epilogue of Leviathan. But his novel formulations are even better. Birmingham's baroque talent for gruesome description - utterly appropriate for this totally over-the-top genre - is at its best here: 'a blizzard of offal' is one of the choicest images I've come across in a good long while, although 'one of them flew apart into half-a-dozen flaming chunks of road kill' gives it a run for its money. Lovely stuff.And in amongst all this blokey carnage and gee-wizz technoporn is a keenly observed conjecture about how clashes of time and culture might play out; how different kinds of people will respond to the same existential provocation; how contortions of narrative fabric reveal the ways in which we construct our world around ourselves; and how different people are differentially equipped to adapt to radical change.No doubt Birmingham would deny putting this much thought into the things that fill the interstices between the main narrative elements, but it's all there regardless - this sort of sub-dramatic contemplation is unavoidable in a longish character-driven narrative of this quality. You just can't write this well and be this smart without getting into the more subtle stuff. Birmingham's people think about their situation, they react and respond, they cope or freak out, they take advantage or take responsibility, they keep their heads down or they step up. Designated Targets is an airport blockbuster, to be sure, and it is fabulously successful on that level. But there's plenty more there for the taking if you want it, although none of it gets in the way of the central driving narrative. What more can a reader want?This follow-up to a highly original and entertaining first instalment is a bloody good job. Of course it's a mid-stream book - I cannot understand people whingeing that book 2 in a trilogy turns out to be, um, book 2 in a trilogy, or that it might prove useful to have read 2.1 before reading 2.2 (I mean, they're numbered and everything, to help us out). But that only means that we have a fabulous crunching crescendo to look forward to in the next instalment. And won't the movie be cool!In summary, get your head into it. It's a great yarn built on a brilliant premise that provokes some intriguing ideas. You can't ask for more than that."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I'm giving this 5 stars for being a great airport trash book to read (the kind where you know you have to turn your brain off before you read it) and because the author's sense of humour/sly quotes makes it fun to read. The expression \\"pull the other one\\" is informal Brit/Aust/NZ slang for \\"expressing a suspicion that one is being teased\\" (OED).Many Amazon reviewers (from the USA) of the first book in the series complained about the aircraft carrier named \\"Hilary Clinton\\", mainly because the future in the book had her being president of the USA, and this offended them. Being from outside the USA, i.e. from New Zealand, I thought it was much ado about nothing.Then in the second book, the author mentions \\"tattooed Maori soldiers\\" and \\"Maori soldiers and their New Zealand slavers\\" so initially I got just as offended as the people who were upset about Hilary Clinton - then I realised I was probably having my leg pulled and laughed about it.On the more nitpicking side, one reviewer praised this book for attention to detail but there are some slip-ups:*when the French sub-fusion cruise missiles hit Hawaii and explode, the author has all the radios, electrical wiring, phones, etc become fused and useless because of the associated EMP pulse. While this would be true for the commercial electronic gear brought back by the 21st century people, it is totally false for the 1940s electrical and electronic stuff. 1940s radios, radar, etc all used valves which are EMP-proof; similarly, telephone exchanges used relays and phones had no solid state parts so they too would have been unaffected by the EMP pulse (a point to note for book3?).* Second, the people spying on J.Edgar Hoover in the Florida hotel mention that they told the hotel staff they were going off scuba-diving. As scuba gear dates from the late 1940s/1950s, the hotel staff would have been confused by the alibi!I note from a reviewer of book 1 that he heard an interview with the author who stated his aim with book 1 was to write the \\"dumbest book out\\", so this series must be read with this in mind. However, he must be getting worried as book 2 is receiving some good reviews here!; still, if he gets rich from these books, good on him."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This novel was better than the first one! It was explosive and daring. Some of the concepts regarding the treatment of terrorists/war criminals is daring and chilling (if only we could do that now without receiving world condemnation). Good thing all of the historical named characters are dead, because the depictions of such individuals like Hoover and MacArther are, what I believe, dead on but if they were alive now, would be refuting everything. Some items were predictable, like finding LT Kennedy, Elvis and Marylin Monroe before they were big names and exploiting them; however, the exploiting was for the benefit of raising funds for the future people so they could win the war and hopefully recreate the device that took them back in time (that may come out in volume 3).It was overall an excellent book and if anything else, learned a lot on combined arms strategic combat and up-in-coming defense and offensive systems that are just now being tested. Good job John Birmingham!"},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book is the sequel to \\"Weapons of Choice.\\" I recommend that you read that one before you pick up this one, as there is no recap (at least not in the e-book version that I purchased) and the novel begins about 6 months after \\"Weapons of Choice\\" jumping straight into the action. The Russians are wildcards, having made an uneasy peace with the Nazis that both sides know will not last. The Japanese have invaded Australia and are holding a seemingly untactical position along the Queensland coast, held back valiantly by Douglas McArthur's troops. The Nazis are massing for an invasion of Britain, and the Americans are spreading thin to counter Japanese aggession in the Pacific. Everyone is also coming to grips with the culture shock of 21st century social attitudes vs. 1940s social attitudes.I found this book to be a much more engaging read than the first book. The action flowed much better and the characters seemed more real (plus it was easier to get a handle on who was who). The sequence of events is quite believable, and I was eagerly turning the pages to see what would happen next. It all has a strong feeling of authenticity...I think it is significant that I did not have a strong conviction or belief that things may turn out ok for the Allies, and the events that end this book do nothing to make me believe either way. Thus, I'm waiting for book 3 to show me how things are going to end up.This series is a great combination of alternate history, science fiction, war novels, and WW2 fiction. I highly recommend it to all fans of any one of these genres."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"As others have mentioned, this is part two of a three-part series, which is perhaps the only grudge I hold against this book. Serial books are what, in my mind, make the speculative fiction genre so tedious. I know that trilogies have a long and old history: Plato wrote them, as well as Shakespeare (HENRY IV, parts 1 and 2, and HENRY V). Tolkien got away with it, and Stirling seems to thrive on the series concept. Nevertheless there is a fatal flaw here that punishes the reader and the author. If one hasn't read the WEAPONS OF CHOICE, then DESIGNATED TARGETS will make no sense, which can be a big problem for readers. That, for example, WEAPONS OF CHOICE is not in stock at Borders Books or Stacey's Books here in San Francisco causes a problem for the author. Mr. Birmingham might be in a situation of ever-diminishing returns simply by absence of a prior book on the shelf. What motivation would a buyer have to purchase a book, if the first is unread and out-of-stock in the bookstore? I like Mr. Birmingham's story-telling, and to continue telling stories he needs to sell books, boxes and boxes if not truckloads of them. That marketing problem might give his truckload of books a flat tire.I do hope that after Mr. Birmingham completes this series he does write a blockbuster (and I think he has the storytelling talent to do so). Perhaps then his publisher will bind WEAPONS OF CHOICE, DESIGNATED TARGETS, and the subsequent novel (to appear when?) together. The whole thing might be a great feast.If the presentation of Mr. Birmingham's work does seem to suffer at the hands of Del Rey's marketing department, his writing and storytelling doesn't. DESIGNATED TARGETS has several interesting sub-themes, one of which is a sort of social calculus: the rate of change and the rate at which the rate of change changes. The 'temps--people of the 1940s--try to leapfrog their technology as quickly as possible. Making social change, such as racial equality and breaking the glass ceiling for women, is more difficult for them. The characters who are from the 21st century seem most confident of their position, yet they don't seem to change at all. Executions without due process are entirely acceptable to them. They have no qualms about releasing future history to the individuals involved. The subtext here is that the culture of the 21st century is better than that of the 1940s. I'm not certain that's always true: sometimes change is for the better, sometimes it is just change--the result is simply different, not necessarily better. Social evolution, like biological evolution, is not a pyramid with the best on top; many times the top is not better, just different.The action sequences in the book are very entertaining and reminiscent of Larry Bond and Tom Clancy's RED STORM RISING as well as some of the better books by Clive Cussler. Many of the characters in the novel manage to break out of the cardboard-cutout mold and actually become human, which is all the more poignant when they are lost to the war, which really does happen in real life. Not everyone who dies in DESIGNATED TARGETS is like an anonymous Red Shirt of Star Trek. This book is thankfully not that formulaic.In short, if you liked the first novel of the series, I think you will like this one. The reviewer here on Amazon who criticized the first book because of an aircraft carrier called the USS HILLARY CLINTON will be relieved that she plays no major part in this book. Perhaps, though--and this is speculation--she will play a major part like the real Hillary Clinton in the rest of the story, which is yet to unfold. Who knows?Perhaps these series novels aren't all bad--we have something to look forward to, and Mr. Birmingham is quite an entertaining author."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Browsing, I found \\"Weapons Of Choice\\" in my local library in December 2004. I thought this book such a good read, I bought a copy. It's been a long wait for \\"Designated Targets\\", but well worth it. John Birmingham has maintained the quality and depth of his fiction, and now I eagerly await the final volume of his \\"Axis of Time\\" Trilogy.The action scenes are as good, if not better than Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, and I found the Characters fleshed out. I am fascinated by Mr Birmingham's use of real people as the Characters in his trilogy, for example in WoC the Australian author Mathew Reilly is cast as the USS Leyte Gulf's meteorological officer until he meets a sticky end, which happens to a lot of his characters. In Designated Targets we meet a couple of Australia's prominent right wing columnists Andrew Bolt and Piers Akerman fittingly metamorphosed into SAS demolition experts, while fellow sports columnist and former Wallaby Peter Fitzsimons becomes a one-legged RAF base commander. I wonder if the presence of Senators Jerry Springer and Bill O'Reilly on the Armed Services Committee will cause as much controversy as the naming of the CVN-21 class super-carrier after the late great President Hillary Clinton did?With the benefits of twenty/Twenty-One hindsight Hitler and Stalin purge their countries of future traitorous elements and the allies are given an opportunity to correct future mistakes, an opportunity many do not want.The depth of research and historical authenticity that underpins the novels is admirable. Mr Birmingham takes you from a believable Lubyanka interrogation scene of Nikita Khrushchev by Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD, to a ringside view at IG Farben's Monovitz facility in Auschwitz where Otto Skorzeny tests the efficacy of bullet proof vests protecting Sonderkommandos. You are taken on a mission with Lieutenant Kennedy aboard PT 101, his motor torpedo boat \\"The Grassy Knoll\\" 101? Watch as troops under the command of Masaharu Homma the Poet General commit atrocities against the populace of Bundaberg and feel the clinical detachment as Sanction 4 field punishment of Japanese officers is carried out, as per 2021 rules of war promulgated by President Clinton in 2009. Be there as Admiral Yamamoto invades the Hawaiian islands with the help of sub-fusion plasma yield Laval Cruise missiles fired from a captured French Stealth destroyer. Muse with Reichsf&uuml;hrer Himmler as he ponders the benefits of a Riefenstahl soundtrack to accompany his Microsoft PowerPoint presentations. Find out the destruction hypervelocity caseless ceramic bullets cause to human flesh, and what a round of Nytrilium fragmentable hollowpoint ammunition does to a koala.I rated \\"Weapons Of Choice\\" as the novel I most enjoyed in 2004, and so far I rate \\"Designated Targets\\" as the best piece of fiction I have read for 2005. Having reread both books, I now await for 2.3: \\"The Last Good War\\" hopefully to be released in early 2006. I want to read Mr Birmingham's graphic description of the Sanction 5 Karma that awaits Commander Hidaka the Japanese Governor of Hawaii.If you have read \\"Leviathan\\" - the unauthorised biography of Sydney, then you know the detail and depth of research John Birmingham enters into. In the acknowledgement for Designated Targets, John reveals the help he gained from the inhabitants of the Newsgroup soc.history.what-if so buy his books, then contribute to the newsgroup or post to his Cheeseburger Gothic Blog, and who knows you may see your name in 2.3 like Midshipman Linthicum."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"The World War II allies are working hard to integrate 21st Century technology into their armies, but Hitler and the Japanese are doing so as well. Although the bulk of the United Nations task force, and the huge majority of its fighting men and women, ended up together, in allied territory, the Germans, Japanese, and Soviets all have their own ships to investigate. Unlike the allies, whom history showed winning the war, the Germans, Japanese, and Soviets know the judgment one timeline's history made on their rule--and are committed to changing it.The Japanese have pulled their armies out of the quagmire of China and have launched an offensive against Japan--but are quickly bogged down by futuristic weapons. The Germans have patched up a cease-fire with the Russians and are massing on the channel, and the Japanese are preparing for another go on Hawaii. If they are successful, they'll move America out of striking range--giving their own scientists breathing room to integrate future technology into their forces.The allies aren't standing still. The UN forces have taken over the San Fernando Valley, creating a zone where their own laws apply. Working with Douglas, Boeing, and other engineers, they are building better planes, introducing technologies that didn't actually arrive until late in the war or even Korea. Still, with so many of their forces involved in training, and so many of their munitions depleted, their force effectiveness is highly degraded. J. Edgar Hoover and others in America, like Hitler and Stalin, see their doom in the future and are as intent as the axis leaders to eliminate the threat--no matter what the cost.Author John Birmingham continues his Axis of Time series with the second novel. In DESIGNATED TARGETS, the axis powers hold the initiative, by virtue of reacting more quickly to the future technologies than did the allies. Yet, even where they hold advanced technology, their efforts to use it are sabotaged by the future warriors who came with them.As with WEAPONS OF CHOICE, the first book in the series, this book is strongest where it shows the clash of civilizations between the Americans of the future and those of the 1940s. Hardened by decades of 'war against terror,' the future warriors are indifferent to death, torture, summary executions, and the use of weapons banned by the Geneva accords. As a few of them recognize, their war has made them become more like the enemy they once faced, and more like the enemy they currently face, than the Americans, Brits, and Australians of the 1940s. On the flipside of this clash of cultures, 1940s America remains a segregated and sexist nation, with a perverse pride in the way it oppresses its minorities and a horror of the future the future warriors display.With powerful social forces at work, and plenty of cute cameo appearances by historical figures (John F. Kennedy on his PT Boat, Marilyn Monroe, etc.), there's a lot to like about DESIGNATED TARGETS. I thought the actual battles were a bit of anticlimax. The Japanese and German attacks were sabotaged and betrayed a bit too completely; Prince William showed up a bit too often to save the day; and the US domestic issues were dismissed too quickly. While a military conflict between past and future generation weaponry would be one-sided, surely the Germans could have done better."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This is literally the first alternate history series I've ever read that is actually a good novel (collectively, so far) and not just an intellectual curiosity. Turtledove's famed work really drags in comparison to this series and Turtledove writes more for the nitpicking geeks than for the general public as does Birmingham. I don't care to go into the plot - enough reviewers have already done so - I'm just expounding on the quality of the written word here. I'll state this simply for those who know what I mean: Birmingham is to alternate World War Two history what Stephen Ambrose has been to World War Two history."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This sequel to Weapons of Choice continues the drama of a world where a battle fleet from the 21st Century has intruded on the world of 1942, with astonishing results. It is part technothriller/part historical set piece. The people from the future have already discovered that the past is indeed another country, where racial and other additudes even among the good guys are abhorent by the standards of the 21st Century. In this way, J. Edgar Hoover (now outed) is almost as dangerous as Adolf Hitler. But the people from the 1940s are no fools and are very adept at adapting the technology that the fleet from the 21st Century has brought with them. With battlelines now drawn from England, under renewed attack from the Third Reich, to Australia, now under threat of invasion from Japan, the tempo of the newly revised World War heats up. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I will not expound on the virtues of the story -- other reviewers already did it adequately, -- but will describe what I liked the most. References.First, references to other alternate-history books. One of the characters actually mentions S.M. Stirling's Draka books she had read, two OS agents are named Stirling and Flint (hah!), Admiral Yamamoto muses about hypothetical turns of events lifted out of Draka and Turtledove's \\"WarWorld\\" series, FDR yells at an advisor named Turtletaub \\"Next you'll tell me space lizards had landed!\\" (that one made me groan out loud), etc.As for other references, here are two examples that stood out for me -- and I am sure I missed many others. In the middle of the book one French character mentions \\"Paris intifadah\\". That made me check the publication date on Amazon. Either John Birmingham is unusually prescient, or this book went to publication VERY quickly. The other reference is even neater. One of Amazon reviews of the FIRST book called a character -- a NYT reporter, -- \\"all surface, even at the core.\\" In the second book someone at NYT calls her exactly that. She punches him out.All in all, a very enjoyable book. I give it 4 stars because toward the end \\"carnography\\" got tedious. I can read only so many times about various ways human bodies get reduced to component parts."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Curses! One of those books that could have kept right on going and turned into a door step. Presumably the author was constrained by the publisher because I have a feeling that he is having a great time with this series, and when I got to the end all I thought was \\"How long until the next one?\\".My hope is that the last in the trilogy won't be the last book in this universe because there are so many threads to follow up there just can't be time in one novel.Some of the things I particularly enjoyed:If you are the effective leader of an enclave of people from eighty years in the future, to whom do you decide you owe responsibility and to what lengths do you go to carry out your duty to them? I would think I'd feel I owed the people of the \\"new\\" universe I had ended up in (and the people under my command) almost any effort to ensure the mistakes of the past I knew didn't get repeated. That is what I think I see Admiral Kolhammer doing at any rate, and I can't wait to see where it will take him.The depiction of historic figures, and particularly the ones that came to tragic ends and/or had significant behavioural problems is also great fun. Can you take young Elvis and still make him The King, but also make him well adjusted enough to stop eating the fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches and killing himself with drugs? Can you make JFK careful and honest enough to really become the great man he looked to be? Unfortunately these are more like interesting digressions from the main story so I fear there may not be enough room to follow up on them.There are so many references to things that have obviously changed from \\"our\\" history, and that make you wonder what the story is there. Hopefully this will turn into some kind of franchise (reading the author's blog he is not averse to the idea) where all sorts of such digressions may get a little more fleshed out."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Firstly, let me say that I love this series, and have always enjoyed John Birmingham's work. For those who think he writes nothing more than alternate-history-techno-thriller-airport-trash, I suggest you check out some of his earlier works on share house living like \\"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand\\" and \\"The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco\\", or his guidebook for the modern man \\"How to be a Man\\".As to Designated Targets, there has been a lot written in these reviews about the political and moral motiviations in the book, particularly in relation to the acceptance or otherwise of the personnel from the future in to the society of 1942. I strongly disagree with the many assertions that Birmingham displays the future personnel as holding the \\"moral high ground\\". If anything, their contempt for life and their ambivelance to extreme violence overides any points they may have gained for racial tolerance.As to the realism or otherwise of the changed course of the war, it is pretty clear why Birmingham didn't have the Allies negotiating a peace with the Japanese - if they had, Birmingham wouldn't have been able to set half of the book in his beloved Queensland! Get over it people, it's alternate history, not history! It's a \\"cracking yarn\\" and should be read as it was written, with tongue firmly wedged in cheek."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Extremely satisfying! A rewarding, thought provoking, deeper exploration of the situations and people we met in \\"Weapons of Choice\\"!Mr Birmingham has not just done more of the same. In Designated Targets we become more deeply involved in the minds of the \\"21st\\" people and the contemporaries (\\"temps\\") of World War II. Some who may have seemed little more than competent, efficient soldiers have real hopes and dreams and fears as we get to know them better. But they have a ruthlessness in warfare, too, that we didn't see before and is shocking to the \\"temps\\".The story arc is quite different from the first volume. In contrast to the adrenalin-filled, explosive opening of that novel, Targets gives the reader snapshots of our familiar characters in their military, political, business, and social affairs around the world. Each short chapter is an interesting exploration of the mix of future and past people, technologies, and information. Action builds slowly until the reader suddenly is in the midst of momentous things happening quickly. The fight is more global in Targets, and the challenges faced are greater. The Axis powers have learned from their 'previous' history and modified their strategies. They also benefit as we learn that still more of the future weapons have appeared in the past and fallen into their hands.If you enjoyed WoC, you won't be disappointed! The only hard thing will be the wait for the final volume."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I received this book on the afternoon of October 28th and finished in the wee hours of October 30th. If it had not been for the niggling interference of working for a living I would have finished on the 29th. As pointed out by other reviewers few serial novelists can capture that intense focus and interest from one book to another; John Birmingham just seems to do it with ease. I highly recommend this book and its predecessor \\"Weapons of Choice\\" as not only as a good read but as a duty we have as we survey the condition of our current world. The research about the era and the absolutely delicious vignettes with Monroe, Hoover and partner, Einstein, and just everyday 1942 \\"temps\\" are outstanding. Yes \\"Designated Targets\\" left us on the edge of our seats just like a good old \\"Rocket Man\\" serial from the 40's. Just cannot wait for the next installment to see what the 21C's do next."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"It's hard to get a sequel as good as the original- especially if it's the second in a trilogy. Birmingham pulls it off. He writes with such realism, spontaneity, and wit, that one feels like they are actually in the trenches, actually dealing with merging 21st and 20th century technology, actually in a room with Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra. We feel the palpable tension of a world going to pot- and we feel this from a nearly infinite number of perspectives.I found I was missing the chapter introductions of the first book, which told me what time and date it was. I also enjoyed the tighter storyline in the first book, without the constant jumping across continents just at the moment of most intense action. But this reduces Designated Targets to a 4.9 instead of a 5. It is still exquisitely written. It would seem that Birmingham has been in all the places he's described, and experienced everything that his characters have experienced. Nearly every character is round and evolving. It is hard to convincingly write Hoover's perspective as well as that of an enlightened 21st century woman fighting against racism.Perhaps the saddest thing to realize is the effects the fight on terrorism is having on us all. Birmingham also convincingly writes the perspective of the 1940s and the 2020s. In the midst of the vileness towards blacks, women, and Jews that we see in those of the 1940s, we also see the cavalier attitude that those of the 2020s have towards violence and the deaths of others- innocents or the guilty. Fighting a long struggle has endued them with an incredible lack of compassion, and a thirst for vengence. It is convincing, because one sees the roots of such ideals in today's society, as we slowly become the children of tomorrow."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Overall I liked this book but I liked \\"Weapons of Choice\\" better. In this book Birmingham continues the multiple story lines but I found it to be a little slower paced than the first and he really didn't put as much emphesis on the emotional and cultural differences as well as he did in Weapons. The story lines don't appear to be as well thought out as before. It is a shame because I loved the first book. It is still a good read it just takes a little longer to get the the really interesting stuff."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"Designated Targets is the second novel in John Birmingham's alternatehistory trilogy 'World War 2.0.' In the first novel 'Weapons of Choice' aMNF (Multi-National Taskforce) from the year 2021 was thrown back in time toJune 1942. Much of this force, centered on the carrier USS Hilary Clinton,arrived in the middle of the Battle of Midway. In the ensuing chaos, heavydamage was struck and the seeds of mistrust sown on all sides. When this novel begins four months later, things seem to be only getting worse.Although the United States retains the lion's share of the information andtechnology brought back from the future, scattered MNF vessels have fallen intothe hands of the other great powers. They are dangerous enough, providing Hitler and Stalin with future weapons and toys (Himmler's anger about Microsoft alone is worth reading the book for) to play with.What's worse is the effect of the painful clarity not just on Nazi Germany and Japan, but also Stalin's Russia that they are going to fail. This causes them to act with a desperation verging on madness. The Japanese abandon China, and invades northern Australia. The Germans and Soviets maintain a shaky cease-fire. Each police state bleeds itself dry in waves of hindsight inspired purges. Stalin will not let the statues of him still be toppled. Instead he wants a massive one to stand over the glowing ruins of Berlin.In the US MNF leader Admiral Kolhammer faces his opposition from those whofear, or will suffer from the change he is directing. There are heated arguments over which new weapons to use, and riots as many thousands converge on the Californian Special Administrative Zone, where the laws of 2021 apply, to start building them. For much of the novel Kolhammer's worst enemy isn't Adolf Hitler, it's FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.In both novels Birmingham has so far avoided many of the pratfalls common to'Island in the Sea of Time' alternate history stories. The people thrown back in time were from a future just distant enough from us that we could recognize them without only seeing ourselves. They are weak enough to have to work with the locals, who are just advanced enough for them to try and exploit the future knowledge to their advantage.The desperation of the Axis powers borders on religious fundamentalism, but this is justified when you realise they are fighting their fate been forced upon them by visitors from an unknown future. Then there are acts of terrorism the 1942 allied leaders are at a loss to understand. One scene of Axis soldiers swarming around 2021 armored vehicles is disturbingly similar to Fedayeen attacking the US 3rd Infantry Division on it's drive into Baghdad. Although all this images are disturbingly similar to the War on Terror, in the context of the novel they provide a telling metaphor without loosing any of their visceral impact.What makes this novel stand out is how it provides this searing metaphor for our contemporary conflict between the information addicted few of postindustrial society and the rest of the world. It is a credit to Birmingham as a writer that he has weaved this into a highly entertaining story full of action and things that go bang. You leave the novel wanting to know what happens next now, not when the third volume in published sometime late in 2006."},{"Title":"Designated Targets (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I really enjoyed the first book in this trilogy (Weapons of Choice) and had been awaiting this second installment with baited breath. I'm happy to say it exceeded all my expectations and more.There's just so many great facets to this book - the implementation of 21st century weapons and tactics in the WWII environment, the manipulation both by goverments and individuals of historic information for their own advantage, the fact that the original history had been twisted to the extent that no-one can predict the outcome, the list goes on.This is the sort of book I had been wanting for for a long time, and while others have come close, none have captured my attention so much, I read the whole thing page to page in 2 days. Its well written, with the story hopping between historic and contemporary figures. It doesnt try to be too Rambo, too techo, or too historically biased, at no point did I get to a chapter and want to skip it. I was worried after reading the first one that the modern day forces would simply roll over the Nazi and Japanese military, its good to see that may not be the case for the final installment (without giving too much away)The only downside is the wait for the next installment! Highly recommended for anyone into alternative history or even WWII history. If you remotely liked Weapons of Choice, you will love this book! It'd be great to see the universe created in this book extend past the 3rd novel due next year."},{"Title":"Someone Is Hiding on Alcatraz Island","review":"I read Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz by Eve Bunting, a book that I did not know existed. The story starts in San Francisco but very quickly moves on to Alcatraz Island. The book begins with Danny giving back an old woman's purse that was stolen by and outlaw's brother. The outlaws were mad because they felt Danny interfered with the heist. Danny jumps on a boat to Alcatraz because the outlaws are chasing him. Cowboy, one of the outlaws, snuck behind Danny and Biddy and Priest opened all the jail cells and they locked Danny and Biddy up. Danny begins to dig a hole through the cell wall. Eventually the hole was big enough, and Danny gets out of the cell. When he gets out he attacks the outlaws. The police show up and lock up all the outlaws.I liked this book because it had a lot of action and adventure. It showed that once there is something on the line for you, you loose all fear and confront your fears. I recommend this book to middle school student who like action and adventure stories."},{"Title":"Someone Is Hiding on Alcatraz Island","review":"I really enjoy Eve Bunting's books, and \\"Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz Island\\" is no exception. It's told in the first person by 14-year-old Danny Sullivan, who avoids four bullies from school (the Outlaws) by hiding out on Alcatraz Island while on a tour of the landmark prison. However, the Outlaws have the same idea, and soon Danny is involved in a nightly cat-and-mouse game through the abandoned building with a young park ranger, Biddy. But will either one of them leave the island alive?This a very fast-paced book and only 136 pages, which should appeal to more lax preteen readers. The setting is perfect, and the history of Alcatraz is significant in foreshadowing the latter events of this book."},{"Title":"Someone Is Hiding on Alcatraz Island","review":"Where to stay alive(Some on is Hiding on Alcatraz Island, By, Eve Bunting)When most people pick up a book to read they first look at the cover, and if it is interesting looking they will probably read about it. Well, the cover of \\"Some on is Hiding on Alcatraz Island\\" isn't as well as other covers. But they always say don't judge a book by its cover. This book is very suspenseful and has a lot of shocking moments woven in to it. This story takes place on the pears of San Fran Sisco. The mane character Danny was relaxing on the pears when he first encountered the outlaws that would be chasing him over the course of a few days. The reason that the outlaws won't to kill him is because Danny beat up the gang's leader's kid brother because he was harassing on an old elderly women.Danny is what you can call a sissy. He is weak and likes to stay to himself. But he stands up for what he thinks is right. When the outlaws first started to chase Danny, they chased him on to a tour boat ferry heading to Alcatraz Island. Where Danny finds his new companion named Bitty. Once Danny was on the island, he thought that he was safe but he was wrong. After the tours were all over for the night the outlaws came out for the hunt down of Danny. Danny stayed away from the outlaws for most of the night. But he finally got captured by the outlaws. When they finally caught Danny they also caught his companion Bitty. It was a face off of verbal abuse until the outlaws finally started to get a little mad and were figuring out ways to kill them. They came up with a lot of crazy ideas, but they really wonted to kill Danny. Bitty was jest a long, and would be used for other purposes. Danny was the one in real trouble. But the outlaws didn't know that Danny was making a hole in the wall to try to escape. Hopefully Danny will escape before the outlaws try to kill him.I would recommend this book to the age group of 13 and up, because it is a quick read and a suspenseful thriller."},{"Title":"Someone Is Hiding on Alcatraz Island","review":"Dear Reader,I checked this book out from the library and quickly read the entire bookin a few hours. It relayed the story of a small teenage boy who escapes to Arcataz Island, home of the famous prison, to get away from a group of bullies who are determined to take vengeance upon the boy. However they manage to follow him over and he gets trapped overnight on the island trying to elude the dangerous gang. The story continues with the struggles and adventure that follows.Though Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz Island proved to be an exciting story, that is about its only redeeming quality. I found the language to be far too simplistic for its comtent. The words and settence stucture that Bunting uses to tell her story seem appropiate for a childrens novel; however some of the content was innopropate for that age group. She also tries to bring in some underlying issues with memories the main character has of his father, but never seems to make much of a point. I did like how the main character chooses to have mercy on his foes instead of taking the revenge he could of had. The only other lesson that is to be learned from the story is that you can make a difference no matter how small you are, but I did not find the lesson at all touching.So, at best, this book is exciting, but I would suggest that you first borrow it from the library before purchasing it.Sincerely,Frank Opinon"},{"Title":"Someone Is Hiding on Alcatraz Island","review":"Imagine your 14, small for your age, living is san fransisco, and being chased by bullies?danny is experiencing this, exept hes trapped on an island that once was one of the worlds best prisons.He tries to find a way to stay alive.Will Danny escape or die?

How do you model a contract? How do you model &quot;purpose&quot;? How do you model push and pull rights and responsibilities? How do you link these to the company's processes and entities? This book tells you how.Rather than presenting a UML model of how an enterprise functions this book presents a comprehensive UML metamodel based on a &quot;fractal&quot; DFD-like decomposition of organization, purpose, process and flows.The solution here is similar to the book &quot;Java Modeling in Color with UML&quot; use of domain-neutral component archetypes--only better if your goal is reusable code over several enterprises rather than a tuned one-off for a specific corporation."},{"Title":"Enterprise Modeling with UML: Designing Successful Software through Business Analysis","review":"This book provides a fair description about modeling for basic business components. However, it fails to be useful for specifying a buildable or testable system and does not address enterprise issues. The models in chapters 4 and 5 are useful only for coffee discussions - they are far from practical for business analysts, requirements engineers, testers, and OO designers.Furthermore, it misses the mark by representing OO design as ontology under the disguise of UML diagrams. I was disappointed and expected more from a book that is published in the Object Technology Series."},{"Title":"Enterprise Modeling with UML: Designing Successful Software through Business Analysis","review":"Reading this book triggers a lot of innovative ideas not only about modeling in UML but also about running and optimizing a business to make it fit for the future.

Don't think this book can show you everything. Instead, watch it as a good starting point if you really want to do business modeling and probably also real BRP. Good work, Chris... but I'm waiting for even more..."},{"Title":"Enterprise Modeling with UML: Designing Successful Software through Business Analysis","review":"This book is annoying. Lack of focus, poor structure and sloppy editing detract from a core set of very useful design patterns for those involved in modelling enterprise wide systems for commercial organisations.The patterns are based around the concept of modelling an enterprise using a &quot;strategic hierarchy&quot; of purpose, processes, entities and organisation (Why this definition for the hierarchy? You'll just have to take the author's word for it). A core design pattern is developed that will suit many commercial enterprises and then detailed patterns are developed for each of the levels of the strategic hierarchy. The patterns cover mainly the static elements of the patterns, although the author does take a look at some of the more dynamic parts of the patterns.If you are involved in the design of enterprise systems for a commercial organisation there are many good ideas to draw on. If you don't expect the UML to be perfect and ignore the structural defects you may find it a useful addition to your store of good design ideas."},{"Title":"Enterprise Modeling with UML: Designing Successful Software through Business Analysis","review":"I bought this book by seeing its title.

CD-ROM","review":"I have never seen such a horrible book produced under the Princton Review name. Judging from the surveys they took of a few of the schools I am acquainted with they may have gone to a drunken frat party at the schools they personally disliked to get quotes for their book. Others that they did like they just had their editors write up a rave review. I am disappointed to say the least and would give the book negative stars if possibly for it's inaccuracy and lack of depth. A particular reviews that are inaccurate are for Virginia Tech and the university of TN. According to the this book the two universities have comparable standards and reputation. To that I say hogwash. Also, under the Virginia Tech review the school is made out to be a campus of drunks and drug addicts who have nothing to do but party. The reputation of the university and the workload at it say the polar opposite. I think for this review they must have used quotes from persons who were either kicked out or dropped out of the school. They also managed to get the whiniest bunch survey-ees. Could someone please name three colleges that don't have a parking problem? Without thinking more than 1 minute. I just pray that parents of high school Seniors are not using this book as a reference on where to send their children to school. If you really want to know the real deal about a school don't trust Mr. Custard to give you accurate representation. If you really want to know about a school, visit it, ask questions, do your own research. I think that the book was constructed using the Q&amp;D principle. Quick and Dirty.

CD-ROM","review":"Being an 11th grader in high school and experiencing the college process firsthand, I have purchased various college guides in the past few months and have decided to enlighten other students and parents of my opinions regarding these books.For students wanting to narrow down the list of over 2,200 four-year colleges, I strongly recommend The Princeton Review's &quot;The Best 331 Colleges.&quot; This book provides invaluable information concerning some of the best institutions in the nation, covering crucial topics such as academics, student life, the student body, admissions, and financial aid. What I loved about this book in particular was its sincere and straightforward look at how the students feel about their college, since much of the information is based on actual responses from attending students. Contrary to other types of college guides, The Princeton Review gives you the essential statistics and information (median SAT scores, average GPA, percentage of applicants accepted, number of undergrads, etc.), and goes above and beyond that by including student reactions and descriptions which make you feel as if you were actually there. Of course, nothing can substitute an actual visit to a college, but the Princeton Review book is one of the best ways to start your college search and decide which universities appeal to you.Another book that I purchased was the enormous 3,257 page &quot;Peterson's 4 Year Colleges&quot; guide. This book is adequate for finding copious amounts of statistics regarding every 4- year college in the United States, as well as a few international universities. The introduction is fairly informative, and the second half of the book provides brief 2-page descriptions of various colleges listed in the beginning of the book. This guide is ok for people who want to consider ALL their options, but it is probably not necessary at all if you at least have a vague idea of where you want to go and what you would like to do.&quot;The Fiske Guide to Colleges&quot; is truly exceptional. Although it may not include every college out there, it does have over 300 of the best ones available. Similar to the Princeton Review's guide, Fiske gives actual ratings to academics, social life, and quality of life, but on a 5-star scale. What is helpful about this is that it gives the reader a modified perspective of a college which may have been otherwise thought of differently. For example, a college which has a five-star rating for academics may seem great to parents and students at first, but then you might realize that the quality of life and social rating might be horrible and students hate living there. This is not the case all the time, but it is a helpful warning that elucidates what exactly the life at a college may be like. Another great thing about Fiske's guide is that his college summaries really bolster his rankings, and he covers everything from the effectiveness of classroom academics to the abundance of frat parties.The last guide I will comment on is the &quot;Insider's Guide to the Colleges,&quot; which was written by actual college students. This book is pretty good and gives insight to quality of academics, student body, and social life, but mainly focuses on the latter. It is fun to read and has lots of humorous quotes from students at the individual colleges. The introduction was pretty good as well, and contains important information for people not too familiar with college applications or terminology.Overall, I believe if you want to buy only one or two books, I would opt for either The Princeton Review's &quot;The Best 331 Colleges&quot; or the &quot;Fiske Guide,&quot; primarily because of the books' forthright approach to assessing the colleges based on various factors, not just academics. And to all students applying to college this coming fall, I wish you all the best of luck."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"Last year I wrote an extensive review of the various college guides. Our daughter was then in eleventh grade and just beginning her serious consideration of colleges. Now she has heard from all her schools (accepted at 8, waiting list at 1, rejected at 1) and an update seems appropriate.The Princeton Review guide is probably the best condensed book for a quick overview. They have improved their format slightly from 1999, though most of the text of their descriptions is the same. However they do give a flavor for the political orientation, difficulty getting in index, academic prestige, student to faculty ratio, and quality of campus life.The Fiske guide is also useful, though my own view is that he tries to say only nice things about each school.The ISI Guide to Choosing the Right College has definite strengths and weaknesses. The strength or weakness depends on your philosophical orientation. It takes a center right political view and a traditional academic view. It therefore praises schools with a core curriculum and a minimum of political correctness and criticizes institutions which have few or no required courses and a left leaning tendency. However, they make their views fully explicit, so the reader can adjust according to their preferences. The greatest strength is that it names actual professors and lists their courses. Thus these can be avoided or sought after as the student sees fit. Most other guides stick to generalities and avoid specifics.Again I strongly endorse Marty Nemko's You're Gonna Love This College Guide. See my full review for details. The strength of this book is that it gets the student to think in terms of big versus small, urban versus rural, highly competitive versus high quality without cut-throat competition, etc. It really helped our daughter know what to think about on her tour of colleges.A few more tips. We found it extremely helpful to look at colleges during spring break of eleventh grade, and again in the fall of twelfth. The essays are VERY important. We are sure that our daughter got in to two excellent schools on the strength of her essays -- and indeed an admission officer from one of those schools specifically told her that after she was accepted. And do whatever you can to get an interview. We have no scientific proof, but it is simply human nature to feel more enthusiastic about a real person whom you have met than a mere bunch of papers. The schools our daughter got in to were all ones where she interviewed. The waiting list school was one where she did not interview. Draw your own conclusions.Good luck. We'll revisit all of this when our next child starts the process in a couple of years."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply!

The Princeton Review articles barely change from year to year and are sometimes so far off it is hard to believe. Maybe the newest edition is better, but don't hold your breath.The Apply! CD-ROM is the most useful part of this book."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"This is a good start for parents and students looking to generate that initial list of candidate colleges. The Princeton Review balances the normal statistics with author and student narrative logically grouped by category. This provides a good feel, however subjective, for what you should find on the critical personal campus visit. Especially helpful are student ratings of professor interest and accessibility as well as summaries on the quality of life. Students rate their school as &quot;what's hot&quot; and &quot;what's not&quot; on such criteria as dorms, politics, Greeks, alcohol, food, registration, etc.This book helped us get past the &quot;view book hype&quot;, and prepare specific, sometimes pointed qustions to asked administrators and staff during campus visits with our son. It pays to be an informed and aggressive consumer. The guide gives equal attention to the &quot;usual suspects&quot; -- Harvard, Rice, Stanford, Duke -- as well as emerging or &quot;quiet quality&quot; schools like Truman State, Valparaiso, Santa Clara and James Madison. On the down side, some student annecdotes are stale (repeated from last year's edition) and predictable (love the faculty, loathe the adminstration). It would also be helpful to have found information on schools with programs for the learning disabled. Overall, Princeton gets a narrow nod over Fiske because of its format and organization. It's fun to read, informative, and arms you with insight to take to campus."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"Searching for the right college is an overwhelming task. The Princeton Review guide is the best of several books we purchased because it is well organized and because it includes (sometimes uncomfortably) frank comments from students--not the admissions office spin on the school. Each of the featured colleges has a two-page spread in the book. Basic statistics are listed in sidebars on either side of the spread, so if your high school student accumulated only 1,100 on the SATs you can eliminate certain schools right away. If you prefer small schools, the stats show you school populations (with a demographic breakdown) so you can stay away from the large institutions where professors barely see the undergrads. Across the top of the page you find the address, telephone and fax nubmers and Web address. Tuition costs are easy to find in the sidebars. Some schools you're interested in won't be in this book, but most will, although there appears to be a clear East Coast bias. The editors are very honest about the process they go through to determine which of the 3,500 colleges and universities make the cut. Some are eliminated simply because they would not allow Princeton Review editors to interview students. What are they hiding? If you buy only one book to help you find the right college, this should be the one."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"To sum up what others have said: This is a great book, essential to any who are beginning the search for a suitable college. However, I have one major qualm with this book (and this goes for all annual college guide books): ratings fluctuate, sometimes drastically, year to year. Obviously, this happens because of the simple fact that it is more profitable to write a book every year with a different twist on each college, then writing a single book say, every five years with general ratings. Of course, in reality, colleges don't really change that much from year to year. An example of this fallacy is found in the 1999 edition, in which Reed College was number one in the best overall under-graduate academic experience category. However, in the 2000 edition Reed was off the top 10 list. I find it hard to believe that the quality of an institution would fluctuate that drastically in a single year (especially since I'm attending Reed College and I haven't seen any deterioration in the quality of the academics). Besides this annoying detail, this is an altogether enjoyable, insightful, and well organized book."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"You can find any number of huge, inexpensive, soft-paper college guides on bookshelves and on Amazon. They contain an overwhelming amount of data (and paid ads labeled &quot;supplemental information.&quot;) Given the bigger-is-better theory, I figured buying a couple and studying them intently would make college selection easy.Somehow I always ended up reading them for hours and still never really drawing any conclusions applicable to my high school senior son's choice of colleges.95% of the schools listed are so specialized or obscure that they were of no interest at all. The 5% that looked promising weren't described well enough (given space limitations) to really choose among them.College mailings and college fairs aren't much help, either. You end up with the impression that every college is a wonderful oasis of culture and learning, and that every graduate is successful because of their time on campus. That doesn't make the choice easier.&quot;Best 331 Colleges&quot; is the only book I can recommend for narrowing down the list of possible colleges. In fact, my son said he was afraid to bring it to school because the students and counselors would fight over it.First, we were surprised that every school we were considering is in the 331. If your student is planning to attend nationally recognized and highly regarded colleges, including top-quality state schools, they're all here.Each school gets a couple of pages, but it's far more useful information than the usual list of majors offered, sports played, etc. Based on surveys of students, you find out what it's really like to attend that school: academic pressure, quality of student life, how many classes are taught by grad assistants, the political and social climate, costs, difficulty in getting in, etc.The book also has some questions and recommendations that will help you find schools that meet your needs: if you want a rural campus, for instance, or a school whose politics are conservative, or if you get solid B's in high school and want a good school that you can excel at.With just the book in front of us for a couple of weekend afternoons, we were able to narrow down my son's prospective list to ten schools, which was our objective in the first place. Our main criteria involved academic reputation, quality of life, campus location, and the kind of students the school tends to attract. I'm confident we had enough information to choose wisely, and a better &quot;big picture&quot; than most guidance counselors could offer.And the interesting point is that of those 10, at least four were schools we had never even thought of as possibilities. And, we ruled out some of the big-name schools that looked great in the big books, but not so good from the student's perspective.Now the college selection looks manageable. We've made contact with the schools, sent test scores to them, and planned campus visits.I recommend this book highly. Even though we're down to the ten choices, I still find myself re-reading it every now and again, just because it's interesting."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply! CD-ROM","review":"Getting your kid into a good college is a nerve-racking process for most parents. It certainly has been for us. We have found the customer reviews in Amazon very helpful. That prompts us to distill our ratings of the various guidebooks.The best short reference on each college is the Princeton Review of The Best (311) Colleges. It gives ratings of academic quality, difficulty of admission, percentage admitted, etc. There is also a brief summary of college life and what each place might be looking for.Peterson Guide is comprehensive, and has long write-ups for each school. There is a front section for each school, listed alphabetically within each state, and a back section with detailed profiles of selected institutions.Fiske's guide is interesting, but he basically has something good to say for each school, so careful reading between the lines and for \\"damning with faint praise\\" is called for.The Yale Insider's Guide is extremely subjective, with different students writing various reviews. We did not find it too reliable, except in conjunction with other books.Likewise for Barrron's Guide to the Most Competitive Colleges. Recent alumni write of their (invariably positive) experiences. Take it with a grain of salt, or read carefully between the lines.Choosing the Right College by ISN was extremely helpful. Some readers criticized it for being allegedly right wing. We did not find it so. Rather, knowing the point of view of the authors helped us evaluate their observations. Other books do not make their biases explicit. A feature of the book we found particularly helpful was the naming of excellent professors and departments in each college.Antonoff's College Finder was interesting only in conjunction with other books.Three books written from the perspective of college admissions officers were very interesting and helpful. They are The College Admissions Mystique, by Mayher, Getting In, by Bill Paul, and most of all A is for Admission by Michelle Hernandez. We strongly recommend that parents and the kids who are the applicants read at least one of these.Another very helpful book was You're Gonna Love This College Guide, by Marty Nemko. It takes the student through the decision process of big vs. small, urban vs. country, elite vs. the level just below, geography, and so forth. That really got our daughter unstuck in her thinking process.Loren Pope is another helpful author for those who think that not getting into Harvard is the end of the world.Three books we did not find to be particularly helpful are Getting Into Any College, by Jim Good and Lisa Lee, The National Review College Guide, by Charles Sykes and Brad Miner (too out of date), and The Real Freshman Handbook, by Jennifer Hanson.One book we found to be unexpectedly useful was Getting Into Medical School Today, by Scott Plantz, et. al. Even if your child is not interested in medical school, this book puts college in perspective for any post-college program.We hope readers find our review helpful."},{"Title":"Best 331 Colleges, 2000 Edition, with Free Apply!

In total, I've bought 5 editions.Then came the time when I actually went to college and experienced it for myself. I'm a junior now. Last year, our campus newspaper printed an article that shocked me. It contained excerpts from the latest edition's description of our school. It was blatantly wrong. It made this place out to be a hellhole. Why? Because they based their review on the results of less than 10 informal surveys.I saw the new edition last week, and again, its description of my school is filled with inaccuracies.

The program takes more than 60 Mbytes of hard drive space, the data is a bit incomplete, the search engine is crude, slow and inefficient, the interface is buggy and not very MAC-like.

Kaminsky hints at the influence by having Rostnikov carry around an Ed McBain novel as he pursues various leads.The title refers to an apparent mental patient who interrupts Rostnikov's visit to his wife Sarah's hospital room, where she's recuperating from a brain tumor operation. The man is naked and ranting about devils invading the shoe factory where he works. Rostnikov decides to investigate. A second case deals with a woman complaining that her son is about to assassinate a Politburo member. A third has to do with the disappearance of Bus 43 and its driver Boris Trush.All of these threads occur prior to the dissolution of the USSR, during the time of Gorbachev and glasnost. Any case involving the Politburo is dangerous territory for Rostnikov and crew. This is exacerbated when the reader realizes \\"The Washtub\\" is being tracked by the KGB.I was so looking forward to another Rostnikov novel that I inadvertently read this one a second time. You'd think I would've remembered that title."},{"Title":"The Man Who Walked Like a Bear: An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Novel","review":"In this latest installment of the series, Porfiry is visiting Sarah in the hospital as she is recovering from brain surgery. A mental patient breaks into the room who, \\"walks like a bear\\" and whispers a secret to Porfiry. Sasha is working on a case where he is looking for a bus driver, who has 'gotten drunk' and parked his bus somewhere. Karpo is looking into a suggestion from a frightened woman that her son is going to kill a Poliburo member.This book gives us a lot of personal insight into Rostnikov, Karpo and Tchach. Porfiry is working to turn his boss, the 'grey wolfhound' from a manikin back into a respected policeman. This is a two edged sword because, though he will be rewarded (his boss) he will come to the attention of people who might want to do him harm. Porfiry is walking a fine line with the KGB once again, but seems to have everything well in hand.Sasha bus and busdriver have been kidnapped by Turkistani separatists who want to use it to blow up Lenin's Masoleum (this is the second time we've seen this one). Sasha also has to deal with telling his mother that he and Maya don't want her moving with them to the new apartment.Karpo is disturbed that after meeting the young man (who is dating the Poliburoman's daughter), that he is 'emotionally' involved in the problem. This being so new to him he has to go talk with Porfiry about it, like it was a disease. Karpo is so upset that he actually goes to see his girlfriend/prostitute a week early because he feels in the need of companionship. Porfiry tells him to forget it, it will pass like a mild cold.All in all I enjoyed this one more than 'A Cold Red Sunrise' for which Kaminsky won an Edgar. Go figure."},{"Title":"The Man Who Walked Like a Bear: An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Novel","review":"In his Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov series, Stuart Kamisky has deftly transplanted the McBain 87th Precinct police procedural to Soviet Russia. Chief Inspector Rostnikov is frequently reported to be carrying or reading an old copy of one of McBain's works and often refers to some of the characters. And as with the 87th Precinct, there are individual detectives, each with his own back stories, investigating different cases. This time out their Office of Special Investigations is looking into a possible murder plot against a member of the Politburo, the disappearance of a bus driver and his bus and, of course, a mysterious mental patient who \\"walks like a bear.\\"Kaminsky leaves me wanting to know what happens to these guys and their families as the Soviet Union disintegrates.

I am eagerly awaiting reading them!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Walked Like a Bear: An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Novel","review":"This is the second book of the series I've read. The first, A Cold Red Sunrise, won an Edgar award but in my estimation isn't as good as this book. True to its genre it is an easy read, moderately paced with sufficient clues to keep turning the page. I guessed incorrectly about the conclusion which would indicate I missed a clue or a false trail was written into the plot. Though I enjoyed the read I kept a mind's eye open for a Chekhov Gun failure, which appeared toward the end. It seems that Kaminsky weaves several disconnected strands of plot into his books and then fails to connect or clean up these strands to make a cohesive whole, a resolution to the story. This is a major flaw, though most likely acceptable if not entertaining for this genre. There is sufficient entertainment in this effort and I believe that if the Kaminsky Estate would price these books at the Kindle level of $3-4 a new found audience for his works would appear. My rating is based on the book's comparison with similar efforts in the genre."},{"Title":"The Man Who Walked Like a Bear: An Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov Novel","review":"As always, Karminsky delivered another highly enjoyable novel with Rostnikov and his team.

It is probably as close to a how-to-do manual for post-conflict stabilization and recovery as is possible. It is also, incidentally, an important contribution to the history of the Balkans in the immediate aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet Union.I can also see it as a useful text for government officials, commentators, and other observers dealing in the less well order areas of the world. In other words, it is a useful political text on the dynamics of politics in failed and failing states. Given the state of the world today, we will pay for ignoring the lessons painfully learned and carefully outlined in this book. (Uncharitable people at this point might turn their thoughts to Iraq).Finally \\"Viable Peace\\" has important things to say about the United Nations and its actual and potential role in today's world. The Kosova operation was a UN Trusteeship regime in all but name. East Timor was another example and other situations appear to call for a similar role by the UN. Given the success in those situations, and the obvious need of something similiar in other places, we might wish to review the Trusteeship authorities in the UN Charter as part of meaningful UN reform.Ambassador (ret) Edward MarksJoint Interagency Coordinating Group on Combating TerrorismUnited States Pacific CommandCamp Smith, Hawaii"},{"Title":"The Quest For Viable Peace: International Intervention And Strategies For Conflict Transformation","review":"This is a first rate long-overdue book, and has motivated me to take a close look at other US Institute for Peace publications, such as \\"Engineering Peace.\\"The book presents, with varied contributions, a clear-cut model with four parts: moderating political conflict, defeating militant extremists, institutionalizing the rule of law, and developing a legitimate political economy. As William Shawcross teaches us in \\"Endless Conflict,\\" most humanitarian interventions are so inept that they create an instant black market and make continuing conflict even more profitable than it was before.Throughout the book, reading the polite observations here and there, it is clear that we no longer lack the knowledge needed to execute complex emergencies, but rather than the United Nations and its Members nations are still refusing to be serious about providing the manpower and resources in both a timely and sustainable fashion. Throughout the book one reads of clear-cut situations where the force commander knew precisely what was needed in the way of people, tools, and dollars, and \\"the system\\" simply refused to provide it for years at a time.The concepts are now mature: Pillar I is Humanitarian Assistance; Pillar II is Civil Administration; Pillar III is Democratization and Institution Building; and Pillar IV is Reconstruction and Economic Development.I was especially impressed by two aspects of the book early on:1) A comprehensive list of intelligence requirements for advance inter-agency planning, **all** of which could be satisfied by open sources of information; and2) A list of eight coalitions needed for Kosovo that could serve as a model for any Combatant Commander: political, military, relief, rule of law, democratization, reconstruction, human rights, and donor.The book comes with an interesting poster useful for classroom environments.I put the book down thinking to myself that we need to split the Special Operations Command in two: a black hat side for dealing with bad guys one on one, and the traditional black behind the lines skulduggery; and a white hat side to serve as a hub for stabilization and reconstruction missions, in partnership with the Northern Command, which is correctly seeking to recast the National Guard as both a homeland defense force and a short term foreign stabilization force with military police, combat engineering, medical, PAO, JAG, and other capabilies. The only problem with that is that they are mostly white boys that have never left their counties. Combining them with an over-lain special operations force with deep inter-agency collaboration and foreign langauge and area skills, might be workable proposition.I also put the book down believing that Ambassador Bolton needs a three star military deputy and a very big stick. We have to clean out the fat-cat first-class junkies from the UN, and replace them with serious people capable of doing real-world campaign planning with military precision and discipline. We need a UN Decision Support Centre with a global open source information collection and processing network, supported by regional Multinational Information Operations Centers (MIOC) funded by and supported by each regional Combatant Commander.Bottom line: this book is quite excellent, but it loses one star for not having detailed of manning and organization as well as detailed budgets for notional complex emergency planning and operations staffs and force structures.This book should be translated into French immediately, for the half of the UN that hates English.See also:Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the FutureThe New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & CorruptionVia Internet: Defense Science Board, Transitions to and From Hostilities"},{"Title":"The Quest For Viable Peace: International Intervention And Strategies For Conflict Transformation","review":"What spurred me to look at this book was a post I found by Democratic insider, Lorelei Kelly, on her blog DemocracyArsenal.org.

He has written a large number of works, some of which are quite technical and others which are more introductory in nature. The best thing about his introductory writings is that they don't presuppose a knowledge of the subject, but at the same time they aren't simplistic.This work is a collection of four smaller introductory works by Prof. McGrath: (1) UNDERSTANDING DOCTRINE; (2) UNDERSTANDING THE TRINITY; (3) UNDERSTANDING JESUS; and (4) JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. I think UNDERSTANDING DOCTRINE is the best because it makes a persuasive case for why doctrine -- and not just feelings -- matter.One problem I have with this work, like some of Prof. McGrath's works, is that he frequently discusses Karl Barth (1886-1968) the well-known Swiss Reformed theologian. Barth was the principal player within the school known as &quot;neo-orthodoxy.&quot; To some he is a towering writer of a more or less Evangelical bent, to others he is something of a modernist. Some traditional Calvinists, such as Gordon Clark and Cornelius Van Til, wrote works criticizing Barth from the Calvinist perspective. I'm not competent to say how faithful Barth was to the Reformed tradition, but Prof. McGrath owes it to his readers to point out that there is quite a controversy about this. Unfortunately he doesn't. (See, e.g., McGrath, HISTORICAL THEOLOGY, 238-39.) For a discussion of Barth from an admirer of Van Til, see John Frame: CORNELIUS VAN TIL: AN ANALYSIS OF HIS THOUGHT, 353-69.This book isn't a &quot;mini&quot; systematic theology. There are all sorts of important topics that Prof. McGrath doesn't discuss (such as ecclesiology and eschatology). Nonetheless, taken as a whole, it is a good introduction to Christianity from a Protestant perspective."},{"Title":"Studies in Doctrine","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a Presbyterian minister with whom I was discussing the Trinity. The minister said McGrath could explain and prove the doctrine of the Trinity. In fact, he spends almost no time attempting to prove it. It is written for people who already believe it, but I'm not sure how much it actually would help such a person. He does all the usual reasoning by analogy without ever finding any analogy that actually works to explain the Trinity. He uses multiple contradictory analogies. He uses scripture passages in contradictory ways, using the same passage to mean one thing one place, and something opposite someplace else. I found it a hopeless muddle, but then, perhaps my expectations were too high. What can one really expect from a book that attempts to explain what even the author acknowledges is inexplicable?It also seemed to me that the author does not exactly conform to an absolutely orthodox or creedal Trinitarianism. At times, he takes positions that sound modalistic, reasoning that the three \\"persons\\" of the Trinity are actually three \\"personas.\\" But then, he goes on to contradict himself, which is not completely surprising as the doctrine is inherently contradictory, but left me unusure what he was really trying to say.If you believe in the Trinity and want a fellow believer to meander around in speculations, some orthodox, some not, in a futile attempt to explain the incomprehensible to the lay reader, then it may be of some value to you. If you are looking for a book to prove the doctrine, either to yourself or someone else, that is not the author's intent."},{"Title":"Paul Nettl: Selected essays","review":"The item arrived later than anticipated.

I read it in about two weeks of bedtime reading and could have finished it in a few days if I'd invested any real time, so it's not a big investment of effort to get through. The authors do a great job of sticking to just the new features and assuming that their readers all know ASP.NET 1.x pretty thoroughly, so there was little wasted space. All code samples were in VB.NET, which was a little weird, but it was very refreshing not to see the same code repeated in VB anc C#, which so many books do to pad their page count.If I have one complaint about the book, it's that there is no reference in it to the sample code and applications available online.

Even if you can't move to ASP.NET 2.0 as soon as it comes out, some of the ideas that are baked into 2.0 (for instance, the Provider Design Pattern) can be used today to produce a more flexible ASP.NET 1.1 application (for instance, the Provider model is already in use today in a version of the .Text blogging engine, using .NET 1.1).So, if you are moving to 2.0 as soon as you can, get this book, and if you are not, it is also a good read for the ideas that you can implement today!"},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"I attended PDC this year, where Microsoft was able to show off their latest and greatest. I mostly attended the ASP.NET 2.0 tracks. It was great to see all the new features of ASP.NET 2.0, but my problem was being able to remember everything. The slide decks area available, but without specific step-by-step examples, even those are hard to follow along.Those of us lucky enough to attend PDC or with an MSDN universal subscription, have access to the ASP.NET 2.0 alpha. For the rest of the world with an interest in \\"Whidbey\\", the next best thing to the actual bits is this book.Even without being able to reproduce the examples live, simply reading the book gives you an insight to how things are going to be in the VERY near future. All of the examples are very easy to read and understand. Every page I turn, I learn something new, about how ASP.NET 2.0 is going to save me hours of programming time developing our core product, www.myKB.com.Every serious ASP.NET developer should have a copy of this book.Scott Catewww.ScottCate.com"},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"I started working with ASP .Net when the first beta went out in 2001. It was so much better than anything out there at the time that I bought an MSDN subscription and jumped in head first, despite not having a job at the time.Weird how history repeats itself. I am working this time, because of my initial pursuit of the .Net platform. During that time, I spent a great deal of time working with it to make slick content management apps and portal sites. As much as I'd like to pat myself on the back for all of that, Microsoft clearly understood I shouldn't have had to do that.The names on the cover of this book should be familiar. Homer has been writing MS-centric books for years. Howard has always been active on www.asp.net, a refreshing thing to see given his position at Microsoft. His team's participation in online communities has largely gone away, but this book shows what they've been up to. It's hard to review the book without reviewing what v2.0 is brining to the table. It changes everything, again.The book is not for new developers to the platform, though much of the declarative programming info should be easily digested by anyone. If you've been living and breathing this platform for a couple of years, you need to see what's in this book. It'll have you buying an MSDN subscription again when v2 goes beta in the spring."},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"The collaborative effort of software development experts Alex Homer, Dave Sussman, and Rob Howard, A First Look At ASP.NET v. 2.0 is a methodical handbook, reference, and self-teaching aid for the Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 Web development platform. Demonstrating how to effectively use ASP.NET to reduce development time and associated costs; improve the performance of Web applications and services; extend applications to mobile clients, and so much more, A First Look At ASP.NET v. 2.0 is a superbly organized and presented introductory guide filled from cover to cover with examples, sample code, and broad overviews -- as well as specific troubleshooting problems to watch out for."},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"Christmas time is here, the geese have gotten fat and the only thing left to worry about is the present for yourself. You mean you didn't reward yourself for buying everyone else presents and developing like a mad dog? Why not grab a copy of \\"A First Look at ASP.NET v2.0\\"? You'll be planning next year's Christmas list in no time. This new tome is the first by the prolific writing team of Homer and Sussman for Addison Wesley and fits very neatly into their .NET Development Series. At a little under 500 pages, this is as complete a preview of the new features in ASP.NET 2.0 - due for release in Winter '04 - as you could wish for the three months before we the public can actually get our hands on a beta of the code itself in the spring.Written against the Whidbey preview code handed out at PDC '03, all the examples are in VB .NET so there may be some change in syntax for C# users but are simple enough to follow in your head. The only problem is that your head might be spinning too much from the well-described and frankly groovy new features described within. There's a large \`wow' factor to most of this book which, coupled to the well-worded text and excellent examples (available online at www.daveandal.net), makes you wish the final release of .NET 2.0 was this Christmas gone, and not the one to come.Chapter one sets up the book nicely with a balanced summary of everything covered in the book in twenty four pages leaving it up to you where you want to go (sic) next. The remaining twelve chapters fill out the detail as you'd expect, but in a seemingly random order. It might be a stroke of genius to push topics the average Joe wouldn't normally read up front to bring them to his attention, but equally it might make just as much sense to group UI, business and data tier topics together, mightn't it? Not that it matters really. Whether you're reading a chapter on its new caching system, its improved security or the evolution of its personalization features, this book does a great job in putting across the main tenets of the new ASP.NET as well: less code, more usable features, mobile platform integration and quicker to build. Alex Homer and Dave Sussman are rightly regarded as two of the communities foremost authors on ASP.NET. With a little help from one of the ASP.NET team's product managers, this book just proves it again.Now back to next Christmas. Now should I just ask for Visual Studio Whidbey, or a new computer to run it on? If I don't need to write much code, maybe I could get a tablet PC and build web apps with a stylus? Bet I could. I'll definitely need the follow up to this book for the final release, then I can plan world domination and buy that penthouse I've always wanted. Hope Santa's got a big enough sack."},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"A First Look is one of the first, if not the first, books on \\"Whidbey\\", the codename for Microsoft's new version of ASP.NET version 2.0. At the time I'm writing this, ASP.NET v2.0 &quot;Whidbey&quot; is in the Alpha stages and not even released into Beta, but already it has caused quite a stir in the ASP.NET development circles. The latest information I have heard is that Beta 1 will be out at the beginning of May 2004 and Beta 2 will be the first release that includes the \\"go-live\\" license so that anyone can host a website using Whidbey.The first chapter of the book starts out with an introduction to \\"Whidbey\\" and briefly covers many of the impressive features, giving a strong \\"wow factor\\". The second chapter touches on Visual Studio \\"Whidbey\\" and then the rest of the book covers \\"Whidbey\\" development and administration in detail. Whidbey is something worth writing about and the authors have done a great job covering the whole spectrum of impressive new features.So, what type of book is this? It's not just a book trying to show off the ease and power of Whidbey, otherwise I'm sure I would have been bored before too long. It's a book that is both a reference book and a readable book on \\"Whidbey\\" that gets into the features in detail and expounds on the properties, methods and other aspects of v2.0. There is really so much to cover that some parts weren't covered at all or only briefly in this book. For example XML and ADO.NET each get their own book. Also, as this is specifically about the changes that Whidbey offers, you won't see mention of anything that isn't new or changed. Again, the target audience isn't the non-ASP.NET developer.Code examples were generously given, and in my opinion, a good balance of small and simple, offering a foundation to work with. One example where I wasn't disappointed was the Client callbacks, a new Client-Side Script feature. The description of it was good enough but I was itching to see a code example, and sure enough they gave one. Expect to see code examples in Visual Basic for most of the major features and many of the sub-features. There are dozens of great code examples that will at least get your feet wet.I have to try hard to come up with any cons for this book, but there are two things I noticed. I found that there wasn't consistency throughout the book in regards to documentation, code examples and other reference information. Sometimes you would find reference charts, code examples, even flow charts while other times there is just a quick mention in paragraph form of a new feature or change to an existing feature. This really isn't as bad as it sounds, the features that have the largest target audience and \`wow factor' are well covered. The second thing I wish this had is a better means of locating the reference information. There isn't a cross-reference chart or means to quickly find much of the great information, and when I have used this as my reference guide for some development it look me a while to find what I was looking for. But, with a few bookmarks and a highlighter this could quickly become a great tool to use as a primary reference for development in Whidbey.One of the things that I appreciated most was the inside knowledge that all three authors offer. They don't just cover specs and reference material, but give information on the goals of the ASP.NET Team on various features, and vision on what will be available in the Beta and final releases of the product. This is one of those books that you don't think twice about its accuracy and correctness. I found the book enjoyable although my wife (a non-developer) started getting sick of me telling her all the details of Whidbey. It's one of those topics and books that you just need to tell someone about and my wife happened to be the unfortunate recipient of my excitement.I would highly recommend A First Look to existing ASP.NET Developers. The topic is exciting and the authors did a great job of covering the bases in an enjoyable and easy to follow format. Now it's just a matter of waiting until Whidbey is fully released so that development with Whidbey can be shown to the world."},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","review":"The scientist Louis Pasteur is famous for, amongst other things, saying, \\"chance favors the prepared mind.\\" With Whidbey on the horizon, Dave Sussman, Alex Homer and Rob Howard, are getting you prepared for battle, as you combat long, drawn-out development sessions and having to write thousands of lines of code. You'll definitely want to pick up a copy of this book to properly arm yourself.Whether you're an existing alpha tester or one of the many who is privy to a PDC copy of Whidbey, this is the definitive source you'll want in your arsenal for the next evolution of ASP.NET. There's code galore, and the concepts are explained easily and well, while still mixing in the specifics of how the next version of .NET will help you become a better web developer.The book's hearty 470+ pages display a tone that is friendly and comforting, which is a plus when taking into consideration the literal piano of information about new features and enhancements that will be dropping on you. It seems to be best read by an experienced ASP.NET developer, familiar with concepts and terms inherent to Microsoft web development. One will quickly welcome the perspectives given on a variety of topics from caching to the new server controls, to the enhancements Version 2.0 of the .NET Framework delivers.The book does not completely marry the reader to the Whidbey version of Visual Studio .NET, rather presenting the code examples in an IDE-agnostic manner, so as to still appeal to the NotePad enthusiast in all of us. Still, the vast and massive improvements to VS.NET itself are well documented.All the book's examples are presented in Visual Basic .NET, which isn't so bad, as one of the key points of the title is that Whidbey's new model minimizes the authoring of code itself, so you can concentrate more on working with encapsulated server controls and optimizing your web apps through intelligent configuration and management utilities.A very healthy chapter on Web Parts and Whidbey's model for the portal framework is most appreciated, and the ease by which you'll sift through the accompanying code just goes to prove how much better developing web-based applications will be once Whidbey arrives. Equally-thick chapters on new aspects of the feature set such as master pages, membership, and personalization, as well as great discussions of the improvements to the existing security, data controls, configuration and administration.The book also does a great job of keeping multi-platform application development in mind, constantly mentioning the capabilities of Whidbey to generate output for both the desktop-based and mobile browser.My personal favorite new feature of ASP.NET 2.0 is Web Parts and Personalization, and the book has a great deal of information on both. The book proves that not only has Microsoft listened to customers and thought way ahead in developing the next big thing, but the title's authors themselves answer many questions you'd likely ask.If you're wondering if this book (and Whidbey in general) is worth it - believe the hype. Get this book now. You'll be very happy you did, and will be anxiously anticipating the release of Beta 1."},{"Title":"Time and Space","review":"I loved reading this! I wasn't disappointed by any of the stories. This is a great collection of stories, I'll definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"I have read most of Thomas Hardy's novels--he is, along with Wilkie Collins, my favorite novelist--and this is the first one by which I have been disappointed. Still, a disappointing book by Hardy is worth ten by nearly anyone else, so let me explain. The ending felt quite out of the blue and abrupt compared to the events leading up to it, yet in retrospect, it makes more and more sense.The ending aside--where the oddness is confined to just the last two pages--this is a superb character study of five disparate main characters and a handful of minor characters. Hardy is a master at imbuing each character with not only distinct personalities, but with the inconsistencies and flaws that make them leap, whole and warm-blooded, from the page. His characters are never stock people; they always seem as though they are people you could (or do) actually know in your own life.The primary character is Anne Garland, a lovely country village girl who is much sought after by three different local men. These include Festus Derriman, a ne'er-do-well with a temper and a lust for his uncle's money; John Loveday, a soldier and the trumpet-major of the novel's title, who is the kindest, most patient character I believe I have ever seen in a novel; and John's younger brother Bob, who is a boisterous sailor with good intentions but a short attention span when it comes to the ladies. The machinations by which these three seek to catch Anne's eye is endlessly inventive and endlessly interesting for the reader, and her varied reactions to their attentions is a marvel of observed detail and the inconsistency of human nature. By turns hot and cold towards each of the men, Anne never seems shallow or thoughtless--merely human. There is also another sharply etched female character, the actress Matilda Johnson, who appears only a couple of times, but who is the linchpin of much important action.As always, Hardy likes to insert subtle humor into even the most serious of situations. In detailing the village's concern about Napoleon (who is referred to frequently in the book by the derisive nickname &quot;Boney&quot;), Hardy writes:Widow Garland's thoughts were those of the period. &quot;Can it be the French?&quot; she said, arranging herself for the extremest form of consternation. &quot;Can that arch-enemy of mankind have landed at last?&quot; It should be stated that at this time there were two arch-enemies of mankind, Satan as usual, and Buonaparte, who had sprung up and eclipsed his elder rival altogether. Mrs Garland alluded of couse to the junior gentleman.You will be surprised, as I was, by the man with whom Anne Garland ends up. Yet now, just a day or two after having finished the novel and having been almost affronted by the abruptness and seeming insuitability of the ending, my position has softened and I can see that Hardy was actually quite true to the characters, their motivations, and their choices--however inconsistent they may at first have seemed to the reader. This is not by any means a great Thomas Hardy novel, but an average novel by Thomas Hardy is still a marvel of construction, of character, and of plot."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"This novel tells of the many turns of Anne Garland's heart takes as she decides upon one of three possible suitors. Each turn her heart takes affects the other suitors in ways which are humorous/clever, but the underlying theme is the pathos you feel for the unfavored ones, primarily John Loveday and his ultimate resolution. Overall not bad."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"Now I know this is not one of better known Thomas Hardy Books. And I know it probably isn't all that well thought of by critics who like the doom of many of his other books (that doesn't sound good, but if you get the chance read them anyway!) I like this because it is nice and simple, about a gil called Anne, who is in love with someone called Robert, who is continously unfaithful to her. And of course you have John, Robert's brother, who is in love with Anne. You sympathise so much with the characters. And, in this book, there is a happy/sad ending, but I would spoil it if I said any more. Without reading this, you might feel that Anne is a bit stupid to stand by her man, but just go and read it and you'll understand better. Perhaps this book isn't a great literary masterpiece like other works, but it is fairly easy to read, which is exactly what I advise you to do!"},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"After having read several Hardy novels in a row recently (I read and loved Tess when I was younger), I am very taken with two of his so-called \\"minor\\" novels -- Under the Greenwood Tree, which is charming, and The Trumpet-Major, which is charming -- AND was devastating to me in a way the more overtly tragic Return of the Native was not. Perhaps because the characters in this book are so much more likable and because of the wonderful way that Hardy mixes up genres in The Trumpet-Major -- tragedy, farce, historical novel -- in such a way that the outcome catches the reader off balance. Yet, therein lies the novel's greatness. I was emotionally overwhelmed by its poignancy; it left me with a deep physical ache. And yet it's a highly enjoyable read -- the novel doesn't pummel one with its grimness, like say, Jude the Obscure. A must-read as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"I bought this book used since I was having trouble a copy of this book. It is a shame since this is an enjoyable book which takes place in England on the midst of an Attack by Napoleon.The book is written as a historical fiction type. The characters are just great especially when they clamor up to catch King George's carriage passing through the village and people are saying \\"King Jarge\\". Even though this book is a historical approach, Hardy is true to his style of presenting real life events.Even though the beginning of the book has a slow introduction, the book takes off and becomes really enjoyable. If you can find this book, a used copy is not very much. I bought the Penguin Classics used version for a few bucks."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"Warning, it's a sad ending. Return of the Native, which I was read to believe a sad ending, wasn't really as much so as departing this book, though not nearly as much so as Tess of the d'Urbervilles, (brilliant book BTW). I cannot say more, other than most of the characters, (especially Anne,) lived happily ever after. However, if you're looking for non-depressing Hardy books, this probably won't be your cup of tea.As for the story, a small part seemed a little underdeveloped -- the story between Festus and the actress girl, (who's name escapes me at the moment,) towards the ending of the book. For a Hardy book it's off and on; slow build, intricate and multi-layered in the middle, slightly abrupt ending. For modern books, this is Hardy! none really come close IMO, and in this is the same style he owns that takes you out of this world and puts you right into the book. 6.7/10."},{"Title":"Trumpet-Major, The","review":"She was walking through the library carrying the university's entire Hardy collection. I already had a nasty schoolboy crush on her, but after that day I was jello. And perhaps it began on the afternoon she lectured on Thom. Hardy, describing him as a poet who sacrificed his art to survive as a novelist. Yet, his novels were not pot-boilers, and Hardy eventually returned to his true muse. I shouldn't write this - let Linda explain it to you."},{"Title":"Red Heroin","review":"This book was written under Dr. Pournelle's pseudonym of Wade Curtis, which humorously is the name of a character in Footfall, written by Dr. Pournelle and Larry Niven. I enjoy reading things from various stages of an author's career and in this case also from a bit of a different genre.I actually bought this book, from the Amazon Marketplace published under Dr. Pournelle's name, but when I finished the book and went to order the 2nd book in the series, I could not find it under Dr. Pournelle's name, so I bought \`Red Dragon' written by Wade Curtis.Certainly this is a short novel compared to later works and I'm struggling for a description--not as sophisticated isn't quite right,,, it almost reads like it was written for kids, as I know Dr. Pournelle and I believe Drs. Heinlein and Asimov all have written books for.in addition there is some political content that shows both how well Dr. Pournelle \`got' things and how while things have progressed in many ways, people are still people.All in all \`Red Heroin' was a good read on many levels, so much so that I ordered the 2nd book, \`Red Dragon' last night; certainly not a classic work like the \`Mote' series, probably a good candidate for a Kindle release."},{"Title":"GOD'S WORD MADE PLAIN","review":"Anyone who want to know God, understand his request and know the GIFT (JESUS) and consequencies if we reject him.It doesn't get any plainer than this writing. Next to the Holy Bible this is a second book."},{"Title":"THE SNAKE PIT.","review":"In the second book of the Master of Hestvicken series Olav & Ingunn are home together at last on Olav's family manor at Hestvicken. Their life together is not a happy one however due to Ingunn's ill health and Olav's heavy sense of guilt.This is a beautiful Norse saga in spite of the depression of the main characters, the attention to historical detail is wonderful. Readers of \\"Kristen Lavransdatter\\" will enjoy the chance encounter in the Snake Pit between Olav and Lavrans Bjorgulfsson and his wife Ragnfrid."},{"Title":"THE SNAKE PIT.","review":"At times this story is quite heavy with emotion, however the characters are so well developed, by the end of the book you feel as if they are a part of you. the authors chooses a very interesting time in Noway's history to set her story. Viking traditions now being governed by Christian ethics. Fascinating and very well written with historical accuracy."},{"Title":"THE SNAKE PIT.","review":"After the second volume of the Master of Hestviken series, I still do not feel the awe inspiring tale that I know Sigrid Undset is capable of. I can't help but keep referring back to \\"Kristin Lavransdatter\\" when I'm reading this series, and wondering what Undset may have lost in talent in-between the two books.Don't get me wrong the story itself is good, the plot anyway, but it lacks the depth I was expecting and I really don't have any feelings for the characters. They're gloom and depression is getting rather old. I've already started the third book in the series, though in most cases I may have put off the final two volumes a little longer. However, since these books aren't very big, I might as well continue on and finish."},{"Title":"Before the Wall: 2","review":"\\"Before The Wall\\", by George Clare, Sub-titled, \\"Berlin Days, 1946-1948\\", Dutton, New York, October 1990.This is short, well written record of the author's service as a translator and part of the British occupying forces in Berlin, directly after the Second World War. George Clare was born as Georg Klaar in Vienna before the Nazi take-over. As a young man, he saw the \\"Anschluss\\" and the end of Austria as an independent country. His father worked to get visas for emigration to the Republic of Ireland (the Irish Free State, as Mr. Clare then termed it), but things were fouled up and the family of father, mother and son were stuck in Nazi Germany's capital, Berlin. Clare uses this stay as a basis for comparison when he returns to bombed-out Berlin, after the war.In a poignant passage, the author remarks on the lack of noise in cold and windy post-war Berlin, where once he had heard the noise and sounds of a busy city. Much of the front of the book is devoted to his memories of this bombed-out city becoming alive as he works in the British occupying forces. The details of simple breakfast, when the Berliners were going hungry (if not starving) and the details of the deference given a British uniform during a subway rush hour, mundane as it would seem, brings alive the occupation of Berlin. You had to be there to write out such recollections. Clare's writing is excellent.Towards the end of the book, the author semi-analyzes Nazi Germany and its cousin state, Austria. He quotes Primo Levi in saying that the Germans were lacking the courage to speak out against the concentration camps. Clare speaks of Goethe and Schiller strolling the woods where \\"... the SS implanted the hell it called Buchenwald\\". (p. 275). Clare doubts that A. Hitler, in 1928, when he was dictating \\"Mein Kampf\\", \\"..could have had the Final Solution in his conscious mind\\", (p. 277) but, clearly, from the paragraphs just preceding, Clare shows, by recounting Hitler's acquiescence to the killing of 380 Jews, that Hitler knew what was happening. Read the book just for this section alone.This is an excellent book, well written and a worthy personal story that documents the history of the few years between the end of the war and the building of wall."},{"Title":"Dairy-Free & Delicious","review":"My partner complained of a lack of options when I told him he should stop eating dairy. (He has a dairy sensitivity and was at the time avoiding cow's milk, but still eating goat dairy.) Then I found, among other things, this book at the local natural foods store, and it disproved that theory quickly.Our household agrees that the cheese sauces work very well. The hard cheeses, I found that I liked, but my sweetie disagreed. The \\"Melty Pizza Cheeze\\" is one of his favorites, whereas I don't much enjoy it, probably for the same reason why he likes it (\\"It's exactly like squeeze cheese! Except all, like, natural and healthy and stuff!\\")There hasn't been a single thing we've tried from this book that *one* of us hasn't liked, and the most valuable thing in it is the substitution information, which allows us to make familiar recipes with different components -- such as the sweetened condensed soymilk recorded here, which made a fabulous key lime pie. (We couldn't even taste the difference.) It's allowed my partner to continue eating variations on \\"normal food\\" that he otherwise would have missed, and which the rest of the family enjoys as much in their altered forms as we do the standard versions. High praise.Furthermore, although this is not an issue for us, I'm pleased by the sensitivity of the book to people with soy allergies; many of the recipes have variations made with non-soy products, which I'm sure must come as a great relief to those who can't have either milk or soy."},{"Title":"Dairy-Free & Delicious","review":"I really enjoyed the nutrition section at the beginning of this book. I've been a vegan for a long time, so I've got to be impressed when a cookbook teaches me some new things about vegan nutrition.The recipes are great as well - as is expected for Joanne Stepaniak's work. My small complaint is that some of the recipes are identical to those in the Uncheese Cookbook. Yeah, that Gazebo cheesecake is excellent enough to deserve getting printed again, but I was really hoping for some new cheesecake recipes! Quite a few of the recipes are new, so it is still worth picking up this one as well, especially if you've got picky non-vegans to feed."},{"Title":"Dairy-Free & Delicious","review":"Whether you are lactose intolerant, have a dairy allergy or are vegetarian or vegan, you will find lots of interesting nutritional information and recipes in Dairy-Free &amp; Delicious. The first five chapters look at \\"Lactose Intolerance\\", \\"Milk Allergy\\", \\"Building Strong, Milk-Free Bodies\\", \\"Superb Substitutes\\" and \\"Dairy-Free Dining.\\" Information is provided that will help you learn if you have an intolerance to lactose or are allergic to milk. Considerable information is also provided on such topics as calcium, calcium supplements, vitamin D, milk substitutes, dining out and travel tips, to name a few.While reading the section on vitamin D, I was hit once again with the realization that being truly vegan can be very difficult - and not because it is hard to eliminate meat, dairy and other animal products from our diet. That was easy. Learning to understand labels can be much more difficult - especially when important information is missing. For example, under the section \\"Does the vitamin D added to foods come from animals\\" I learned that vitamin D2 comes from plants while D3 comes from animals.\\"There are two forms of dietary vitamin D: D2 or ergocalciferol, which is of plant origin, and D3 or cholecalciferol, which comes mainly from sheep's wool and hides, fish liver, and eels. Unfortunately, most of the vitamin D added to foods is vitamin D3. The main exception is nondairy milk - many of these products contain vitamin D2.\\" (page 40)Armed with this information I went to the kitchen to see what is in our multi vitamins. Arrghh! Of the three brands of children's vitamins, two listed vitamin D as D3 while the other just listed it as vitamin D and didn't specify whether it was D3 or D2. The bottle of adult multi vitamins contained vitamin D3 as well. A quick check of some of our soy and rice milks listed vitamin D3 or just vitamin D. We will have to be more vigilant in ensuring that the products we eat and drink are totally vegan.The second part of the book is entitled \\"Dairy-Free &amp; Delicious Recipes\\" and contains a good selection of vegan recipes for spreads, uncheeses, milk, sauces, breakfast, salads and dressings, soups, main dishes and desserts. Each recipe contains: yield, calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, calcium and sodium.If you are a vegetarian or vegan Dairy-Free &amp; Delicious is a good book to have. If you are lactose intolerant or have milk allergies then this book is a \\"must have.\\"--Reviewed by Glenn Perrett"},{"Title":"Dairy-Free & Delicious","review":"recently turning vegan, i decided i would like to have a cookbook of uncheese recipes. though there are some on the market that are more known and reviewed than this one, i decided to try it. so far i have tried two recipes and each were disappointing. maybe i have my expectations set too high? really, for recipes that boast a \\"velvety\\" cheese sauce and soy -less \\"cream\\" cheese, these are a downer. perhaps if they instead had names like \\"orangy sauce that is incredibly inventive but doesn't really taste like cheese sauce\\" or \\"white spread for toast\\" i wouldn't have been so disappointed. so, from now on i will try to stick to whole foods (like avocados)to get my fix instead of the recipes in this book."},{"Title":"Dairy-Free & Delicious","review":"This book was not overly helpful.

I was dismayed to find that this book is hardcore vegan...so not only is there no milk, there's no eggs or anything else from an animal. I mean, if you want to be vegan, fine, but I'm just looking for some milk and butter-free recipes. These recipes called for way too much tofu, though I'll admit the tofu cupcakes were good. But by and large, unless you are really committed to the vegan lifestyle, I'd look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Reason and emotion","review":"This book is a collection of essays that Macmurray delivered as radio addresses for the BBC in the 1930's. They are fairly basic, but nevertheless challenging to both traditional philosophy and common assumptions. His redefinition of religion as the practical effort to produce a universal community, rather to merely reiterate traditional dogmas, is magnificent.Macmurray also deals with the role of science and art and their relation to religion. He sees each one as rooted in basic human experience and vital to the future of society. I have re-read all of his books over the years, except those that are out-of-print and hard to find, except in libraries."},{"Title":"Reason and emotion","review":"Timeless...thought provoking...perfect for anyone wanting to clarify their own philosophy.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Explaining Society: An Introduction to Critical Realism in the Social Sciences (Critical Realism: Interventions)","review":"Explaining Society is geared primarily for those in the social science field and thus makes for a rather hard and technical read. In it, the philosophical framework (or, in social science jargon, the meta-theory) of critical realism is introduced and then helpfully explained. The book then spends a few chapters showing how critical realist thinking can be applied to on the ground social scientific research.Critical realism is slowly becoming an important meta-theoretical framework (particularly in Sociology) with scholars such as Phil Gorski, Christian Smith, and Margaret Archer as leading proponents. That said, this is the most accessible introduction to the topic and its usefulness. If you are in the discipline, it is certainly worth reading and probably worth owning. If you aren't, this would only be for the most adventurous. If you are just philosophically minded and want to know more about critical realism, you are better off just heading straight for Roy Bhaskars' works (or Christian Smith's 2010 release)."},{"Title":"Explaining Society: An Introduction to Critical Realism in the Social Sciences (Critical Realism: Interventions)","review":"Danermark et al.'s guide to critical realism is excellent for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

Thirty-six pages constitutes a pamphlet. \\"Paperback\\" is a misleading description. I could have downloaded this information much less expensively."},{"Title":"The Anabaptist vision","review":"This is one of the first books I read as an intro to Anabaptism. Initially it answered many of my nagging doubts regarding modern evangelicalism. It also fired me up and got me really excited about following the Bible and the words of Jesus literally. If you know nothing about Anabaptists, Amish or Mennonites then this book is for you. Well worth the few quid you spend on it. It's a great book. the book that kind of clinched it for me really in my decision to become Amish-Mennonite. though when I got there I found modern day Anabaptism is not what I thought it was or what historical Anabaptism was.I went the way of so many. Looking for the perfect Church according to my own set of standards of what perfect is. Like so many I didn't find it. Many end up leaving the Church and just heading out on their own with their family. Others try to recreate the Church and end up like the groups they despise.I tried a different route. Find the Church of the first century, locate it on earth today. Join it, and submit myself to it. What I found wasn't necessarily what I was comfortable with, but it is the Church that Jesus established through His Apostles, sinners and all! The Orthodox Church doesn't have the prettiest history, but neither does ancient Judaism, yet Jesus said the people of his day regarding the pharisees, and I paraphrase \\"do what they say, but don't do what they do, for they sit in the seat of Moses.\\" Now if he could say that about the hypocritical pharisees, how much more the successors of the Apostles, the men who sit in their seats? And there are plenty of righteous men in the Orthodox Church, past and present.Schism is a great sin, numbered right up there with adultery and murder. The Anabaptist Church is infamous for it's history of schism. If you are searching for the truth, I encourage you to consider Orthodoxy. A good book to start with is eitherThe Way: What Every Protestant Should Know about the Orthodox ChurchorBecoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith."},{"Title":"Millennium's Dawn","review":"This is an excellent example of the thriller, but with moral overtones.

It's shocking to know that a well-known publishing company and God-knows how many universities require this book for their students. Does Popham want us future teachers to call our students CLUCKS! This is outrageous! This makes our educational system appear like a circus. I don't care how proficient an English teacher Popham is, in my book, Popham is an anti-educator. Inferior mental processes have no space in our schools.

Chapter by chapter, he takes the reader through the different kinds of test questions, how to write them, how to grade them, how to tell if your students understand what you're asking; then he provides case studies, examples, and lists of further reading.The easy kinds of questions come first: selected-response, that is, questions where the test-taker picks an answer from ones provided by the teacher, such as multiple-choice, true-false, and matching. Popham explains how to write these clearly, how to reduce the confusion on the direction of true-false questions (and why it's NOT a good idea to try and &quot;trick&quot; your students by writing ambiguous or deliberately confusing answers).Then the constructed-response type of questions, that is, ones where students write the answers: short-answer and essay. Again, Popham discusses how to write these clearly, how to write instructions indicating what kind of answer you expect, and, perhaps most important, especially for the novice teacher, how to grade these types of questions. He goes through the issue of &quot;rubrics&quot; - grading systems for essay questions which tell how many points will be given for different features of the answer, such as the value of the information, the spelling and grammar, the use of certain key words, etc, and how to decide what will constitute an &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;not acceptable&quot; answer in those categories.One of the most extensive and informative features of the book is Popham's sidebars on how to explain to students why they have to take these kinds of tests, and, even more, how to explain tests to parents, especially standardized tests. Explaining to parents what the tests are supposed to measure, and how test results will be used, is a very big issue these days, especially in states with high-stakes testing; Popham's book will give you practice in addressing questions from parents, administrators, etc."},{"Title":"Classroom Assessment: What Teachers Need to Know","review":"I had to buy this book to use in a class I'm taking.

Most books on assessment are dry and so dense you loathe having to read them but Mr. Popham exceeded my expectations in this respect. I don't know how he did it but the text is informational and humorous at the same time. I actually laughed out loud at some of his expressions...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!

They are equally critical of the coverage given to Bush and Gore, in an impressive display of non-partisanship that is lacking in our media today. They encourage reporters to research the statements by candidates and to not simply accept the frame given to them by interested parties but to investigate and to put a truly fair and balanced frame around it. One issue that they note but could have gone into more detail on is that the media almost universally present issues as a for/against disagreement, whereas in reality there are often (I might argue almost always) more than two points of view on a given issue and the press ignores all but the two that are most easily reduced to sound bites."},{"Title":"The Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories that Shape the Political World","review":"The Press Effect suggests the media frames issues and candidates in a way that their future stories on the subjects will tend to fit neatly inside the pre-conceived box. Since the media is a follow-the-leader game, once a frame takes hold it doesn't let go very easily. Jamieson and Waldman use this theory mainly to explore the 2000 Election between Gore and Bush.Gore's many misstatements through his political career led the press to frame him as dishonest. Bush's flubs through his short political career convinced the press to put him in the frame of unintelligent. The result were campaign stories that asked voters to choose between the smart, but untrustworthy Gore and the dumb but affable Bush. The examples of media coverage in the book support this theory pretty well.Next the authors cite the examples of Gore's untruths and basically defend each one as a misunderstanding, leaving Gore as a more honest individual than painted by the media. As a reader, I anticipated the authors next explaining that Bush was actually a smarter man than he was given credit for, after all he has an MBA from Harvard. Instead the authors quote a New Yorker article where a reporter cites George W. Bush's average grades at Yale. This is was a surprise, because the story was unverified by Yale and it doesn't take into account that grades have much more to do with ambition and drive than intelligence. There was no attempt to give Bush the same credit that the authors spent giving Gore. An opportunity to support their main thesis was left on the floor, which gives one the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to defend Gore not shame the media. This same pattern is repeated when the authors discuss the Florida recount.It's unfortunate that Jamieson and Waldman abandon the scholarly for the advocacy role because there is a lot of other research in the book that seems dead on. They bemoan that fact that reporters do a terrible job of verifying the evidence and drawing conclusions. Instead, the authors argue that the media play into the &quot;he said, she said&quot; game of political strategy. The story becomes about how the candidates disagree with each other on their positions more than the actual substance of those positions. They also state that the media loves to play psychologist when they should instead be playing fact-finder.I found the basic theories in the book supported by good evidence. But the advocacy of Gore and the silence on Bush in the analysis sections detracted from the book's purported goal of exposing the media's laziness. I'm sure that the authors would say that they had no intention of propping up Gore, but parts of the book seem to strengthen the media frame on Bush which weakens the overall argument of the book. This is surprising since Bush could have been defended as easily as Gore.Anyway, I think the authors do a fine job casting a spotlight on the media's &quot;follow the leader&quot; approach and that's enough recommend it despite my other misgivings."},{"Title":"The Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories that Shape the Political World","review":"This is nicely written, not wordy or loaded with polysci jargon. She reviews national events, mostly political, and how the media covered or created them.It is rather painful but enlightening to see how some of the \\"what everybody knows\\" about a particular candidate started off as speculation by someone, then got quoted as fact by the rest of the pack.Another reminder of how gullible people are so the media can lead us around by the nose and how important it is to be extremely skeptical about the way the media characterize candidates. Also I'm reminded how important it is to have sources from outside the US media market such as BBC."},{"Title":"The Press Effect: Politicians, Journalists, and the Stories that Shape the Political World","review":"The press is in crisis--it no longer serves its most important role, which is to cut through political spin to get at the facts.

To a large extent, as this book points out, this is the fault of journalists, whose primary job is, or should be, to discover and report the truth about important issues of the day. Democracy cannot function well if the public is constantly mislead. And simply presenting opposing views does not help the public determine the truth. Truth telling needs to be rewarded and deception needs to be punished. This is not happening now.Real journalism is not about repeating the \\"spin\\" but finding the truth.As the book says: \\"Reporters should help the public make sense of competing political arguments by defining terms, filling in needed information, assessing the accuracy of the evidence being offered, and relating the claims and counterclaims to the probable impact of the proposed policies on citizens and the country.\\"This can be hard work. It is much easier to focus on the \\"horse race\\" and personalities and that is why over 70% of elections stories in 2000 did not mention any issue at all.This book should be required reading for all journalists and concerned citizens."},{"Title":"Rehearsal for Reconstruction;: The Port Royal experiment","review":"Standing from an academic point of view Rehearsal for Reconstruction (RfR) is undoubtedly useful for information pretaining to Reconstruction. RfR illustrates the problems that were set forth during reconstruction, but limits and expands them to a setting of the Port Royal Experiment (PRE). Themes that arise in the book are those of Southern social changes in labor (move from slavery to free labor), economics (decline therein), and politics (freedmen's move into the political atmosphere). It illustrates how northern attitudes change during the shadowy and turbulent era and also how Nothern Freedmen associations and/or missonaries came to the south to help with the project. Also, Rose will show how the racial attitudes, race relations, and social class structure were affected by the Civil War and Reconstruction. And finally, RfR will develop your knowledge on land distriburtion and land disputes among the planters and the freedmen.Rose takes you through stories that depict just how life was in the Port Royal experiment. Although you do not need to have a degree in history or need to have a previous understanding of the topic at hand, Rose will show how things were in a revissionist style.I would highly recomend this book on two accounts; 1.) if you are interested in the topic of Reconstruction or even the American Civil War for that part, this would be a good book to read for pleasure. 2.) This book is very useful for academic research. Although you will be directed to the topic of the PRE, you will still be capible of extracting meaningful and useful information that will assist you in your studies."},{"Title":"Rehearsal for Reconstruction;: The Port Royal experiment","review":"Willie Lee Rose describes what took place in the Sea Islands of South Carolina during the Civil War. When Union troops took over the Islands in 1861 the plantation owners fled. They left behind their negroe slaves.Administration of the area was divided between the military, various missionary associations and cotton agents. The negroes continued with their agricultural duties, but no longer as slaves.Under the new system, cotton productivity declined. One major factor was because the negroes preferred to grow food crops rather than cotton. They could not eat cotton.When the Civil War ended in 1865, some of the old planters returned, but in many instances their land had been forfeit.From a non-academic layman's viewpoint, even though there is worthwhile information to be learned from this book, it was very hard for me to finish it.

He again demonstrates that he is both a first-rate scholar and an accomplished popularizer of science. His style does not overshadow the book's content; de Duve moves with equal familiarity and elegance from scientific papers to French poets, never losing his grip on a deterministic description of the history of life. A straightforward story line starts with the origin of life and continues through the evolution of humans, mind, and language. Intertwined with the narrative are the author's thoughts on the willful world of biotechnology and our potential for determining our future as a species. It is not surprising that de Duve's biography of the biosphere includes sweeping generalizations, but his gripping chronicle could have been aided by diagrams and additional illustrations. The author's treatment of issues such as language, consciousness, and the development of pluricellularity may be unsatisfactory to some. And readers interested in the origin and earliest evolution of life would probably prefer more detailed discussions of the RNA world and what may have preceded it.However, evolutionary convergence shows that the history of life is not as contingent as some critics of de Duve's positions would argue. Quite surprisingly, the author does not discuss any cases of molecular convergence in Life Evolving. The small, but very revealing, list of known examples includes the independent development of biosynthetic pathways for molecules such as lysine or the imizadole moiety found in purines and histidine as well as the polyphyletic origin of several nonhomologous classes of nucleic acid polymerases. With only one example of biology (Earth's own) we cannot calculate probabilities, but the search for extraterrestrial life may assist us in evaluating the evolutionary odds of life and consciousness. The idea that life on Earth is the result of a miracle or of a rare chance event has been replaced by an evolutionary narrative. Still, as William Blake wrote in There Is No Natural Religion, &quot;Reason, or the ratio of all we have already known, is not the same that it shall be when we know more.&quot; The discovery of dozens of planets orbiting nearby stars and the prospect of searching for compounds of possible biological origin in their atmospheres suggest that in the not-so-distant future we may have more factors to consider when addressing the issues de Duve raises.Whether or not one agrees with de Duve's strong statements, Life Evolving forces the reader to avoid intellectual complacency and to articulate one's own arguments to effectively address his position. These are, in themselves, major reasons to appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning","review":"Let's me say first that I'm 100% pro-evolution, and that abiogenesis is what attracted me to this book. I was seeking an explanation that is either fundamental by itself and based upon some empirical data, or another based on advances of known origin-of-life theories like the &quot;RNA-world&quot;.Unfortunately, the book delivers neither.As another reviewer pointed out already, De Duve divulges the reader into the basics of cell biology; a nice introduction of life chemistry, proteins, RNA, DNA, enzymes and such.De Duve then spends few chapters on paving the way from a pre biotic world to one that is dominated by protocells. He believes that proteins are a by-product of RNA and therefore RNA must have preceded proteins. Judging by the complexity of RNA, he postulates that peptide bonds _somehow_ formed among amino acids with the help of what he calls &quot;multimers&quot; (amino acids among other things), and those short peptides could have played the role of a primitive catalyst.What De Duve fails to provide through out his book is data + examples. To convince any reader with the possibility of such event, common wisdom dictates a minimum amount of experimental data to support the &quot;building&quot; blocks of his hypothesis.In 1997, Ghadri group synthesized a peptide ligase. That is, a self-replicating 32 amino-acid long peptide. It is the constant lack of evidence that makes Du Duve arguments weak.Then he says that ATP and other NTPs _somehow_ arose, and the discussion for their &quot;existence&quot; is beyond the scope of the book. Then our catalyst peptide forms an RNA-like structure from ATP and others. Then he says that many bases were initially bound, not just A, U, G, and C. But once we had a &quot;rare&quot; RNA with A, U, G, C, it is _somehow_ more stable and more reproducible. De Duve does not really discuss why he believes this is the case, other than it must be because this is what we have now.In one occasion, De Duve says &quot;Admittedly, this is all hypothetical. But the hypothesis rests on undeniable foundations and has the advantage of suggesting experimental approaches&quot;. He made it clear on several occasions than many areas of pre biotic chemistry lack experimentation despite their significance in origin-of-life research. After suggesting an experiment, he concludes &quot;This is what I would do if I were 20 years younger&quot;.De Duve then goes on to explain how the RNA led eventually to proteins (RNA attaches itself to some amino acids, and using the RNA itself as a catalyst, we form protein). And that once we had proteins, life needed cells at that stage to compete and protocells were created. The RNA made proteins, and RNA that made better proteins for the cell survived and got duplicated. The cell at this has some rudimentary membrane, and can replicate itself via division.What he skipped is how such membrane forms, why it forms, and how the division process in this protocell exactly takes place.I really wished that De Duve paid more attention to such critical details. Different people might read the book for different reasons, I read it for the goal of gaining an understanding on abiogenesis. Being a strong believer in abiogenesis myself, I was quite enthusiastic when I began reading the book. However, skepticism over Duve's take on abiogensis kept growing as I read more chapters.Unfortunately, I lost faith in his approach to this critical issue."},{"Title":"Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning","review":"I read this book because Christian De Duve is one of the &quot;grand old men&quot; of origin-of-life research. What I found was as much a book on theology as one on life sciences. Along with lucid descriptions of the inner workings of living cells and conjectures of how life arose, it is an evangelistic treatise in support of soft-core atheism. His message is that we need priests, not because God exists...He does not...but because natural selection has created within mankind the need for God.De Duve gives a great review of just how cells work at the molecular level. There is adequate depth without getting bogged down in details. What I really wanted to see was his explanation for the origin of life. De Duve proposes thatAbundant triphosphates somehow arose to provide energyPrebiotic peptide catalysts somehow aroseMyriads of different RNA-like molecules somehow formed from phosphates&quot;Rare true-RNA&quot; molecules evolved by Darwinian evolutionRNAs began to make proteins out of the abundant amino acid soupThe RNAs began to make cell wallsThe genetic code for specific proteins arose via Darwinian evolutionThese very short RNA chains grew tremendously longer via Darwinian evolutionDNA developed from RNA to form protocellsThe protocells evolved via Darwinian evolution until they became the first living cellsThe key to his proposal is molecular selection. &quot;This mechanism, it must be emphasized, represents at the molecular level exactly that imagined by Darwin to account for biological evolution&quot;. In other words, the way to get around the incredible odds of accomplishing each of the proposed steps to life listed above is by having non-living molecules competing with each other. The winning molecules then advance to the next level of competition.De Duve is rather less than kind to those who disagree. He is distressed that many intelligent people, even scientists, do not agree that this is a plausible explanation to the origin of life. As one with a background in the earth sciences, I am one of the skeptics. My major problem is that he seemingly ignores data from other scientific disciplines. His premise depends on assumptions that are either wrong or improbable at best.His proposal requires a benign chemical environment with a rich prebiotic soup from which the peptides, RNAs, and proteins could form. Geochemists and planetary physicists have conclusively demonstrated that this soup simply didn't exist. The neutral atmosphere of the early earth could not form prebiotics. In addition, there was sufficient photogenic oxygen in the atmosphere and radiogenic (radiation-induced) oxygen in the oceans to destroy them if they did form. No &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; has ever been found, although &quot;post-biotics&quot; are extremely common. What does exist in abundance are deposits of poisonous heavy metals and rare-earth elements. The early ocean more closely resembled the deadly effluent from a toxic waste dump than the prebiotic soup De Duve needs. Entire industries exist to mine these materials which were once poisons dissolved in the early oceans.De Duve proposes that prebiotic materials were delivered to the Earth from outer space. Small amounts of nucleic acids have been found in some meteorites, and comets often contain some carbon compounds as well. In reality, the volume of chemicals is small, but the energy release is not. For example, the Shoemaker-Levy comet which struck Jupiter in 1994, probably contained hundreds of tons of organic compounds. This is the proverbial &quot;drop in a bucket&quot; in terms of getting a meaningful volume of prebiotics into the ocean. However, the impact event was roughly 100 million megatons of TNT. This is ten thousand times the power of all of mankind's nuclear weapons combined. We would all be dead if this impact had occurred on Earth.Another problem occurs in obtaining concentrated baths of organic compounds. The scenarios De Duve mentions are Darwin's &quot;warm little pond&quot; and Stanley Miller's &quot;drying lagoon&quot;. These are physical impossibilities on the early earth, where tides were measured in hundreds of feet and wind speeds were measured in thousands of miles an hour. Think of the movie &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; and consider that the weather never got that nice 3.9 billion years ago! There is no plausible mechanism available to generate a concentrated bath of prebiotic compounds in such an environment.The last several chapters delve into esoteric astronomical subjects far from De Duve's area of expertise, including life on other planets. Large numbers are quoted, but there is little discussed in the vein of cause-and-effect from which a meaningful statistical calculation could be made. He acknowledges that the physical properties of the universe exhibit evidence of incredible precision which allows life to exist. Inconceivably tiny deviations in a number of parameters would make life impossible. This &quot;anthropic principle&quot; has led many formerly atheistic or agnostic scientists to a belief in God. I know one radio-astronomer who wrote &quot;Astronomers who do not draw theistic or deistic conclusions are becoming rare&quot;, while his atheist collegue complained that his fellow astronomers are rushing off to join &quot;the First Church of Christ of the Big Bang.&quot; De Duve apparently prefers the explanation that there are an infinite number of universes, perhaps even evolving via natural selection, and ours is the lucky one.De Duve's final appeal is that &quot;something positive must be proposed that can eventually replace the myths propagated by religion.&quot; God does not exist, but we need &quot;spiritual guides&quot; to provide ethics and morals. &quot;The religious feeling is deeply embedded in our nature, probably carved into it by natural selection&quot;I enjoyed De Duve's excellent description of cellular biology. However, I found his proposed mechanisms for the origin of life unconvincing and unsupported by actual chemical pathways. He ignored the hard evidence from other scientific disciplines that render his explanations highly implausible. His premise that science has demonstrated naturalistic explanations to how the universe, the earth, and mankind got here requires more faith than I can muster. I remain skeptical, and tend to agree with the astronomers, who are finding increasing evidence of &quot;something else behind it all&quot;."},{"Title":"Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning","review":"Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.Some of my favorite quotes in this book by this 1974 Nobel laureate:\\"until recently, the answer to the question 'what is life?' posed no problem.

An intriguing account blending a history of life with a survey of where it's heading."},{"Title":"How to Fish from Top to Bottom","review":"I recently spent time in a small cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and happened upon this book (the 2nd reprint, stained and tattered) on a shelf. Luckily I had a week off and am a fast reader, because I read the book cover to cover. I enjoyed the author's style of writing. It was conversational, and yet conveyed the information well. He discusses simple topics such as transparency of the water, and goes on to more complex matter such as the CO2 content. If you're familiar with maintaining an aquarium, you will find this information familiar, but it is presented in a way that you might not have considered when trying to catch fish. I enjoyed the book greatly.In addition to reading the book, I was able to spend some time fishing as well. I'd love to say that it allowed me to catch a large amount of fish, but I can't. Two small perch and a bass were all I could manage. Oh well... at least the book provided great reading.I would have given the book 5 stars but it spends a large number of chapters talking about fly fishing, but don't let this dissuade you... it's worth getting."},{"Title":"How to Fish from Top to Bottom","review":"Originally started reading this book from our local library and quit because it seemed too technical to enjoy, but on second attempt found it educational and filled with personal stories that made it fun to read. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it.If you're willing to invest a little time learning the habits of fish and traits of small and large waters, it's an invaluable resource book and humorous at the same time."},{"Title":"How to Fish from Top to Bottom","review":"Very complete and scholarly book on fishing. Although quite a bit of the book dealt with conventional fishing, his discussion of how to rate lakes by clarity and hardness of water was valuable. His information on stream dynamics and fly fishing was what I was really interested in, and although he recommends flies that would be incredibly huge today for most streams, his techniques were right on. I always learn a few things from these older books, (this one first written in 1955) and this book provided more than a few. The fact that it was recommended by Charlie Fox said something to me as well."},{"Title":"FORBES GREATEST BUSINESS STORIES OF ALL TIME","review":"A great book about the people who made a real difference in shaping the present that we live in and influencing the future as it will become.From Robert Morris to Bill Gates; the books takes you on a promonade into their kingdoms. Explaining to the reader many valuable information about each &quot;tycoon's&quot; personality, enterprise, industry, and the general business environment in his particular era.I personally enjoyed the chapters on David Ogilvy, Ray Croc, Sam Walton, Walt Disney, Joseph Wilson, Henry Ford and Harley Davidson.The book portrays many successful personalities and companies that will be of interest to people in varying specializations within Business.An enjoyable read and a good reference.Also read &quot;Lessons from the Top&quot; and &quot;Radical Marketing&quot;"},{"Title":"FORBES GREATEST BUSINESS STORIES OF ALL TIME","review":"I found the stories in the book very interesting. They covered a a wide spectrum of industries and spanned over a long time frame. The stories clearly illustrated the most important business figures of the particular time and industry.However, I thought the stories were lacking in detail to make it truly a great read. After reading the book, I felt that I was introduced to the great figures in business. But to know them better, I have to read another book.For example, I knew something about Henry Ford before reading the book. In the story about Henry Ford, I found it superficial. However, in other stories that I was not familiar with the protagonist, like McGowan, I found the story illuminating. I never knew the telecommunications business could be so interesting.As such, I recommend this book to people who wants to know some of the greatest people in business. But to those who want to find out about the secrets to their success, the answer will lie in other more detailed books."},{"Title":"FORBES GREATEST BUSINESS STORIES OF ALL TIME","review":"Each chapter offers a profile of a major contributor to the evolution of American business history, beginning with one of my ancestors, Robert Morris (America's \\"first real businessman\\"), and concluding with Bill Gates (\\"Microsoft's cofounder and guiding spirit\\"). In between, Gross and his associates also examine other great leaders such as McCormick, Rockefeller, Morgan, Ford, Merrill, Sarnoff, Disney, Johnson, Ogilvy, Kroc, Wilson, Ash, Walton, and McGowan as well as major corporations such as American Express, Intel, Harley-Davidson, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The reader is told, \\"This book is about heroes\\" and it really is.Using the most effective strategies and devices of a storyteller, the authors examine biographical information within an historical context, sustaining interest with anecdotes while providing insights as to the causes and effects of each subject's accomplishments. For Morris, essentially the economic survival of thirteen colonies during their struggle for independence. For McCormick, the industrialization of agriculture. For Rockefeller, the creation and development of the modern corporation. For Morgan, saving a nation's financial system. For Ford, mass-producing affordable personal transportation. For Merrill, broadening the base of stock ownership to include those, among others, for whom the Ford Motor Company manufactured automobiles. Each of the other \\"heroes\\" discussed made equally important contributions.A brief review such as this can only suggest (albeit inadequately) the wealth of information to be found in Greatest Business Stories of All Time. The prose has snap, crackle, and pop. The focus is crystal clear. The lessons to be learned from the careers examined are of incalculable value. Although this book will be of interest to almost anyone, it will have special importance for school, college, and university students who may sometimes wonder if there are any \\"secrets to success.\\" The answer is yes.

It is a very quick read because all of the biography is concise and to the point. Some of the people I had never heard of before and that made it all the more interesting.

Every story was great and very interesting telling how they started and where they finished up. Also how people borrowed huge sums of money in order to buy a business that wasn't making money at the time only to turn them around. Like the guys at Harley for example putting together $1 million of their own and then borrowing $81 million to buy the company. Unbelievable.Everyone who reads this will enjoy it as it was written very well. You will learn some valuable business and marketing concepts from the leaders of industry.

In this book, she talks about her childhood in China and then Canada, the difficulties she faced going through school with severely impaired vision, and the love and support of her family that enabled her to persevere.With insight and humor but without self-pity, she tells of the challenges she faced at school, including bullying, as well as the relief when she was put in a sight-savers class and at last found a place where she was &quot;normal&quot; - like the other children in her class - and had teachers who understood her needs.Against all odds, Little decided to go to university.

The story is about how Jean, little by little, succeeds in different things like reading, school and many more. For example, when she's trying to learn to read, she didn't give up. She went through stages during lerning to make new frieds,and getting through school. Jean uses very interesting words to make you feel like you're there.

To do this, I've been attempting to use a variety of already existing lists, so as to bulk up my cumulative kiddie lit knowledge. One of these lists is the New York Public Library's \\"100 Favorite Children's Books\\". This list includes everything from \\"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry\\" to \\"Freaky Friday\\". Now I had been doing quite well on these titles and was pleased with its choices right up until I came across the somewhat bizarre choice of \\"Little By Little\\" by Jean Little. This is one of those authorial biographies that are meant to tell an inspirational story by highlighting an author's struggles and tribulations. Now, this is not a badly told story by any means. Jean Little is, admittedly, not one of the better known children's authors living today (though a quick Amazon search will show you that she certainly doesn't lack for titles), but her story is fairly interesting. It's just that... well, I dunno. Maybe kids reading this tale would all find it fully fascinating. For my part, I was disappointed. What we seem to have here is a nice enough story about an obscure person dealing with some physical and social trials who triumphs in the end. It's nice, but the book does not strike me as being a particularly memorable experience.Jean Little was originally born in Taiwan to a pair of overseas Canadians. And from the moment she was born there was a great deal of concern over her eyes and her eyesight. Jean popped out of the womb with scars on her corneas, a condition which left her cross-eyed and untreatable. Glasses, for all that she wore them, did nothing to correct the problem. After moving to Canada just after the outbreak of WWII, Jean faced constant ridicule and torment from her peers due to her partly blind condition. A brief period spent in a school for children like herself did her a lot of good, but soon it was right back into public school where the cruelty of children was concentrated on poor little Jean. Fortunately, she had her books and poetry to keep her happy. Over time, Jean started to write her own stories and poems, some getting accepted into magazines and publications. Her parents, always supportive, helped her to improve her skills and in spite of her handicap she managed to attend and graduate from college with a B.A. The rest, as they say, is history.When I first began to read this story, I was struck by how similar Jean's story has been to the \\"100 Favorite Children's Books\\" biography, \\"Homesick: My Own Story\\" by fellow (better known) children's writer Jean Fritz. Both women began life in East Asian countries and had to move to North America while young. But while Fritz concentrates her attention on that particular transition and what it means to have two different homes, Little is more concerned with the tale of her own inspirational story. Also, Little's book isn't filled with interesting illustrations (like Fritz's) so it's a wordy affair. The occasional photograph does dot the text here and there, but that's all that breaks up the story. I was a bit shocked at the abruptness of the ending as well. Not to give anything away, but it shows Little receiving notice that her first children's book is going to be published. Suddenly the story ends, without the book summing up what Little's been through or explaining how she changed over the years. It was an odd way to end a story where the reader has been through so much with the protagonist.To be honest, the book struck me as odd. It's a biography, but Little freely admits that no human being is capable of remembering perfectly every moment and conversation of their life. So there's been some tampering to make the tale readable. It's well-written. It has an interesting tale of individual struggle. And quite frankly I really didn't enjoy it. I can't pinpoint why either. Maybe it's the title. Maybe the fact that I found it hard to identify with Jean from time to time. Maybe it was the writing style or Jean's constant appeal for understanding. Whatever the case, I just couldn't get into it. I have little doubt that for some children that face torment due to their appearances, this book could be considered nothing short of a godsend. But I just didn't like it. Plain and simple.Usually I can back up my reaction to one book or another with a host of flaws in the title. I don't think I can here. It's a nice enough story. And the writing is fine n' dandy. But if you were to ask me for my top twenty biographies written for children... I can't say this would make the list. But I may well be in a minority here. In any case, if my personal opinion means anything to you then I suggest you search out Jean Fritz's, \\"Homesick\\", and read that instead of this tale. It's fine and all.

He obviously has more stomach for it than I had, kudos to him for staying and trying to help.People need to pay more attention. Of course there aren't many Baptists in Vermont--but there are a lot of Baptists in powerful places in this country. No, no one ought to be shocked that the SoBaptists are opposed to homosexual expression or that anyone not theologically conservative enough ought to repent and vote correctly! But a book like this needs to be widely circulated, if for information if nothing else. Bravo, Jeff Pool."},{"Title":"AGAINST RETURNING TO EGYPT","review":"Although, it was certainly not Pool's intention, I have never read a book that proves the necessity of the conservative resurgence in the SBC more than this one. Pool was hired to teach at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary under the previous liberal administration of Russell Dilday. In this book, Pool denies biblical inerrancy, the sovereignty of God, original sin, and substitutionary atonement (he spends several pages making unconvincing, warmed-over Socinian argyments against substitutionary atonement). No book that I have ever read convinces me more that the Southwestern Trustees did the right thing when they fired Dilday in 1994. Dilday was hiring liberals like Pool who indoctrinated a whole generation of future pastors with heretical Socinian Pelagianism. Praise be to God that the Southwestern administration took appropriate action in the fall of 1997 to remove this heretic from campus. If you have any doubt that liberals used to teach at SBC seminaries, read this book, particularly the sections that deal with theology."},{"Title":"AGAINST RETURNING TO EGYPT","review":"Wow, this author scared me!

Velvet Glove explores mental and physical dominance and submission from a young woman's perspective, but there's no nasty S &amp; M - just adult, consensual play. I really felt Audrey's excitement and doubt as she tried out D/s! Emma's trademark, shown in her earlier books, Cooking Up a Storm and Top of Her Game, is luscious, fiery and imaginative sex. I think Velvet Glove is a good book to share with a partner if you want to unlock your secret desires."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Whether it is historical or contemporary Holly is the best writer of erotica/romance. This book is no exception. You immediately get wrapped up into Audrey's life, her emotions and sensual nature are intense and from Sterling, to Tommy to Basil & Patrick you feel her sexuality and ride her emotions. Holly develops these people beyond just sexual beings and makes you care for them as people. And you really begin to understand how they think and feel. This is erotica at its best. Holly once again delievers!!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Is definitely worth reading. Spicy yet also romantic. Has a good mixture of different aspects of erotica but a good story as well.

HAVE YOUR PARTNER READY !!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I had read a couple of things by Emma Holly and didn't love or hate them. But after this book I will be reading more of Ms. Holly. The sex was hot (very important in erotica) and varied. Even the scenes involving male/male sex, which is not a thing for me, were well written and much better handled than other authors' treatment of simliar scenes.Yes, Audrey has a lot of sex and with more than one person (although nowhere near the numbers of most more typical non-romantica erotica) and explores sub and dom relationships which involve bondage. The character is introduced in the middle of a punishment given by Sterling, her master/lover. Thier relationship has abusive overtones and Audrey leaves him and goes back to her old life in D.C. She begins staying with her best friend Tommy, who is in love with her. But soon gets a job at a bar owned by Patrick Dugan, who has been asked to look out for her, and excepts his invitation to move in with him. Patrick is trying to protect Audrey because Sterling, believing that Audrey is his possesion, is having her watched.Patrick needs Audrey to trust him, so he pretends to be involved with Basil, the bars transvetite singer, who also comes to live at Patrick's large penthouse apartment. But Patrick is having a hard time fighting his attraction to Audrey, a natural sub. To further complicate things Basil is showing intrest in both of them. Through the course of the story Patrick must either learn to deal with his intamacy issues or lose Audrey. Audrey is learning that she can be submissive in her sex life (and plays at dominence a little) withought being misstreated. But the book deffinatly does not have your typical happily ever after ending. This is a more uncoventional love story and readers who dislike books where the characters have multiple partners, should probably skip this one. For readers who don't require monogamy enjoy!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I am probably as far from this author's target demographic as one can get. African American. Lesbian. Dred Locs. Afrocentric. I have never commented on any of her books (or any other books) because for the most part hers totally turn me on. I have a passion for all things erotica, and her writing is definitely top notch! This book, however, was a true disappointment. I love this writer's style, but here are my grievances:1) She has the hottest scenes of any author I have ever read, and I'm pretty well read in this area. The way she builds up her characters & the scenes are H.O.T. I even enjoy some of her male-on-male scenes (particularly Strange Attractions). I have read almost her entire catalog except Top of Her Game (I think). She writes such great scenes m-w and m-w-m and even m-m. I don't understand why she just grazes her woman-woman scenes. I would think she would have so much to say about the p-y. She has so much phallic description. Yet, in the three w-w scenes I've read, she skims over them or quickly adds a male to the mix.2) I would love it if she added some color to the mix. She only has two stories that I have read with some color, and those were both Asian men. I think she could add a little spice or her stories could benefit from some color. Maybe a Latina or an African American. An Indian beauty...Just Thoughts. I still love her books. They're my weakness.Anyway, reading her stories has truly inspired me to write. If you read anything of hers, You will definitely be inspired to something. *Ahem."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I started reading Erotica not that long ago, and this is definitely my favorite author.

She is SO varied in her ability to respond to people - male, female, and androgynes - that her claim to a B & D obsession is not all that credible, although she DOES love her pierced nipple jewlry. Her \\"forever\\"friends and sexual playmates Tommy and Cynthia are so sweet and believable, and the female impersonator Basil is WAY cool and oh so genuine. But the masterful well endowed hunk Patrick who is the overriding object of Audrey's affection turns out in the end to be a sucker for romance and enthusiastically bisexual himself! Still, this is vividly realistic and VERY graphic sexual writing. I will certasinly read more from Ms. Holly."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I've loved all of Emma Holly's books, and Velvet Glove is one of my favorites.

Emma writes characters that you really feel for...they are written so true to life, that you can feel happiness for them, sadness, empathy, and sympathy. Emma also knows how to make a book flow, and keep the reader interested and anticipating what comes next.I really loved Audrey and Patrick, and Basil was just too cute.

Brava Emma!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I enjoyed Ms. Holly's novel about a very ripe twenty two year old recent collge grad. I found her use of the english language, creation of an actual storyline and character development most refreshing. You just don't get that in most of these types of books. That's why she gets the 3 stars from me.The reason she didn't get more stars is because she was inconsistent. For instance when she is with Sterling, her first Dom in Florida, Ms. Holly is very very descriptive. She describes how Sterling dominates her and plays out the scenes. When she takes up with Patrick, her one true love, she is very descriptive about the sex but woefully lacking in any sort of description of dominating by Patrick. Yet time and time again we are to believe he's really good at it and our little lady falls in love with him because she has never been mastered so skillfully. When you buy D/S books you want some d/s plus the sex. Call me greedy. But it was entertaining and I don't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I actually liked the way this started out more than the way it ended. Audrey is a goof if you ask me.

Audrey likes to have sex. She likes to have sex with everyone. Thats basiclly the book in a nutshell. She seems to have no other qualities besides whats between her legs. Boring! Lets have alittle depth. Patrick was alittle likeable and then theres the drag queen roomate Basil (What). I don't know and I don't know if you will either. I read some other reviews and found theres to be good but unfortunetly I don't like everybody in the book having sex with one another. Mrs. Holly I would recommend giving a little more depth to your characters even tho it's erotica. If you like erotica try Rhyannon Byrd!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I've become addicted to Emma Holly's erotic novels and I couldn't wait to read another one of her Black Lace offerings. Velvet Glove is a smoldering novel that centers on BDSM and other mouthwatering scenarios. Audrey is on the lookout for the perfect master, but things don't look too good when candidate number one, a influential millionaire, turns out to be a sadist and candidate number two, her old friend, is a big softy. But when she meets Patrick, a sexy barman and son of a famous politician, not only is the third candidate a charm, but she embarks upon a sexual odyssey that she hadn't envisaged. With sexy bondage scenes, man-woman-man threesomes and other scorching exploits, Audrey may have found the perfect dominant partner. But what's going to happen when she discovers that her sadistic ex-dom is stalking her? And will Patrick's misguided attempts to throw the stalker off affect his father's political career? There are various insatiable twists throughout the novel.This isn't the best Emma Holly novel I've read. But her trademark building of tension, smoldering scenes and excellent plot development and characterization aren't lost in this book. I especially love how she illustrates S&M; in a more positive light. Ms. Holly is one of the best erotica authors of this era and I shall continue to read her books with gusto. I recommend Velvet Glove..."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Emma Holly has pretty much established herself as one of the top authors of erotica. Her novels have compelling stories, well-rounded characters, and hot hot sex.All of the characters are interesting and none are wasted - from bar-owner Patrick &amp; transvestite singer Basil (with whom Audrey forms an unlikely threesome), to her old college friends, Tommy &amp; Cynthia (living with each other but both in love with Audrey) and a host of others besides.If you are not into S&amp;M you will still enjoy Velvet Glove, because it is basically a love story with the plot twists created out of the twists &amp; turns of the characters' interaction with each other.Also Emma Holly has that rare storytellers gift of being able to pull her readers wholly into her world and make it ours as well. She makes the life of a submissive female seem not only normal, but positively idyllic.Read this book and then buy everything else by Emma Holly!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I have been reading Emma Holly's work for several years. She has blended romance and high eroticism to a fine art. In VELVET GLOVE the scenes of old fashion style romance and hard edged S&amp;M seem to just flow one into another. I found myself rooting for Patrick and Audrey and hoping that their love and passion for each other would prevail. The secondary characters are well written and visually the book is a feast. I highly recommend buying this and any other BLACK LACE novel written by Emma Holly. If you have not read any BLACK LACE novels and are curious as to what they are about I suggest starting with VELVET GLOVE. Its Simply The Best. Thanks again Emma."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Emma Holly grabs the reader by the throat from the first pages as we find our young and naive heroine, Audrey, dump her friend in Miami during a vacatiion and move into the mansion of a much older, man of the world, wealthy, of course, banker. The fact that she entered the world of becoming a sex slave in training didn't really bother her at the beginning, but after a few weeks of this exploration, and abuse, she decided to escape and maybe think this whole thing over.Feeling safe to be back with her friend she plays some wonderfull 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' games that are so crisply written that the temperature in the room must have risen by like 10 degrees. Anyway, little Audrey didn't get away as we soon learn that our older banker friend and pervert, not only had a tracker on her but started to pull in favours with his wide web of powerfull friends to 'keep an eye' on Audrey and continue her training.It's at this point we meet Patrick Dugan, the son of a prominent politico and a cast of characters including a drag queen singer who works at the local bar owned by Patrick. The little games played our cast of characters and the intrigue of our Miami banker friend not wanting to loose a yummie morsel like Audrey is what makes this a great book.I have noted some reviewers making comments about the proclivity of Audrey to be a little free with her favours .... I don't know just because on her first day of work as a waitress at Dugans bar she does a serious lap dance on the drag queen singer in his dressing room, finally does the 'dirty' with Tommy her 'friend' shes been teasing for ten years, at his apartment, is forced to start her slave training and 'lick' spilled beer off the 'pants' of Patrick her new boss, at his apartment, and then 'really' pleasures herself with a vibrator that has suction cups and can be stuck on the wall ... that doen't really make her a nympho though, does it?I believe that Emma Holly made the story the central theme of this book since it's really hard to fixate or place any kind of real attachement, as the reader, to any of these characters individually. But just take a young beutifull nympho that likes it rough, mix in an old wealthy banker perv, a young 'hot to trot self conscious boyfriend, a bar lizzard drag queen, the son of a prominent politico and you vertainly have the makings of a wonderfully erotic sexual cocktail .... no pun intended ..."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"This was the first Black Lace series book I picked up-- and I was hooked. Audrey's journey from her first cruel master to Tommy's welcoming-but-frustrated arms, to the upscale lair of Patrick (complete with live-in friend &amp; female impersonator) makes for an interesting tale. The complicated relationship that springs up between Audrey and Patrick is completely plausible, and the story unfolds as both romantic AND erotic. Lots of D/s, S/M-- and a wide variety of partnerings-- straight, bi, and otherwise! Looking forward to reading more from this author. Thanks for the Washington, DC setting, Emma-- we loved it being here! Kudos from the DC Scene!"},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"I have always been a fan of Emma Holly mainly because her novels are very well written with well developed characters and the plot-line is unique. For these reasons alone new readers to the genre of erotica should read an Emma Holly novel. However, what I particularly like is the challenge presented to her readers with each novel. BDSM (bondage domination & sadomasochism) is an area I have mixed feelings about because I associate it with pain, yet I would like to understand its role in relationships. In Cooking Up A Storm and more so in Top Of Her Game, Emma Holly helped me to see that there are various ways in which people use BDSM and she illustrates well its significance in her characters' lives. But I have never fully understood nor appreciated the many levels of BDSM until Velvet Glove. All the elements of an Emma Holly novel are there - it's well written, the plot is unique and interesting and the characters are great. Velvet Glove is a great exploration into two polar sides of BDSM. Readers will get so caught up in the storyline that they will learn about the BDSM culture while enjoying the story. This is a must have for Emma Holly fans and a great introduction for new readers of erotica."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"This book left me feeling like I'd just had a one-night stand. It was mildly enjoyable, if you're ok with casual sex a la the 70's, but afterward it just felt dirty.Had there been no pretense at romance, I might have liked the book better. However, I had a hard time believing that there were any real feelings going on between Audrey and Patrick, and couldn't for the life of me figure out what Patrick would see in Audrey. Basically, the heroine is an empty-headed nymphomaniac and the hero is cold and aloof. I think some statements about Audrey being warm and intelligent or something like that are made somewhere, but every action she took throughout the book showed nothing but stupidity and weakness.I mean, she takes off with some old guy she barely knows and lets him chain her up and torture her while totally abandoning her apartment, job and friends without a word to anyone. Real smart. Then when she escapes him - literally - she can't wait to jump back into another slave role with another man she barely knows. At least this one is a little better looking. Audrey comes off as nothing more than an witless sex slave. Patrick seemed cold and distant, and I never felt as though I knew him well enough to care about him. It was also hard to respect him after he supposedly fell in love with helpless, naive, incredibly easy twenty-something Audrey.As in many of Emma's books, the heroine is unable to be in a room with another human for more than five minutes without seducing him or her. This gets old, and a little gross. She really has no standards at all.I think the most appealing scenes were between Patrick and a transexual man, but they would have been better if Audrey hadn't been present.So while there were some steamy moments, in the end I couldn't get past Audrey's weak personality and undiscriminating nymphomania. I much prefer Ms. Holly's historical romances, where the characters are better developed and the romantic aspect more believable."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"My main advice to everyone is please read beyond the first chapter. I read it and thought it was really not my cup of tea (heavy bondage, S&amp;M) and put it aside. A few months later I picked it up again and proceeded to read past the first chapter and was immediately hooked - now this was the Emma Holly I know and love. There is bondage in this book - the heroine is a sub - but there is also the normal love and tenderness I expect from EH."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Emma Holly's latest book keeps up the style of her earlier books: there is plenty of adventurous sex, mixed with romance and real characterization. It is actually possible to care about the characters and the story, which makes this book considerably more erotic than a list of who did what to whom. There's plenty of variety in this book, a little something for every taste, the S/M is light, but the domination theme was much more compelling (because it was actually based on the psychology of the power situation) than most tough S/M books. The ending was happy and fulfilling, unusual for an erotic novel. I recommend this book highly to anyone who enjoys erotic novels already-this is a cut above the usual. I also recommend it to anyone who usually avoids them for reasons of style, poor plot, or ick factor."},{"Title":"Velvet Glove","review":"Emma Holly is a very versatile writer who seems to understand people in a rare way, and know every dark fantasy you've ever had, committing it to paper.Here she veers a little off.Audrey is much more young and naive than her usual heroines; on a vacation she happily leaves her life to become a disrespected sex slave to a complete stranger, the very old and cold Sterling.She escapes but he plants a tracking device in her nipple ring and finds she lands back in Boston with her best friend Tommy. He is a whiny mn who worships her and desperately desires sex to the point of pathetic begging and misogynistic demands. With Tommy there are slowly escalating scenes of her dominating him, which seems odd as she is very much a submissive at that point. She even dominates his girfriend Cynthia, yet another person who worships the great and two-dimensional Audrey.Sterling asks old friend Senator Dugan to keep an eye on her, and Dugan dcides to stick it to him. He knows his son Patrick, a bar owner, is part of the group D/s scene and asks him to master the girl.Patrick draws Audrey in an an unbelievable stroke of luck and realizes she is too skittish for the group scene. He asks her to move in with him and asks his drag queen nightly performer (at an Irish bar in Boston? What the HELL was Holly thinking????) Basil to pretend to be his gay lover, lulling her into submission.Patrick discovers he likes men, not as much as women though; Audrey discovers she is a weak willed spineless twit with an amazing, uh, \\"asset\\" between her legs who wants to be cossetted and spoiled by day, chained and spanked by night.Somehow, inexplicably, she falls in love with him and refuses Sterling when he comes for her. It seems without motivation, there is no real relationship between the bar owner and his new pet.The sex is so weak, it reads like a husband and wife of 30 years decided to try a little light spanking to spice up their sex life. The D/s is nonexistent and the best sex scenes are Basil seducing Audrey when they first meet, Basil seducing Patrick in the kitchen, and Patrick dominating Basil while Audrey watches pretending to be a dominatrix.The characters aren't fleshed out enough and the sex scenes were A: too far apart, and B: had no sensual anticipation leading up to them.Audrey, unlike all of her other heroines, seems like an empty-headed spoiled beauty queen and I really would have liked for just one person to not be head-over-heels in love with her. Just one.

However, there are still some people who decided that they wanted to try and disprove the point that rape and sexual assault hurts women in ways that people who have not survived a sexual assault could possabily understand. In this new addition, Ms. Warshaw puts her detractors(and they KNOW who they are)to shame by not only providing an awesome counter argument, but by using Real Facts obtained in a Scientific Study. These are some of the things that her detractors did not do."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"If you know someone who is going off to college or moving out on her own, recovering from a divorce or anything ~~ or simply because you love her, this is a book I highly recommend for you to give to her. It talks about date rape/acquaintance rape ~~ a subject that isn't talked about very often ~~ and you will find resources in this book to help a survivor recover ~~ or even to prevent a rape from happening. And I recommend young men reading this book too. It shows the other side of rape ~~ a man may think that a woman &quot;teased&quot; him and that she really wanted it ~~ but oftentimes, it leaves lasting scars ~~ not just on the victims but also on the rapists too. Both men and women need to be educated on what date rape is ~~ it is more common than people think.When a woman says no, a man is trained by society that she really means yes ~~ but that isn't the case. Rape is when a sexual act is committed against a woman's will ~~ even if she knows her attacker. It's downright disturbing and there are many women who have survived date rape. Did you know that &quot;stranger rape&quot; occurs very rarely but &quot;acquaintance rape&quot; occurs more often? Also, did you know that even if a woman stops dating a man, he can still rape her? There are all kinds of stories in this book that the author shares with the reader to warn them of this issue.This book will share with you how to recognize the danger signals and how to prevent a rape from happening. If it happens, there is advice on what to do next. It explores the statistics of numerous studies performed on this topic and it's downright scary. But there are people fighting it and so can you. Just read this book, and pass it on. I truly believe every woman going off to college or moving out on her own or even entering her teen years should have a copy of this. It shouldn't be a topic to ignore ~~ it should be talked about and shared ~~ it is a serious issue and one that every woman needs to be aware of.I have a young cousin going off to college and this is one book I would like to send to her. For all you moms, dads, grandmas, aunts, sisters, cousins, friends should think of the young women (and young men) in your family or circle of friends and think of how you should arm them with knowledge on how to prevent acquaintance rape from happening. But not only women need to read this book, men should too. They should sit down with their sons and tell them that &quot;no means no.&quot; And that they should resist pressure from other men in raping a woman. Acquaintance rape is very damaging to women and to men as well. It wreaks havoc on the fragile fabric of society itself.Pick it up ~~ I don't think you'll regret it as one can never have too much information about a topic like this one."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"This book deals with an important, sensitive message, but it is too narrowed. Sadly, a victimizer today can be anyone. I was raped in my second year of college by an upper classmate--another woman.We were both drunk and I had passed out. Incidentally I am neither gay nor bi. I thought we were just friends. When I awoke, I found her on top of me, my blouce and pants undone and her holding me down. I had awoken to her penetrating me with her fingers and at first had no idea of what was happening, or if I was even dreaming. When it became obvious to me what was happening, she held me down and tried to muffle my protests with her hand and began to vigorously and violently thrust in and out of me hushing me and whispering that I should just relax and would like it and what \\"good things\\" she could show me if I let her.I began to cry and scream and that was when she finally let go of me. Even while I was dressing, trembling, she seemed genuinely confused as to why I was so upset.That day forever changed my life and I am still dealing with the after effects of that trauma. What is most upsetting to me is some people think that women do not rape, or that this wasn't rape, or even question \\"how\\" another woman can rape.Rape is simply a violation of another person's physical, psychological, and emotional being. It doesn't matter who does it or if a penis is used. I *was* raped.I have heard many similar stories by other women since, especially of sororities, which truly sexually abuse new pledges. As far as I know there is no real recognition of this phenomena, which only seems to fuel a sick girl-on-girl sexual fantasy in society.Robin Warshaw, sadly, only sees rapes as when a man does it to only a woman and only in the context of penile-vaginal intercourse. Rape is a much more broader phenomena.It is important for young people to be on guard and aware of the dangers of rape and also no that the moment they engage in sex with anyone without their consent or then not knowing it--in any shape or form--they themselves are committing rape, regardless of gender or the means of sexual stimulation."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"I have recently been molested by someone I thought to be my best friend. Yes, I am starting this off this way because this is important for people to know when reading reviews for this kind of book.Now when scrolling down to read the reviews for this book I noticed this top one titled \\"Misandrist Feminist Propaganda\\" by Nathan J. Yoder. Well Nathan, your response to this book is so callous and rude that I cannot even begin to collect my thoughts as orderly as I like. Your comments are so horribly insensitive that I can only be led to believe that you yourself have coerced someone into having sex with you. Let me tell you this. If the person that you are propositioning sex from says no even once and you continue, it is still rape.And the horribly stupid comment you left at te end of your review:\\"Of course, when a man is drunk, the principle never applies because it's an anti-male principle.\\"This is also not true. If ANYONE has unwanted sexual contact, whether it be male or female, whether they are drunk or sober, IT IS NOT OKAY. There is NO justification and no excuses!That is, unless you are trying to convince yourself that what you did wasn't wrong, like the man that molested me.I suggest that anyone who is sufferering from something that has happened to them like this should read this book, it is helping me far more than I can imagine and so is speaking out about the wrongdoing. Men can learn from this book too. It's not just for women. Men can learn that this kind of thing is NOT OKAY and that if it has happened to them it is not their fault.What happened to me was not my fault. He broke my trust. I am well loved. The people around me love me very much.This is the mantra that everyone who has suffered such trauma should tell themselves. It has helped me so much and I have only been reciting it for a day.Read this book. Period. These kinds of things need to be covered in school. Education is what will help reduce what is happening. Learn from what happened. Learn and go on living your lives.What happened to me was not my fault. He broke my trust. I am well loved.

This is an excellent book for the general reader; it uses a research base but does not use statistical or research jargon.

Adults will find it equally useful.

As long as this distinction is clear, readers will be pleased to find an academic text, and not a self-help guide, workbook, or recovery support. This book remains a classic, although readers should be aware that this is a current edition of a book that explores the implications of studies from a couple of decades ago. The relevance, then, is that it reveals how epidemic rape has been for a long time, not that it offers cutting-edge recent academic data."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"I Never Called it Rape is a classic book integrating research and womens survivor stories that really helps women to understand about how rape occurs, what it really means, and how to go about recovering for it. Based on the most comprensive study about rape to date, done in the 1980s, Warshaw weaves in the stories of survivors in a poetic an poignant way throught this masterpiece. My only criticism is that the statistics are now 20 years old and it is clearly time for a new edition, or similar book like it, to be written."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"I am so glad I \\"found\\" this book. If you've never cried and know you need to, read this. In every chapter there was something that pertained to me. I cried for the first time in 20 years! That doesn't mean I worked through it through this book. This doesn't teach you how to \\"get over it\\". But, it does help you to realize that you need to talk to someone about it and that it's OK to need help. If I had read this book before or shortly after it happened, I would have been better off about it then, instead of keeping it bottled up for 20 years. For parents of pre-teens - please get this book. It's good for males as well as females. It points out to males behavior that is not acceptable. It teaches females what to do before, during, and after any attack, not just rape as most people define it. It is beautifully written. It is never condescending. It seems a little harsh when males are being discussed. But the negatives they are talking about when talking about males pertain to the ones that attack, not all males.

It uses personal experience, as well as research and the stories of other survivors to convey the fight to mentally survive the after shock of being raped by a person she knows.I must say that I did read all of the reviews of this book and I am completely disgusted with the review of Nathan J. Yoder. He believes that sexual coercion is not rape. Nagging and abusing power in order to force a female to have intercourse is STILL rape. She does NOT want to have sex with the person and this man should be ashamed of himself for writing something this stupid. He believes that this rape survivor wrote a sexist novel. Before this idiotice person writes any additional reviews, he should research rape and what qualifies as rape.In conclusion, this novel was one of the best that I have ever read since my experience.

Got a really reasonable price for the book but shipping was alittle pricey. overall very satisfied with the book"},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"Having been raped myself; this book was essential in my recovery. Since I was raped by a now-ex-boyfriend in my teenage years, I didn't see what happened to me as rape until 4 years after the fact. I think that one of the girls in the book in the teenage chapter described my situation the best when she said, \\"I never told anyone I was raped. I would not have thought that was what it was. It was unwilling sex. I just didn't want to and he did. Today, I know that it was rape\\" on p. 120. I felt violated and as if I had been raped after it happened to me, but I didn't realize that that was actually what had happened.Since I had read several other stories like this and reading statistics throughout this book, it really helped reassure me that I was not alone. I had not faced my experience or called it by its name until recently, and when I read this book, I felt as if I was really conversing with these women. In fact, I might even go as far to say that this book is responsible for my recovery. This book helped me more than any therapist or friends ever could. These women \\"got\\" it.A few months ago, I was finally able to grieve for what I had lost. Having been a virgin when it happened to me, I walked into a local crisis center and later fell into a depression that got worse by the day. Later, I was recommended this book.Reading the chapter about \\"Why Women are Safe Victims\\" really helped me to understand the feelings I was having about the incident, and what had actually happened.This book is well written and the author seems to be driven to write it based on the fact that she too had been raped by someone she knew. I think that one thing that makes this book unique is that it is written by someone who has experienced similar feelings as the other women in this book, as opposed to a counselor who thinks that they understand just because they read something about rape in a textbook somewhere.Reading this helped me to understand that my experience was not one-of-a-kind. It was similar to many other date rapes in numerous respects. Other women married their attackers to make their experience \\"seem okay\\", I knew my attacker, and it happened in an isolated room.This book has the ability to help rape victims realize that others can believe them. Because of how informative it is, it is used by sexuality and rape classes in campuses across the United States. It has a chart in it about the myths vrs. realities about rape, which can help people better understand what rape is and get rid of what society has to say about it.The best part is chapter 14 in which it outlines what to do if you are raped by someone you know. I wish that I had known what I know now about date rape and had had a copy of this chapter with me. However it will help me if I ever help a friend who has been through a similar situation."},{"Title":"I Never Called It Rape: The Ms. Report on Recognizing, Fighting, and Surviving Date and Aquaintance Rape","review":"I find this book to be an excellent referral however, i'd prefer to see a revised edition.

Although it is fairly old, the statistics are still relevant and the topics need to be looked at and discussed. Rape is still a some what \\"hush hush\\" problem because it's a difficult topic to discuss. Aquaintance rape is misunderstood, or not understood at all which is why I loved this book. It explains all the many different types of aquaintance rape from that one date guy who rapes the girl to the case of a husband who rapes his wife. Just because a woman (or man) is dating someone, it does not give the significant other the right to rape them. Just because the victim knew their attacker doesn't make it less of a rape. I HIGHLY recommend this book to EVERYONE. Men and women alike, as well as rape victims/survivors.

She looks at fraternities, athletes, and teen victims.She examines the individual woman's response to an assault committed by a man she knows, as well as the response of universities, the police, and the courts.Included are practical suggestions for preventing acquaintance rape, as well as what to do if it happens to you or someone you know.

You see insight into the problem of Acquaintance rape/ date rape. You see that it is bigger and more common than any other rape. This book provides evidence that some men are criminal in their actions and some genuinely do not have any idea what they are doing is rape or wrong. It covers the emotional trauma, experience, life changing, encountered by victims, and even the effects rape has on social circles (friends, family, etc.). This book deals with the rapists mind too, briefly, and details how this is a Social Problem that our nation, communities, colleges, workplaces, etc. MUST ACKNOWLEDGE and take action. You will read encounters that take place in the courtroom and gain understanding through empirical evidence to the non existence of justice to rape victims, especially those in Acquaintance Rape cases.As a victim:I truly never called it rape. Even in current therapy, I find myself unable to say the term, &#34;rape&#34;. I never knew what to call it. I was young and as suggested in the book, I went through this alone, I did not report, which is common, especially for acquaintance rape. I read encounters that made me think, that triggered some thoughts, but it honestly was the easiest experience I have had in regards to thinking and understanding what happened. As a victim, who was 15 [and raped by a married man who was much older than me, and someone I was taught to trust], I was a little upset that there was no account that related directly to me, which is also a complaint of another reviewer. Unlike the other reviewer, I felt the need to be objective and found it easy to relate to the information provided, as the reactions were quite similar. I do not want anyone reading to think I am bashing the other reviewer because that is not at all my intentions. I think on a whole, that victims can gain some &#34;sanity&#34; or clarity in regards to their experience and utilize it a lot to RE-EVALUATE, in an objective way, the event itself and the actions before and after. I look at my situation completely differently than I did before. I would say this book was very encouraging, and really backed my thoughts on how vital it is that our society change it's view on sex and acquaintance rape.

This is the first book I've read by Ms. Chambers, and I will scour the shelves for her other works. My kids loved this book, and I fell in love with it as well.The story is about Palo and Mala, a pair of twin elephants who couldn't be more different. Palo is gentle, almost timid, and loving. Mala is wild, carefree, and energetic. The twins' mother is concerned that she won't be able to find a life suitable for the two of them. By book's end, we find that it is acceptable to embrace our differences, rather than attempt to stifle them. The elephant twins are to be given their own, very different settings for their very different lives, and the reader soon learns that all elephants will be the recipients of their good fortune.This book touches the children on so many levels. Not only are kids taught that we can be different and still be loved, but we can also be important for our differences.

However, other social scientists have until recently not paid much attention to an integrative study of natural resource conflict. This volume attempts to provide an alternative perspective to conflict analysis by building on theories of political ecology that have developed from Marxist geography and cultural anthropology. The political ecology framework dispenses with neo-Malthusian accounts anchored in population determinism and linear causality. Instead, it calls for a more dialectical approach to understanding why certain environmental conditions breed violence by focusing on the processes by which natural resources are manipulated by vested interests for assuming power.Some of the theoretical arguments presented in this volume have been explored previously by Nancy Peluso and Michael Watts in their edited volume titled Violent Environments (Cornell University Press, 2003). However, the editors of Beyond Territory and Scarcity have managed to provide more in-depth case analysis by focusing on the African continent. Nine countries across the continent are examined by the authors, most of whom have affiliations with Scandinavian research centers, and participated in a workshop organized by the Institutes of Geography and Anthropology at the University of Copenhagen in 2002.The introductory chapter by the editors provides a worthwhile coverage of some of the literature on environment and security including a critical analysis of agency and social resilience. As the editors acknowledge \\"one of the important contributions of Malthusian and neo-Malthusian models is that they make individual agency central\\" (p. 17). Human consumption of natural resources and the scientific constraints of carrying capacity are thus more directly attenuated to the neo-Malthusian approach. Indeed, this is where the political ecologists often receive the most criticism since they tend to neglect the physical constraints of resource availability. The editors develop the concept of \\"political scarcity\\" rather than \\"natural scarcity\\", that is somewhat abstract in the context of climatic change or desertification.The importance of political and economic failure versus natural scarcity has been studied by economists as a determinant of famines, most notably in the Nobel-prize-winning work of economist Amartya Sen. However, even so, environmental degradation can still lead to greater \\"natural scarcity\\" and exacerbate \\"political scarcity.\\" It was perhaps this observation that led to the awarding of the 2004 Nobel Peace prize to the Kenyan environmentalist Wangaari Maathai. The linkage between desertification and the Darfour crisis in Sudan is one that Dr. Maathai and other environmentalists have frequently made. The contributors to this volume would disagree with this causality and instead focus on the land tenure regimes and institutional and cultural factors that have led to alienation and conflict in the region.While accusing prior research on resource-induced conflict of being \\"reductionist\\", the editors of this volume appear to fall into the same trap of presenting a highly focused theory of conflict. A critique of neo-Malthusian approaches must still recognize the physical constraints on the environment and the complex causality of conflict as humans contend with the limitations of natural systems. The peril of only following a political model is that it distracts environmental planners and managers (whom the authors are keen to address) from focusing on the importance of individual environmental behavior. By pushing the burden of causality on embedded power structures, Marxist analyses of the environment often absolve individual consumption patterns and ecological behavior of human societies.Despite these deficiencies, this is a well-researched and clearly written volume that provides some detailed ethnographic analyses of African conflicts. The authors have admirably covered a range of cases across the continent and there is consistent quality between chapters. The book serves as a welcome complement, but not a replacement, to existing economic and political analyses of resource conflicts."},{"Title":"Create Wealth with Quicken 5","review":"I've used Quicken for years, and this book taught me useful, money-saving tips that I never learned with the &quot;Dummies&quot; book, Quicken's own literature, or from the Help menu.

Good literature was never about strict adherence to historical or physical fact. We usually call those history or science, respectively.No, in this book L'Amour seems to let his confident writing skills and his imagination run free. He asks the reader to imagine what would happen if a frontier-trained lad, Hardy Collins, was forced to make his way cross country with nothing more than a three-year-old girl, Betty Sue Powell, a wonderful, almost magical horse, Big Red and a head filled with the knowledge gained from working side-by-side with a loving but tough western father, Scott Collins.Together, Hardy, Betty Sue and Big Red brave everything from the weather to a grizzly to scummy horse thieves, all the while being tracked by a Cheyenne brave who wants this horse of horses. The story flows extremely well culminating in a classic L'Amour showdown.A great western for the entire family.And if you ever get a chance to see the movie of the same title you'll love it too. It's about as faithful an adaptation to an original book as I have ever seen.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"Down the Long Hills is as far as I know, the only book Louis L'Amour wrote where the main characters are kids, little kids at that.I have now read perhaps a hundred books by L'Amour and I have enjoyed every single one of them, even if I did find a few of them to be not nearly as good as most of them. This one though, Down The Long Hills, it is my favorite! After I'd read it I gave a copy to my sister, who is a second grade teacher. She read it and loved it too, and I doubt if she had ever read any Westerns before. She was so impressed on how tough the little boy and little girl in the story were...at how much they knew, compared to children now who have things so much easier. My sister is now reading Down the Long Hills to her own classes, a few pages each day, and the kids are all captivated by it.I fully expect that if this book were promoted as a kids' book, or as a young adult book, that it would become a huge, smash it. But don't think that the book is just for kids because it isn't at all. Adults will love this book too, for sure.I am a writer myself with five published books to my credit and I know and understand how difficult it is to write a book where the action just jumps off the page. No writer of Westerns was more a master of the craft than Luis L'Amour, and this little book may well be his finest.All of Louis L'Amour's books are fun to read and action packed but this story really gets to you. The first few pages of Down the Long Hills are as well crafted as any novel I've ever read. The reader is immediately tossed head over heels right into the action and the fast paced adventure never lets up for a second. Down the Long Hills is a wonderful, marvelous tall tale, an all around terrific read. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"Very, very good.

The wagon train gets attacked by Indians and the children have to push on alone across Wyoming in fall with winter setting in against increasingly mounting odds with nothing but a sack of food, a knife and a horse.It was also a lot of fun to read about this little boy braving Wyoming and crossing the entire state all by himself with a three year old to take care of on top of it. Today you would never have heard of such a thing. A child getting lost out in the desert would be a death knell and even with a huge search party might never be found. This story was about three men traveling together to find the children across a whole state and yet they seemed to have better odds.That was the not fun thing about the story. It seemed almost too much to be believed. The things they faced got crazier and crazier (Indians, wild animals, outlaws, freezing cold, little food) and yet they still kept right on surviving relatively unscathed. It was more than could be believed. I was willing to follow along for the ride though, because who wants to read about a bunch of kids that go off to die a horrible death?"},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"This book isn't one of Louis L'Amour's best. There were a few exciting moments, but the times between them were very dull. I thought he put to much into describing the settings and didn't put enough into the story. After reading other books by Louis L'Amour, I would have to say I was disapointed. For example when the Indians raided the wagon train, the story was talking about the two children bringing the horse back instead of talking about the raid. Two children being alone in the wilderness isn't that exciting. I have to admit it did get better towards the end, but I like to be able to get into a book from the start."},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"I don't buy Comanches on the Oregon Trail. I don't buy two kids as the lone survivors of a Comanche massacre of a wagon train on the Oregon Trail, who have to travel west for hundreds of miles from the scene alone to make it with a big stud horse to find the boy's Pa at Ft. Bridger. I don't buy the boy's father trying to find them and following tracks of a horse where the horse hasn't yet trod. I don't buy the two kids not finding a soul on the deserted Oregon Trail because it's late in the year. Someone rode that trail often, day and night every day of the year, over every foot of the trail, from the time it was opened, either Army, or civilian travel was constant. This is malarkey by a man who had a reputation as a historian based on reader ignorance, not his own knowledge. That and PR hype.Sorry, this is baloney and so are most of his other books and stories. For example, Hondo, where his reputation as a &quot;historian&quot; was first born in a PR conference. In Hondo it is obvious that Looie first wrote just a book, set roughly in the never-never land of traditional Westerns. When his promoting geniuses tried to make it over into a historial tour de force, they fell on their faces, and did him no favor so far as reputation went. Bank account is something else.I recall standing in my back yard while my horse shoer stopped and spit tobacco juice and said, &quot;I was readin' Hondo last night. It's fairly obvious that when he said &quot;there was no water between Lordsburg and the Fort, he meant Ft. Huachuca over there. What did he think that is over there behind me?&quot; He motioned toward the nearby San Pedro River. &quot;It's sure as hell between Lordsburg and the fort. And get this: this clown is carryin' a forty pound saddle across the supposedly waterless desert. What the hell for? You wouldn't make a mile with a saddle. But is sure looked good in the picture on the cover of the book. If they called this guy Looie Manure they'd come closer to the truth. I threw the damn book in the wastebasket.&quot;Looie was a good old boy who wrote an interesting story, and I don't begrudge him his readership any more tahn I begrudge fast good joints their customers who may not even know what a five star restaurant is, or care, but let's not take that historian&quot; business too seriously."},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"A good storyteller will write plots that can be used to investigate interesting subjects, and Louis L'Amour is no different. This particular book, while still a western, is a bit different than most of his others, which tend to feature gunslingers, homesteaders, prospectors or other classic western archetypes of the late 1800's. In this book, which takes place a generation earlier---1848, just as the California Gold Rush brought thousands of families out west in wagon trains---he uses the story to explore what life was like for frontier children; showing how young they were given responsibility, how hard they worked, how early they learned survival skills, and how normal all of this was for them.Two small kids and a horse are the only survivors of an Indian attack on a wagon train in Wyoming territory. They're forced to go on alone, across the vast and desolate high plains, with winter coming and nothing standing between them and probable death except the survival skills they'd been taught, and the unshakable belief that the boy's father, who is waiting for him at Fort Bridger, will come and find them.The children face many different kinds of danger and privation, all with the resilient endurance children naturally possess. They survive because the boy uses what he's been taught, and thinks critically about every situation they encounter, even when he's scared witless. The story has some great edge-of-your-seat action scenes, and wonderful moments where the boy uses his head to find creative solutions to their dilemmas.It's a great story to read to children, or just to enjoy as an adult. Especially if, like me, you were raised in the wilderness, learning the same skills these children had. Louis L'Amour grew up in a similar way, and his portrayal of a 7-year-old survivalist is an accurate account of what a child raised that way knows at such a young age."},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"This is an excellent book.

The action may not be as fast-paced as some of the other Louis L'Amour books, but the attention to detail and the explanation of the survival decisions that the children make are excellent. It was definitely a fun read.I'd recommend it for any child who likes the outdoors or is interested in history -- and also to those who are looking for a good book for a child who may not have found a 'reason' to love reading yet. This book might do it for them!"},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"Having seen a number of movies and TV shows based on Louis L'Amour's novels, and having listened to a number of his stories on audiotape, I thought I would read some of his stories that won Golden Spur awards. To my surprise Down the Long Hills was the only one I could find. It is an excellent tale and a winner on all accounts.Down the Long Hills is really a novella. The paperback version is only 150 pages long and a quick read. I almost gave up on it because I thought it was a children's story. While it is written simply enough such that a juvenile reader could enjoy it, it is written for adults. The reader can identify what it is like to be a child in the wilderness, abandoned and without parents. A parent can identify with the fear of losing a child.The story features a 7-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl who follows him escaping an Indian massacre. The boy, appropriately named Hardy, must try and find his father while being tracked by Indians and 2 crooks. Hardy uses every trick he has learned in his short life to throw the bad guys off his trail yet leave signs for his father. Eventually all parties converge for a rip-snorting climax.This is a great western, if not politically correct, in this day and age. The only problem that I had with it is that some of the dates don't work. Hardy's father was supposed to be over 15 when the Royal Navy pressed him. Yet the story is set in 1848. Given that the Napoleonic wars ended 33 years before the story and that the Royal Navy had to downsize decommissioning sailors not pressing them, Hardy's father is either a lot older than he seems in the story or L'Amour has an anachronism. However, this is a minor point.Down the Long Hills is a great story and shows why L'Amour should have received more critical acclaim than he did."},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"I was surprised to see a rating average of only 4 and a half stars on this one. This is the only book for which L'Amour ever won a Golden Spur Award from Western Writers of America! It is definitely different from anything else he ever wrote, and a great coup, I thought. I usually don't give any L'Amour's more than three stars, but this one sure deserved it. It kept to L'Amour's trademark of no sex, no graphic violence, and little cursing, and I like that a lot. For that reason, if you like L'Amour you just have to read all of the books by the author critics are calling The New Louis L'Amour, Kirby Jonas. He is tremendous, and may one day even replace L'AMour. L'Amour was always my favorite, but Jonas has edged him out. You have to read this guy!"},{"Title":"Down the Long Hills (1981)","review":"Assuming you skip over the massacre (pages 5-6) that leaves the two kids alone in the wild West, this is a great adventure to read to your outdoorsy children. The kids around which the story builds are 3? and 7 and smart, as are all L'Amour's heros. The bad guys are skunks, the dad and his friends are heroic. Yay for the good guys. Yay for the kids. Read it to your 7 or 8-year-old and he/she'll feel heroic too. Scary for those easily spooked but you can adjust that as you read. A fun read for adults, too."},{"Title":"The kids' money book: Earning, saving, spending, investing, donating","review":"This is not the book I thought it was going to be.

Maybe even a bit of mind control. Whackiness of stuff, and whackiness of language.In other words, this book is really not very good."},{"Title":"The Eighty Minute Hour","review":"Now, this is one of the weirdest novels I have read. It builds on the same kind of scenario as Frankenstein Unbound i.e. time slips as a result of nuclear war. But this story in infinitely more complex. There are I think five or six parallel stories with different character that only in the very end are connected to each other (think about that, I guess about ten main characters equally important, and you have to read six or seven chapters to find out what happened when the last chapter ended).It is written as a kind of musical comedy, I kid you not, the character repeatedly break out in song! Since time is acting up, there is no simple way to tell the story (like chronological order) so it does get confusing at times.The theme of the book could be said to be a kind of mystery that asks who actually rules the world. It seems that the world is run by computers (the Zeitgeist people should read this), but who runs the computers?It is also at times almost Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy-level silly, though not as funny IMO. And incredibly thought provoking as well. Aldiss in all his books is fond of alluding to different works of literature etc, but here it at times get absurd (I guess it is because the narrator is far from a neutral observer): I found a joke that you would only get if you are fairly well versed in liturgical terminology.It does kind of come together in the end, but at times it does feel like a bit too much. So, high marks for ambition, slightly less so for execution. But it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Eighty Minute Hour","review":"I usually finish any book I read, but this one did not entertain me; it did not interest me in the characters, setting, nor concepts.

Then there will be no need to have a hugh state beaurocracy enforcement. 50-50 joint custody means both parents will have equal rights and responsibilities, there will be no need for either to pay child support, no need to transfer money or have a state agency to monitor it. If one paren fails to live up to their bargin, only then the other could go back to court and petition for sole custody. The past 30 years have shown the entire social experiment is a failure. Now's the time to change the law and make a better system that works."},{"Title":"Making Fathers Pay: The Enforcement of Child Support","review":"This is a well documented discussion of how to get blood from a stone, or put another way, how to enforce indentured servitude, a form of slavery, to the maximum advantage. It smacks of 17th century studies aimed a adjusting the size of cotton bales to maximize the total pounds of cotton each slave could load per day. What it fails to address is that indentured servitude, and all forms of slavery, have been illegal in the US since the Civil War. Of course David Chambers is a professor of law, and therefore blinded to moral or ethical considerations that might have been in his book. Instead of elimination of a hateful system of servitude of men, he proposes a massive tax on all non-custodial men to pay women for breaking up our families and taking our children. Unfortunatly you can't make wrong into right by doing wrong more effectively. Like the 99lb \\"optimum\\" bale of cotton, an optimum way of extracting money from men has little merit. Another father is driven to suicide every 6 minutes in the US after lawyers take away his family and bind him into the involuntary indentured servitude called \\"child support.\\" This book fails to address any of the massive human toll or to propose any real solutions. It merely fantacizes about ways to tighten the already overstrained legal screws.I'm sure that attorneys, judges, and bureaucrats who earn their livings on the backs of emotionally distraught fathers who are already suffereing emotionally from the loss of their children will enjoy the read."},{"Title":"Making Fathers Pay: The Enforcement of Child Support","review":"Here we go again. A totally unobjective review of the child support system in America. It is blantatly clear that any parent that skips out on their child in terms of not only financial support but emotional support has got some serious problems. However, the child support laws, enforcement policies and system are huge failures. This book instead treats them as a wonderful solution to the problem of the failed family unit in America - NOT!!!First off, in cases where the custodial parent has a capable income they too are financially responsible for their children yet the laws explictily say this yet they are ignored - this book ignores this as well. For example a professional mother, earning 200,000 a year has her daughter's father's paltry income of 50,000 ganrished for child support. A year later she quits her job. Is that in the best interest of the child? If the father can't remove his financial support, how come the system allows the mother to remove hers (and in this case that would be a much larger impact on the child's living style than if dad was a deadbeat). The book never addresses the custodial parent's financial responsibilities even though they are clearly mandated by the law but ignored everywhere else. This is a huge problem with the current child support system.Secondly, very few Fathers don't pay support and the amount of time, money effort, etc. that we put into chasing them down and jailing them clearly is not being used effectively. Additionally the laws are clearly destroying dads who are support of their kids and clearly do not need government intervention to tell them they must. The makes no mention of these problems.Thirdly, there is no mention to the problem whereby custodial parents despite their equal responsibility see a credit rating increase at the receipt of child support where as the non-custodial parent sees a huge decrease. Why should that be - they both have to pay their share to support their child. Oddly enough, banks see child support as income - yet this money should not change the financial position of the custodial parent as it should be totally spent on the child. In fact that parent should be appraised the same way as the non-custodial parent as their percentage of their income should be going to the child in the same fashion. Any mention of this huge inequity in the book - nope - just one thing - get those deadbeats!What about deadbeat moms - no mention of them in here, about 40% of moms don't pay their court ordered child support, only about 22% of dads don't pay. And there is a big difference with not paying in the two cases. In the mom's case it is predominantly total default.This book attempts to play into what is politically correct and does so at the cost of equity, objectiveness and reason. That sucks. If I could have given it less than one star I would have."},{"Title":"The 9th Annual of the Year's Best SF","review":"I purchased this book along with the previous book (8th annual years best SF) recently as a bit of a walk down memory lane.When I was in late grade-school, I used to mow the lawns of some of my neighbors. One was a SF reader, and had a collection of old 50s and newer 60s SF books that he'd lend to me. I remember certain stories with some fondness, and wanted to see if I could find them again. I remembered that the Judith Merril books were amongst those I read back then, so I was able to come here to Amazon (as well as a couple other vendors) and purchase inexpensive used copies of these books, so I now have the whole set up to number 11.I haven't yet gotten to these last two books, but I feel confident that some of those remembered stories are in here.Being anthologies, there's quite a variation of style and quality here, but if you're a middle-aged SF fan as I am, these books should evoke some memories for you!"},{"Title":"Crushed","review":"(I revised my February 2006 review to address points in an April 10, 2006, review on this page.) The 10/2005 issue of Photo District News, a magazine for professional photographers, named this one of the \\"most captivating and influential photography books\\" from 1999-2004. In an interview on the Web, photographer Jason Fulford said \\"this book is about the simultaneous feeling of sad and funny,\\" which was intriguing. So I thought I would buy a copy.This hardcover (ISBN 0-9701656-7-6) measures 23 cm high by 18 cm wide. The covers and the pastedown endpapers are illustrated with four photos not found in the body of the book.The first page has a quotation \\"It's only a game, but it's the only game\\" by the character Emmett Creed in a 1972 novel \\"End Zone\\" by Don DeLillo. After that are almost 100 pages containing 60 color photos, each 11.5 cm square. The photographs were taken 1997-2001 in the United States (accounting for just over half the photos), Canada, China, France, Hungary, Iceland, India, and Romania. Blank pages are interspersed apparently randomly among the pages with photos. The last two pages give locations and dates for the 64 photos (which are difficult to use because the photos on the interior pages are unnumbered!*), as well as copyright information.Overall, I'm not as favorably impressed as PDN's editors. Some photos are either funny or sad, like #13 with the couple putting their heads through holes in a sculpture to pose as king & queen of the sea; #21 with the single car in the parking lot covered with snow; #33 with people in a park in the shadow of a palm tree; and #46 with hairy guys. I see some recurring themes: tree trunks on wallpaper in #1, real tree trunks in #4; plastic lamb in #11, flock of lambs in #34; crushed cars in #15 and #28; a tiger print on sheets in #16, a stuffed tiger in #50; plastic(?) white horse in #17, real(?) white horse in #53; brown paint on bricks in #42, brown towels in #43; etc.But I find no theme or sequence linking all the photos. Furthermore, most of the photos are just uninteresting. The photos are not beautiful in a painterly sense like Eggleston's, nor are they poignant like Dijkstra's or Soth's. Susan Lipper's books show far more insight into humanity. For example, her \\"Grapevine\\" (1994) documents a town in West Virginia with photographs and interviews; her \\"Trip\\" (1999) consists of road trip photos with a text by Frederick Barthelme. In my mind, this book is most reminiscent of Stephen Shore's books (like \\"American Surfaces\\" and \\"Uncommon Places\\"), which I consider mundane and over-rated.Per the publisher's Web site, the book is limited to an edition of 3,000; I'm wondering if all those copies will ever be sold.* In the aforementioned interview, Fulford states that the location info \\"seemed relevant in order to say that this book is not about any one region or country,\\" but to accomplish that goal it would have been better to either: (1) randomly list the 64 locations, or (2) state only something like \\"the photos were taken in North America, Asia, and Europe.\\""},{"Title":"Crushed","review":"This was a gift for my daughter who is studying to be a professional photographer.

This is the first photography book I have purchased in a very long time and am glad I did.

This is, in fact, not the most minimal art book ever published, I think that would go to Richard Misrach's first book of desert photographs which was published with only an ISBN number.This is a book of images taken 1997-2001 by the author in such far-ranging locales as the US, China, India, Canada, Iceland, and Transylvania. There is no explicatory text, just the identifying titles listed at the end. I personally do not have a problem with the \\"titles\\" not being shown next to the image because, in the end, they don't matter. The images transcend their physical locale and become anywhere, anytime images; they are more global than local. In addition, the lack of titles keeps the viewer/reader from potential influence about how they may read an image knowing where it was made; the lack of titles helps the viewer/reader come to a completely unbiased interpretation of the image. The lack of immediate titling forces one to really look at each image and consider it on an aesthetic level instead of mere geographic location.It's difficult to pinpoint Fulford's visual influence for there are images reminiscent of a number today's leading photographers: William Eggleston,Rineke Dijkstra, Alec Soth, Stephen Shore, and Susan Lipper. A common theme running through the book...um, not really sure but these images are all very quiet and sometime melancholy, sometimes humorous. Oh wait, I know...the theme is: life! This is really very apparent. These images give us what photography shows us best - the moment between the next moment. All we have to do is take the time to recognize these moments and their simple beauty."},{"Title":"Crushed","review":"unlike a previous reviewer, i DO get this work, and it's OK. my major problem is that the work comes off as cute and hipper-than-thou. this style of work is rather trendy, the question being whether that's a declining or inclining trend. for me, i hope the work finds its proper place, and doesn't reach the front lines of art."},{"Title":"Crushed","review":"Jason Fulford has proven himself, in Crushed, to be one of our younger generation's heirs to the meditative and witty fine art photojournalism of Robert Frank, Lee Friendlander, Garry Winogrand, Diane Arbus, and William Eggleston.

Even more interesting: when I was starting out in my career, I worked for a publisher in NY and had a chance to meet the author. She was...warm and encouraging and frankly just marvelous.

This is literature, thoughtful and accurate in its picture of life in the early part of the last century and yet still ringing true today in its issues and feelings.

It is 1899, and Pearce has been traveling on foot for four days. Believing that \\"This [man] was a burden [God] had...chosen for him,\\" Hassanali enlists his wife Malika, and his sister Rehana to help care for him until a local British official brings him back to \\"civilization.\\" When Pearce returns to thank Hassanali, he becomes enamored of Rehana, and their eventual affair becomes a scandal in both the British and the Indian/Muslim communities.Part II, which takes place fifty years later in Zanzibar, focuses on a new set of characters--two brothers, Amin and Rashid, and their sister Farida. The story of Amin's love for Jamila, which soon unfolds, bears some resemblance to that of Pearce and Rehana--both loves involve cultural and religious taboos and raise questions about the ability of love to survive such difficulties.Part III, which further develops the stories of Amin, Rashid, and Farida, takes place about fifteen years after that. Amin is still in Zanzibar, while Rashid is studying in England. The British have granted Zanzibar independence, but a revolution has taken place. The traumas of this period and its bloodshed, primarily in the 1970s, keep the brothers apart, and, because of censorship in Zanzibar, their communications are difficult and vague. \\"A Continuation,\\" the five-page epilogue, eventually connects all the stories and resolves some unanswered questions.Illustrating, to some extent, the effects of colonialism, along with desertions and displacements in the characters' lives, Gurnah concentrates primarily on stories of family, courtship, and relationships--ordinary people living their daily lives. His style is smooth and descriptive, conjuring the moods and images of different times and places, but structurally, the novel feels like three separate stories, rather than a continuous whole. The characters we meet in Part I (the most exciting part) are never mentioned again until the five-page epilogue, and that epilogue, which connects the various stories, depends on coincidence for its surprises and feels artificial. Individually, the stories, told primarily by Rashid, are intriging, but they feel more like three separate novellas than one unified novel. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"I first learned about this book from Essence Magazines best sellers list. I read a brief synopsis and decided to purchase the book because it seemed interesting and Essence is rarely wrong. This book was amazing. Its a bit hard to get into at first but I loved it. It was beautifully written. Kudos!"},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"What begins as a literary novel of love and passion across the barriers of race and culture becomes something more - and less - in Gurnah's restrained and capable hands.The novel begins in 1899 in a small coastal town near Mombassa when a Muslim storekeeper stumbles over a comatose Englishman in the early morning hours. He has the unconscious man brought to the home he shares with his young wife and beautiful, embittered sister, Rehana.When the British colonial establishment, in the person of the usual ignorant, racist, self-satisfied man of Empire, hears of the injured man, he hurries to fetch him away and settle him in a proper white man's establishment. The patient quickly recovers and identifies himself as Martin Pearce, something of a wanderer and orientalist, who had been robbed and abandoned by his Somali guides.Pearce is a sensitive man, adept at languages and interested in cultures other than his own. Perceiving that his British rescuer undoubtedly offended his local rescuer, Pearce goes on his own to thank the man. Invited to a meal, he is smitten with Rehana.Rehana is in a difficult position. Her husband disappeared on a trading journey. He may be dead, he may have deserted her. She lives in an isolated limbo, dependent on her brother, her future bleak.And just as she takes a step to return the Englishman's attraction, the heretofore invisible narrator interrupts, the narrative jumps forward 50 years, and he sums up Rehana's fate in a few short pages, baffled as to how she could do it, how she could run off to Mombassa with an Englishman who would, and did, leave her to her disgrace.\\"Perhaps she thought she had nothing to lose, that all that remained for her was a lifetime in that bright yard behind the shop, making clothes for women who only paid her a pittance, or only offered her affection and promises in return. That does not sound so intolerable, really, not for a woman who had lived her whole life in the back of a shop in that town, and who was used to women's lives such as hers.\\"For Rashid, the narrator, born long after Rehana is dead and buried, her story is chiefly of interest for its impact on his older brother Amin and the peripheral involvement of his sister, Farida. Amin falls in love with Jasmina, the granddaughter of Martin Pearce and Rehana. There are several strikes against her - she is older and has previously been married, but in their conservative society she inherited a taint and was doomed to be fast and loose from the day she was born. In other words, his parents are adamant that Jasmina is unfit to marry their Amin.Rashid, several years younger and largely oblivious to the drama enveloping his brother and family, is bent on going to Oxford to study. He succeeds in doing this, leaving shortly after his parents have derailed Amin and Jasmina's secret love affair. From afar he celebrates his country's independence from Britain and then the spiral into chaos and violence that makes him an exile rather than a temporary student.As time passes and he makes a new life for himself in Britain, far from the village traditions of Islam and Zanzibar, he learns more of the events of 1899, the love affair that reverberated through generations, and gains a keener empathy for what might have been.Booker Prize-nominated Gurnah, a Zanzibar native who now teaches in Britain, examines culture clash and prejudice, family loyalty and relationships, colonial attitudes and the upheavals in Africa following independence. His narrator's distance and unwillingness to intrude on the privacy of the lovers lessens the emotional resonance of the story's core as do the abrupt segues between the three sections.Bur Gurnah is not looking for romantic appeal. He wants the reader to feel the greater tragedy of rigidity, patriarchal power (political and familial), and cultural isolation. Lest you think him too intellectual, though, his prose is fluid, dynamic and atmospheric, and carries the story along in a tumult of color and life:\\"The rains came during this time, lowering the sky for days and then releasing torrents of clear crystal water that refreshed everyone. At first it was as it everything had been reborn: trees swayed more self-importantly than before, house-roofs gleamed through the rust, roads sparkled, but as the rains continued day after day, the gutters filled up with debris that the water had swept up in its rush, drains overflowed and pools and puddles formed everywhere. Roofs leaked and water found its way into the limestone mortar and loosened the fabric of the houses, some of which collapsed suddenly in the night.\\"An affecting novel for anyone who enjoys literature about Africa, the colonial legacy and the power of family.-- Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"Extremely well written book. If words were like music, this would be it. Set in East Africa, this is a multicultural story of cross cultural love affairs. The story is written mostly with broad strokes, and occasional detail, much of whi I did not understand until the final pages of the book, when many of apparently disjointed scenes finally come together. Why so many pages were expended on the detailed rantings of the British District Officer Frederick Turner, and so little detail on Martin and Rehana's affair and life together? I would have preferred fewer pages on the former and more on the later, but nevertheless it is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"The blurb tells us that the story begins in 1899 in a coastal village near Mombasa in what was then called the East Africa Protectorate and would later be called Kenya, and that it is about a passionate love affair between Martin Pearce, an Englishman, and Rahana, a Muslim girl, but we have to wait until page 108 before that starts. By then the novel has established several characters: three Englishmen - Pearce; a District Officer called Frederick Turner; and a coarse estate manager called Burton - and Rahana's family - her brother Hassanali and her sister-in-law Malika. It has also brought to life the local scene, with its African, Arab and Indian population and the customs of the villagers. The plot so far has been on the thin side; but we have learnt the history of the area and the attitude of the British towards the local people mainly from several didactic passages in the dialogue between the Englishmen.A mere twelve pages after the love affair has started, it has reached its conclusion, and so has Part I. In Part II we are suddenly brought into an apparently unrelated story, with a different set of characters, this time set in Zanzibar a little over 50 years after the earlier story. These new characters - two brothers, their sister, and their parents - and their relationship to each other are well described (that between the brothers is particularly touching), but again there isn't much of a plot. The older brother, Amin, is in love with a girl - and like the love affair in Part I, this one runs in the face of disapproval - in the first part on account of race, in the second part at least on account of the girl's background and uncertain reputation.Part III is written twenty years later, in the 1980s. The younger brother, Rashid, had won a scholarship to study in London, and he recounts the unfriendliness and the racism he found there (this is 1963). Soon after his arrival Zanzibar had became independent, and within a few months of independence there had been a bloody revolution on the island when the African majority there turned against the ruling Arab minority. Rashid's father had told him not to return home, so Rashid now also saw himself as an exile. He made a career for himself at an English university. This all seems very autobiographical). His correspondence with his family becomes more artificial. We now understand for the first time the title of the book. But there is another desertion we will learn about.And suddenly, in what seems a throw-away line, we find that the stories of Part I and Part II have a link, (though perhaps we might have guessed what it was); we understand why there seemed to be such a break between it and the later parts; and the story that was broken off so abruptly at the end of Part I is now resumed.Unlike another reader, I found this third part much the best - perhaps because it describes Rashid's (i.e. the author's) feelings instead of the feelings of all the other characters in the book, which, by comparison, are seen more from the outside and perhaps not quite as deeply experienced. And you cannot say of Part III that there is hardly any plot! My estimation of the book went up a great deal."},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"The title can indicate the end of East African colonialism and the vicissitudes of love. Both euphoric experiences dissipate with the coming of political and social realities. The brief happiness of independence and romance sustain them across bland, desperate times. The saga covers three generations of Zanzibaris, English, and Mombasans. The author unravels the surprising relations at the end. Curiosity prompted my inquiry into the geography, clothing, and history of the area. Gurnah reveres literary arts. Characters create prose, poetry, and letters while he plays with a passage from Leopold S&eacute;dar Senghor."},{"Title":"Desertion: A Novel","review":"Desertion is a gripping novel that tackled themes of colonialism, particularly the impact on a country when the colonial power pulls out, and issues of race in relationships. The novel is framed by two forbidden love affairs which underline the impact of prejudice, of different kinds, on the lovers. There are subtle references to Zanzibar's history and the impact of certain events on the characters.

It should be in your field kit. It contains a number of essential reference tools, ranging from a description of current Kodak films, to aides for estimating exposure, reciprocity correction, and proper filtration.The topics are not exhaustive, as one would expect from a textbook. But then, this isn't a text, it's a field handbook. As such, it fills a need very well."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"I bough this book basically for the 5'x5'18% Gray Card which comes along with this book. I have used the card many times unfortunatley I can't say the same for the book itself.The book may be handy for its small size which you can cary in a 1 body SLR bag.Lots of technical jargons, no amateur would grasp this book in a single or even triple reading. There are some information that is very usefull, e.g the f stops that could be used for different lighting, film types and all the information you can possible get e.g which film speed has grain,film reactions to different light, which light is best for the type of film, purposes for film. The only thing is you should not expect any other information on different brands, I mean it is a Kodak Book.There is also information to help you select the right or close to the correct setting for the camera but it's only suggestions to get the correct settings.This is a good book for the advance and professional photographer but I wouldn't sugect novices to purchase just yet untill they are comfortable with their craft."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"For any serious amatateur photographer (and I can't sayabout professional photographers, because I'm not one),the Kodak Professional Photoguide is indispensible. It'sseven tabbed chapters take one quickly to referencematerials on every techinical subject concerningpicture-taking to which you would need to refer.For instance, the chapter entitled &quot;exposure&quot; containsdetail information on every metering techniqueexcept the Zone System, as well as containing handytables on, for instance, ISO film speeds in 1/3 stop intervals,lighting ratios, exposure correction for leaf shutters, andan existing light dial that gives standard exposure timesfor a variety of hard to meter situations (i.e. moonlitlandscapes).If you don't know what any of the above topic are, then thebook is too advanced for you. Order Ansel Adams triology(The Camara, The Negative, The Print) and Hornstein's books,read them, then buy the Kodak Professional Photoguide.The only draw backs to the Photoguide are:(1) the descriptions of film are exclusively for Kodakfilm. Kodak could be a little more ecumenical on thissubject; but they are in the business of selling Kodakfilm, so this is forgiveable; &amp;(2) the 5th edition dates from 1995 and the film informationis in fact getting a bit stale. Kodak has introducednot only its APS line of film since 1995, but severalnew ektachrome films as well as Royal Gold 200 and discontinueda couple of films described there...this, however, is no reasonnot to buy this book."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"This is the only book I always keep in my photo case. An excellent technical reference. Whenever I find myself scratching my head trying to figure out how to expose for a scene I find the answer in this book. Beside all the usual technical stuff it's full of charts and dials that lets you find out stuff like depth of field and how to expose in near darkness. The best thing I like about this book is that is quiet small (fits perfectly in my photo case) and the inside of the last cover is a Grey card. Neat."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"This is a very technical book, those dipping into photography as a beginner will really yawn fast. In short not for learning but as a technical reference.Excellent information on everything I can think of, data tables, charts, dials, formulas. In fact got me learning new stuff on light metering and exposure.An initial problem is that the filters are referred in Kodak terms and Wratten, eg 20B, 30R, 20C etc...kinda confusing at times, I still don't quite it much of the time (too lazy perhaps) but minor glitch. One other thing is, read it before you go for the trip! Can really get messy if you need info in a hurry. Really thoughtful that a gray card is included but I prefer the neat idea that the Nat. Geographic Field Guide team did; inside covers acting as gray cards! cool.Saying it as a field guide would be a bit of overstatement, at least for my purpose. The cover is so thin and binding so flimsy that I wonder what the publisher and author are thinking. I had to reinforce it with tapes and thick cardboard, maybe some wont need it but people like me who carry the camera in a watertight bag in one hand and go backpacking might just need to do these. I wish it's smaller (thicker is not a problem) but alas, one can never please everybody...Get this book, even if you think you won't need it (like me), you might just learn new tricks never thought of or come across your mind."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"I used the 1975 edition of this book throughout my career in photography. There's so much to remember anyway about photography,,, why remember more than you need to! This book with all it's dials and charts, will give you just about all the answers you need to know regarding low light or really bright exposures (you can easily arrive at the correct exposure for uncommon lighting situations), depth of field, film types and film capabilities, etc. etc.The pages of this book are packed with all the info and tools you need to arrive at the answer to your questions, and those rotating dials are truly &quot;bigtime&quot; problem solvers.You gotta get this book!!!"},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"When I received this book, I thumbed through it and set it aside to be buried by other things. I think that was an indication of how not unexcited I was about the book. It is intended to be carried as a reference, but didn't fit in my camera bag. Got a new, larger, professional LowePro bag. Didn't fit in there, either.The book is supposed to be a &quot;professional&quot; photoguide, but much of the information provided would be so fundamental to a pro that a reference wouldn't be needed (e.g., how to use a light meter.). Some topics seem to be too involved for a discussion in a pocket reference and then are neither succinct nor good. Of course, references to film will soon be outdated, and the book didn't have data for Kodak Supra, which I use almost exclusively. Of course, like most Kodak books (which are otherwise typically excellent) the film references are very Kodak-centric.What is very good are the calculators - one gives you camera settings for unusual situations or ones in case your meter breaks. Another gives filters to correct about any type of light for any type of film. The depth-of-field calculators are useful when I'm shooting 4x5, but they chose to not include them for 35mm, stating that DOF scales are built into the lenses of most 35mm cameras. However, with the rising quality and popularity of zoom lenses, this is a bad oversight, as most zooms do not have DOF scales.The books does have some good information in it, but left with a sick feeling in my stomach. That is the feeling I get when I feel as though I have wasted my money on something. The cover says $29.95, and it's a few dollars cheaper on-line, but I still feel like I got way too little information for too much money.There is a smaller, pocketable version that I haven't looked at yet. Perhaps it retains the best info at a lower price, and in a size that fits in my camera bag."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"While this book has a wealth of information ranging from f-stop's to shutter speeds, etc . . . it did not provide the guidance that I expected at the beginner level. Two years from now, if I am still trying better my photographic skills this book will act as a great reference."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"I think every advance amateur should have a copy of this guide in his/her bag. If for nothing else, the condense film guide and the color conversion/compensation dials alone are worth the money. Yes, you can get the same information somewhere else, but this is the only pocket guide that consolidates everything. Professionals may also benefit from it when they have to change from their routine, such as going to a different film. This book is not for beginners."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"I wasn't paying close enough attention when I purchased this guide - it's definitely above my level. I'm sure it's chock-full of useful tidbits for professional or pro-am photographers, but I looked through it with a growing sense of frustration, confusion and futility.There are sections on film types, film care and storage, exposure, filters, flash, lenses, and other important items, but the level of information presented is rather advanced. There are multiple graphs, calculators, and spinning dials to compute correct values. An 18% gray card in the back is very useful for metering, but not worth the price of the whole book, of course.The size of Kodak's guide is pretty convenient - small enough to fit into most bags without taking up too much space, but not so small that it's unreadable (though the print size is very small.) The charts are in color, and are easy to read. I can't really comment about the actual content provided - while it *looks* very good, I can't be absolutely sure how useful it will be to a true professional.My feeling is this: if you're a photographer who has a solid grasp of the complexities of the art, but want to take your skills to the next *technical* level, this may be for you. If you, like me, are a relative beginner, who wants to learn how to take better photos overall, this is definitely not it. Perhaps consider Ansel Adam's series instead - a prominent photo magazine editor recommends beginning with _The Negative_."},{"Title":"Kodak Professional Photoguide","review":"An excellent reference for photographers above the \\"point and shoot\\" group --and could prove very helpful to this large group of photographers also. It should be in camera bag. This is NOT a text book but it has the needed information that you require to make a good photograph when you snap the shutter.Some topics might be over your head today, but if you are really serious about being an above the average snapshooter and want to become a good photographer this is for you. You will grow into it and find The Kodak Professional Photoguide is indispensible. The chapters are tabbed and will take you quickly to reference materials on every techinical subject concerning picture-taking to which you would need to refer.IF you are not into film but go digital, it will not be as useful but has some good information on exposure (existing light, metering in artificial light, lighting ratios for portraits, etc). Information you can adapt for using filters, flash and taking care of your camera lenses. For instance camera lenses are different than eyeglass lenses and can be damaged by using eyeglass cleaning techniques.I use both digital and film and find this book is indispensible for for the serious amateur photographer using either digital cameras or film cameras.As for the Pro, I am not one and cannot make any comments concerning this book there, except to say many of the pros that I have met have this book with them in the studio and many carry it in their bags in the field.And it can be bought \\"used\\" for half the price.

No locked room or any other kind of impossible crime here. No Gideon Fell or Henry Merrivale. &quot;Snuff-Box&quot; is a stand-alone, one of those experimental books that Carr attempted now and then. And one of his very masterpieces.I doubt that there are some people who don't like JDC. But if such people exist, they have to read this book at once: it will have their eyes open. Carr creates fully-drawn characters you won't forget, such as Eve Neill, Ned Atwood, Toby Lawes or Dermot Kinross. He also provides a touching love story, and some really moving scenes, yet humor is never absent. Look at the ending, one of Carr's best ones. Atmosphere is as well done as usual. And the plot...

Stylistically reads in the way Agatha Christie writes, but the characterizations are more to the taste of top-flight Barbara Michaels. For those to whom those names don't help, say that there is plenty of humor involved, an admirable if flawed hero, many colorful characters written on the real side of caricature, plucky sidekick, a plot that bangs along without slowing down, intelligent and clear delivery. This book is very hard to get ahold of and all these are reasons why.

Worth reading - just don't expect too much:-)"},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"Much of Charles de Lint's work has been categorized as urban fantasy - tales that tell of the power and magic in the world today, in people's lives now, in places here. \\"Into the Green\\" could be a transition tale: how did we get to a time in which magic and power seem to have disappeared, in which urban fantasy comes into being as the longing for that power and magic? What was the world like just before the very last traces of that power disappeared?Angharad the tinker, a nomad of gypsy kind, lived in the world at such a time. The \\"time\\" is of course disguised as a different place - the Kingdom of the Green Isles - and in fact has a history, a past time of its own in which power and magic, and those who wielded the power and magic, were not so rare. The Kingdom of the Green Isles is not thick with magic; this isn't Earthsea, with its mage winds, competing mages, priestesses, Roke's college of mages. It is more akin to Middle Earth at the end of the Third Age: political and military powers are wielded in the open, while ancient wisdoms and subtle forces fade and dissipate as surely as, though more slowly than, the morning fog lifts and disperses with the rising sun. Then we are in the heat and rush and bright light of day.One of the remaining spirits in the Kingdom of the Green Isles - a mere breath, a shimmering wisp of that world's magic - warns Angharad of the impending final retreat of \\"the green\\", of magic and light, from their world. It is Angharad's triad of dispensations - tinker, witch, and harpist - that signal her right to this wisdom, and allow her understanding of and response to that wisdom. The spirit, an oak's spirit, instructs Angharad in, if not preventing the final retreat of \\"the green\\", at least closing off the most obvious and sure avenue of that retreat. This is a magical box, a sort of negative Pandora's box. If let open in the world, the box wouldn't release a mob of calamities and troubles, but would rather suck out of the world the last of that breath of magic of the green into the blackness of the box. Her task is to find the box, and somehow take that blackness into herself before it can darken the fey light in the heart of the world.De Lint's story seems to come to us through the mists of Irish history, language and legend, much of which is left obscure. The many references, and even more subtle allusions, to a nomadic Irish gypsy life do give a certain time-depth to the Kingdom of the Green Isles, and to Angharad's life and journey there. At times, these same idioms and colloquialisms lack substance, and stand out like props. Also, the storytelling suffers from a choppy plot in the first third of the book. The acknowledgment at the beginning of the book partly explains, and confirms, this: the \\"early portion of this novel appeared, in much altered form, as short stories.\\"About one-third the way into the book, I got the sense that I'd left behind any story that had been developing, or not developing, and now was coming quickly into the thick of a mystery novel. Angharad has temporarily left her meandering tinker ways to get wrapped up in, and get to the bottom of, intrigues involving the sale of purported witch bones, and finding the mysterious box that may after all be somehow involved in the gruesome business.Nonetheless, the last half of the book is quite engaging, and actually less \\"fantastic\\" than is the first \\"early portion.\\" Perhaps the most engaging of this part of the story is its more soulful, psychological, and human, rather than fantastic and fey, quality. A broken, unredeemed outcast - a forgotten, crippled soldier bent on blowing his brains out with alcohol (he is a coward to boot, and so resists cutting his own throat or falling on a sword) - flickers into the picture. He can't bear to look at his love, the woman he held in her dying moments, as she speaks to him in his memories, and we ache for him to look and listen long enough to hear beyond his shame and fear. Angharad finds him in the gutter, but he's been there a very long time; his mind is darkened, and alcohol helps him to keep it that way. Alcohol, anger and resentment. If Angharad's humility can be counted on, she won't mind that in fact the reader finds the real joy, the real power and magic, not in her ghostly harp playing and witchy frights, but in this man's facing of his own wasted life. This could be the ultimate triumph of \\"the green,\\" and the sure genius of \\"Into the Green.\\""},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"What a strange little book. That was the first thought that crossed my head after I closed \\"Into the Green\\". It concerns the adventures of Angharad, a tinker-woman who is also \`Summerborn', which means that she has a mystical gift that connects her with the realm of Faerie, better known in this world as \`the Green'. Travelling the three islands that make up her Celtic-flavoured world, Angharad's mission in life is to awaken other potential Summerborns to their dormant gift and prevent the magic of the Green from leaking out of the world through her singing, storytelling and harping.In the first surprise of the book, the heroine does not marry at the finale of the story but at its beginning - and just as abruptly her husband Garrow is taken from her by the plague. With her husband, family and community dead she is forced into a new calling as a solitary wanderer. For the first few chapters of the book, it seemed that De Lint was mapping a rather unusual plot: each chapter is a self-enclosed adventure of Angharad as she searches for fellow Summerborns, a format you would expect from a episodic television series. For example, in one chapter Angharad meets a tree wizard and helps out his misguided apprentice, in another she finds herself in a dangerous situation with some witch-hunters, one of whom is a Summerborn himself. Each crisis is wrapped up by the end of the chapter, and has no further bearing on the rest of the story.But just as I began to settle in and enjoy this unique volume of mini-adventures (told in beautiful prose with a wonderful melding of Celtic myth and original ideas), De Lint throws in an actual story, with cross-chapter references and character building. Unfortunately this story wasn't quite as interesting as it should have been, and I had already found De Lint's previous path (of telling one story of Angharad's life per chapter) quite appealing. Now we're dealing with a mysterious puzzle-box is uncovered after thousands of years, one that poses a threat to the Summerborn and the Green. Angharad is charged with the task of finding and destroying it.From here, about a dozen new characters are introduced (none of whom are as interesting as those found in the first half of the book) who are rather difficult to keep track of. The quality of the puzzle-box story can be summed up in the fact that I remember Angharad's solo adventures at the beginning of the book very well, but have no idea as to how she managed to eventually destroy the power of the puzzle box.As I said, it's an odd little book. Many will share my sentiment that the idea of a series of short-stories concerning Angharad's life was a unique and interesting conceit; others will be impatient for the longer story-arc of the book that involves the sinister puzzle box. I certainly don't regret reading \\"Into the Green\\" as it has some neat little ideas concerning the life and qualities of the tinker-folk, and De Lint's language is beautiful, but still...it's odd!"},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"I'm a huge fan of de Lint, and so I enjoy all his works, though I expected more out of this one. It centers around Angharad, who is a tinker, witch, and a harper (a point that de Lint emphasises every few pages and comes to be very annoying) and she interrupts her usual quest, of roaming the lands to find others of her kind and show them their gifts, so that she can destroy a great evil. A great, horrible, terrible evil, that is essentially just a shadow inside a box that makes people feel awful. And Angharad is burdened with the quest of finding the box and destroying what's inside so that it doesn't destroy \\"the green\\", which is the land of magic that we also hear about every few pages, and also gets annoying.But repetetive phrases aside, it was a decent little story. Quick read. The characters are fairly likeable, though they're not nearly as engaging as some of de Lint's other characters. The settings were nicely described though, and I felt like I was there, without being told every single detail. It did feel like the story was building up to some epic ending, but overall it was pretty passive. I'm glad I read the book, and I'll keep it in my collection, but it's not something I'm going to want to read again."},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"This book was boring, unlike 90% of Mr. de Lint's work I found this unenlighting, completely dull and uninspireing. Sadly I can see some of the potential but there is so little elaboration and it all ends so quickly. Even most of his short stories read better than this novella.The whole main plot of the puzzle box is so lacking in detail and the we are only given a glimpse of who brings the box to the plot and then they disapear never to be heard from again. This book SHRIEKS out for another 200 pages of some decent plot development. It almost seems like this was either written by de Lint when he was much younger, or by someone completely different. Of all the de Lint books, this is the only one I did not keep."},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"I'm a casual fan of Charles de Lint. I've only read Forests of the Heart and a huge handful of his short stories, but I've generally considered him a good author. However, with Into the Green, we have an author exploring themes he's already done (and better, in &quot;The Little Country&quot;). Plus, the reader never gets into the minds of the characters and often pages are filled with trite and redundent lamentations of grief, either concerning the main heroine or how tragic it would be if the &quot;fey wonders of the world&quot; disappeared. This man can write better than this. If you must read this book, try and get a used copy."},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"You have to read it yourself. There's no way my descriptions could do it justice"},{"Title":"Into the Green","review":"In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass."},{"Title":"The Chronicle of King Edward the First, Surnamed Longshanks: With the Life of Lluellen, Rebel in Wales","review":"This was a play first published in 1593, with the theme of King Edward's struggle against the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffudd, otherwise known as Llewelyn the Last. Llewelyn was a prince of Gwynedd who adopted the style Prince of Wales in 1258 and was formally recognised in this role by King Henry III at the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. Edward I became King of England in 1272 but it was only on his return from the Crusades in 1274 that he had to confront the problem of Wales. In 1277 he invaded Wales and Llewelyn was forced to pay homage. Several years of comparative peace followed but hatred of English laws and settlers caused the Welsh to rise again in 1282. The king crushed the revolt and Llewelyn was killed. These events prompted a Welsh bard to ask &quot;Is this the end of the world?&quot; and another to yearn &quot;Ah God, that the sea would drown the land!&quot;.Llewelyn is rarely mentioned in English literature so I read the play with interest. This edition is edited by the late G. K Dreher who wrote an interesting introduction and modernized the spelling and punctuation. I did not expect to find new historical insights into Llewelyn but was interested to see how he was portrayed to an Elizabethan audience. In fact, George Peele is surprisingly sympathetic in his presentation of the man who posed such a threat to the English crown. As Dreher points out, the play was written for an audience of people who &quot;under Elizabeth were enjoying health, expansion, new knowledge, relish and hope&quot;. They were citizens of a country in the midst of becoming a great power and enjoying a cultural renaissance. Peele knew that they would sympathize with King Edward's desire to unite Britain under one monarch but would also respect the motives of the Welshman who fought for the rights and dignity of his own people.Although practically unknown today, George Peele was highly respected by his literary contemporaries. He was an Oxford &quot;Maister of Artes&quot; and the play contains a sprinkling of the Latin tags and classical allusions that we expect from an educated writer of his time but my own favourite passage is a homely one:(The Friar's novice responds to his master's command to visit town in order to buy food and wine)&quot;Now, master as I am true wag,I will be neither late nor lag,But go and come with gossip's cheerEre Gib our cat can lick her ear .&quot;This new edition of the play published by the Iron Horse Free Press in Texas."},{"Title":"The Chronicle of King Edward the First, Surnamed Longshanks: With the Life of Lluellen, Rebel in Wales","review":"George Peele's King Edward the First Modernized &amp; IllustratedPeele, George. King Edward the First. Ed. G. K. Dreher. Midland, TX: Iron Horse Free Press, 1999;ISBN: 0-9601000-7-5 (hardcover, 224 pages with illustrations).The publication history of George Peele's chronicle play, Edward I, begins in 1593, as the Stationers' Company register tells us:Die Octobris./. [1593] Entred for his Copie vnder thandes of bothe the wardens an enterlude entituled the Chronicle of Kinge Edward the firste surnamed Longeshank with his Retourne out of the Holye Lande, with the lyfe of Leublen Rebell in Wales with the sinkinge of Quene Elinour [.]Alternately called Longshank, Longshanks, and Prince Longshank, Peele's Edward I was performed fourteen times by the Lord Admiral's Men between August 29, 1595, and July 14, 1596. The play's successful stage history occasioned the printing of a second edition, which appeared in 1599.At least eleven modern editions have been published since R. Dodsley's 1827 text, the most recent of which is: King Edward the First, a retroform edited by G. K. Dreher, published by Iron Horse Free Press. Publisher George R. Dreher, son of G. K. Dreher, notes that the \\"aim of this edition is to provide . . . a few unriddles in the text, modern spelling and punctuation, and an introduction for readers who are not familiar with the play.\\" Partly a celebration of Peele's life and works and partly a tribute to Dreher's father's scholarship, the volume brings together G. K. Dreher's previous editions of Peele's Edward I (Adams Press, 1974) and David and Bethsabe (Adams Press, 1980). The new edition also includes an introduction, a commentary, and 23 images: 8 medieval illustrations from the British Library, plus 1 each from the Public Records Office, Eton College, and the Beinecke Rare Book Collection (featured in Edward I); 12 illustrations from museums around the world by the artists Raphael, Michelangelo, Salviati, Rembrandt, Chapron, Berton, Beckmann, Picasso, and Chagall (featured in David and Bethsabe). Together these components fashion a useful volume for a general reading audience; indeed, this text does more than any previous edition to popularize Peele's work. Although not a critical edition, the book will perhaps be most valuable as a teaching text for undergraduate studies.George Peele (1556-96), born in London, was one of the principal writers of chronicle history plays in the Elizabethan literary movement, which culminated in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays and Henry V. Peele was educated at Christ's Hospital, Broadgates Hall (Pembroke College), and Christ Church, Oxford where he won praise as a translator of one of the Iphigenias of Euripides. In 1580 Peele married Anne Cooke, daughter of an Oxford merchant. With Ann he returned to the environs of London in 1581 where he pursued an active literary career in association with the \\"University Wits\\", a group of playwrights that included John Lyly, Robert Greene, Thomas Lodge, Thomas Nashe, Christopher Marlowe, and Thomas Watson. Peele's works concern courtly and patriotic themes and can be classified according to three main categories: plays, pageants, and miscellaneous verse. In 1589, in a vitriolic preface to Greene's Menaphon, Nashe suspends his condemnation of most late-sixteenth-century English writers to praise Peele as the \\"chiefe supporter of pleasance now living, the Atlas of Poetrie, and primus verborum Artifex\\" who \\"goeth a steppe beyond all that write.\\" In 1592 Greene considered him \\"no lesse deserving\\" than Marlowe and Nashe; \\"in some things rarer, in nothing inferiour.\\" Peele's surviving plays are: The Araygnement of Paris (1584); Edward I (1593); The Battle of Alcazar (1594); The Old Wives' Tale (1595); and David and Fair Bethsabe (1599). His miscellaneous verse includes The Tale of Troy (1589), Polyhymnia (1590) and The Honour of the Garter (1593), an epideictic poem to the Earl of Northumberland. Excerpts from Peele's writings were first anthologized in 1600 in Englands Helicon and Englands Parnassus.Peele's Edward I combines three narratives, each announced by the original text's full title: the Chronicle of Kinge Edward the firste surnamed Longeshank with his Retourne out of the Holye Lande, with the lyfe of Leublen Rebell in Wales with the sinkinge of Quene Elinour. Peele derives the first story, the return from the Holy Land of King Edward I (1272-1307), from at least four different chronicles, but chiefly those of Grafton and Holinshed. Peele shapes his account of the life of Llywelyn (?-1282) from popular tales of Robin Hood. The third story is an unhistorical account of Queen Elinor portrayed as a divinely judged murderess. Peele subordinates the second and third narratives under the first in order to frame the play's central plot of Edward's glorious military victories over the Scots and Welsh, especially his devastating campaigns of 1277 and 1282-83 in which he conquered the Welsh principality of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd.Edward I resounds with nationalistic pride at a time when England's victory, in 1588, over the Spanish Armada continued to fuel public celebrations. Edward's first speech in the play, for example, invokes a providential design for England's history:O God my God, the brightnes of my daye,How oft haft thou preferu'd thy feruant fafe, By fea and land, yea in the gates of death, O God to thee how highly am I bound, For fetting me with thefe on Englifh ground?G. K. Dreher's modern edition standardizes the text's spelling, punctuation, and stage directions, thus achieving a very readable version:O God, my God, the brightness of my day, How oft hast thou preserved thy servant safe, By sea and land, yea in the gates of death. O God, to thee how highly am I bound For setting me with these on English ground.This latest return of Longeshank will certainly contribute to George Peele's popular reputation as one of the most important chronicle playwrights in Elizabethan England. In addition to Peele's Edward I, Iron Horse Free Press currently offers three other books by G. K. Dreher: Samuel Huntington, Longer Than Expected (an illustrated essay on the Presidency of Samuel Huntington, first president of The United States in Congress Assembled); Now the Dog is Quiet (a novella written in opposition to world hunger); and Ourselves &amp; One Other (a collection of Christian devotional meditations)."},{"Title":"The Chronicle of King Edward the First, Surnamed Longshanks: With the Life of Lluellen, Rebel in Wales","review":"Author George Peele was in a group of London playwrights, precursory to Shakespeare, known as the &quot;university wits&quot; as were Marlowe, Lyly, Nashe, and Greene. In 1587 Thomas Nashe called Peele &quot;The chief supporter of pleasance now living, the Atlas of poetry, and primum verborum artifex (most excellent artist of words),&quot; and &quot;one who goeth a step beyond all that write.&quot; Editor George Kelsey, through extensive research of primary sources at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, has provided a retroform of KING EDWARD I, solving several riddles in the text that he discusses in the 43 page introduction covering Chronicle History Plays, Sources, Structure, Theme, Characterization, and Diction. In the special insert of DAVID AND BETHSABE (SAMPLES) Dreher juxtaposes Peele's verse with parallel Bible passages from the 1525 translation by Miles Coverdale and demonstrates that Peele worked directly from the Latin and used as sources the Psalms as well as Samuel II. Dreher offers a 35 page discussion of Peele's viewpoint, emotional involvement, and style. The book is 6 x 9, 224 pp., with color printed case, 20 illustrations from the finest museums around the world, a Foreword, Introduction, Comments, and Bibliography."},{"Title":"The Chronicle of King Edward the First, Surnamed Longshanks: With the Life of Lluellen, Rebel in Wales","review":"George Peele (1556-1596) was evidently one of the principle writers of chronicle history plays in the movement which rose to Shakespeare's One and Two HENRY IV, and HENRY V. His experimentation in theatrical art was precursory to the work of Shakespeare. His repertoire included such forms of literature as history, melodrama, pastoral, tragedy, folk, play and pageant. His varied interests accented a desire not to be narrowly classified and a worry about poverty. While attending Oxford, Peele launched his diverse literary career and won praise as a translator of a play by Euripedes. Here he also wrote the first of his surviving works, THE TALE OF TROY (published 1589), a 485-line verse epitome of the ILLIAD. Peele joined an assembly of fellow Oxonians living just outside London, known as the &quot;university wits.&quot; The group of playwrights (including Lyly, Greene, Nashe, and Marlowe) were experimental with poetry in various meters. In 1587, Thomas Nashe could call him &quot;The chief supporter of pleasance now living, the Atlas of poetry, and primus verborum artifex&quot; and as to his dexterity of wit and variety of invention one who &quot;goeth a step beyond all that write.&quot; Peele developed his eloquent blank, or unrhymed, verse which greatly contributed to the tone of idyllic romance that later came to characterize comedy, demonstrated most in his works THE OLD WIVES TALE (1595) and THE ARAYGNMENT OF PARIS (1584). Consequently his generation looked on him as a literary giant. Eight years after THE ARAYGNMENT, Robert Greene considered him &quot;no less deserving&quot; than Marlowe and Nashe; &quot;in some things rarer, in nothing inferior.&quot; EDWARD I (1593) and THE LOVE OF KING DAVID AND FAIR BETHSABE (1599) are two of only four dramatic works that certainly are the products of Peele's wit."},{"Title":"Hitler's Diplomat: The Life and Times of Joachim von Ribbentrop","review":"This book is a biography of Hitler's Foreign Minister for much of his reign, Joachim von Ribbentrop. Von Ribbentrop was a former champagne salesman (much was made of this by other Nazis) turned diplomat who served first as a special envoy, later as ambassador to Great Britain, and finally as Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany. He was essentially a colorless functionary, a boring and not-too-involved character who found his role increasingly irrelevant as Hitler switched from bullying neighboring countries into submission to conquering them.I read this book largely because I had read another book of the author's (Hitler's Banker) and enjoyed it. I must confess, this book wasn't as good. For one thing, it's hard to sympathize with the subject at all, though the author does make it clear that von Ribbentrop was a good husband and father to his family. The author apparently had little access to information not published elsewhere, however, so he pads his account of the life of the Foreign Minister of Germany with a series of anecdotes and incidents which have little to do with his main subject. This, to my mind, cripples the book at least somewhat.It's hard to read a book like this, in that you're not going to enjoy it, because the main character isn't a nice person, really. Given that, the book is well-written, and I would recommend it to someone who wishes to know more about the Nazis."},{"Title":"Low Carb Sinfully Delicious Desserts: Cheesecakes, Pies, Cookies, Mousse, Tiramisu, Fudge, Chocolate, and More.","review":"I was searching for a Low Carb Cook Book that only uses Splenda.

My favorites were McCullough's Truman piece, Doris Kearns' FDR section, Ambrose's Ike selection, and the section on Carter. While most of the authors are a bit biased towards their president/topic, they write well and make many good points. The book is a fast read. Noonan's piece on Reagan, also incredibly well written, simply bipasses the Iran-contra scandal with but a mention of what Reagan tried to do for the Contras. That is all well and good but it is difficult to read something about a president's character and the biggest scandal of that president's administration is conveniently left out. That would be like discussing Nixon's character and never bringing up Watergate or mentioning Clinton and not the Lewinski scandal. Fact is, those events are integral parts of a president's tenure. Such is life; still incredibly fun to read."},{"Title":"Character Above All: Ten Presidents from FDR to George Bush","review":"\\"Character\\" is the focus of this book's biographical essays on the ten presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George H.W. Bush. \\"In a president, character is everything,\\" wrote Peggy Noonan in her essay on Ronald Reagan. \\"A president doesn't have to be brilliant; Harry Truman wasn't brilliant, and he helped save Western Europe from Stalin. He doesn't have to be clever; you can hire clever. White Houses are always full of quick-witted people with ready advice on how to flip a senator or implement a strategy. You can hire pragmatic, and you can buy and bring in policy wonks. But you can't buy courage and decency, and can't rent a strong moral sense. A president must bring these things with him.\\"Here are three anecdotes from the book that throw character into relief:1912: West Point Cadet Third Class (sophomore) Dwight Eisenhower dressed down a plebe (freshman). \\"Eisenhower added sarcastically, 'You look like a barber.' The plebe's face went red. He replied softly, 'I was a barber, sir.' It was Eisenhower's turn to go red with embarrassment. Without a word, he returned to his room, where he told his roommate, 'I'm never going to crawl [haze] another plebe as long as I live.... I've just done something that was stupid and unforgivable. I managed to make a man ashamed of the work he did to earn a living.' Eisenhower never hazed again, and as an adult he never shamed a man.\\" (Stephen Ambrose)Sometime in the 1930's: \\"When the young Gregory Peck stood on the dock that day and saw [President Franklin] Roosevelt being carried off the boat like a child, he was so stunned that he started to cry. But then, Peck recalled, Roosevelt instantly put everyone at ease. As soon as he was placed in his chair, he put his hat on his head, placed his cigarette holder in his mouth, waved to the crowd and smiled his dazzling smile, and suddenly, Peck said, 'I started clapping and everything was fine. He seemed with every gesture to be saying, 'I'm not pitying myself, so why should you worry about me?\\"'\\" (Doris Kearns Goodwin)1943: After the sinking of the PT-109, Lieutenant John Kennedy gathered the battered crew on the shore of a nearby island, making plans to signal their location. Another officer said, \\"'Boy, you kill me. We're beat, we're burned, we're given up for dead, we're living on green coconuts and no water. We're surrounded by fifteen thousand Japs and you think the odds are with us.' ... Kennedy says, 'it's a flaw in my character.' Well, it was in his character. Kennedy had an iron will.\\" (Richard Reeves)Editor Robert Wilson gathered the essays by ten presidential biographhers -- all men and women of letters, all with gifted prose styles. There's a fine mix of telling personal anecdote, responses to the great challenges, and large conclusions.Writing something short and concise is always harder than writing something long, and these essays are compact gems. For instance, if you're unlikely to get through the 1120 pages of David McCullough's full biography of Harry S. Truman, his essay in this book delivers the high points in 21 pages.\\"Character Above All\\" is an excellent starting point for the study of character and its effect on history -- and can well encourage more reading on the lives of great men.-30-"},{"Title":"Character Above All: Ten Presidents from FDR to George Bush","review":"As the title implies, this is a collection of biographcial essays on each of the 10 presidents from FDR to Bush 1 by 10 different authors who are either expert historians or knew the President while in office. The thing that ties them all together is that each essay is supposed to look at each man as president and find that one part of his character that made him the type of president he was. Each essay is about 30 pages and it makes for interesting reading.A good sample would come from Doris Kearns Goodwin's look at Franklin Roosevelt. She asserts that the most valuable component of his personality was his self-confidence. I thought this quote from FDR makes the point wonderfully: \\"I'll tell you...at night when I lay my head on my pilow, and it is often pretty late, and I think of the things that have come before me during the day and the decisions that I have made, I say to myself - well, I have done the best that I could, and turn over and go to sleep.\\"The essays are wonderful - some inspiring, such as Gerald Ford's, some disturbing such as JFK's.

Since these are all well known authors, the writers know their subjects and boil their personalities down in twenty to thirty pages. One cannot get more well known than David McCullough and Steven Ambrose. The writing is great and flows well.If I have any problem, it is that some of the authors are more generous than others. Reeves makes Kennedy look pretty low on the morality issue and Noonan inflates Reagan a little too much. Of course, this is subjective writing, and since the authors know their subjects well, one can probably count on some bias.

I know a good deal about Walden Pond and Walden Woods as a result of many years of personal research. I never thought that anyone would be able to bring together, between the covers of one book, the astonishing amount of information Barksdale Maynard has compiled and integrated in this scrupulously researched and well written book. He has brought together facts from all sorts of sources: newspapers and magazines, books, unpublished letters and diaries, eyewitness interviews, videos, radio broadcasts, maps, and so forth. There are fifty pages of endnotes and bibliography - over 500 of each. I am in awe at what he has been able to do. (Wish I could have done it!) Anyone interested in historic preservation, nature conservation, human nature, grassroots activism, literature, or (most important) Thoreau and Walden itself will enjoy this book. It has lots of information, yet it reads easily and has a good ?story line?: how and why Walden has become the symbol it is and what people have done to protect it. The hero of heroes is Don Henley of The Eagles.

Maynard has obviously done his research on Thoreau and his times.In particular I was amused by the amazement of some Concordians,in Thoreau's time and after, who just couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about over the so-called hermit of Walden Pond. But more importantly, the book looks above and beyond Thoreau's realationship to the Pond and Maynard goes into exquisite detail about life at Walden after 1847. If dedicted Thoreauvians abhor the so-called commercialism of the place now, be thankful it's not the 1930's, when all vestiges of Walden as a &quot;sacred&quot; spot were practically destoyed. Maynard does well to explain the ups and downs that the Pond has been through the last 150 years.In particular I was pleased to see the way the author treated Thoreau's contemporaries, particularly Bronson Alcott. All of the Transcendentalists had a special fondness for Walden and their love of the place-and the love that millions have shared over the last 150 years- really comes out. It is obvious that Maynard loves Walden as well.And, he also does a good job of explaining the many fights to preserve Walden, and the in-fighting and back-stabbing that has, unfortunately, been as much a part of Walden's history as the Transcendentalists. But Maynard's reporting is fair and balanced and he doesn't seem to take sides. Still, I'm sure he will have stepped on somebody's toes with this book!If anyone is interested in American History,Conservation, Henry Thoreau or just an interesting piece of Americana, &quot;Walden Pond; A Hsitory&quot; is a must read!"},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"Anyone who knows anything about the history of Walden Pond will realize that people, politics, and agendas necessarily occupy an important place in Maynard's book. The messy human element has affected Walden from Thoreau's time on as much as environmental and other forces. It would have been poor scholarship for Maynard not to acknowledge and deal with this. The book is the result of thorough familiarity with the Walden landscape and with the full range of source material. The author's perspective is characterized by a combination of objectivity and tact that together emphatically prevent the final product from descending to the level of gossip. It is a deliberate, thoughtful, handsome book, and a valuable contribution."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"How deep is Walden Pond? To that question, Barksdale Maynard would answer, &quot;How deep do you want to go?&quot; His new book-masterwork will take you almost to the bottom, should you choose to follow him. As one who has lived near the edge of Walden Woods for almost forty years, I was delighted to see this astonishing gathering of over two centuries of fact, anecdote, and portraits. I learned a great deal about a memorable place and could detect no appreciable error of fact or tone, even when the book discussed controversial issues. What was particularly remarkable was how Mr. Maynard organized the material into themes, so that the right fact popped up at the most appropriate place. In the book, the pond succeeds in humanizing both its Transcendental visitors and its modern defenders.Two small comments: this is a rigorous and complete history of a place and its people, and, as such, facts do not always arrange themselves in dramatic sequence---don't expect a novel. My other comment is that I would have liked to have seen more discussion of how Thoreau used, both in his book &quot;Walden&quot; and in his journals, the symbolism of the pond to express his ethical message and a spiritual philosophy. But those comments should not diminish the achievement.Unlikely as it might seem, the book succeeds as a landmark social, environmental, and intellectual history of ... a pond."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"Walden Pond by W. Barksdale Maynard is an excellent history, thoroughly researched and written in the best prose style."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"Barksdale Maynard has performed a tour de force in writing WALDEN POND: A HISTORY. As someone who has tried (since the late 1950s) to follow the bewildering barrage of events and swirling controversies surrounding Walden and its use, misuse, and abuse over the decades and centuries, I stand in awe of what Mr. Maynard has been able to do.Since I know first hand something about the controversies and events the book describes, I can judge (1) the accuracy and (2) the adequacy of what he has written. It's right on the mark, and it evokes exactly what happened. How he did it I do not know! Everything he has written is scrupulously documented with fifty pages of endnotes and bibliography (over 500 endnotes and over 500 entries in the bibliography). He has taken information from an amazing array of sources--popular, scholarly, scientific, and manuscript--as well as from a veritable army of eyewitnesses and specialists--and has melded them into a truly wonderful and accessible narrative. He brings together literature, history, biography, science, and politics in a fascinating and meaningful way. His book is a landmark of scholarship, yet it reads beautifully. There is a lot of human interest in the gripping story he tells. There are humor, suspense, and other qualities that make for a good story. You don't have to be a Thoreau expert to benefit from the book. You'll love it if you're someone who cares about nature (and human nature, as well) and some of the best expressions of American history and ideals. The book helps to explain a lot of what I had formerly felt to be inexplicable. Certainly I personally learned an ENORMOUS amount from reading it.For people trying to preserve natural areas, open space, and historic sites elsewhere in the US and beyond, the story should hold great interest and encouragement. The book is well worthy of its subjects--Thoreau, Emerson, the Alcotts, Hawthorne, Walden Pond, Walden Woods, the book Walden, and the shining symbol that Walden has become since the book was published a century and a half ago.The eighty-four illustrations are selected ingeniously (flip through the pages a few times, looking at the illustrations, comparing them with each other and with the text, to see what I mean). The story puts forth for all to see just why and how Walden has been so mistreated over the years--as well as how and why it has been \\"saved\\" (and who was responsible for doing so).There are many \\"heroes\\" and \\"heroines\\"-and even a martyr or two-in this book (and not a few lovable oddballs), from the venerable nineteenth century champions of Walden, through the redoubtable Gladys Hosmer, Mary Sherwood, Paul Tsongas, and Don Henley. It is a fascinating case study of just how agonizingly difficult it is to DO THE RIGHT THING in this world, what with competing egos, turf battles, obstructionism, cupidity, official opposition, public apathy, and just plain human perversity.There are villains in the book also (and some of the heroes and heroines have their flaws), most of them actually well meaning, a few of them greedy and truly mean spirited. And there are altogether too many clueless Philistines. One telling episode described in the book has Thomas Blanding sparring transcendentally (and brilliantly) with a developer's bulldog of a lawyer, effectively defanging the latter's searing sarcasm.In my opinion, Don Henley comes off as the hero of heroes in this saga. The photograph of him walking out of Walden Woods between Bill Clinton and Hilary Clinton is the climax of the book. It is altogether fitting that Don Henley gets prominent recognition for his unstinting and unbelievably generous work on behalf of Walden. Had it not been for him the story might never end--or else the ending would be tragic.Don Henley put a much needed, solid foundation under the often squabbling idealists' heroic campaigns to do right by Walden. We owe him and Barksdale Maynard a lot. Two people who came to the fore at just the right time and did what had to be done!"},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"For years to come, historians and literary scholars will know this book as the definitive history of Walden Pond. But it's also a delightful read. Combining impeccable scholarship with skillful writing, Maynard brings Walden Pond's storied history to life, from Thoreau's first visit as a little boy to today's preservation battles. &quot;Walden Pond: A History&quot; is a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"Walden Pond: A HistoryI neglected reading this book for several years because I thought itwas about the natural history of Walden Pond: a subject I have nointerest in. In the course of my reading about the town of Concord andits environs, someone suggested this book for its detailed maps of thearea. I purchased the book and soon gained an appreciation for itbeyond the usefulness of its maps.This book is not really a history of Walden Pond, but a history of howpeople use and interact with the pond, from the early 19th century tothe present day (it was published in 2004). It is also a parallelhistory of how Thoreau, who was a marginal figure in life, becamecanonized in death due to the dedicated work of a few admirers. As hisfame grew, so did that of the pond: the reputation of bothintertwined.The most interesting aspect of this book is how it reveals how humanbeings ascribe meaning and importance to people and places that arenot inherently there: how Thoreau has been appropriated over the yearsas new disciples tried to assume his mantle for themselves to achievetheir own idiosyncratic ends (some who even went as far as recreatinghis Walden Pond experiment and writing books about their experience),the battles between people, near and far, who saw Walden Pond as asacred, literary shrine worthy of preservation and locals who saw itmerely as a recreation center for swimming, fishing, and eating hotdogs, ignorant to any of its other associations, and the need forpeople to feel important and a part of something bigger thanthemselves.Thoreau wrote that the pond was the \\"earth's eye; looking into whichthe beholder measures the depth of his own nature.\\" This reflectivenature of the pond is what makes this story not merely the history ofa place, but a deeper look into what it means to be a human being."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"This is a wonderfully written and carefully documented history, one that will remain definitive for a very long time to come. I have spoken with dozens of readers who have all told me they enjoyed the book a great deal and learned a lot from it. Not a single person I have spoken with has expressed a single reservation about this book."},{"Title":"Walden Pond: A History","review":"\\"Walden Pond: A History\\" is a wonderful, in-depth guide that provides a wealth a background on the pond and its inspiration on our literature and culture. I found the book to be a fantastic - behing the scenes - guide to not only Thoreau's classic \\"Walden,\\" but the musings of Emerson and Alcott as well. I have been going to Walden every summer for years (I live close by). This book has greatly enhanced my experiences while visiting the pond, and reinvigorated my interest in its history in general."},{"Title":"5-HTP The Natural Alternative to Prozac","review":"I found this book to be invaluable. I had been on lots and lots of antidepressant medications and none of them worked for very long, nor without side-effects(in some cases the benefits didn't outweigh the side-effects). This book gave me HOPE! with no side-effects! I now take 5-HTP daily and feel much better."},{"Title":"5-HTP The Natural Alternative to Prozac","review":"This little book deal with the natural alternative to anti-depressants like Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. This is the amino acid 5-hydroxitryptophan which increases the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Whereas the drugs work by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, 5-HTP raises serotonin levels in a natural way and therefore has fewer and less severe side effects.The authors cite various clinical studies to show that 5-HTP may be helpful in relieving depression, alleviating anxiety, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, reducing the pain of migraine and fibromyalgia, improving sleep and suppressing appetite. There is also preliminary evidence that 5-HTP may be useful for treating the discomfort of PMS and for reducing aggression. The authors also discuss the safety concerns of taking this amino acid, its drug interactions and provide dosing guidelines.There is growing evidence of the efficacy of a variety of natural substances in the above conditions; these include the amino acids L-Tyrosine, DL-Phenylalanine and Tryptophan. One drawback of the book is that the authors only discuss Tryptophan in some detail and make cursory references to the herb St. John's Wort, while other natural substances like Trimethylglycine, Essential Fatty Acids and Acetyl-L-Carnitine are also showing great promise.The booklet nevertheless contains valuable information and serves to introduce this natural anti-depressant to a wider audience. For a more comprehensive look at all of the aforementioned and other nutrients, I recommend Ray Sahelian's book Mind Boosters: A Guide To Natural Supplements That Enhance Your Mind, Memory And Mood."},{"Title":"The life and ministry of Dr. Richard Loys Vess: Pioneer church planter","review":"Many years ago I sat at the feet of this great man. I was one of his students while he was President of the Trinity Valley Baptist Seminary and College. I can say for a certainty that he was the one man who more than any other has influenced my life for the good and for the service of our Lord. When I first recieved a copy of this work it was through his grandson (the author) who was very generous and gracious in his getting a copy to me. I read the book in 2 sittings and very fondly recalled Dr. Vess telling us in class firsthand several of the accounts that are written in this book. Many were the times that I and several others would travel with Dr. Vess as he would hold meetings in various places in and around the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. One of the best times of my life was when just he and I traveled to a city several hours away from the school to hold a series of meetings over a weekend. We talked for hours about subjects ranging from the preaching of the gospel, christian manhood, starting and building churches to the college (Trinity) and where it was headed to interpretations of difficult Bible passages. Suffice it to say that he taught me more about the ministry, the Bible and about the christian life than anyone I have ever known. He was during the course of our time together my pastor, my mentor, my teacher, my friend and the best example of what a christian and what a man should be. His grandson (the author) has done a masterful work in putting Dr. Vess' life and ministry in printed form. I highly recommend this work."},{"Title":"The Transition to Democracy in Spain","review":"Maravall studies the fragile early years of the Spanish democracy, after the death of General Franco.

Also studied are the attitudes of the electorate, and how these correlated to those during and before the Civil War.It's not just his opinion. The text cites numerous surveys of the people conducted, and compares these to results elsewhere in Europe."},{"Title":"Pilgrimage from Rome","review":"I had the privilege of knowing Bart Brewer and his wife. He was a very kindly man who cared about the salvation of souls. This book recounts the experiences and influences that led him out of the Roman Catholic priesthood and into the evangelical faith and ministry. What impressed me was that Bart didn't question the sincerity of the seminary students he studied with nor the priests he knew, nor the many Roman Catholic people he grew up with. His burden was to show what the Bible says about the way to eternal life."},{"Title":"Pilgrimage from Rome","review":"Bartholomew (\\"Bart\\") Brewer is a former Catholic Discalced Carmelite priest, who has since become an evangelical Christian. (He has a website.)He writes in the Introduction to this 1986 book, \\"I had been a priest about five years when a change began to come over my life. I was not at peace either with God or with myself... I began to question things I had once accepted. I searched the Scriptures for the foundations of my salvation... Slowly I was compelled to accept a clear and awesome fact; many things taught by the Roman Catholic church are not in holy Scripture... For this, I am anathema, a Judas, a renegade, a fugitive, and an apostate. My sin? I dared to search the Scriptures; and as a consequence, I stand excommunicated and condemned by the Catholic hierarchy to Hell's eternal fire. This is the gospel of Rome. Such condemnation is not the truth, however. I am not at enmity with God. I have wonderful peace and glory in my heart and soul...\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"Celibacy is not supported by any Scripture. It is against nature... So I pondered the question, 'If a celibate falls in love or succumbs to the temptations of the flesh, who is more to blame, the church or the celibate?\\"\\"As I held her and kissed her, a rhapsody of joy filled my whole being... Suddenly my calling wasn't enough. I was filled with fear and consternation. I couldn't understand it, no matter how hard I tried.\\"\\"I realized that the rampant immorality among the Catholic hierarchy was largely attributable to the confessional. These priests heard so many confessions about unchaste behavior that some began to generalize, thinking that every town and village is another Peyton Place.\\"\\"I stopped the car and asked mother to wait. I took my mass kit into the Catholic church and left it next to the confessional booth. The unbilical cord was cut! At last I had done what I knew was right.\\"\\"I saw that as long as I questioned Mrs. White's predictions and interpretations, I was headed for repeated confrontations with the (Seventh-Day Adventist) church's leaders. The more I thought about it, the more convinced I was that it would be unethical to remain a minister in a church whose doctrines I could not accept. I would not submit to another pope or modern prophetess.\\"\\"There is not one verse in the Bible that clearly supports the doctrine of transubstantiation. We are told to celebrate the Lord's Supper, using bread and wine as symbols of His flesh and blood, but we are not asked to be cannibals.\\""},{"Title":"Pilgrimage from Rome","review":"Bartholomew F.

Initially it answered many of my nagging doubts regarding modern evangelicalism. It also fired me up and got me really excited about following the Bible and the words of Jesus literally. If you know nothing about Anabaptists, Amish or Mennonites then this book is for you. Well worth the few quid you spend on it. It's a great book. the book that kind of clinched it for me really in my decision to become Amish-Mennonite. though when I got there I found modern day Anabaptism is not what I thought it was or what historical Anabaptism was.I went the way of so many. Looking for the perfect Church according to my own set of standards of what perfect is. Like so many I didn't find it. Many end up leaving the Church and just heading out on their own with their family. Others try to recreate the Church and end up like the groups they despise.I tried a different route. Find the Church of the first century, locate it on earth today. Join it, and submit myself to it. What I found wasn't necessarily what I was comfortable with, but it is the Church that Jesus established through His Apostles, sinners and all! The Orthodox Church doesn't have the prettiest history, but neither does ancient Judaism, yet Jesus said the people of his day regarding the pharisees, and I paraphrase \\"do what they say, but don't do what they do, for they sit in the seat of Moses.\\" Now if he could say that about the hypocritical pharisees, how much more the successors of the Apostles, the men who sit in their seats? And there are plenty of righteous men in the Orthodox Church, past and present.Schism is a great sin, numbered right up there with adultery and murder. The Anabaptist Church is infamous for it's history of schism. If you are searching for the truth, I encourage you to consider Orthodoxy.

Great stories of waterfowl and quail hunting in the Deep South at a time when some Civil War veterans were still alive. His love of the outdoors, duck hunting especially, and a different way of life back then come shining through. Some of the Southern vernacular is hard to push through but apparently realistic for that time period. Contains some politically incorrect words and situations but again, realistic for that time in America.

John Lucaks, teacher and historian, tells us early on of how he escaped from Hungary shortly after World War II. He lived under the Nazi's and then the Communists, despised both, and then made a life for himself in America.Good writing is about good writing. Any subject is interesting when presented the right way and Lucaks goes a long way in presenting his story in a way that is fresh and full of life. He reveals many personal observations and details that leave him bare. He laments the loss of his first mistress (a married Hungarian lady with two children) and keeps her picture still. He describes, in detail, the harrowing illness and death of his first wife and the sadly sweet feelings that her memory still conjure up. He goes a long way in describing why Philadelphia is superior to New York City and why the Pennsylvania countryside is superior to both.But mostly, Lucaks explains why he is a political reactionary, why that distinction is a noble one, and why it suits him so well. Don't construe this to mean that he is a member of the John Birch society or something, his political opinions are really hard to pigeonhole. He is a man of unique perspective, who had a front row seat to the happenings in the Second World War. He saw his people at their best and at their worst. He witnessed people who blew with the wind, and others that stood on conviction. He got a glimpse of what Eastern Europe could have been like if the Americans hadn't left it in the hands of the Russians.The one caveat I have to offer is that this book is not breeze to read. The language is easy enough, but Lucaks insists that you think about his writing, and that takes a little more time than reading the latest popular novel."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Original Sinner","review":"Lukacs gets to you slowly in this marvelous autobiography. It's partly the way he structures his life, and partly his remarkable prose. Structurally, he moves chronologically through his life, but also moves thematically at the same time, coming back around to the same preoccupations again and again but from different angles, foreshadowing what's to come, commenting on his earlier follies and triumphs. And so, slowly, he gnaws away at your preconceptions about history, especially U.S. history. Particularly entertaining are his witty criticisms of U.S. academia, his stinging assessments of Kissinger and Reagan from his perspective as a &quot;reactionary&quot; historian. Direct and simple, never-simplistic, he paints his experience as an exile coming to the U.S. after WWII truthfully, with wit, self-deprecation, and remarkable self-knowledge. There are passages in this book which are remarkably moving. His description of his first wife's illness and death, the slow dissolution of his connections to Hungary, the mother and family he left behind, are restrained, but all the more emotionally compelling because of that restraint. An original thinker, Lukacs never accepts anything at face value. After reading him, your view of 20th Century U.S. and world history will be changed. You may even be tempted to adopt his &quot;reactionary&quot; values."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Original Sinner","review":"I agree with the two reviewers who give the book five stars. In almost every sentence one can feel Mr Lukacs' humanity. Strangely, in my youth, I spent a summer in Norristown, a northwest suburb of Philadelphia, close to where Mr Lukacs lives. I too was struck by the verdant beauty of the countryside of southeast Pennsylvania. It is a mystery that its beauty is not more widely known."},{"Title":"The New Encyclopedic Reference Bible","review":"This is a wonderful reference Bible.

He's handsome, debonair, and admittedly bisexual, and also lives at Number Nine Downing Street, \\"because someone has to.\\" Lucifer is an artist by day, and a cold, calculating killer, by night, a ruthless assassin for the British government. So it comes as no surprise, that in the opening chapter The Vesuvius Club, we see him casually disposing of an enemy of the State.When Professors Verdigris and Sash, two prominent scientists are discovered murdered, Mr. Joshua Reynolds, a dwarf in the employ of The Royal Academy of Arts, entrusts Lucifer with the task of finding the perpetrator. The scientists chosen field was something rather bewildering, to do with the molten core of the earth. They ended up forming some sort of research team and traveling to Italy. His search for their killers isn't as easy as Lucifer first thought, and as the trail thickens, our intrepid hero finds himself in danger of his life.Author, Mark Gatiss peppers his narrative with eccentric Edwardian characters, \\"whey faced poets, frayed-cuffed artists; all the splendid flotsam of bohemian London life.\\" Lucifer is equally at home in both London's Imperial grandeur as he is in the underworld of crazed vice that seethes beneath. He's a man who is geographically at the very beating heart of the Empire, yet as much as an outcast as the greatest of his calling has been.Lucifer's search for the missing scientists eventually takes him to Naples, where he meets Charlie Jackpot, a young hunk, who also becomes his lover and servant. Charlie introduces him to the Vesuvius Club, a den of iniquity that in reality is a front for a sinister and catastrophic plan to destroy the world.Gatiss has become popular writing the popular Dr. Who novels, and their trademark structure is evident here. Each chapter carefully plotted with a huge revelation and climax at the end of each. Layer by layer, character by character, mystery by mystery, the insidious and theatrical plot is revealed, more clues unveiled, all leading to the same, and irrevocable conclusion that the scientists have most likely met an untimely end, and that only Lucifer can possibly save the world.Gatiss deliciously portrays a society roiling with pimps, tarts, and harlots, and where Edwardian sexual ambiguity reigns supreme. There's evenings of flagrant debauch, especially at the Vesuvius Club, where the primary protagonists are deceitful and amoral, taking pleasure at the prospect of doing harm to other, especially to Charlie and Lucifer. Other cast members prove surprisingly resourceful, although frequently compromised.Gatiss also has an impressive command of idiom, capturing the sycophantic nature of the era in all its self-congratulatory grandeur. Full of dotty and eccentric characters with names like Everard Supple, Miss Fullalove, Jocelyn Poop, and Bella Pock, the author has created a world of thrilling ancient antiquity and combined this with all the excitement of a turn-of the century Dickensian thriller. Mike Leonard November 05."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I rarely give out five stars but this stylish, aloofly decadent novella is worth it. A tongue in cheek look borrowed from Wilde and partly from Flemming's delightful Bond. Lucifer Box is the perfect Victorian gentlemen, with their respect for values and morals-only upheld in the most hypocritical sense, devastatingly beautiful and leading the most successful dual personality since The importance of being Earnest. A bit of fluff certainly, blending all genres into one from horror-gothic, romance, drama and tragedy. With an exaggerated air for the melodramatic, Gatiss leads us on the most addictive journey around England and the 'continent'. One can almost smell the orchids and feel the sweltering heat of Italy and see the finely cut suits of Mr. Box as he fights 'the forces of evil' impecabbly cut and dressed with a dashing mysterious femme fatale hanging off his arm. Mr. Box explores all that is truely 'Victorian' (in the most underworld, revealing meaning) in a laugh out loud, yet charismatically seductive way. Read it. Well done Gatiss, a true tour de force."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"Since the plot has been sufficiently covered, I'll just say that I picked this book up on a whim and I'm so utterly glad I did. I believe one of the reviews said it best in that one *despairs* when they see the pages disappearing behind them. Fantastically likeable protaginist, deliciously melodramtic plot, and a extrodinarily satisfying sending up of the Bond Girl. I've finished it but I can't bring myself to put it back on the shelf, so it's also proving itself to be quite re-readable. Honestly one of the most enjoyable books I've read in ages."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"This is, without doubt, the weirdest book that I've ever read. Try to imagine a mixture of James Bond, complete with a government license to kill, a cast of characters with Dickensian names like Jocelyn Poop and Tom Bowler, and an Oscar Wilde dandy, complete with an orchid in his button hole(except that this one is openly bi-sexual), and immerse the whole scene in the foggy, filthy London of the early 20th century, complete with cab chases and bawdy houses. Then take a massive step away from that into a sci-fi scenario of Naples at the foot of Mt.Vesuvius, and home to a brothel and opium den which caters to the most depraved tastes and is peopled, in the background, by zombies, serving a crazed master who plans to ignite the volcano, seeking revenge for a supposedly wronged father. The writing is rather elegant but the subject matter reminds me of the old serials one saw at the pictures on a Saturday afternoon, where the backgrounds were quite obviously made of papiermache. It was all a bit much for this reader!"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I sort of won a free edition of this book through a Simon & Schuster UK LiveJournal giveaway. I'm so grateful for my wicked good luck, I'm writing a review! If it encourages anyone to pick up this novel (which you should do), I hope you enjoy it as much as I did (and I'm sure you will).Lucifer Box is a socialite and a portraitist with dashing good looks, but he's also one of Britain's most witty secret agents working for His Majesty's Government. The Vesuvius Club is a first-person narrative of Edwardian high society with a behind-the-scenes (most secret) look at the people churning the cogs that make the world go \`round.This early 20th century who-dunnit tale is punctuated with black ink illustrations that are, appropriately enough, as grotesque and disturbing as some of the weird and dangerous goings-on in the novel itself. Lucifer mixes business with pleasure as he works to pay off a debt of indiscretion known only to him and his boss, Joshua Reynolds. The novel opens with a dazzling display of an artistry of the most deadly variety: a ruse to lure the Honourable Everard Supple into complacency and entrapment exercised by Mr. Box's indulgent talent for portraiture and a taste for fine dining. Soon after the messy deed is executed and with souvenir in hand, Lucifer makes his drunken way to the men's lavatory inside the Royal Academy of Art. A good sit and few minutes of waiting reveals a ludicrous meeting between Lucifer and Joshua Reynolds in a headquarters of the \\"Get Smart\\" variety. Cleverly (Or stupidly. Lucifer never mentions if the loos actually work) hidden between the stalls, JR assigns Lucifer's next assignment: Two highly respected scientists have died within a day of each other and the estimable Jocelyn Poop (agent to His Majesty and directly employed under Joshua), hot on their trail of evidence, has gone missing.It's up to Lucifer to discover the connection between Poop's disappearance and the mysterious death of the two geologists. To bring all matters to justice begins an investigative journey of near-fatal carriage chases and harrowing, death-defying encounters. Lucifer must contend with all manner of sundry folk and hired help, opium dens, volcanoes, and pleasure domes, all while courting the lovely Bella Pok. And let no one (man or woman), however delectable, stand in his way. There is no task too difficult, no road too winding, no mountain too high, and no partner too unwilling to prevent Lucifer from discovering the horrific truths behind the mysterious Vesuvius Club and the vengeful motivations of a very injured and abandoned human being.Imagine Artemis Fowl without magic, fairies, trolls and the usual fantastic iterations. Let him simmer until he grows very much into an adult. He remains egotistical and enjoys the finer things in life--no discretions made. Mix in a little of the mysteriousness of James Bond and detective work of Sherlock Holmes and this modest concoction reveals itself in Mark Gatiss's magnificently pleasant and serpentine plot of murder, revenge, sex, and scandal.Mark Gatiss spins a delightfully refreshing mystery with witty prose, engaging characters, fantastic names, and a playful atmosphere. Lucifer's world is an indulgent one with plush velvets, immaculately tailored garments, fine cigarettes, and devilish secrets. The Vesuvius Club is hilarious and horrific--a fantastic blend of the elements that make for an engrossing and thrilling read full of surprises that kept me reading well into the night. At 240 pages the only crime Gatiss commits is leaving us with such a short installment of Lucifer's witty and instructive inner dialogue. The good news? There's already a second Lucifer Box novel available to whet one's appetite until the third installment arrives later this month."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"You know this is going to be a saucy book from the very first line: \\"I have always been an appalling judge of character.

I love his style and that indefinable something about his personality. He's just so adorable. So delving into this audiobook, read by the author, was inevitable. And this book delivers in everything I was expecting from a novel by Mr. Gatiss. It's sharply witty, a touch macabre and grotesque, and a thorough romp. The absurd names he gives his characters is already a hint that this story is just a fun ride that should not be taken too seriously. It starts off a little rambly, as the reader gets to experience a few days in the life of Lucifer Box as he does a little research into his assignment and has to deal with the consequences of his very active social life. But when circumstances snowball and the need to solve the mystery of the missing agent becomes urgent, the story picks up it's pace.With the twists and turns of the plot, the story also becomes more bizarre and less believable. Lucifer gets into some ridiculous scrapes, and the eventual resolution plays on all the tropes of the maniacal uber-villain. The resolution does come at you fast, with about a dozen things happening at once which made for a very compelling listen. It's a light and fun story with broad, comical characterizations, a charmingly egotistical dandy as narrator and multiple plot threads that are resolved neatly in the end."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I loved this book, and Lucifer Box! A complex and delightfully absurd novel set in the early 20th Century, it sets up the series, of which there are two more book... I am about to order the second one now. Mark Gatiss is, of course, an experienced writer with two Dr. Who episodes and a couple of Sherlock Holmes episodes to his credit. Clearly he had loads of fun with this one."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"This is funny and witty and stylish and did I mention funny. Mark Gatiss has a great sense of humour, very tongue in cheek and he knows how to make up the best character's name in history.But don't be fooled by the apparent triviality of it all, this book also has a serious plot and lots of twists that will keep you on edge all along.With likable and charismatic characters, this is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I was very impressed with 'The Vesuvius Club', the 1st Lucifer Box story written by Mark Gatiss. You are going to be in a for a treat when the 2nd line of the title is \\"A Bit of Fluff\\". Kids - from that point on, hold fast, hold tight!The first pages suck you in with the colorful descriptions of Box's Edwardian bohemian world. You are truly transported to Box's studio where he is entertaining his latest client, because, after all, Lucifer Box is a portraitist. An artist...a calculating assassin in the service of His Majesty's Government. The whole story is told from Box's point of view and is an absolute thrill ride as our hero escapes attempts on his own life as quickly as he dispatches those set against him. Another point is Lucifer Box is very...flexible and enjoys the beauty of both the male & female physique.I won't reveal any of the plot, because it is just too delicious! But the names of the characters ( Everard Supple, Jocelyn Poop, Cretaceous Unmann, Bella Pok, Charlie Jackpot) harkens back to the wonderful days of Ian Fleming writing James Bond - and a plotline not unlike those villians. An enjoyable romp - get your hands on the book and fall in love with dear, gorgeous, murderous Lucifer Box!"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"Naughty, bawdy, silly, witty, over-the-top.Just a few ways to describe Mark Gatiss's rollicking caper - which I enjoyed enormously.Sure, it can be described as Sherlock Holmes meets James Bond (if they'd been brave enough to cast the estimable, dishy Rupert Everett in the role), but it seems to share more DNA with a lesser known British export, The Assassination Bureau, a film starring Oliver Reed and Diana Rigg. Like The Vesuvius Club it's an anachronistic mash-up of Edwardian starch, wild espionage spoof and hippie era sex comedy. In a word - delightful.What I enjoyed most about the whole affair was that, at the heart of it, narrator and ostensible \\"hero\\" Lucifer Box, is rather a pompous ass. I suspect author Mark Gatiss is taking sly aim at the English class system, using the preening, egotistical Box as the perfect model of (in the parlance of Monty Python) the upper-class twit. Time and again, we see that Box's mission would fail utterly without the help of his \\"domestics,\\" the servants and underlings who aide him nearly every step of the way - whether it be with investigating, researching, alluding capture or fisticuffs. Unlike with Holmes, there isn't a lot of deduction going on here, as every revelation seems to come to Box by chance or after the fact entirely. Despite all that, he continues to trumpet his virtues throughout. The only area in which he doesn't appear to overestimate his abilities, is in his powers of attraction, as evidenced by his multitude of conquests - both male and female. A fact that adds a delicous level of subversiveness to the proceedings.This is a terrific, light romp - outlandish, funny, sexy - even a bit suspenseful and surprising. Perfect for a hot, lazy day at the beach."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"One of the more fascinating things about the cleverly written The Vesuvius Club by Mark Gatiss is that the story's protagonist, Lucifer Box, is a renaissance man extraordinaire. Forget that the story takes place in Edwardian England, or even that Lucifer is a second-rate portraitist and secret agent; note, rather, how his inhibitions and peccadilloes know no gender. That the reader will start the adventure around Box's womanly indiscretions and lead somewhere...else...is simply the sheer flippancy of such a piece of fluff, as subtitled by Gatiss. Box is perhaps an anachronistic anomaly, parading around and performing his HMS duties in a spirit of glam that would make David Bowie proud.Said somewhere else covers a time and place when audiences weren't surrounded with formulaic, contrived villains trying to conquer and/or destroy the world. No, The Vesuvius Club is something different. Box's work for His Majesty's Service is more of a satire of what Bond and Bourne were combating when things were simpler, when your average villains had something smaller and more bizarre in their sights, like say, a volcano. Apart from the setting, Gatiss excels in his descriptions of eerily misty London cemeteries and runaway hansoms, hazy and writhing opium dens and slightly off antagonists. From London to Naples, the reader is carried swiftly in bewilderment in an overly witty, bizarre, and humorous adventure."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"Mark Gatiss as a writer represents a wonderful mix of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sax Rhomer and Monty Python. Part of the fun of the book is discovering the plot, so I won't divulge too much. You just need to know the action takes place in Edwardian England, where Lucifer Box is not only a revered painter and danddy. But, also a very active spy for King Edward's secret services, fighting his way from London to Naples to uncover a secret society plotting nothing less than the end of the modern world. There are many twists and turns, with witty dialogue Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond would have been jealous of. The plot is very fanciful and moves briskly, but Gatiss never lets a dull moment slip in. The humor is fresh and very British. There are some very kinky moments, but those are treated with taste and a sense of fun that is just irresisitible. Let's hope this is the beginning of a long series of novels. Just like James Bond, Lucifer Box will return in \\"The Devil in Amber\\" already published. Be there, before Hollywood jumps on the Lucifer Box bandwagon. Maybe Mark Gatiss has created here the Indiana Jones of the 21st Century. No small feat for a hero rubbing shoulders wth Oscar Wilde and the toast of early 20th Century London.

After debriefing his handler in a public bathroom he is asked to investigate the death of Jocelyn Poop, a diplomat in Naples who spies for England.Poop sent a wire before his death mentioning two scientists studying volcanic activity, dying within days of each other in what looks like natural causes but the coincidence of these deaths so close is very suspicious. The funeral parlor that performed the burial is based in England and Naples. Lucifer visits and opens the coffin of one of the scientists but the body is gone. The other scientist's body is also missing. Believing the answer is in Naples, Lucifer travels there only to encounter THE VESUVIUS CLUB a secret organization that plans to destroy that part of the world unless Lucifer can kill the leaders and stop the ticking time bomb.This is a tongue in cheek version of James Bond only more earthy, decedent and reminiscent of the last depraved days of the Roman Empire. The protagonist is a very naughty man who is a hedonist at heart and gets his jollies from knowing he is one of the saviors of the British Empire. This is not a book to be taken seriously but a work to be enjoyed for its earthly humor, fun characters, and fine setting.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"This starts OK with our enjoyable scarlet pimpernel dilettante character being frightfully sophisticated, and Gatiss generally does a good job playing with the irony of, say, the hero being far more concerned with tiny blood splatters ruining his linen suit than with the horribly dismembered corpse confronting him. Moreover he soon captured the feel of Conan-Doyle's turn of the century Europe, civilised private clubs of ludicrous pretentiousness and excess lounging among disease ridden hovels. After a chapter or two I was looking forward to a thriller with a comic edge in an interesting historical setting populated by charmingly eccentric/exotic/appalling characters.Alas, having completed the book I can now recommend you stop reading fairly early and just enjoy the promise. It peaked about ten pages in, and by halfway had become a chore. We soon lose the sophistication and descend into James Bond (circa Roger Moore) farce. The sex couldn't be any more gratuitous. In fact it's beyond gratuity and yet another story with an immoral - Gatiss goes to some pains to affront/instruct anyone who might be as contemptible as to not advocate promiscuous bisexuality.It fails on so many levels. The lead character, billed as the ultimate cunning spy, only once does something arguably clever (with plaster of paris) while far more consistently acting stupidly. Marlowe-like he just bowls on into known highly dangerous places without a plan, but in contrast he has no wit or core nobility to excuse this. Alternatively he blithely exucutes an unsuspecting, unarmed man as he dines, having his staff clean up the body: did I miss what was particularly dashing and entertaining here? The villains are lifted straight from Batman (TV, not film), as is the absurd climax (and don't even start me on the groan-inducing, forehead smacking twist revelation at the end). Maybe, just maybe, some of this could have been successful as wry satire, but Gatiss seems to want us to glorify this derivative mess as some sort of \`plot'.Stephen Fry praises the book for its depravity, something I can't enjoy in either his or Gatiss' work: however even in some of his seedy books I must grudgingly acknowledge that Fry does show some superb turns of wit. I feel no compunction to acknowledge any such thing in The Vesuvius Club; indeed, if there was no homosexuality in this book I feel pretty certain Fry wouldn't have found much wit to praise in it either."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"This is one of the most bizarre novels I've ever read. The novel starts off very well--witty, light, very British, and poised to be a good historical mystery/thriller. However, almost exactly halfway through, the author introduces mysterious purple gasses, a race of half robot, half zombie people, and an Austin Powers type plan to destroy all of Italy (remember Dr. Evil's Preparation H, with the chain-reaction volcanic eruptions? Yeah, that one). I'm still wondering how the setting switched from turn of the (19th) century England to sci-fi Italy, as well as how the fantastically technical doomsday plan was supposed to be carried out without the aid of modern machinery and computers. I just don't understand how a book can end so very far away from where it began.I would only recommend this book as a joke gift or as an example to use when studying plot trends or shifting genres and things like that."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I had pretty high hopes for this book because the synopsis makes it sound like everything you could ever ask for in a novel...espionage, intrigue, secret societies bent on world domination, a roguish anti-hero. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It just got too ridiculous, and the plot was so simplistic it was like watching a cartoon. Another peeve of mine is that it was written in the first person with the main character Lucifer narrating, and he got on my nerves SO MUCH. He's thoroughly obnoxious, and was constantly making these little asides to the reader about how naughty and/or fabulous he feels himself to be. Plus, you can tell the author is trying SO hard to be witty and funny and he goes so over-the-top that it's like nails on a chalkboard."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club","review":"I haven't made it past the fifth chapter in the book and I honestly dread picking it up again.

He spends too much time complaining he's lost and not enough describing what he sees. Some pictures would have been nice, but you can see typical pictures of watchtowers and fences all over the web, so he probably purposely omitted those. I'm really stunned at how few people he spoke with, or at least how few conversations he relates; I've spoken to more east Germans in an afternoon drive between Leipzig and Dresden. The basic complaint I have here is that he could easily have written a few hundred pages, instead of the what -- 110, 120 in the book.

It point out several places of interest not only of that of the old border zone but of those of WWII such as the caves of the making of the V-2 rockets which is rather interesting. I was hoping for more on the Border Zone itself. I was a border guard there in the Hof and Coburg sectors and found he did not reach the true meaning of the border for both sides and what it stand for today. I also found it a poor guide to us because he did not get to all musuems and place of interest for the border. The author seem to give more detail to the people he met then what the Border Zone looks like today. There are no photographs or maps to each of the areas which could help as a guide and to keep the interest of younger people. I also found the research misleading and inaccurate for the old Border Zone such as the city of Hof and the unknown soldier of the tri-zone. For history seeker its an OK book, for History of the East/West German Border Zone I do not recommend. Sorry!"},{"Title":"Along the Wall and Watchtowers: A Journey Down Germany's Divide","review":"Oliver August, the son of East German parents who escaped to West Germany, drives along the route of the now-vanished Wall that separated East from West, and interviews people on both sides of the border along the way. The author is perfectly bilingual and bicultural, and thus in the ideal position to explain to the reader the peculiarities of German behavior and attitudes. The Easterners regard themselves as Germany's second-class citizens and look with nostalgia upon the old East German regime. The final chapter (of 14) is about Berlin, where the author interviews the East German general who supervised the border guards. The author writes well and tells a compelling story of how, despite reunification, the two halves of Germany are far from being able to understand one another. The book has no photos, one diagram, and (only) one map."},{"Title":"Degranon","review":"I recommend DEGRANON for its exciting, well-constructed narrative, its often intriguing characters, and its wealth of ideas both political and philosophical.However, I do have a couple minor - and I hope constructive - quibbles. Although we're all used to colorful invented words in SF (from &quot;Barsoom&quot; to &quot;Arrakis&quot;), too often I scratched my head over whether there was some allegorical, and hence thematic, significance to a word or name. Take &quot;Degranon&quot; for example: It sounds like &quot;degrading&quot; and &quot;anonymous&quot; - and that sort of fits with what's in the novel... but it's not a snug fit. And the gap, both here and in other instances, produced a nagging doubt that I'd missed something important. And that pulled me out of the story.The characters, although vivid, spoke a bit too much in &quot;exposition-ese.&quot; On the other hand, I was often fascinated by the details of Valchondria or Degranon which they revealed. As I said, these are minor criticisms of an ambitious and entertaining novel.I hope that Simolke will continue exploring these engrossing worlds in future books... or take us to entirely new places."},{"Title":"Degranon","review":"A brilliant scientist, a twisted man who loves her beyond measure, twins separated by time, an ancient religious book, speech-control and more. Mix these up and what do you get? You get Degranon, a fascinating read that blends intrigue, time-travel and the attempted resurrection of what was thought to be an ancient religion. Filled with the undercurrent of how important family is, Mr. Simolke successfully combines all of these elements into a suspenseful story about betrayal, lust for power, love and the need for truth. Set on Valchondria, a far away star-system, Degranon refers to the Book of Degranon, an ancient text that is thought by some to be the ultimate source of truth. But, perhaps it's just a story. Degranon mirrors Earth's current events in many ways. Reflecting the clash of fanatical beliefs due to modern-day monotheistic religions, Degranon speaks to the extremes that they produce in our own civilization, as well as for the civilization that is the setting of this story. I was constantly reminded of our own modern day woes while reading this tome. All in all, Degranon is fitting entry into the science fiction genre."},{"Title":"Degranon","review":"Duane Simolke adds yet another dimension to his diverse literary offerings with this science-fiction novel. He has already established that he can create whole communities with his Acorn Stories-a book of short stories. With his collection of essays and poetry in Holding Me Together, he has shown that he is equally adroit with research and a breath-taking turn of phrase. In Degranon, Simolke brings it all together, creating not a single community, but a whole world. His characters are as unique as anything he creates with his Acorn Stories, but in Degranon, he weaves a tightly plotted story of a planet on the verge of political and social ruin, exacerbated by those with misguided and therefore \\"evil\\" intentions. Layer upon layer of intrigue and counter-balancing moves make this scifi story one that will hold your interest and surprise you with its twists and turns. Definitely a good read. --Ronald L. Donaghe, author of the fantasy novel, Cin&aacute;tis (coming in 2002)"},{"Title":"Degranon","review":"\\"Degranon\\"Duane SimolkeReview by MountmanDegranon is Duane?s first venture into the world of Sci-Fi. And what a venture it is. Duane really shows just how talented he is with Degranon. When I was asked which of Duane?s book I wanted to review it was very hard for me to choose. As you may know, I reviewed Acorn Stories. I was excited about reading it, but, when I got Degranon, I chose it because I am a Sci-Fi fan from way back.The story begins on the world of Valchondria. A negative utopia that is ?Maintained? by, who else, the Maintainers, sort of, like the Firemen in Ray Bradbury?s Fahrenheit 451. They watch for people using words from a banned word list. Words that are considered anti-glory to Valchondria, words such as colonization. There are no books, like in Fahrenheit 451, only wallscreens that project the things that the Maintainers want the people of Valchondria to see and think. For their own good, of course.There is a ?miracle drug that has given the people of Valchondria a virus that makes them immune to almost all diseases and the ravages of time? but, along with that there are things that it takes away also like, the ability to see in color, and hear as many tones as we do now. With this loss people have lost interest in music and anything related to it, such as dancing.There are some that have not lost the ability to see in color. One such person is Dr. Lorfeltez. A 26-year-old scientist that recently became a representative of the SSC (Supreme Science Council), a strong branch of the government. She is as strong willed as her adversaries. She thinks that Valchondria should reopen space travel exploration, something that is considered anti-glory.She along with another brilliant scientist, Dr. Nabold, creates Life. Life is a computer that had many tentacles that reach deep into the Valchondria soil looking for energy deposits. There is another ?scientist? along with them, Dr. Geln. Did I say scientist? I forgot to add the word Mad. Dr. Geln is also an operative placed there to watch, and make sure that Life does what it?s actually meant for, creating a doorway to Valchondria?s past.Dr.?s Lorfeltez and Nabold fall in love and become married. At the same time, Dr. Geln falls in love with Lorfeltez. Which creates some very interesting twists later in the story. When Dr. Lorfeltez becomes pregnant with twins, something that is forbidden on Valchondria, Dr. Geln, with the help of Life, takes one of the twins, Telius, to the past, where Alom brings him up. Alom is an aging priest of his time.Dr. Geln has got to be fashioned after 20th Century?s worst criminal, Hitler. He creates a youth organization called Youth For Valchondrian Reform. Where he brain washes, Argen, the twin that stayed in Valchondria?s present. Argen, best friend is Kryldon who happens to be same-gendered, something that is considered normal in Valchondrian society. Sometimes it is even preferred. Kryldon unwittingly, gets Argen involved in the Youth For Valchondria?s Reform. You can take it from there.Whether you are a Sci-Fi fan or not, Degranon is a must read. It is fast paced, and compelling. Thanks Duane for giving us another place and friends I would like to revisit again."},{"Title":"A Faceless Enemy: The Origins of Modern Terrorism","review":"This book was written in 1998, with a new preface written after September 11. The author's urgency about the threat of \\"superterrorism\\" on American soil was based on his extensive worldwide experience with a variety of international organizations. His comments on everything from profiling of airline passengers to the dangers of attacks of anthrax and weapons of mass destruction now seem eerily prophetic. At the same time, it is amazing in retrospect that al-Qaeda is not mentioned once in the entire volume, nor is Osama bin Laden -- a clear indication of how little attention we were paying to some very ominous developments in the 1990s. In this regard, the author's government experience and perspective is very instructive, and less reassuring. His sense of confidence about our intelligence and law enforcement capabilities seems based largely on how much money we spend and how many international forums we participate in, rather than on the difficult and dirty business of in-country military and intelligence action. Frequent references to the author's own extensive and fascinating experiences, particulary in the former Soviet Union, make an otherwise 'academic' study very readable. This important book -- perhaps inadvertantly -- is an excellent guide to both the strengths and the weaknesses of official governmental and international efforts to track and prosecute terrorism."},{"Title":"A Faceless Enemy: The Origins of Modern Terrorism","review":"While the book is prophehtic and contains some little known facts much of the informtion in this book is common knowledge to the well informed. It often seemed to me to be a recitation of facts collected elsewhere and while the authors warnings and recommendations are extraordinary considering when the book was written. It comes off flat and uninteresting.For those less informed on the subject it's highly recommened for those looking for even deeper information I don't recommend it.Additionally the book does little to actually discuss the origins of terrorism as the title indicates. It is more about the possabilities today and the cross breeding of narco-crime and terrorism."},{"Title":"A Faceless Enemy: The Origins of Modern Terrorism","review":"A Faceless Enemy first appeared in 1998, predicting high-impact terrorist attacks on America in the near future and even pinpointing the potentials of anthrax as a mail device. In the wake of September 11th its message is even more frightening as author Glenn E. Schweitzer's considers other possible scenarios of modern terrorism and the potential big-money interests which could finance them overseas. A new prologue for this edition of A Faceless Enemy adds impact and power to an increasingly relevant warning of the dangers to come."},{"Title":"A Faceless Enemy: The Origins of Modern Terrorism","review":"No one can deny that Mr. Schweitzer has shed light on some topics which ceartanly deserve close attention. Whether it isthe poisoing of water and food supplies or the stealing of Uranium from the former Soviet Unions weakly protected facilities.Terrorism today means killing on a large scale.However, the topic of Terrorsim has existed since Mankind and is not alien to any country, especially the United States.Mr. Schweitzer, working in the service of the USA, has as the most proposed Ideas which lay in the interest of the American people and promote Goverment based projects, and is therefore lacking in critizicsm of the USA,altough admitting that any country which uses Weapons of Mass destruction must not be hesitated to be labeled as a Terrorist state. This labeling can then ofcourse not exclude the USA, the only Nation ever to use Atomic weapons against another, to win a war whose victory was already in their hands.Ofcourse there is Fanatic terror, ideological terror, and simply material benefit terror. However, two categories must not be excluded and these are Democratic and Mediae Terror.The United States is expert in both. Having no regretts in pursuing their Goals they support Regimes, who later turn into cruel and backward dictatorships,with Financial and Material support, only to later replace them, under the false banner of Democracy, with a so called Democratic Leadership. The best example is ofcourse Iraq, which is now part of the \\"axis of Evil\\", and under target by the United States. Who can forget the picture of a smiling Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam Hussein? The support of Saddam by the United States with Poison gas, radar images, and money is to easily forgotten. With support of the United States Saddam Hussein managed to stage a successfull coup in 1979 and in turn started the war with neighbour Iran, which was developing in a dangerous opponent, not to be underestimated. This Terrible War cost a million people their Lives and yet today America can proudly proclaim that it is their duty to promoted freedom and justice.It is astonishing yet the same paradox policy existed in Afghanistan. The United States showed showed no regretts in supporing Osama Bin Laden, then a nobody, and his Mujaheddenwith three Billion Dollars, to help drive out the Soviet Union Soldiers. Similar with the Taliban, perhaps the most Mediae targeted regime ever, who have been labeled as the \\"embodiment of the backwardness of Islam\\". It only takes a little knowledge and common sense to realize that rather then Islam, the real reason behind their existence was controll and power.Having been trained in so called \\"Kuranic Schools\\" and supported by the Pakistani secret service, under the rule of Nuaz Shareef,( who can rightly claim that the Pakistani secret service did not work closely with the CIA?)they soon went to controll Most of Afghanistan.However, the most surprising support came from the United States which alone in years 2000 to 2001 paid 200 Million dollar to them. The simple question arises, why? The answer is just as simple. Iran was supportive of the Hazrat Shiia Minority in Afghanistan, whose center was in Mazar Shareef. Fearing that they would created a Shia State, which in turn would controll Afghanistans resourses. It is not surprising then when we conisder the Massacer in 1996, by which more then 6000 Shiias were killed in the most barbaric way by the Taliban? Or is it surprising to know that because of the brutal killing of Iranian Diplomats Iran was was on the verge of War? The most brutal and intoxicating way to controll a people( or to promote the \\"good and evil\\" cause of a so called super power) is through religion or unquestionabel ideologies like communism. The Taliban testiy to that fact.In this world is saddly the strong who rule, and democracy is something that is forced on with a gun. To give a fair and logical Picture of Modern Terrorism, the obsever has to analyze the motives and ambition of the Ruling Elite. It is through this that we gain a clear and unbiased picture of what policticsis really about, and that even the current Islamo-phobia trend is nothing buy a way for a ceartain fraction of society to convince and gain voices. As Ralph Waldo Emmerson said: Fear is the greatest Motivator.Any other discussion is pure side talk and is just resbosible for creating public panic. We cant avoid Terror, but we should examine its roots rather then its possibilty."},{"Title":"I Want To Be A Pilot","review":"This book features full color, printed-to-edge photos of pilots and various kinds of aircraft.

In \\"Cry\\" he wrote of the wretched lives and condition of the black South African. But he imagined a better world through the lives of his major characters.In \\"Too Late the Phalarope,\\" published in 1953, five years after \\"Cry,\\" Paton shows exactly how apartheid negatively affected whites, as well. Instead of murder the central crime in this novel is immorality. Yes, crime. It was on record, meaning against the law, for a white man to have sexual relations with a black South African.The main character, Pieter van Vlaanderen, taller, stronger, smarter, and more successful than the average Afrikaaner, has a secret sin, a secret guilt: He is attracted to Stephanie, a black South Afrikaaner. What sets Pieter apart from others is his record as a war hero, an efficient lieutenant in the police force, and a celebrated rugby player from his region.It is not a spoiler if I tell you that Pieter will be destroyed and the family ruined when Pieter is accused of immorality, then proven guilty. One way Paton avoids any description of this ill-gotten pleasure is to have an innocent narrator tell the story. Pieter's aunt, an unmarried woman, never loved by a man, is the narrator. Pieter's journal fills in details the aunt could not know.Paton raises all sorts of ethical questions in his novel. Can a wife drive a man to another woman if she is unwilling to participate fully in the marriage bed? Does a man develop a weak character, although hidden, because his father is cruel and withholds love? The main question raised several times is this: If God fully forgives, if God gives grace, why then can't the state in crimes such as this? Not only is Pieter ruined, but so is his family, although grace does come into effect in this.I found \\"Too Late the Phalarope\\" (a Phalarope is a bird and no, I cannot explain its meaning in the title), a richer novel than \\"Cry.\\" It needs an immediate second reading to capture those nuances that run all through the novel that may elude the reader on first reading. And those ethical questions. This is the kind of book that would make an excellent choice for discussion in a book club."},{"Title":"Too Late the Phalarope","review":"This is the first time I have been so moved by a book that I have written a review of it. When I think of &quot;the lieutenant&quot; and his goodness, his sin, his longing - deep longing - for fulfilled love with his spouse or his father or his G-d, my heart aches. Because of his physical beauty and bearing, others have set him apart. Where is he at home? Not in either of his own homes, not in his own body or mind. Locked in the unforgiving and puritanical society of the Afrikaaners, the lieutenant is doomed to destroy himself and all around him. The characters are multi-layered, fully believable. His Aunt, as narrator, serves as the conscience of the times. She reveals herself as she details the downfall of the family and as she does, she and the captain question man's right to condemn self-righteously - when G-d condemns and then forgives."},{"Title":"Too Late the Phalarope","review":"In unusual and finely styled language we have sensitive portrayals of many characters and a variety of relationships with the main character Pieter, a larger-than-life hero (called a god by one of the townspeople) who is admired by many but nonetheless cannot ignore &quot;the one misery of [his] life.&quot; Apartheid is the environment of this novel, not the focus. The most significant relationship is the one between Pieter and his father Jakob, but crucial to the story are the other father-surrogates: the Captain, Pieter's father-in-law, and most important, his friend Kappie. I have taught this novel to my classes every year for the past twenty-five years or so. I always have students who say to me that it is unlike any other book they have ever read.

I was struck by his Steinbeck-ish style of writing (which is fabulous, of course!) But comparison's aside, Paton has crafted an intriguing and extremely meaningful story. I'll avoid going over the plot but suffice to say there was not a moment when I did not feel a strong connection to the characters and their motivations. The views into Pieter's mind contributed to an intense emotional line through the book. Apartheid was not the focus but through Pieter's entries we can definitely understand the horrors of the situation (and perhaps apply the knowledge to our own situations). Truly an inspirational work! I encourage you to read this book ASAP!"},{"Title":"Too Late the Phalarope","review":"What is most remarkable about this book, aside from the fascinating style of language in which it's told, is the fact that apartheid is a &quot;given&quot; in the story. Set in the late '40's-early '50's, it's the story of a God-like young man from a powerful family, who, while outwardly perfect (except for bouts of depression/moodiness) is tortured by his lust. What's nice about reading the book is that the writing is not explicit-it deals more with his wrestling with conscience rather than the lust itself. The apartheid factor weighs heavily on plot, but the author doesn't bemoan the injustice or tragedy of the system, because the narrator is the protagonist's aunt, who has obviously grown up with apartheid and accepts it as fact, with no question. The reader, therefore, comes to their own sense of injustice without having to be told by the author or a character. The result is extremely effective.I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old, as a great character study and glimpse into a time, not that far gone."},{"Title":"Too Late the Phalarope","review":"Alan Paton masterfully scripts a young man's descent into a sin that in segregated South Africa was the worst of all sins. Paton writes the narrative from the main character's (Pieter's) Aunt perspective and splices in first person narratives from Pieter's perspective. The Aunt is something of an all-knowing narrator with some limitations.The novel sort of begins by revealing the conclusion that is also apparent from the novel's description or cover--that the white Lt. commits this grave act. It builds and builds to the final climax of total personal destruction and familial destruction. Paradoxically, there are hints of some type of liberation within the main character that are not really elaborated enough to be more than just hints.Paton includes much foreshadowing and foreboding leading up to the final act. So it is not a surprise what happens; although, the enormity and devestating effects are.What Paton has geniusly accomplished in the novel is the absurdity of the lives so many lead that appear moral, noble and successful but are hiding both depravity and suffering. His insights into the relationships and observations of people are a great lesson on male and female souls.This is disturbing to read but worth it; although the feelings and thoughts I was left with were quite different than I had after reading Cry, the Beloved Country though just as profound.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Too Late the Phalarope","review":"I was glad to read here that a teacher regularly assigns this book to his students.

It is a great tool for outlining a broad plan for a visit, with a current guidebook (I like \\"Hiddden San Francisco\\" from local publisher Ulysses Press, new edition in press) for the details.

Twelve-year-old Amanda \\"Mandie\\" Shaw has been having the time of her life over the past few months. After discovering the truth about her family, and being reunited with her long-lost mother, Mandie finally feels at home. And since the wedding bringing her mother, and her father's brother together in union, things have been splendid. The only thing that has made life even more grand for Mandie is spending time with Uncle Ned, and assisting the Cherokee Indians in protecting their gold, and building a hospital where they can be cared for in times of need. But now Mandie's world has been suddenly turned upside down.Mandie understands that being a proper young lady is important in high society, but when she learns that her mother is determined to send her away to The Misses Heathwood's School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina, she couldn't be more disappointed. Mandie is convinced that she could learn the proper ways of living right at home with her mother and Uncle John. But her pleas fall upon deaf ears; and before she knows it, she has been deposited at the dreaded institution. Mandie misses her close friend, Joe, and, even more, her beloved kitten Snowball; but she knows that receiving a proper education is important to her mother, so she resolves to stick it out. But things aren't so easy. Mandie's roommate, April Snow, is dead-set upon catching Mandie breaking the school rules, and wants nothing more than to get her into trouble. It is only when a new girl in the form of Celia Hamilton arrives that Mandie finally begins to feel at home. She and Celia have quite a bit in common, and before they know it, they have become the best of friends. But things still aren't right at The Misses Heathwood's. Strange noises coming from the attic in the dead of night have been keeping the two girls up; and when Mandie's belongings begin to disappear, the two girls know that they have to do some investigating. But their snooping may just land them in hot water, before they even have the chance to get to the bottom of the case.It has been over three years since I read MANDIE AND THE GHOST BANDITS, but I feel as if I read it just yesterday. As with the previous installments, Mandie is her normal sweet, lovable, curious self. Her kindness towards the various people she meets is admirable, and sets a perfect example for young readers; while her faith in God adds a nice, inspirational touch to the tale that can't be denied. While the scenes starring Snowball and Joe are rare, Lois Gladys Leppard has introduced some new characters into the story that make up for the lack of the two of them. April Snow is a wonderful, villainous character whom you try to love but find difficulty doing so; and Celia Hamilton is adorable. The mystery is engrossing, and is hard to unravel, but the steps the reader must take, alongside Mandie, to do so, is quite fun.

I've studied the lead guitar and lead guitar riffs books, and I recently bought the slide guitar book.The best thing about the chord book is the organization by key. The book provides all chords for each key, in standard and bar chord configurations. The book also contains a nice, brief description of music theory and examples of some typical chord progressions. It's far better, and more comprehensive, than any other chord book I've seen (and as a result, of course, it won't fit in your case)."},{"Title":"Progressive Guitar Chords: For Beginner To Advanced Guitarists","review":"This is one of the few chord books worthy of space on my shelves. Most just lay out page after page of the same shapes in all keys, expecting you to either memorize all of that information out of context or refer to it on an ongoing basis. Not very practical and not very useful in the moment of musical expression. This one helps you learn how to structure a chord shape by indicating which notes of the chord are what degrees, and it shows you how each moveable shape is derived. There's also a fairly comprehensive (albeit brief) section on basic music theory and a few useful appendices. Coupled with a bit of fretboard knowledge and maybe a little ear training, this is a great resource that can be instrumental (pardon the pun) in enabling you to construct your own chord voicings, avoiding the tedium of flipping through page after page of a lesser book in confusion.Eventually, you won't even need a chord book and you can give your copy away to someone who does. But you'll probably want to replace it 20 years later so you have one on hand to show your students when they ask about good chord books...Speaking of which, it always helps to have a good teacher to help put it all together, regardless of how much reference material you have.This book is much more useful than just a collection of pictures and fingering diagrams that you have to learn by rote. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Progressive Guitar Chords: For Beginner To Advanced Guitarists","review":"I bought this book when I started learning guitar. I only used it occasionally to find open chords when that was all I played. This book probably sat on the book shelf and eventually storage in the basement (where it got water damaged)for about 2 to 3 years. For much of that time I didn't play the guitar. But then I got back into it. Occasionally I picked up this book and started looking at the chords. Also I would read the back where it talks about keys and chord construction.I was getting very frustrated trying to finds songs with just the chords I new. Soon I realized to my dismay (at first) that I would have to use bar chords. So I started to play the songs I previously played with open chords in bar chord form. Suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks. I now started to understand why the string notes (EADGBe) were chosen the way they are. Also it occurred to me that most rock songs use the same basic pattern of root notes regardless of how the song sounds or what key it's in. Another thing I realized is that a chord is the same regardless of the different fingerings used by the folks who transcribe music. A major chord is simply 3 notes played together it does't really matter where you get the notes from as long as you play them. So if you hate playing the open G because of the fingering and difficulty in switching between it and other chords, don't, just play the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings open, that is a g chord just don't play any of the other strings and you will be ok. Also you can play the first string if you put your finger on the 3rd fret of it.This book has helped me realize that playing complex chords doesn't make you a great guitarist. Making the right sounds come out of the guitar is the key to it all. You will sound better if you use the simplest possible chord forms for your playing ability and concentrate on the other aspects such as timing etc.Another big advantage of bar chords is the ability to stop the chord by simply releasing pressure on the strings as opposed to having to drop your pick hand on the strings to get the muted effect. I was in heaven the first time I played a B bar chord (in the open A form) and started muting and playing the chord alternately. Just play a bar chord in the E form anywhere on the guitar and start moving your fingers to other places to see the sounds you can acquire. You will hear all the chords that are commonly used in music.I originally paid $15 for this book at the local music shop. At first I got little or no use out of this and began to think it was a waste of money. Now I look at this book almost every day and find myself just looking for different chord positions. It has essentially become my bible for guitar playing. If you decide to buy it don't get dissapointed if you don't use it much. Eventually it will become a necessary resource."},{"Title":"Progressive Guitar Chords: For Beginner To Advanced Guitarists","review":"I picked this book up last night from my local music store to study some movable chord shapes, i took it home and opened it up again and to my surprise there was a roughly 20 page long summary of music theory, a topic which previously i have struggled with. i own books upon books upon books upon books on my bookshelf 3000 pages of music theory. basic guitar? piano? timing? intermediate and advanced. I've read them all and still struggled to understand some music theory concepts.The 20 pages in the back of this book describe music theory for the guitar in a completely direct logical easy to understand way and cover mostly everything that you will need to know. i flipped it open spent 40 mins reading that section and have increased my knowledge about music theory by at least 10 fold.But in its roots this book is a chord book not a theory book and it excel's at that too. chords are presented in a logical fashion in sequential order a b c d e f g it goes through all the important kinds of chords you would expect such as major minor augmented diminished etc shows you movable chord shapes bar chord shapes and most of all teaches you an understand of how a chord is constructed so you can easily find an A Major anywhere on the fret board without needing to refer back to the book.It also has an excellent section on transposing in the theory section at the back and a great list of Keys and their Relative Minor keys as well as the scale that makes up that key and the chords you can use in said key.All in all this one book has replaced 3000 pages of complected theory and chord charts that after reading numerous times have baffled me. just look at some of the other reviews and your decision to buy this book should be easy, This book is simply the best chord and theory document i have ever owned."},{"Title":"Progressive Guitar Chords: For Beginner To Advanced Guitarists","review":"\`Progressive Guitar Chords' is a pretty comprehensive guitar reference book that is good for both beginner and advanced guitarists.

Technically, it is good reference guide - not the best. There are many concepts and terms that are not explained in the body of the text. Rather, as you are reading up on a particular topic,instead of defining the key terms, you are forced to flip through the glossary at the end of the text.Example, page 100: \\"Forms of the verb that end in -ing, called gerunds...\\" Well, he author never mentions the fact that gerunds are used as nouns. This you learn from going to the glossary (P. 555)This sort of thing happens all the time. Ahhhh!!My second issue has to do with the excessive number of mind-numbing number of practice exercises. They alone take up 30% to 40% of the text. I think it is a great idea to practice what you are trying to learn but guess what? There is no answer key provided.Why is it that you can get a solutions manual (at least odd number)to every math text ever produced but every other discipline restricts them to instructors only.

I purchased this text planning to give it to a friend who does not share let alone understand my passion for jazz. Now I wish I'd exercised more judicious consumer restraint. This is a book for those who are curious about some of the many &quot;names&quot; of jazz as well as a brush-up on historical periods and musical styles. But it's of little help in explaining how to listen to this difficult, challenging music, or even what to listen to.With respect to the latter criticism, one or two examples should serve. Duke Ellington, arguably the greatest American composer and all-around American musician, is represented by a couple of off-beat recordings in which he agreed to perform with Charles Mingus and John Coltrane. And the most beloved, revered, inarguably influential recording of the last 50 years--Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;--is not even included among the authors' list of essential recordings.From years of experience, I've learned that it's insufficient to overwhelm jazz neophytes with hundreds of names of musicians. Nor does it help younger listeners to learn that a bebop tune is based on Gershwin's &quot;I Got Rhythm.&quot; Even playing a Charlie Parker solo for most listeners simply makes no impression. Great thoughtfulness, selectivity, and ingenuity are required to communicate the essence of this profound, beautiful American art form.For those who want all the names, check out Leonard Feather's &quot;Encyclopedia of Jazz.&quot; For those who want a clearer perspective on the 5-6 musicians who count most as well as better understanding of musical form, improvisation, and stylistic distinctions, try Mark Gridley's &quot;Jazz Styles&quot; (or catch a lecture by Wynton Marsalis). This &quot;Dummies&quot; edition I would regard as an occasionally convenient reference tool, but I can't think of anyone I'd give it to."},{"Title":"Jazz For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"The nicest aspect of this book is it's accompanied with a 10-song CD, including great tunes such as Sonny Rollins' &quot;Way Out West&quot; and Miles Davis' &quot;Oleo.&quot; But the author doesn't say much about these pieces. I personally would've loved to see some detailed annotaion about the song structure, instruments, melodic development, etc.In fact, Sutro is mostly interested in names. He spends only about 5-10 pages on what constitutes jazz: swing, improv, and so on. This is what I wanted more of. I want to listen to a piece of music and have someone whisper in my ear &quot;notice the synocpated the beat here.&quot; I also would like a clearer description of the differences between historical periods. How does hard bop differ from bebop? Sutro gives me some names in each group, but he doesn't help me to *hear* the difference. Why not use the bonus CD to help us out here?"},{"Title":"Jazz For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Both the accolades and criticisms of the reviews above are accurate. As someone new to jazz, I wanted to hear some examples of what makes jazz unique - such as syncopation, emphasis on chords, and slurred notes. The CD does not deliver this, but neither does any other introduction to jazz that I could find. The closest thing is the PBS web site for Ken Burns' Jazz, which has a virtual piano that morphs \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" from the nursery rhyme tune into a jazz version, step by step.The author's emphasis on performers and \\"names\\" is true, but all music is developed by people. Jazz (more so than other music types) has evolved from the performers and their personalities. The different eras of jazz seem to be best explained by the creative changes of people playing it. Jazz as a whole today seems to be strongly influenced by the major figures of the past, such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, and Thelonius Monk. Understanding these types of figures, and the others who have been influenced by them, explains a lot about the development of jazz. There are some omissions in the book that seem to be common from the jazz \\"elite\\", for example Glenn Miller. While maybe not the best performer of big band swing jazz, he certainly was one of the most popular.If you are interested in jazz, want to know more about it and the people who made it what it is, this book is a good place to start. After that, let your own taste be your guide as to where you go next."},{"Title":"Jazz For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This has been a great reference book that I've used extensively while watching the &quot;Jazz&quot; film series by Kenneth Burns on public TV. All the key points and players have been presented in &quot;Jazz for Dummies&quot; and it has helped me identify names, understand musical concepts and follow the chronology of the jazz players, and their influences, as they are introduced on the TV series. Clearly the author has a deep appreciation for jazz and shares his passion in an approachable style rather than showboat himself by adopting a more academic tone. I totally disagree with one of the other reviewers appearing on this web page. His pet peeve about Miles Davis' album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; being slighted in the book is unfounded. On page 141 Mr. Sutro recommends listening to this album as an introduction to Davis' music. This is a very cool album, it has a reputation as the ultimate &quot;make out&quot; music. But it's my conclusion that serious jazz afficionados would agree with Mr. Sutro that some of Davis' other albums such as &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; are far more indicative of the range of his talent. There's decades of great jazz music to choose from and Mr. Sutro has done a commendable job pointing novice listeners in the right direction."},{"Title":"Jazz For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"&quot;Jazz for Dummies&quot; takes this complex Americal classical music and distills its basic history and players into a form that newcomers and oldtimes alike will appreciate. Important eras, from early New Orleans to Bebop and Free-Jazz, are represented, as are dozens of jazz's heroes. I found it particularly helpful how the book is divided by sections that trace the history not only of jazz's greatest eras, but also of its great instruments and instrumentalists. Most books about jazz deal with theory, in esoteric language. Sutro's book is admirable for the ways in which it makes jazz accessible to newcomers who want to experience its power. He shows you how to start a collection, which CDs might be of interest, and how to find your own personal path into this epic music.

But he, as many others in the biz, will tell you, plot IS character and character IS plot. Without engaging, compelling people directing the action of your story, chances are your reader is not going to get past the first few pages. Lukeman gives great advice for punching up one's characters, testing them, making sure these &quot;people&quot; are right for the story you want to tell and vice versa. THE PLOT THICKENS covers more than just characters, however. It's a great resource for writers at any experience level. Add it to your writer's bookshelf today!

Not very helpful in my experience."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"In writing good, solid fiction, the setting we create is experienced sensually, the action of the plot hangs on logic and connections, continually surprising the reader, and the characters cause us to recognize aspects of ourselves, remind us of people we know, (or don't want to know!), and are memorable.In The Plot Thickens Lukeman offers up, well, one of those mythical magical bags that are always full of whatever you need - in this case plot deepening, character fattening questions. You know from the start that you will not remember most of the questions, nor use every question for any one character.It is a book to read, to study, to think about. It is a book to carve out a space on your bookshelf for. It is a book to reread. Each of the questions can help you get closer to your characters: A few of them you will get to know intimately.Buy Lukeman's The First Five Pages, too, and read it first.

And for a guy who has, we are told, reviewed 50,000 manuscripts, the examples he gives are all from...movies! Not books, but films! What a waste."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"While I can't say that anything in this book was earth-shatteringly new to me, I did learn a lot and feel it is well worth my time and the money paid.If you are writing a novel and wish to write for the masses, Lukeman's advice can help you mold your vision into that of the \`industry standard.' He gives the writer kudos for being an \`artist' but will also help you take your original \`painting' (your rough draft) and transform it into something a successful literary agent such as himself might look at and consider representing.If you are a writer who is strictly pursuing self-publishing, you can get insight on pacing, building the story through suspense and any number of other tools. He has great advice on how to scrutinize your work, fiddle with it, and tweak it to make it smooth and flowing.I did not do the exercises, but skimmed them. I found the questions he had us ask ourselves useful and not repetitive.I recommend this book to people who have written a novel and want to make it better, OR people who will write a novel one day and would like to fill their brains with some good advice from the get-go.Lukeman recognizes the importance of encouraging writers. Read my favorite quote below:MY FAVORITE QUOTE from this book, PAGE 207\\"Great writers are desperate. For them, every sentence is a matter of life or death, just as for the great samurai every battle was a matter of life and death. You needn't be dying or imprisoned, but you do need to tap that part of yourself that has driven you to write in the first place. When you have done so, you will know it. You will no longer be writing because you like to, but because you NEED to. And if a day should pass when you skip your writing, you will feel it viscerally, as if you skipped a dose of medicine.\\"DISCLAIMER: I don't know Noah Lukeman, and I have no financial stock in this work.Ellen C MazeAuthor of Curiously Spiritual Vampire Tales"},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"This book has helped me a lot.

To put in bluntly, he tells aspiring writers how not to stink at their craft. The book does assume that you have at least written something that you can apply his principles to, so the first thing to do would be to put pen to paper; even so, some of the ideas can inspire you to get writing again--or to keep going. Lukeman has evidently edited for some high-power literary authors, and has also watched a lot of movies and read a lot of books. Most of his references will at least be familiar to readers.

I introduce them to canonical literature, and they introduce me to the more contemporary. We both learn and share.Although we do not always share common reading interests, we are nevertheless able to meet on common ground when we discuss movies.For example, I have found it easier and quicker to discuss the lack of character development in Ghost Rider and the character arc in A Beautiful Mind, as opposed to comparing a Mickey \\"I write stuff that people read\\" Spillane novel with Moby Dick.Or to compare the flatter characters in Crossroads (1986) with the richer characters in O Brother, Where Art Thou?--especially because many of my students have neither heard Bobby Bare's \\"Marie Laveau\\" nor read The Odyssey.Good writing of any sort provides such frames of reference to link the reader with the writer.

Well Done and Highly Recommended for anybody wanting to delve deeper into characterizations and how to drive plot through getting to know your characters."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"As a working writer and teacher of writing, I feel THE PLOT THICKENS: 8 WAYS TO BRING FICTION TO LIFE is one of the best buys I've ever made, and I've bought dozens and dozens of books on writing and related subjects. I've used this book extensively in teaching my classes and recommended it to all my students, most of whom have bought copies for themselves. Lukeman not only explains concepts and techniques in a way that's easy to understand, he presents fresh ideas --- something that's sometimes difficult to find. The sections on conflict and suspense alone are worth the price of the book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Lukeman promises in the introduction that by the end of the book, readers (writers) will take away plenty of new ideas and inspiration. At first I was skeptical, but ultimately he's right. The topics he covers are themselves nothing new, for they are basic fundamentals, but the depth to which Lukeman plunges into each area makes the book an excellent reference. The amount of questions he compels you to ask of your own work is astounding, which leads you to deepen and broaden your writing. If you are well into your own project, it would be wise to stop and explore your work through the exercises he offers at the end of each chapter. The chapters on Characterization are especially good. If you don't have much material written, don't worry... this knowledge can be used going forward, so that you are saved some revising time."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"First of all, disregard all the whiners. Getting published in this era is immensely difficult when you learn that agents reject 98% of the completed novels they encounter. To succeed as a writer, you will need--in my opinion:The First Five Pagesthis one\\"Techniques of the Selling Writer\\" by Dwight Swainand a dozen others. You will need to remove any reason an agent or publisher has to reject your work--and this book will help you achieve that goal.Some of the suspense stuff I have never seen gathered in one place. Another great resource is the books that accompany the \\"Dramatica\\" series (Dramatica.com). In short, there is no magic bullet but anybody who discounts this or any other book is oversimplifying it."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Good for beginning a story or editing it after you've finished writing it. There is a strong focus on developing characters even though the book title implies it would be plot. The author tends to jump from using techniques that you might use before even starting to write to something you might use after you've finished and are editing to something you'd use to move along as you're writing. Thus you can't use it as a straight follow the steps kind of book but it does give the book flexibility. I'm adding this one to my personal library. Overall I give it gets an A from the StuPage Reviews."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Literary agent Noah Lukeman represents many New York Times bestselling authors, and award winning authors. He's read over 50,000 manuscripts in the past 10 years and knows what will sell and what won't. The first five pages are critical to whether an agent, editor, or the all important consumer, will make the decision to purchase a book. Think about it. The last time you picked up a book, you looked at the cover, turned over and read the back cover blurb, and then, most probably, took a look at the first couple of pages. Lukeman tells you how to improve your writing so it grabs the reader. And grabs you, the author a publishing contract.Dee PowerAuthor, The Making of a Bestseller: Success Stories From Authors and the Editors, Agents, and Booksellers Behind Them."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"I've read quite a few books on writing while on my journey to writing my own book. Sometimes I read them because I get sick of my story, get a bad case of writer's block, and look to these books for inspiration to get me back on track. Sometimes I just want to develop my abilities, or I just read them for fun (yeah, I know, I'm a nerd).This is one of the most amazing books I've found on developing your plot, and I'm convinced there isn't one to parallel it as far as character goes. The first three chapters are spent focusing on developing your characters. And if you answer all those questions (literally 50 pages of them) you will know your character as well as yourself. Possibly better. They will have depth, quirks, a history, a detailed physical description, a medical history, spiritual/religious beliefs and philosophies (or lack thereof), an employment background and a transcript of the grades they have gotten in every class. You know what's important to them, how they would react to any situation. If you created a very caustic character, you now know why your character is that way (beyond the boring \\"oh well someone broke his/her heart and now he/she hates the world), exactly how much he/she is that way, and where his or her one and only weakness might lie that lets you get through those walls. It makes you pause: \\"I never thought about that!\\" My characters grew from decent, with some depth and reality, to completely full fleshed, so that I know them better than I know most of my friends and family.After the first two chapters of questions, there is one explaining how to apply the characterization into the plot and make the story better. Chapters on \\"the journey,\\" suspense, conflict, and context are unbelievable valuable and full of good advice and ideas you might not have thought of before. The final chapter, on transcendency, helps you learn to create a book that can better stand the test of time.I found myself getting more and more excited as I read this book, about writing my own. And while there were exercises that I sometimes stopped to do, often I was so into it that I couldn't put it down (cliche, yes, and pretty sad since it is a how-to guidebook, but I think that says something). There are exercises in each chapter helping you learn to apply principles and ideas the author has brought up and outlined, and there are examples from popular literature and movies. My only qualm with the book is that it often doesn't explain the example, just mentions the title of the movie or book. However, when it does explain the example, it does so very well, and the places where it doesn't explain them, it didn't necessarily need an example in the first place. It's like a little bonus chocolate chip in your cookie. And i'm not going to take off points because the chocolate chip wasn't big enough.Overall, an absolutely amazing book, and I highly recommend it to all potential future novelists."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"The plot thickens when the solution to a problem in a story plunges the reader deeper into the problem. The subtitle, 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life, does just what it claims. This is where the author works his magic, by revealing to the reader just how you thicken the plot.The author starts with a discussion of the characters' outer life, taking obvious life qualities and situations that involve what we do in life and has us craft characters embodying those qualities. He proceeds to relate these to character developments to turns in the plot to bring out meaningful interactions. The inner life delves into those things that motivate characters. These require more than the obvious clarifying the characters' beliefs, values and concerns. Thus thickening the characters. He describes inner-outer life discrepancies putting together a composite that does its job. This thickens the character soup still more.The narrative involves a different bag of tricks. The author uses a clever example from the Godfather to show how the narrative may be used to establish personality. This works well while developing difficult moments and suffering. Realization works to carry mood in the story as well. These aspects of narrative technique serve to thicken the spirit that narrative generates.Suspense and conflict provide another avenue of story development opportunity that drive the plot into a thicken state, consequently further captivating the reader. Creating suspense and raising the stakes the characters face are part of the larger scheme to drive the conflict. Consequently, the conflict sets up the initiative for suspense.At the end, he gives us transcendency--the ability to carry an idea forward in time, making a story immortal like Romeo and Juliet or Indiana Jones.The goal of the each segment is to illustrate ways in which an author can further develop a story, thus thickening the plot. He does this by embroidering various aspects of a character's inner and out life, laced with a strong, evolving narrative. When suspense and conflict are added, it's not hard to see how the author achieves his end."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Lukeman's previous book, The First Five Pages, provided good practical information about grabbing an agent's or editor's (and presumedly a reader's) attention quickly in order to increase your chances of getting published.In the first five pages of The Plot Thickens, I counted several cliches (he uses the phrase, \\"On the contrary,\\" three times within four paragraphs), the word \\"reference\\" used as a verb when he meant \\"refer to,\\" and other examples of unimaginative construction and sloppy usage.Continuing on, I discovered that this may have been intentional, for Lukeman's goal seems to be to help you construct a story that is full of cliches. He encourages the recycling of plot devices that will be immediately recognizable to the reader (and refers to popular films - not other books - to make his point.)If your goal is to create easily digested fiction that will not challenge your reader, and will stand a better chance of getting optioned for a screenplay, then Lukeman's advice may help you."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Noah Lukeman, The Plot Thickens: Eight Ways to Bring Fiction to Life (St. Martin's, 2002)One would probably pick this book up thinking that it's about plot. And it is, to an extent; Lukeman's belief (which I agree with) is that plot stems naturally from characters, so in actuality this is a book about character development. And that is a good thing. I've read a whole lot of novels over the years, and static characters have always been one of my complaints. Lukeman here attempts to engage budding (and established, perhaps) writers to break out of the static-character mold. Once your characters are living, breathing beings, he posits, your books will come alive on their own.As with Lukeman's other how-to-write books, The Plot Thickens is structured as exercise and explanation, but it's much, much heavier on the exercise this time around; fully a third of the book is nothing more than Lukeman firing questions at you. And given the length of the book, this should give you an idea of how thoroughly he wants you to know your characters. He comes up with questions I'm not sure anyone's thought to ask the people they know, let alone characters in a novel. And that's Noah Lukeman's strong point: he gets you to think, not just to follow along. I have to say that I liked this one even better than The First Five Pages. If you're an aspiring writer, Noah Lukeman is a goft; use him wisely. ****"},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"The Plot Thickens is a very enjoyable book about writing. I read it twice, and highly recommend it. The chapter on conflict is the one that I liked best, since my own novel Different Flags has a lot of that and The Plot Thickens helped me make it better. The Plot Thickens is written in a clear style, and it draws bridges between real life and fiction, something that we, writers, need to make our fiction come to life."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters?"},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"The author started with building characters. He went deeply in depth to create a character on the outside and on the inside. There were many things mentioned which I was familiar with from other books about the craft, but I did add a few things to help me build multidimensional characters. I loved the small things which made my characters rich! Then the author talked about a journey on the inside and about different journeys on the outside. But the best part for me came when he started to give tips how to build suspense. I have found ways to never have a sagging middle. Literary writers would benefit from this part of the book! He then provided different kinds of conflicts to keep readers engaged in the story.The last portion of the book was about context. Again, he said things that I've never thought about when writing! I made a list for myself of the things to remember when making an outline for my book and go through the list again when I revise my first draft.At the end, the writer summarized in one chapter how to make your novel stand out and become one of the classics.This book is a great addition for new novelists and established ones."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"There are many books available that tell you how to write a book according to a formula. This is not one of those books. Rather than providing aspiring writers with a template for writing a formulaic, but average, novel, Noah Lukeman discusses the characteristics of great fiction and instructs his readers on how to use these characteristics to organically create their own \\"masterpiece\\". Topics of discussion include: creating realistic, 3-dimensional characters and using them to generate plot ideas; creating compelling story arcs (physical and spiritual journeys for your characters); suspense; conflict; context; and transcendency (the art of writing a \\"classic\\" novel that will stay with your reader after he or she has finished reading).This book is very different from any writing books that I have ever seen and one which I find myself constantly returning to. Although Lukeman preaches against the \\"master plot\\" theory (that is that there is a finite number of \\"classic\\" plots and all stories can be constructed from this), I actually find that this book complements \\"20 Master Plots\\" (another of my favourite writing books) very well. When I am trying to come up with a novel idea, I find that the best situation for me is to have both of these books on the desk in front of me. One book is about writing within a framework, the other is about writing outside the framework and the combined effect is somewhere in between (which is a pretty good place to be, in my opinion). I highly recommend both of these books to all aspiring writers."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"If you have written anything at all, indeed, if you have read anything at all, this book will not make you a better, more knowledgeable fiction writer. The author certainly seems to assume the reader has almost no knowledge of fiction as most of his references are to films. Likewise, his discussions of fictional technique are shallow: in a discussion of the need for a character to change, he offers as an example \\"the rebellious son realizes his mother has always been good and kind to him.\\" He assumes that a reader of fiction won't sit still for an unreliable narrator (and uses as analogy the refusal of a movie viewer to tolerate an out of focus shot).Perhaps if you are absolutely new to fiction writing, the lists of characteristics in the first chapters will assist you.

How many brilliant flashes of inspiration lead to books, movies, or plays? Not many because ideas wither away without great characters and events that drive the story forward. Although this book is plot development, Noah Lukeman addresses the threads that are woven throughout the story in order to create the fabric from which beautiful, lasting images are created.He uses many examples from film because this is the media where life is visualized for the audience, and his \\"chief concern is illustrating (sometimes abstract) points.\\" (Lukeman)An example:* A young man is unhappy and feels trapped in his rural life.* He hungers for adventure.* He is inducted into thrilling adventures by chance.* He is part of a mystical adventure, for which he is unprepared.* Circumstances force him to face his inadequacies.* He gains friends and companions along the way.* Ultimately he finds the confidence he needs to succeed.* He saves the realm.The ideas belongs to many stories from Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter to Star Wars, and more. The magic of each story is wrapped into the characters and the lives they live; they are real.Each chapter and the introduction are deeper than I can show in a review. The book should be on every writer's desk.Both chapters one (Characterization: The Outer Life) and two (Characterization: The Inner Life) are 90 percent questions. I decided that a great addition to the book would be a CD listing of all of the questions. However, as I read and contemplated the details a writer must know about the people who live in their stories, I realized that a CD would make it too easy. By taking time to write the questions and answer them, they become part of a writer's arsenal. Even more significant is the gathered information can generate ideas to carry the story forward and create new plots.Chapter Three -- Applied Characterization discusses whether the character is major or minor, the frequency s/he appears, entrances and exits, and more. \\"Plot does not magically appear with the creation of a character; Frankenstein's monster might open his eyes, but until he gets up from the table and does something, there is little basis for a plot.\\" (NL) Think of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde -- if the elixir he drank had killed him there would be no story, yet if it was murder mystery a or ghost story the death is instrumental to the plot.Chapter Four -- The Journey takes us on an emotional or mental experience (not necessarily a trip) that brings about change. Simple and familiar examples are Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, The Bourne Identity, Speed, Cujo, Carrie, etc.Chapter Five -- Suspense, \\"more than any other element, affects the immediate, short-term experience of the work.\\" (NL) What is the destination, why is it significant, and what obstacles stand in the way? In The Lord of the Rings, if the dark riders killed the young hero Frodo, then there would be no story. The suspense is heightened because we know the ring has been awakened, it is calling to its dark master, and Frodo (and anyone near him) is in grave danger. This is how J.R.R. Tolkien created the roller coaster. A great writer constantly raises the stakes and provides some relief between encounters.Chapter Six -- Conflict causes changes; they can be obvious (court, sports, or battle scenes, etc.) or subtle, such as Sandra Bullock's role in Miss Congeniality: Gracie Hart must become Gracie Lou Freebush, a beauty queen. No matter what the conflict is, it must exist on multiple levels because people, therefore characters, are complex. One single conflict is not enough to propel a plot.Chapter Seven -- Context \\"influences suspense, conflict, pacing, progression, and ultimately meaning.\\" (NL) A writer or editor must keep the entire work in mind, and gauge the overall impression of each element in the creation of the story -- does it work? Judging repetition of information is one of the important steps. The keys in a murder mystery may be listed for analysis, but repeating the scenes can be disastrous and boring, yet might be necessary to solve the case. The obscure repetition of inferred information can also be deadly.Chapter Eight -- Transcendency taps \\"...into the universal, timeless truths and facets of the human condition.\\" (NL) The examples are clear and powerful.The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life is profound, and as I read, I applied much of the information to my own life -- in the end, I am richer than I was before I opened the first page. The highest compliment I can give to a book is that it made a difference to me.Noah Lukeman's books should be required reading. Without doubt, this is five-star book for everyone.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"This should be on every writer's bookshelf. Noah Lukeman writes as though he's an ancient finger-wagging English teacher, so I was surprised to see the bookflap photo and find he's quite young.Overlook the slightly disapproving tone, because the book is a gem. Few books are able to distil so much knowledge into such a short space.Detailed character-building exercises take up a large chunk of the book, because Lukeman firmly believes that character is the plot. He doesn't just work through appearance and background, though he does this in detail. He also covers which characters to put together, major and minor characters, how often they should appear, who they should interact with and when, what they react to, etc.Next he explains the different types of journey your characters can be on and how that affects the story, how to build suspense and develop conflict.Each chapter has suggested exercises to practice what you've learned.This deserves to be a classic."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"New writers do need advice about writing, the market, and structure.

Helpful they said. Great guide they said. I am not a well-published writer, but I found little in this book helpful.The first half is composed of mostly questions to ask yourself, mostly about your characters. How does the character treat other characters? Who does he choose to spend time with? Does he have a disfiguring disease? Perhaps these questions could be useful in inventing a character to base a story off of or in developing characters as a beginning writer, but not to an experienced and reasonably-competent writer trying to flesh out an already existing idea.Anyone who reads regularly will know most of this information already. It can help inspire new ideas though. The exercises aren't terrible, though they really just recap the rest of the writing.He seems to push conflict and tension over the top. He actually recommends cliches. For instance, if a character has to cross a river in order to continue journeying with his colleagues, Lukeman recommends that the story migt benefit if the river has a rushing current AND is full of man-eating crocodiles AND the character is being chased by an army AND 90% of the people who try to cross die. A story full of super-high tension and rediculous obstacles and conflicts is not my idea of good writing. It's more like the formula for a Hollywood blockbuster for testosterone junkies too pumped-up to recognize the difference between plot and situational window dressing. Jeopardy isn't jeopardy unless we believe he might not succeed.Even the title is misleading. This book is about how to start writing a story, not how tho thicken the plot. I liked &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; and did find that helpful for revising stories, especially the early parts. Lukeman just dropped the ball on this one."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"I found this book too formulaic to be at all useful.

The book is a lengthy set of prompts. It assumes the writer already understands something about structure and the writing process. The book assumes character is king and that plot emerges from character. If your technique is different from this, you may find the book irritating. If you need help fleshing out characterization to either augment or fundamentally build your story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Tackling a first novel is a big deal for someone always afraid to go for it. Lukeman's book is a lot like having Dad teach you to ride your first bike. The exercises help build balance and skill. As in learning to ride a bike a steadying guide takes out some of the wobbles. The beginning that points to arrival signals an enjoyable ride."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"&quot;The Plot Thickens&quot; is the best book I have read to date on the subject of creating living characters in fiction. Bravo, Noah.Without being overbearing, and without injecting his own personal &quot;style&quot; upon the reader, he outlines practical approaches in the form of questions designed to force you (as both reader and writer) to think about your characters in new and oftentimes inspiring ways.After reading only the first two chapters I found myself drawn to my lap-top to write another story with 3 new characters that I had envisioned while reading the questions he posed.If you--like me--have had trouble developing characters in your fiction, if you have found that breathing life into your protaganist anti-hero has left you frustrated and at your wits end, if you have felt as though you have failed as a writer because your round characters seem as flat as non-descript's, then you need to buy and read this book; it is a decision that you will never regret.6 out of 5 stars. Keep it coming, Noah. You have succeeded. You said, quote, &quot;As a Literary Agent...I have had to read over fifty thousand manuscripts...now I will teach back what you taught me. Now I will return the favor.&quot;We apprecaiate it, well done."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"To some extent, I have to agree with Scott of Cookeville. This book's main feature is its two chapters of questions you can ask about your characters in order to better flesh them out. (In my humble opinion, these questionnaires are simply the best I've ever seen in a writing book. And, as Scott mentions, the rest of the book is really about how to START a story rather than how to &quot;thicken the plot&quot;.But since that's my need right now, I'm giving this book 4 stars.On the other hand, I disagree with Scott's comments about the cliched suspense stuff. My read of that paragraph (p. 123 in the hardbound edition or see Scott's review below) is that Lukeman is merely giving an example of increasing danger, one of a variety of ways to increase suspense. In the start of the chapter, Lukeman also says, &quot;One can have undeveloped characters... and a weak plot, but if suspense exists, an audience will often stay with the work.&quot; On the other hand, though, he points out that the suspense needs to arise from the characters and the situation itself, and should not be used as &quot;a means in and of itself&quot;. Given that caveat, it hardly seems to me that Lukeman is recommending the (cartoonish) addition of crocodiles, roaring rapids and enemy soldiers patrolling the opposite banks just for the sake of a suspenseful river crossing."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"Lukeman's questions are dangerous. He forces you to engage your characters in all their raw flesh and bones. Before you write you must flay them alive and then recreate them. You cannot simply ask what your characters look like. You must know them as you know yourself. You must ask their motivations. You must know their guts and innards like you know your own face.Here, then, is a distillation of Lukeman's advice, though a distillation does it little justice:1. Character is plot, because plot is simply a gathering of events, and events are things that happen. And nothing happens unless somebody makes it happen. Cause and effect is all. Plot is a consequence of a character's will.2. If your story compels the reader not, raise the stakes. Increase the tension. Things happen because of action and reaction. Action and reaction are born from conflict. So if your prose is bland, spice it with conflict. Consider it thus: if all is fine in your fictional world, why the hell should anything happen? But flip that coin--if everything is all shot to hell, if your protagonist is at the end of his rope, then something bloody well will happen. Lukeman provides examples--don't have a group of friends sitting in a room talking. Have them forced to be there, held at gunpoint. Don't have your characters at ease. Make them hate themselves. Make them hate somebody else. Of course, your conflict must follow the exigencies of your story-- the purpose of your plot-- but it is also the plot's purpose. Overcoming conflict is the esence of storytelling.That's it. Lukeman gets to the brain and bone of creating plot by getting to the brain and bone of creating characters. If your characters are real, acting from true motivation, then so goes your plot. It will play well and ring true."},{"Title":"The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life","review":"I'm only on page 24 and I'm put off by the guy's misogynist attitude. \\"I use 'he' predominantly and 'she' in instances where the facet is particular to a woman.\\" Okay, so I'll just pretend most fictional characters are male...?

Since the opportunities to do so are rare, the next best thing is to read this book. It's well-written and a tremendous amount of time and research went into putting the history and stories together. The photos are great too."},{"Title":"Deep Secrets: The Discovery and Exploration of Lechuguilla Cave","review":"You may have heard of Lechuguilla cave. Located in Carlbad Caverns National Park, it is one of the world's most spectacular underground treasures, boasting extensive passages and impressive formations. It has been featured in a National Geographic special, and it received a great deal of national media coverage when an explorer was injured there several years back. While many people have heard of this incredibly beautiful cave, few know the story of its discovery and exploration, and of the intense struggles that ensued as various people vied for control of this underground treasure.In &quot;Deep Secrets&quot; (Cave Books 1999) Stephen Reams, Lawrence Fish, Paul Burger and Patricia Kambesis give us a true insider's view of the biggest discoveries, the dramatic episodes, and the political battles surrounding Lechuguilla.The story begins with a small group of Colorado cavers who have a passion for digging open new cave passages. Spurred on by success at home, the group decides to attempt a promising project in the Guadeloupe mountains of New Mexico, at a small, uninteresting cave by the name of Lechuguilla. As we toil with the diggers, the authors paint a picture of the rocky political landscape upon which the entire story takes place. And as the explorers break through into the &quot;find of the century&quot;, the political tensions break loose into an all out battle for control of the cave.As the story unfolds, we are witness to the most sensational discoveries and the thrill of exploration as Lechuguilla becomes longer, deeper and more spectacular. We come to know the explorers themselves, sharing in their triumphs and frustrations. And we hold our breaths in suspense at the dramatic rescue of an injured caver miles underground. All of this is played out on the backdrop of an intense political struggle.&quot;Deep Secrets&quot; gives us a unique behind the scenes glimpse into the life of a Lechuguilla explorer. The authors have done a wonderful job highlighting the biggest discoveries and most exciting stories, encompassing a cast of over fifty characters, while maintaining a coherent and compelling story line.Far from being a book just for cave explorers, &quot;Deep Secrets&quot; has universal appeal. This is not a collection of expidition reports, it's a true life story of adventure, drama and intrigue. And wrapped around the amazing discoveries, the stunningly beautiful passages, and the thrill of exploration is the timeless theme of a community torn apart by greed and power struggles, yet united by the need to rescue one of its own.&quot;Deep Secrets&quot; is thoroughly enjoyable reading for nature aficionados, adventure enthusiasts or anyone who just likes a good story."},{"Title":"Deep Secrets: The Discovery and Exploration of Lechuguilla Cave","review":"Excellent book. The authors captured very well the drama and adventure of the initial exploration. It is magical to read about how the cave revealed itself to the world.There is also a description of the politics and struggles to control the expeditions, but this is done in a measured way that doesn't distract from the main story.The only bit that I found lacking is the amount and quality of the maps. Although admittedly probably no amount would have been enough."},{"Title":"Deep Secrets: The Discovery and Exploration of Lechuguilla Cave","review":"Anyone who claims to be a caver and does not read this book isobviously a fake. This is a much need chapter in the history ofAmerican caving. Lechuguillia Cave is the crown jewel of the caving world. This is as close as you can get without being there. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The meaning of relativity: Four lectures delivered at Princeton University, May, 1921","review":"In 1921, five years after the appearance of his comprehensive paper on general relativity and twelve years before he left Europe permanently to join the Institute for Advanced Study, Albert Einstein visited Princeton University, where he delivered the Stafford Little Lectures for that year. These four lectures constituted an overview of his then controversial theory of relativity.The man who couldn't get a teaching job, whom everyone who knew thought a hopeless nutcase, and a virtual nobody at the time in the world of scientific research, this man wrote a paper in the dim light of early 20th century, The Special Theory of Relativity, and changed our conception of the physical universe and our physical world forever. His subsequent research in physics continued and built upon the findings in this book (independently proven by others as accurate)and the rest is history: His metamorphosis in the public eye into a genuine genius and research that built upon his findings resulting in jaw-dropping human acts of both destruction (nuclear warfare) and discovery that made our world a better place for life (advances in science and medicine from space exploration). No one knows what's next, but the works of his contained in this book were seminal and its seeds continue to sprout and grow every day."},{"Title":"The mission of spiritual science and of its building at Dornach, Switzerland: A lecture given at Liestal, Bale, Jan. 11th, 1916","review":"The Master taught Steiner his spiritual mission in life; to develop knowledge that synthesized science and religion.

Excellent reading."},{"Title":"For a Tin Star: Honoring America's Slain and Living Police Officers","review":"As a civilian, there are many aspects of the lives of law enforcement officers that I am unaware of. Before reading this book, I did not know about the daily risks they take, the animosity they face by some members of society, or the role of their families in their lives. For A Tin Star has instilled in me this knowledge and so much more.The book covers a range of topics from the effects of a police officer's death on his or her family, to the murder of Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner by convicted cop-killer mumia abu-jamal. Being from Philadelphia, I had known bits and pieces about this case. However, For A Tin Star filled me in on the truth about this savage murder using evidence like witness testimonies and court transcripts (the foreward is written by Officer Faulkner's widow, Maureen).This compelling book, which is written so smoothly, colorfully, and beautifully, puts the reader in a blue uniform and illustrates exactly what law enforcement officers feel and experience. It describes a police funeral in detail and goes the extra mile and tells the reader exactly what they can do to better their relationship with law enforcement. After reading this powerful and emotional book, most people will want to heed the authors advice and reach out to our protectors and heros.For A Tin Star is a must have for every family, those with a member who is a law enforcement officer and those who are simply protected by them."},{"Title":"For a Tin Star: Honoring America's Slain and Living Police Officers","review":"Wow, is all I can say in responce to this book. It is so nice to see such a young author write about such a touching subject. This is a true tribute to the men and women of the police. Every police officer should read this book! Gabrie L. Nathan delivers his thoughts clearly and with such grace. The pictures are also very touching."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The name of this book, while intriguing, is somehwat misleading. I expected to read a tale about an enigmatic gunfighter, but instead, was subjected to nothing more than a romance set on a ranch in the old west. The protagonist is not a particularly compelling character, and although the prose itself is well-written, the plot simply trudges along. I had to force myself to complete the book."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"Bill Bellounds made his fortune getting in on the cheap land early. he went on to raise agricultural products for the city folks.

Very entertaining and highly recommended for relaxed reading."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"One of Zane Greys best. I have enjoyed all of the Zane Grey books I have read since I got my Kindle early this year.The Mysterious Rider had some very unique twists. Many good characters. I like the descriptions of the colors and scenery in Zane Grays books, my mother didn't, she wanted to get to the \\"guts\\" of the books, but I feel more like I am watching the scene unfold. Although the endings are somewhat predictable, they are usually happy, they are the way you want them to end, but through many obstacles!I like the Trilogy Betty Zane, The Spirit of The Border and The Last Trail, these are the one's I read first and have not been disappointed in any of the Zane Grey books. Wildfire, Valley of Wild Horses were also good.I am trying to decide which one to read next!"},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"As most of Zane Grey books,this is a winner,and a good read. New book AmazonI recommend this book if you like western books."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"While I am a fan of Western movies, I've never been big on Western books outside of Elmore Leonard's stories (which I read not because they were Westerns, but because they were Elmore Leonard stories). In fact, just as the movie genre is a pale shadow of its former self, so is the written Western. In its heyday, however, there were few writers bigger than Zane Grey, and The Mysterious Rider shows that he handles the genre well.The story is centered around Columbine Bellounds, a nineteen-year-old girl who was adopted by wealthy rancher Bill Bellounds after she was found abandoned in Colorado ranch country. Columbine is a good step-daughter, in fact, too good; feeling she owes Bill, she agrees to his wish that she marry her step-brother Jack. The semi-incestuous nature of marrying someone who she has treated as a sibling isn't really the issue; the problem is that Jack is a rather loathsome character.Bill wants the wedding to take place because he thinks only Columbine can reform Jack, and she almost believes it herself, despite his constant acts of cruelty. Complicating matters is that she loves another, the cowboy Wilson Moore, who in turn loves her. Into this soap opera wanders the title character, Bent Wade. Wade once led a wild life but now has reformed his ways. He harbors a secret: he is Columbine's actual father. It's something he can't reveal, but it motivates him to try and give her a happy ending.Despite being nearly a century old, this novel reads easily and is overall, pretty good. It may not be great literature, but Grey's intent is to entertain, and he does this well. The Western may not be a major genre anymore, but The Mysterious Rider shows why it was successful in the past."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider is an amazing book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I especially like being able to get free books and reading them on my Kindle app."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider perhaps would have been better titled, Beauty and the Beast, and I am not in any way being disparaging. Zane Grey used the same type of plot lines for many of his books, and then added an extra character to bring the book to its logical conclusion. A young girl, the adopted daughter of a wealthy rancher, is forced to marry the rancher's no-good, drunk of a son, while the young girl loves another cowboy as different from the son as could possibly be--a similar scenario is found in Heritage of the Desert. But here a \\"mysterious stranger\\" is on the scene to make things right. And we can all guess who this \\"mysterious stranger\\" is, can't we? If you can't guess, I'm not going to tell you and ruin the book. Still, having said that, this book is a good Zane Grey romance told as only the master of historical romance could tell it, and worth reading--even more than once."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"I found this little gem at a yard sale in southern Oklahoma. It is an earlier Zane Grey work (1921 copyright) but it is well worth the reading. This little green hardback gave me a good contrast between what was written as western fiction then, and what is written now. The title is somewhat misleading in that the mysterious rider is not who you would think it would be. I would highly recommend it for the younger generation, boys or girls."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"On the surface, this book could be considered dull. But what one must realize, is the era in which this book was written, in the 1920's. For lack of a better way to say it, people, especially children, did not get out much back then. They needed to escape, and thinking of the wild west, was a good a way as any.I found the book very enjoyable. The book is not for children, if for no other reason, it it is not written for them, more for young adults. If you want to read a western about shootouts, and that sort of thing, then this is not your book. But for a good, descriptive drama, that grabs you and makes the pages turn, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"The Mysterious Rider is the story of Columbine, a orphan girl raised by her adoptive father Rancher Bill. Out of feeling obligated to Bill, Columbine agrees to marry his son Jack who is a drunkard, gambler, and coward. But her true love is Wilson Moore, who loves her in return..... But there is one more character with a secret- Columbine's actual father....The master of Western, Zane Grey (1872-1939), brings in romance in his novels, but the insightful way he describes the geography, social customs and practices, the way of life in the West, the American Indian, cowboy, and rancher characters makes the reader so involved. The stories provide not only adventure and entertainment, but the remarkable history of the West."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Rider","review":"As all of the books I have read penned by Zane Grey, this one was great.

The pacing of the book is fantastic, and it lends itself to reading with great drama and emotion: drenched animals, fright, relief, compassion, pity, laugher, hope, surprise... and the illustrations are spot on.

The illustrations are marvelous. I have bought this for many friends."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This simple-minded book sounds like it was written for perhaps ages middle school to high school, although I know many students of those ages who would find it boring. It has no meaningful conflict, no deep issues, no great resolutions, no wonderful descriptions. If you believe the word \\"Babe\\" automatically refers to baby Jesus, you might like it. That it is a New York Times best seller amazes me, but perhaps this reflects people's longing for uncomplicated lives without any serious troubles, love without ever real arguing, and faith without questioning or thought.The author's attempt to convey local dialects is very difficult to read, and her frequent use of \\"he,\\" when the identity of \\"he\\" is not apparent, caused me to have to go back and reread or read fairly far ahead to figure it out. After a while, I finally got that \\"he\\" was always the same man, but grammatically, this was very weak.The story itself, of the love between a pastor and his wife and their actions to create meaningful Christmas presents for each other, was touching (even though they NEVER got mad at each other about ANYTHING), and their restoration of old Nativity figures was believable, because they were based on some real ones that someone restored.There are a few sub-relationships that are also too perfect, but still sweet, and the sense of community is something we all want."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"As a self-admitted Christmas junkie, I'm always on the lookout for movies and books to make my own personal holiday experience a little richer. I found that in \\"Shepherds Abiding\\", even though at that point I had not read any of Karon's other Mitford novels. The story is fairly simple and uplifting, but something about it appealed to my soul so much that I now make it a point to reread the book every year when fall comes and I can feel the holidays beginning to stir (which happens early on with crafters--so much to do and so little time to do it!) I also have it unabridged on cd so that I can listen to it if my hands are otherwise occupied, and I don't have that many books on cd. I've given copies of this to almost all of my friends in case their spirits need a little renewing during this time of year. If you are looking for an easy, comfortable read, this is it and it stands alone quite well without having to read the entire series. Cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"The book arrived quickly and in great condition ,I have been reading all of the book & enjoyed all of them.

After this, I will probably never read another one of her books unless forced. It wasn't that the story was bad or the characters dull, it was merely that the characters seemed undeveloped and the plot was thin at best. There was very little resolution, and yet a satisfying end was easily within grasp, even expected. Instead, the ending was forgettable and I had to force myself to read to the last page of this (very short) book. It was not a book I would read again, and, based on this one, I will not pick up any of the other Mitford books either.Some of my reasons for the above judgment are as follows: The entire host of characters was shoddily introduced in this book, which, if I had read nine other books on the characters, I probably could have forgiven. However, I was left with the feeling that a proper introduction to any character (excusing the main character, Father Tim) was sorely lacking. The point of view (POV) was mostly from Father Tim, but then a whole bunch of other characters would jump in for short sections with their stories. This led to a fragmented storyline with too many POV characters and an unrealistic expectation that the \\"secret\\" did not come out when the entire town knew about it. In addition, I found the writing simple and forgettable.I'm sure lovers of Jan Karon would disagree with my deductions (as there's clearly a large following for Mitford books), but I was unimpressed with the quality of writing, characters, or plot."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"Characters, are great, you feel almost like you have known them for years, that is the way good books should be written."},{"Title":"Shepherds Abiding","review":"This is another of Jan Karon's kind hearted and thoughtful books about Father Timothy Kavanaugh and the characters of his world ....

A long-time Mitford series fan, I was severely disappointed in this latest installment: Karon presents us with nothing more than a vague, breezy update on some of the village's inhabitants - no depth of character or emotion; no real turmoil or triumph; no spiritual insight or inspiration. And precious little plot to boot. The book gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;painted with a broad brush;&quot; indeed, Karon seems to have employed a roller.
