All in the complex are on edge, especially Hatsumi and her family. Now that Shinogu has announced that he is severing ties with the Narita family it has caused all sorts of unrest within Hatsumi's troubled heart. She decides to go to him to demand that he return to the family but decides to stop and see Ryoki for support. He, being the most dense person on the face of the planet, mistakes her reasons for visiting him and naturally jumps to the assumption that she just wants to be with him, not that she might actually need some TLC.On an impulse he decides to run away with her and takes her to his father's suite in Izu. This causes all sorts of grief within the apartment complex as Mrs. Tachibana goes on a tirade to Hatsumi's family, insisting that it is Hatsumi that is corrupting the morals of her angelic son. An argument ensues but is brought to a crashing halt when none other than Mr. Tachibana shows up in the chaotic midst. When he admits to his part of the \\"affair\\" between Mr. Narita and Mrs. Odagiri all hell breaks loose, and Shinogu decides he must go and retrieve Ryoki and Hatsumi... but arrives too late... see, Ryoki has also told Hatsumi about the truth of the sordid \\"affair\\", and the news proves too much for her to take, so much so that in her anguish she breaks up with Ryoki (who was demanding that she choose between him and her family, perhaps this was not the best time to be offering such ultimatums, but hey, nobody said the boy was a genius... oh wait...)Grrr, the most annoying thing about this manga is that it takes too long to arrive in the stores! Now I get lucky because I work in a book store as the store's manga person, so I get access to books before they get out on the shelves, but it's not soon enough. This storyline is simply wonderful, the drama still leaves me enrapt, and the pathos that poor Hatsumi has to endure simply because she has a difficult time standing up for herself and making up her mind is nothing short of gut wrenching. I can't wait for the next volume to find it's way to my shelves... I just hope it gets released soon, I am dying to see what happened, especially since the end of this one winds up on a pretty high note between Shinogu and Hatsumi... but I give away too much, you'll have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Hot Gimmick, Vol. 10 (v. 10)","review":"First of all, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Hot Gimmick! It's been a solid shoujo series & I love that Miki Aihara is always keeping readers on their toes. Although not much really happened in volume 10, the complaint I have here is not with the story, but with VIZ.Let me say that I dislike VIZ in general. Their quality of work is inconcisistent with regard to both manga & anime and I would prefer not to buy anything from them if possible. Unfortunately they are they people translating this series! I was so excited to read volume 10 - I even waited to receive it as an X-mas gift (it was very tempting to buy it when it came out!). So imagine my dissapointment when I opened it up to read the THE WORST DIALOGUE IN HISTORY.Not only has VIZ decided to pump up the slang, but they have also taken the volume too far in terms of Americanization by doing so. The word \\"like\\" (as a filler word) appears at least a dozen times. And with phrases like \\"I am so sure!\\" and \\"omigod\\", the characters end up sounding more like Valley girls than the young Japanese they are supposed to be. What's worse is the ridiculous treatment of Shibnobu's friend who they've \\"urbanized\\". Example: \\"..'course I'm fairly BUSTIN' with all kindsa questions...\\" \\"Hey dude, take this. Be good to have some wheels.\\"I understand that publishers must change the language somewhat so Western audiences can relate to it, but I think they must also strike a balance between relatability and preserving the integrity of the author's work. Whatever slang is in the original Japanese text should be translated faithfully in a way we can understand. It really turns me off (as an older reader) when manga & anime companies try too hard to fit the work into a particular mold. If they want to keep readers older than their teens, then they must stay away from language that is TOO Americanized."},{"Title":"The Christian Mother Goose Book","review":"If you are a born-again Christian, you will absolutely love Marjorie Ainsborough Decker's books for small children.

Evolution Beyond the Gene","review":"Lee Alan Dugatkin has spent the last ten years studying imitation in guppies and in &quot;The Imitation Factor&quot; he explains his research and summarizes numerous other examples of imitation found in nature. His conclusion: even low intelligence animals like guppies can engage in the non-genetic transmission of behavior through imitation, and that transmission can have an impact on genetic evolution.In carefully controlled experiments using guppies Dr. Dugatkin explores how the tendency to imitate other females in mate selection can override other mate selection preferences. Female guppies of a certain species prefer bright orange males over drab gray ones. Dugatkin places a female and a dull male in one corner of a tank and a bright male in the other and then allows a second female to observe the guppy groupings. Then the first female is removed and the observer female is allowed to choose which male to go to. The observer female shows a greater tendency to select the male she saw with the first female (Yes there is a control to make certain that the observer is not just going to the side of the tank where there were two guppies). Further, after repeated exposure to females associated with drab males, the observer female shows a preference for drab males in general.Beyond his own research Dugatkin also details the research of others on imitation in animals. Examples include some very carefully controlled experiments with pigeons poking open boxes to get food, blackbirds learning which animals are predators, numerous studies of chimpanzees and rats who learn which foods are edible from their presence on other rat's whiskers. In addition to those examples he also discusses when imitation is likely to a useful survival strategy, and points towards other researchers who have developed mathematical models for when imitation is more likely to occur and what affect it will can have on the evolution of a species.Dugatkin is clearing attacking the idea proposed by others such as Susan Blackmore that humans are different from other animals because of the ability to imitate. If behavioral imitation is as common place as Dugatkin's evidence shows, these arguments are certainly erroneous. With his numerous examples and carefully controlled experiments Dugatkin does a very credible job of proving his point. I have just a few quibbles with this book. Dugatkin's definition of culture is a bit too loose for my preference. I would only count the guppies as being cultural because they can develop a general preference for drab males that can be transmitted, whereas Dugatkin would consider it culture even if the preference only applies to one male at a time. I am not certain under his definition whether a distinction can be made for fleeting imitation examples like observer animals moving when they see another member of their species fleeing something the observer can not see. I would hesitate to call that culture because their is nothing to pass from generation to generation. Similarly, while a general preference for drab males learned by observing females mating is something that could pass along indefinitely, a specific preference for a single male can only be passed along until while the male still lives.In addition, although he does an excellent job with his own specialization he unwilling to fill the gap left if the concept of human as super imitator idea is incorrect. Early on in the book he suggests that there might be two types of cultural evolution, that which he describes for guppies and other animals and a sort of 'runaway' cultural evolution which develops its own rules independent of genetic evolution, but he never really explains this distinction in any detail. Of course this is not the main thrust of his work anyway.Overall though this book should be valuable reading for anyone interested in cultural evolution. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Imitation Factor, The ... Evolution Beyond the Gene","review":"This is a wonderful book - clearly written, authoritative, up-to-date, and fun. I recommend it to all people interested not only in the study of animal (and human) behavior, but also to those who want a good read about what researchers are up to. Dugatkin is a first-class biologist and a great writer with a good sense of humor."},{"Title":"Imitation Factor, The ... Evolution Beyond the Gene","review":"Lee Alan Dugatkin is a first-rate animal behavior experimentalist whose specialty is the guppy, as well as a game-theoretic modeler. Most welcome is Dugatkin's talent for popular exposition of animal behavior research.This book is a very general exposition of animal behavior theory for the general public, with a special emphasis on epigenetic transmission of information, which Dugatkin equates with cultural transmission. He does quite a good job, and I would recommend this book to curious newcomers to the field. Dugatkin is especially good at weaving general themes (e.g., the various explanations of mate choice) with the specifics of particularexperiments.My concern here will be as an animal behaviorist whose specialty is human beings. Humans come into the picture in the first sentence of Dugatkin's book: &quot;We desperately want to think of ourselves as somehow distinct from other life forms on our planet...Currently there is the sense that we are unique because&quot;culture&quot; is found only in humans...As we shall see, culture is not humanity's gift to the universe.&quot; (p. ix). There is no doubt but that Dugatkin is correct, and indeed, it is impossible to understand human culture as divorced from the broad sweep of cultural phenomena across species. The attempt to do so is a major flaw in sociological and anthropological approaches to human culture--but that is another story to tell.While Dugatkin's assertion is correct, and his efforts to motivate his position are quite successful, it is curious that he does not place his argument in intellectual context. John Tyler Bonner's pathbreaking The Evolution of Culture in Animals (Princeton University Press 1984) is not mentioned, nor is Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb's ambitious Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution (Oxford University Press 1995) are not mentioned.Nor is the Baldwin effect, which is a major causal link from culture to genes (Baldwin, &quot;A New Factor in Evolution&quot;, American Naturalist 30 1896).Dugatkin is quite orthodox in taking the gene-culture coevolution definition of culture as &quot;information&quot;, a definition anchored in the two great contributions of Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution (Princeton University Press, 1981), and Boyd and Richerson, Culture and the Evolutionary Process (University of Chicago Press, 1985). In brief, this view holds that culture is information concerning the organism's physical and biological environment. While the basic biological information transmission mechanism is genetic inheritance, epigenetic transmission may also be fitness enhancing, and when it is, we can expect cultural transmission in animals. I do not dispute the fact that culture includes epigenetic information transmission. For instance, as Dugatkin stresses the tendency for previously mated male guppies to be desirable to unmated females may be due to the fact that older female guppies &quot;teach&quot; younger females who the desirable males are (although there are other plausible explanations of this phenomenon). I do believe, however, that (a) imitation in animals is categorically distinct from the &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; that typically occurs in human cultural transmission; and (b) the culture-as-information definition of culture is considerably too narrow to embrace all of human culture, and misses what is particularly unique about human culture.On the first point, most animal behaviorists have come to accept the idea that, pace bird imitations of vocalizations, animals do not imitate complex learned behavior directly. Rather, the contiguity of an individual to a conspecific carrying out a particular learned behavior increases the probability that the individual will stumble upon the same behavior. For instance, if a chimp discovers how to use a stone to smash open a food item,her child will be frequently in situations where stones and the food item are contiguous, and hence is more likely to discover the complex behavior. But the behavior is neither &quot;learned&quot; from the parent, or &quot;taught&quot; by the parent to the child. For more on this topic, the reader might refer to Tomasello and Call, Primate Cognition (Oxford University Press 1997), Daniel Povinelli, Folk Physics for Apes: The Chimpanzee's Theory of How the World Works (Oxford 2000), and Marc Hauser, Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think (Henry Holt, 2000).The most distinctive characteristic of human culture, however, is the existence of ethical norms and values. A value such as &quot;dress modestly,&quot; &quot;work hard and do not succumb to temptations that yield only short-run pleasures,&quot; and &quot;forgive those who transgress upon you,&quot; are deeply cultural forms, but they do not involve objective information about the world. Unlike a technique, such as how to fashion a tool, where to look for prey, or what types of things are edible, an ethical value has no scientific truth value. Of course, one might assert that if one follows a certain norm, certain material results will obtain (e.g., long life, good after-life, high fitness, happiness), but humans follow norms for their own sake, andeven when these good results are not expected. In sociology this is called the internalization of norms (see, for instance, Grusec and Kuczynski, Parenting and Children's Internalization of Values: A Handbook of Contemporary Theory, John Wily &amp; Sons 1997). The human capacity to internalize norms is thus akin to the programmability of human goals, since the key factor in an internalized value is that people \\\\emph{conform to the prescribed behavior for its own sake, and as a goal of action, rather than a means towards the realization of other goals. As I argue in &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Altruism: Genes, Culture, and the Internalization of Norms&quot;, Journal of Theoretical Biology 220,4 (2003):407-418, the programmability of the preference function is key to human prosocial behavior, quite on par with the accumulation and transmission of the types of cultural techniques associated with improving the ability to exploit the physical and natural environment.I would have preferred that Dugatkin include in his analysis both the factors leading to a commonality of culture across species, and the factors involved in the special cultural position of humans, but just dealing with the first of these makes for a quite informative and interesting contribution."},{"Title":"Imitation Factor, The ...

Evolution Beyond the Gene","review":"Dugatkin is a biologist and science writer. His specialist field seems to be the mating behaviour of guppies. Mating bahaviour is interesting from the perspective of cultural transmission - since chooseing a mate is a very important decision that it is difficult to get right - and many creatures may well use social cues to help them decide on the best mate.In the book Dugatkin describes in considerable detail the evidence that shows that guppies do, in fact copy each other's mate choice. This involves experiments with mirrors, fake male guppies attached to sticks.The book is mainly concerned with the issues of animal culture and animal teaching. It came out in the year 2000 - and the subject has exploded since then, with many new publications. As fellow reviewer Herbert Gintis says, it is rather strange that Dugatkin makes no mention of: \\"The Evolution of Culture in Animals\\" by John Tyler Bonner from 1983 - which is an important previous landmark in this area.There are some studies relating to human mate choice in the book as well, but that isn't the focus. The book is pretty well written and readable. However, the topic involves a lot of descriptions of scientific experiments - which is an intrinsically dry subject area for many. You have to be pretty interested in the topic to want to read the book. Fortunately the topic is a key issue in biology, so there will be some who are interested.There's a chapter on defining culture - where Dugatkin endorses the definition of Boyd and Richerson from 1985 that confines culture to information transmitted by imitation and teaching - and excludes other forms of social learning. I don't really approve of defining culture that way - but defining culture remains a controversial issue.The book has a whole chapter on memes, which serves to put the author's ideas in context. A few months before his book was published, Dugatkin published a \\"counterpoint\\" to Susan Blackmore's Scientific American article titled \\"The power of memes\\" which was called: \\"Animals Imitate, Too\\". One of the flaws of Susan's book was that it was very human-centric. It played down the abilities of animals to imitate - and positioned memes as the factor that had transformed beasts into men. Memes did do that - but it is important to note that animals have cultural transmission - and thus memes - too.Here is what Dugatkin wrote in that response article:\\"In my work as a behavioral ecologist I have run across dozens of other examples of animal behavior that fit the definition of a meme, and I would not be surprised if the total number were quite large. Memes may be older and more fundamental to biological evolution than Blackmore or anyone else has argued to date. More specifically, the difference between animal and human memes may be quantitative rather than qualitative. Memeticists may well take hold of the idea that animal memes are real and use this to bolster the claim that memes truly are a universally important force in evolution. But if memes do not separate us from animals, as Blackmore suggests, then they alone cannot explain why human culture is uniquely advanced.\\"The chapter in the book on memes is pretty good. Dugatkin closes by quoting Dawkins on the power of memes (the bit where Dawkins says that memes may leave genes panting behind)- and then he says:\\"Memes may have the power that this quotation implies, but even so, the more profound point is that they may be older and more fundamental than Dawkins, Blackmore or anyone else has tended to think.\\"That pretty neatly encaspulates the main theme of the book - that culture is an ancient and ubiquitous phenomenon in the animal kingdom. These days, there's even evidence for cultural transmission among small insects like ants and flies- which have pretty limited cognition.I think it is fair to say that Dugatkin's ideas about memes have withstood the test of time. We can now see that memes are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, just as Dugatkin claimed that they were.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Imitation Factor, The ...

With 6 years of training in feminist theory, I would personally consider myself competent to write a concise summary of an important author or term in this field; I'm sure my peers feel the same. Second, I think it's telling that Mr. Anderson is so upset that Simone de Beauvoir's relationship with Sartre is not a large part of the entry on this writer. Certainly, the indebtedness to existential thought is acknowledged in the entry, and since the encyclopedia is focused on contributions to feminist theory, I see no reason why de Beauvoir's personal relationships should receive the attention instead of her intellectual grounding. I also find it hard to imagine anyone being disturbed by an entry on Sartre for say, &quot;An Encyclopedia of Philosophical Thought&quot; that failed to mention de Beauvoir.Personally, I have found this reference volume invaluable for checking the history of sometimes ambiguous terms, not to mention useful as a bibliographic source."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","review":"Mit der Bildung einer feministischen literarischen Forschung besonders seit den 70er Jahrenentwickelte sich nicht nur ein erweiterter Begriff von Literaturgeschichtsschreibung(1) sondernauch eine zum Teil neue, stark reflektierte Begrifflichkeit(2).

Historically, it is a must read for anyone studying world history and the story of King Leopold and his influence at the Berlin conference of 1884-85 is a fascinating side note to the events and political infighting that eventually would lead to the first World War.

He had previously written \\"The Czar's Soliloquy,\\" a vicious satire on Nicholas II's rule purportedly from the czar's own perspective; this uses the same device for Belgium's Leopold, cutting to the very heart of his brutal Congo rule. Though less well-known than some later events, Leopold's Congo reign is one of modern history's saddest events - an unimaginably horrific time of murder, exploitation, racism, and more. The events behind it were part of the lead up to World War I and are generally the kind of history everyone should know, lest it happen again. Twain was one of several world figures to denounce Leopold, most famously here. The work is hard to categorize; though a fictional soliloquy, it is filled with facts and is historically and biographically plausible. It is a good place for anyone wanting to know more about the event to start, though it helps to have some knowledge before reading. The piece is important as a rare example of literature having a very real effect on world problems, as it played a significant role in leading to reform, and it still has great historical value. However, it is also sadly still relevant; colonialism, racism, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and the other unsavory traits leading to Leopold's rule unfortunately remain, and this work will be powerful as long as they do. Twain bitterly denounces intolerance, religious hypocrisy, imperialism, and other evils more heart-wrenchingly here than anywhere else, which truly says much. Few works have more fire and venom; it brims with the vitriol of a deeply stirred soul. This is also a good example of the cynical misanthropy infusing the later Twain. Even at third-hand in this semi-fictional guise, even after more than a century, the bare recital of Leopold's crimes is almost painful to even read; almost no one who has ever lived can even imagine what it must have been like to actually suffer through them. The soliloquy is so viscerally powerful that I had to take several breaks from reading and was tempted to take more; it indeed took a considerable effort to finish. An enduring triumph to Twain's deep-rooted humanitarianism, this is satire and political writing at its best. Anyone even remotely interested in Twain or the Congo Free State must of course read it, but so should everyone. Works of such insight and fervor are very rare and should be a part of the collective conscience. It is available in collections - such as Library of America's Tales, Sketches, Speeches, and Essays 1891-1910 - but well worth reading in itself."},{"Title":"King Leopold's Soliloquy","review":"In Billy Joel's song _We Didn't Start the Fire_, there are a lot of lyrics that seem nonsensical unless you can get a hold of a written copy of the lyrics.

When I was younger I just thought that that was a key word for a generalized dislike of all imperialism.Naturally, as a product of the American school system, I did not have my earlier ideas refuted. I have learned only tangentially of the horrors that stands behind the idea of what \\"Belgians in the Congo\\" really means. It means more than imperialism. What it means is one of the first stabs at genocide in the world, decimating the people of central Africa to take advantage of the natural resources.King Leopold of Belgium's reign in the Congo was lamentable for many, and a point of inspitation for too many. The actions taken prefigured a bloody twentieth century where the powerful make the powerless submit or be disfigured or killed. As one of the main human rights issues of the time (as the nineteenth century turned into the twentieth), not just King Leopold was at fault, but the entire industrialized was complicit in allowing its continuance.Twain saw the hypocrisy in allowing this to continue, and penned this fine text against the atrocities of the Congo. He takes the persona of King Leopold himself, embattled by the reformers who wish him to change. By taking this voice, or master satirist shows why he in many ways is still the conscious of our country. The argument is made with such force I wanted to go out and do what I could to stop them, even if they are too far away to reverse.The Soliloquy itself is short, and padded out with extra explanatory detail and historical context the book is still under a hundred pages. I read through it quickly and enjoyed the contextual material. I might search out more of this untold history, but nothing can have the voice Twain gives Leopold."},{"Title":"King Leopold's Soliloquy","review":"The front cover of the printing I have (International Publishers, New York, 1961) is so relevant even now. You see a picture of a cross, over a machete, over a black background. And, above it all, a Crown.Twain's genius, so superior to that of John Conrad in the racist \\"Heart of Darkness\\", is reflected in his use of the the main character's own defense to effectively hang himself. Twain manages to provide many factual examples of actual reports of abuses without casting off his fiction-writer robes. Well done.

Only after they suffer The Crash. After that, a few of them might become familiar with the legacy of Alice Miller...I am so surprised. Fifteen years ago I read Oscar Wilde's most profound, confessional book. But like the rest of mankind I was blind and did not see the obvious. Today I reread my notes of a 1943 Spanish translation of De Profundis and couldn't believe how much I have changed since 1995.I discovered Alice Miller in 2002. Her books changed my life. These days I reread a newer, albeit identical copy of De Profundis that was at my family's library and a whole new Wildean universe emerged. How could I have read Wilde in the dark before the transforming experience that represented Miller?The real title that Wilde chose for this letter-book was Epistola in Carcere et Vinculis. It is a shame that, although Wilde constantly mentions in this epistle to his former boyfriend Alfred Douglas, \\"Bosie\\", that he would soon make it reach Bosie's very hands, Wilde never dared to deliver De Profundis to him.Wilde's De Profundis is actually two books inside one cover: an accusative and self-accusative epistle and a soul-searching incursion unrelated to Bosie, where Wilde writes page upon page about \\"Christ\\". All of this idealization of Jesus only reflects Wilde's literary and artistic mind, who always strove to look for beauty. But there's something real in his spiritual quest. Unlike the Greek gods the new religion includes pain, the key to open the door to know oneself. It's pain what made Wilde's soul to flower at prison. Wilde met deep pain doing hard labor: it was there where he had to go though the agonies of losing the right to see his children forever (Wilde also lost his personal library; and felt like a zoo animal when exposed, with his prison uniform, at a train station before a laughing crowd). When I hit Wilde's phrase \\"And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful thing\\" I couldn't help but remember how, when I was still a minor and lost everything--my family, my career and even my mind--, a high school pseudo-friend mocked at me.What struck me the most in this second, mature reading of De Profundis is that through his turbulent conflict with Bosie Wilde behaved like a pathetic dumb. While Wilde fully acknowledges the dumbness, he fails to confess that the reason for extreme dumbness is Eros, or rather, a sort of pathological Eros. Sex is the giant piece missing in the puzzle in De Profundis.More serious is that Wilde never developed a good amount of hatred. He lived under the sky of regarding as highly sinful the legitimate feelings of hatred. Hence he could never really break away from Bosie, not even after he was released from prison!Thanks to Miller, I realized that hate, not acting-out hatred but legit hate, is the way out of unhealthy relationships and entanglements. Susan Forward has also written books about the legit hatred we must feel toward our abusive parents before being capable of breaking away from a hellish relationship with our partner. Let me quote the words of Andreas Wirs&eacute;n, a Swede lover of literature whose life also was transfigured by Miller:\\"That the author is secretly smuggling out and reworking, often lying about and numbing, their abusive emotional childhood is something Alice Miller tends to imply when dealing with works of art, a mode of thinking we as her readers easily slip into, isn't it? That Kafka's work is basically explainable as artistic dramatization of a child's insecurity about his parents true agenda, that the vampiric women of Baudelaire's poems are in fact his emotionally unavailable and seductive mother... --this is still the only opening to Baudelaire's work I can stand, the only way in which I can read his work with interest. In this way, artistic work after Alice Miller demands a new openness and consciousness in the producer. We can't only chew and chew the unworked-through emotions from our childhood and find creative ways of repackaging them, then call it Art. It's a new game now.\\" (end of Wirs&eacute;n quote)Of course, Wilde lived before Miller was born. Following Miller I surmise that Wilde must have had an abusive childhood. It's the only way to explain why he allowed to be treated so grotesquely bad by his destructive pseudo-ephebe lover (\\"pseudoephebe\\" I say since Bosie was no longer an adolescent when he met Wilde).In a mere book-review I cannot introduce the revolutionary psychological views of Miller. I devoted the third book of my unpublished Hojas Susurrantes series to it. Here I am writing for those who have already read, and assimilated, Miller. Miller readers will readily understand why Wilde's very repetitive phrase in De Profundis \\"your noble father\\" only reflects that Wilde was immersed in poisonous pedagogy.Bosie never had what Miller calls an \\"enlightened witness\\", although he seems to have looked very hard for it in the fatherly person of Wilde. I cannot blame Wilde because very few souls, if any, had an enlightened witness in 19th century England. Had Wilde been Bosie's witness, he would have recommended him to write a long, vindictive letter to his abusive father, just what Kafka would do in 1919 (what Sue Forward recommends to her psychotherapy clients). But throughout De Profundis it is clear that both Wilde and Bosie were absolutely clueless about the nature of the problem. Wilde even reproaches Bosie for trying to expose publicly the abusive behavior of Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensberry.Wilde himself never had an enlightened witness. In fact, his death was virtually a suicide since, once released from prison, Wilde drank a lot, including absinthe, and died prematurely at forty-six.Likewise, Bosie never found an enlightened witness. In fact, after Wilde died Bosie married and abused his only child, Raymond, so badly that he schizophrenized him. I find it scandalous that psychotherapist Daniel Mackler claims having assimilated Miller and, at the same time, he buries his head deep into the sand as to the schizophrenogenic-parent theory, as I rebuke him in a YouTube video. Coward or pseudo-readers of Miller aside, it's remarkable to what extent deep psychology has advanced since Wilde's De Profundis written in 1897 and Miller's most comprehensive book, Breaking Down the Wall of Silence, published a hundred years later, in 1997.Unlike Andreas Wirs&eacute;n, I am no lover of literature. However, I loved those splendid passages in De Profundis that reminded me Solzhenitsyn's chapter \\"The Soul and the Barbed Wire\\" in his immortal Gulag. Wilde's De Profundis is probably the best in-depth, soul-surfing text that could be written by the end of the 19th century. But there's no question that we need a 21st century writer that advances the Miller paradigm further; for instance, by analyzing the great figures in literature under \\"the new game\\" that Wirs&eacute;n talks about above.At the end of the unabridged De Profundis (the available texts I've seen in the net are censored) Wilde blew up everything by writing to the very one who ruined his life in conciliatory terms, and even suggesting he would met Bosie after leaving prison! Again, the fundamental sin of pre-Millerian humans is the prohibition to hate, say, as I openly hate Teresa.Final note about my first reading of De Profundis:Yesterday I read my 1995 handwritten notes within my old copy. I wrote those notes seven years before my inner transformation took place.It does not cease to strike me my former blindness in psychologicis. During my first reading of De Profundis I didn't see anything of what is crystal-clear to me by now. Fifteen years ago I almost blamed myself, following Wilde's own words, for my former hatred toward those who destroyed my life during my teens. Following Wilde, I also blamed myself for the many soliloquies I had had in my vain efforts to process the pain.Now I know that due processing of the pain can only come with the advent of a true enlightened witness, or, alternatively, when we find that witness after doing an emotional contact with our inner child. This happened to me after reading Miller: a witness that neither poor Wilde nor poor Bosie had."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"I purchased this item for school and when it came in the mail, I knew I was going to have problems.

There is some of it that is mordantly hilarious."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"I usually avoid reading writers' biographies or letters to their loved ones, especially those published posthumously. I am sure some people dream of the time when their lives are open to scrutiny by legions of readers, when their private confessions are published in neat volumes, and their witty letters to friends have little footnotes explaining the inside-jokes to the uninitiated. But the thought makes me cringe, and in the spirit of the old saying &quot;do onto others&quot;, I have never before ventured into someone's exposed private life.Last summer though, I came across this letter by accident and found myself unable to stop reading it until I was done. The glimpse into someone's vulnerable privacy was intoxicating. Having read (and loved) &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;The Ideal Husband&quot;, and other light pieces, or even &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot;--a more somber but still very controlled story, I was shocked by this letter--tortured by emotion and so uneven--by the same author.The previous reviewer mentioned that he found the letter somewhat contrived. But the insincerity makes it all the more fascinating ! Not even the insincerity in itself, but the bits where the true emotion bursts through. I could imagine so vividly the great author, the person of wit and fashion, stripped of the glamor, in jail, trying to clear up his name in the public letter to his lover. He starts out with calm and controlled prose, trying to put his Christian-repentance-and-forgiveness scheme on paper... And, I am sure, he believes the things he plans to write. However, as he gets deeper into the narrative, as his pen takes a hold of him, he starts writing what he did not mean--the truth, full of bile and unrequited passion. In a while he notices it and collects himself, and the prose becomes controlled and witty and intellectual. But he is in jail, the time for writing is precious and does not permit the luxury of extensive editing. It lets soul nudity that would normally be edited out remain to seduce shamless readers like me.It is not only the breakaway emotion that I found so compelling in the letter. It is also the very alternating nature of the narrative--from the polished and righteous to the true and base, and back. Is it not how our mind always works: how it thinks what we wish it to think and then breaks away to find something deeper in us, until we catch it and put it back to its proper controlled place...There is a long and intricate novel hidden in this letter. It is a story of the rise and fall of a great man, of the universally human desire and its treacherous waters, of stoicism and weakness, of the fine society and jailed outcasts, and we see it through the eyes of the main hero who actually lived. It is presented fully on meager ninety pages. Wilde was a genius indeed."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"I agree that this is a book that should be read by all and I do not deny the great emotional intensity with which it is written. For these two reasons and the very nature of the work, it certainly merits a 5 star rating. However, my primary criticism is that I was discomforted with an underlying feeling of insincerity when I read the words Wilde wrote to Douglas. I do believe that the circumstances were as Wilde listed, but I did not feel that Wilde was as forgiving as he depicted himself to be, nor made as independent by the time in prison. I wondered if, after his release, he really was able to be happy without all the pleasures and indulgences he had known in life before his sentence; if his compromised social status was honestly no longer of importance to him. The lesson he claimed in humility were repeatedly contradicted with his own claim to genius and superiority. And though he claimed to have always wanted out of his involvement with Douglas (and I beleive he did) and that he had now found the strength to resist him, I felt quite certain that he wanted nothing more than Douglas' return to him. All of this aside, however, the letter still makes for an interesting study in the human emotion under almost inhumane conditions and should be read for such. Whether his feelings were authentic and carried on into his life, likewise contribute to the intrigue of the expressions. He wrote what he surely believed to be true at the time and that alone is worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"This is quite possibly one of the most profound pieces of literature ever written.

This really does deserve to be more widely read - very few people I know had heard of it."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"De Profundis is truly Oscar Wilde's best work. Written as a letter to Bosie, it contains his thoughts on his past life, his trial, and his future; it is full of intense emotion. If you are really interested in Wilde and his life, read De Profundis, it gives you a complete understanding of the metamorphosis he underwent while in Reading."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"One of the most famous - and infamous - letters in all of literature, De Profundis is a strange little piece of work: either much more than it appears on the surface, or much less. It is something I think everyone should read, if only for its insight into the human character, particularly that of one under great personal suffering. Wilde wrote this extraordinarily long letter from prison to Lord Alfred Douglas, his friend, lover, and the man who - by all accounts - was the reason Wilde was in jail in the first place. Despite repeated assertions in the first few pages alone to the contrary, Wilde seems reluctant to blame himself. He clearly blames Douglas to the hilt, and harbors a certain bitter resentment towards him. And yet... he clearly still hold much dear affection toward - and even loves - Douglas. He still seems to be asking for forgiveness - despite the fact that, by all accounts hardly excluding his own, he was the man wronged. It is quite clear from reading this letter that, desite the view history holds of him, Wilde was clearly a man of very high moral character. Certainly, one would not put Wilde atop a pedastal as the zenith of ethics - he himself says that morals contain \\"absolutely nothing\\" for him, and clearly admits - and is proud of - his having lived the high life to the hilt during his youth - but Wilde was a man of principles, and he stuck to those principles to the tragic, bitter end. Perhaps you might say he carried them too far. One gets the sense in reading this letter - or a biography of Wilde - that, not only could he have stopped his immiment imprisonment, but could have severed his ties with Douglas completely - had he wanted to. Apparently, he had his own utterly compelling reasons for not doing so. Whatever the case, Oscar Wilde is one of the most fundamentally and perpetually interesting characters in the whole of history. A self-described man of paradoxes - Wilde was subsequently the true essence of his time, while also being far ahead of his time - De Profundis makes for required reading by one of the most endlessly fascinating individuals you'll ever read about, and also provides a startling - indeed, perhaps too much so - insight into human nature.De Profundis, though long for a letter, is not a long work in the conventional sense. Consequently, as many editions of Wilde's collected works are available, buying this on its own may be deemed questionable. I highly reccommend purchasing a Collected Works of Oscar if you have not done so already - it's well worth the price - but, should you desire to have more compact editions of specific works, an edition such as this will be privy to your needs."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"However pretty this edition of Wilde's long letter to Bosie from prison may be, it is unfortunately a truncated half-text (popular in the first half of the 20th century no doubt because of legal and literary sensitivities towards Bosie [who survived Wilde by more than 40 years] and the Douglas family); but, that past, I assure you, the full text is the necessary read -- and may be found in a pricier Penguin edition. This is not a letter for a collector of epigrams and opens not with the abridged \\"Suffering is one long moment\\" paragraph but rather with the far more poignant appeal of a man wounded by and starved for the company and the society he in large part created -- \\"After long and fruitless waiting\\" -- and he wants to hear from Bosie (and never will).I have read this letter a dozen times -- each reading leaves me, like Coleridge's Mariner, a wiser and a sadder man the following morn."},{"Title":"De profundis,","review":"Written as a letter to Bosie, De Profundis shows an author at the peak of his powers, yet tragically already fallen. Anger, disgust, revulsion, joy, reflection - in many ways a total separation from the glib and cocky literature that made him famous - the full gamut of a humbled man. Even missing the cheeky humor and quick turn of phrase there is still a solid thread of consistency entombed in De Profundis, that of salvation. From the grace evident in his fairy tales to the recognition of inner justice in Dorian Gray, Wilde flirted with the themes of the Divine and of sacrifice.

This book is part of the series &quot;Cultures of the World&quot; which summarize the highlights of societies and cultures for the majority of countries around the world. After a successful first edition this book is one of the early books in the second edition, which has been revised and expanded. Various political changes such as the North American Free Trade Agreement are noted and related to those aspects of society and culture that they affect or influence. The book also contains many vivid colour photos which help increase awareness of the flavour of Mexico.One technique which the authors use particularly well is to take time to explain things that many readers might bypass as obvious. In the Environment Chapter, new to the second edition, they note that air pollution in Mexico City area has not decreased even though the Mexican Government has designated 'No Driving Days by license plate numbers to restrict vehicle use.How can this be? Simply because the vast majority of Mexican drivers are wealthy, rather than middle class, so they purchase a second vehicle to circumvent the restrictions, something that many readers might overlook.Although the book &quot;Mexico&quot; and the series &quot;Cultures of the World' are officially listed as 'juvenile literature' that should not scare others away. This book, unlike some juvenile literature, does not talk down to the reader. While it does not delve into depths of Mexican philosophy or ideology, such topics are quite different requiring quite different kinds of books. Aside from secondary school students, the book can be useful to travellers, both pleasure and business, as well as enjoyable to anyone seeking an overview of Mexico.Perhaps the authors could have expanded discussion of Mexico's pre-Columbian civilizations somewhat including notation that several different cultures had written languages as discussed by Andrew Robinson in the book &quot;Lost Languages&quot; but unknown to many.The only substantial suggestion I could offer concerns the large size and somewhat high price of the book. If the publishers produced a smaller size paperbook edition, many more readers could buy the book, carry it with them, and appreciate it"},{"Title":"Pipe Welding Procedures","review":"I found this book to be very well written with a good attention to details that can aid in making the learning process smoother.

He can thereby engage in therapy because he likes to do so, because he enjoys helping others help themselves.\\"RET \\"begins with a premise that for the individual to achieve a fundamental change in his personality structure, he must significantly modify some of his deep-seated and long-standing cognitions and beliefs.\\""},{"Title":"Tom Blake: Surfing 1922-1932","review":"These are marvelous pictures of a time that is barely imaginable --Tom Blake looks like god......his photos of he and Duke Kahanamoku and Tom's girlfriend are classics and priceless. Great slices-of-time surfing at Waikiki.....presented in a beautiful hardcover. Soon to be out of print....save in the limited edition - joe t. of surfbooks.com"},{"Title":"Tom Blake: Surfing 1922-1932","review":"Tom Blake Surfing: 1922-1932 presents a selection of Blake's photographs that define a period in surfing, a period of innovation and rediscovery of surfing's ancient Hawaiian roots. Blake's invention, the paddleboard, stands beside the heavier redwood boards of the period and provides a striking contrast in shape and weight. These lighter boards created a controversy when Blake paddled them to easy victories in races. They were clearly a quantum leap for surfboard design. Interestingly enough, the Blake innovation--hollowing surfboards--is still used today with balsa boards. In addition, if you have been to a beach in the summer and noticed the large wood boards atop rescue vehicles, you have seen the Tom Blake design at work to this day. The photographs, laid out in a eye-pleasing format on very fine paper, allow the reader to, as it were, review a unique period of history seen by few until this time and lived by few during that period, since history covering this time period usually focuses on the Roaring Twenties. Here the Roaring Waves provide another view of the Roaring Twenties, a view of life in California and Hawaii at once wholesome and relaxed. If readers look closely at the themes presented here in the photographs, they will discover the breadth of experience Tom Blake had at this time and later. To illustrate, Tom Blake was a stunt man for Hollywood, an inventor, a champion swimmer, a champion paddler, a historian and replicator of ancient Hawaiian surfboards, a phototgrapher...and more. What an impressive list for any man. Gary Lynch and Tom Adler have forever preserved an important bit of surfing history. Their hard work and attention to detail show in the informative Foreward and the explanatory notes at the end of the book. Only Blake's own notations appear on the photographs, allowing viewers to make observations on their own. This book is one of my treasured possessions."},{"Title":"Tom Blake: Surfing 1922-1932","review":"Gary Lynch and Tom Adler have put together a book to expose Tom Blake to the general public. After a brief foreward that introduces us to Tom, we are supplied with images of a man that will immortalize him. Tom Blake was not an ordinary man or surfer. He was an innovative inventor that changed the pastime of surfing. A pictorial history of Blake is followed with thumbnails of the pictures and brief/succinct notes. I enjoyed the variety of the images and the emphasis on the &quot;beach life.&quot; Blake obviously lived cleanly and simply. His life was directed by a force of nature that was compelling for him. The pictures are inspiring. It is a recollection of a time when surfing was simple. Yet, Blake, the man, was anything but the common thinker or surfer.

The play was written in 1946, and the oppression of the Hebrews in Egypt serves as a vehicle for examining the injustice for the Jews of Fry's day."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I remember I loved reading Tom Sawyer when I was a kid and I continued reading him in college. So when I started reading this, I had high expectations - not disappointed. This story is waaaaay ahead of its time in terms of morality and the social order. There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless. Do yourself a favor and read this book because its highly entertaining, very humorous, and definitely an excellent read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, is one of my all time choices, an incredible tale full of imagination , funny situations , magic and amazing adventures, is funny how our hero brings to King Arthur court all the inventions , ocupations, and culture from XX century and how all the knigths and the population in a very entertaining way for the reader, assume the whole way of life supposed to be achieved in our culture centuries ahead and all that with a hilarious normality. you can find also very interesting situations in wich King Arthur is involved because of his relation with the main character, definitelly you have to read this book , this is the kind of ligth literature we all should be used entertaining with , all parets must show their kids what is good and bad literature and recommend masterpieces like this"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book, \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court\\" by Mark Twain was very intriguing to read. The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel.

This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this book, a man named Hank Morgan is transported from the 19th century to the Dark Ages. He lives there for about a decade living a full and exciting life. He gets by using his wits, courage, common sense and 19th century knowledge to survive. A war takes place, and England is left in ruins. Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey. Well before the reader finishes \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" they will know why Mark Twain is often spoken of as the \\"Voice of America itself\\" and considered among the very greatest storytellers in all of History. Selecting the \\"Best\\" or the \\"Most Enjoyable\\" of Mark Twain's many, many writings would be a task as hopeless as picking the prettiest photograph ever taken anywhere along the Mississippi River.

Not any more. And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hank Morgan is hit in the head with a crowbar in the 19th century and wakes up int he Middle Ages.

This book was anything but. It's nothing more than a 400 page rant about how evil wealthy people are, in contrast to the inherent goodness of the oppressed poor. He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hi everyone!

This is not a lie at all: I fell asleep with the book open on my lap!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books.

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A fellow from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut finds himself back in early medieval England, specifically in King Arthur's Court. Our protagonist revolutionizes their society be introducing them to the printing press, the bicycle, and socialism, among other things. The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts. It provides insights into changes over a period of 30 years."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a wonderful story with clever twist all the way through it. Hank, the main character, manages to go back in time to the year 513. Hank then goes about the business of trying to modernize a soceity that seem to want to resist any improvement. Although the main objective of the story is Hank's attempt to modernize Britian, he has some pretty wacky adventures along the way. From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series.

In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave.

A good read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too.

He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation.

For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life.

It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life. Twain makes some interesting commentary on technology, honor, and human nature with characters that cross a millenium."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small.

What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot.

As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there?

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home. Quite accurate!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time.

They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't. The characters were unrealistic; they would not be in the same mood for 5 minutes.

I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point.

There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ.

The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;. Another reason I don't like this book is that it is to hard to know what is really going on and who is speaking in the book.

The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first.

I usually get involved in books, but for this book I was utterly oblivious."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist.

If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels.

In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain.

Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such.

However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought.

The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility. He also points out how the tyranny of England in Arthur's time continued on 1300 years later. The book will make you laugh and will also make you examine the myths that people take as fact today"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge.

The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends.

The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period. He is faced with a lot of these incidents like going to war.It takes place in the nine tenth century in Camelot. I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Classic Mark Twain, this is another of his books I have had on my reading list for a long time. It is a great read, quite hysterical and yet poignant too. If you like Twain and have not read this one.......put it on you list."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My absolute favorite novel always find something new to love every time. Five stars for creativity, depth, and witty humor. Love, love, love. :)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I enjoy Mark Twain. He was one of America's best authors of yesteryear. For those who like humor, and good literature this is a must read"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Fanciful. Like I have said before, it is an example of the diversity of Mark Twain's many interests and his imagination."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is still hilarious. I reread it for the first time since high school. I don't know how much of the political and human satire I understood then; I hope it was a lot. Now it's much richer. The description of riding in the countryside in full armor is a peach!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Bin Crosby should have read this book. The action and adventure was so much better than anything Hollywood had created. Mark Twain was absolutely totally into theArthurian legend, However, his animus toward the Catholic really came through. I have no idea why he hated the first Church."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It's a bit of a tedious read,but there are many aspects which seem to foretell the current state of the world in general. Twain seems to be a bit anti-religious,by sniping at the ills caused by the Catholic belief in the Divine Right of Kings. Other social ills are expored,such as the caste system in medieval England."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain classic. Great book. My fourteen year old daughter loves it. I loved it forty years ago. I'm going to reread it when she is done."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A \\"must read\\" for my son's Honors English class! I love it as a classic - he enjoyed it as a classic cross between his love for scy-fi and medieval stories. I'm glad it was available on Kindle for his last-minute reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I adore everything Mark Twain ever wrote, but \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is my favorite, not just of Twain's, but of all books. I've bought and read 'til the pages are falling out, replaced and read again, etc. I'm very happy to have it on my Kindle now so I can read it anytime I like, no matter where I happen to be. Twain's wit and craftiness with the backhands just has yet to be topped. I still sit and laugh out loud while reading this. Just the perfect book in every way."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the first book by Twain I've read.

(Didnt have the heart to tell the teacher, I was taking, what I knew from the Movie staring Bing Crosby) I think, one reason why it took me so long to pick it up and actual READ IT, was that it has small print and is always a thick book.

Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency...

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I remembered reading this a teen and wanted it for my Kindle, especially since it was a freebie.

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me. Worth reading, but I wish I had skimmed more passages than I did!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is amusing in some of the same ways that Captain Stormfieldis amusing. A modern man of the time is placed in a different, strange,setting, and gets to make humorous observations about the natives,locals, functionaries and authority figures.Here, the device is time travel, plonking a 19th century American in the middle of a fantasy version of King Arthur's court."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hank Morgan is a typical Connecticut resident living in the late eighteen-hundreds. He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I really liked this book very much. I never have had my mind go so crazy before. It was like having a movie play in your head and it was great. I would recomend this to anyone who loves to read Mark Twain!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it.

The end made up for alot of the book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I am a true fan of the King Arthor legands and of the writings of Mark Twain, but this novel does not meet up to either things. Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story. I wish that I could have enjoyed this more, but there was little to make me love it"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain spoils a promising premise with bloated preachifying, colorless prose, and an uneven, nigh-absurdist plot arc."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"Mark Twain was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri, in 1835, and died at Redding, Connecticut, in 1910.\\" He is well known for the great humoristic writings through \\"a miscellany of history, all balanced by his most complex narrative.\\" On his fourth travel book, Life on the Mississippi (1883), he deliberately described the tension surrounding of his life as well as the events history that was happening. His vivid working inspired and kept me on the edge from reading chapter after chapter."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a good book.Read it.IT RULES!(haha just kidding,but it was pretty good.)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read the book, &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.&quot; This is about a middle-aged man from Connecticut in the 19th century. He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.) This is a classic and it should be familiar to all well-educated individuals."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I was very suprised by the complexity of this book.

It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard. If you've read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, you'll enjoy this, or even if you haven't, you should try A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review [...]*"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I did not think this was a good book at all. I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery. Besides that, many things in this book are too unrealistic and not well thought out in my opinion."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My kids love the Arthur and Merlin stories. We have read T. H. White's \\"Sword in the Stone\\" many timesThe Sword in the Stoneas a family.This book pokes the Arthur legends, and pokes them, and turns them over and gives them their due, and then pokes them again. And again. The satire is simply wonderful -- twice as good if you have read Thomas Malory and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.The section on breaking the enchantment on the well, with the sensational German-sounding incantations, was wonderful. The whole book was entirely enjoyable.Little kids won't get this, unless you are willing to read it all together. Better for big kids.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else? The ending is not particularly uplifting, which is too bad...I like my books to end on a happy note.

Hi dad!: 101 cartoons","review":"Before my daughter was born, I had read many books about newborns and how they change your life. Fortunately, my daughter was a relative angel; it was a rare occasion when she cried in the night, her regular hours were from 9AM to 9PM. Therefore, when I read this book, I found it difficult to relate to the cartoons that depicted a whiny, crying baby that keeps you up all night.However, I did relate to the other ones, especially those about how having a child completely changes your perspective. When you go anywhere, you think about the child and whatever you are doing, you switch back to being a parent at a certain time of the day or night.Parenting is one of the most joyous things you can ever do, and I confess that I do miss the days of dirty diapers, carrying and feeding a baby and singing to her.

It is an acknowledged fact that Duke Ellington's arrangements were tailored to highlight the individuality of his musicians. It is said that he often labelled the parts with the names of the musicians rather than the instrument they played. Whether that is true or not, it is true to say that having established a particular sound early in the band's life, Ellington subsequently attempted to choose replacement musicians who could reproduce and enhance that sound.Kurt Diedrich's book \\"Duke's Bones\\" takes a very thorough in-depth look at the various trombonists who passed through the band at different stages. By making a special study of three trombonists \\"Tricky Sam\\" Nanton - the plunger expert, Juan Tizol - valve trombonist and composer and Lawrence Brown, the virtuoso soloist, Diedrich sets the scene for a broader view of other members of the trombone section. The book contains detailed musical examples of solos and effects and, although of primary interest to trombonists, would be relevant to anyone who wishes to have a better understanding of the Duke's special way of using his musicians."},{"Title":"The Art of Management: Insights from an Employee's Perspective","review":"Having been in the business world for nearly 30 years, in a high level position, I have made the mistake in my belief that I know it all and that managements ideas for a company are always the best way.

Mr Blencoe has given us a new look into this from their perspective and I wish I had read this book 20 years ago. There are many books of this type that push the same old tired ideas from managements point of view. This one is different and I highly recommend it for any manager who needs a refresher course in postive management.

Reading his book reminded me of the years that I spent as a regular employee, and how I wanted to be, if I were ever able to climb that corporate ladder. Mr. Blencoe reminds us to never forget how important our employees are, and that they can make you or break you with every transaction they encouter. Also, his ideas on proffit sharing and employee motivation are innovative and well thought out. Reading this book actually left me wondering, &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot;I recommend this book to anyone who wants to succeed as a manager, whether you are a Fortune 500 CEO or the store manager of a local pizza parlor.

Respect is often missing in old style management philosophy.

A truly moral tale."},{"Title":"Marianne Moore: A Literary Life","review":"This book is quite informative -- the author has clearly done solid and serious research for many years to write such a book. However, the book is incredibly boring -- it has no through-line, no plot, just chronological plodding through year after year without any sense of how to tell a story, much less write one. The style is extremely uneven and at times just pure aggravation. He actually uses words like \\"ignorable,\\" a word that is not in my Webster's Unabridged but that obviously means easily ignored, but after the fiftieth such term it does become difficult to ignore such awkward neologisms.Still, if you are interested in Moore, this book is the best place to start. He is right about everything where her critics are just a pack of psychotic feminist goofballs for the most part -- one book uses the term \\"anti-bourgeois\\" 123 times in 120 pages. Moore was for the Vietnam War, voted for Nixon and went to church twice a week. She spent her entire life in devotion to Christ. You won't find that out from reading her critics, who instead draft her into the feminist war on men. While Moore did think women should have the right to vote, she was also against any kind of self-righteousness and was very conservative, and long before Nixon had supported Taft and Hoover. She is also anti-feminist in many ways: Molesworth quotes her:\\"If there is any advantage in dress, it is on the side of woman; ... women are no longer debarred from professions that are open to men, and if one cares to be femininely lazy, traditions of the past still afford shelter\\" (162).Molesworth gets his facts straight and is right about the major themes of Moore's life, and this part of his book is pure pleasure. This is a great biography in terms of research and details, but very poor in terms of plot line, and readability. I've read about ten books on Moore, and this is far and away the best one. You get a good picture of her, while in most of the criticism you get willfully and woefully inaccurate depictions of her in which the authors simply don't care at all to present the truth. Molesworth really does care to present the truth as he sees it, and he has struggled hard to get to it. Thank heavens there is one useful book to get at this difficult, charming, incredibly ingenious poet. Set aside 60 hours to read it, it's about as difficult to read as anything I've read since Hegel, but he hews close to the facts, and has a very strong mind for understanding Moore's philosophy, religion, and temperament. He just has so many facts, and they don't seem to be well-organized, and sometimes you have to reread a paragraph three times to figure out what he was trying to say, as he can move from talking about her brother, to a poem, to a check she got, to her interest in the Presbyterian religion all in one sentence. Check out this sentence, literally chosen at random (there are some that I could find that are much worse):\\"The poem [The Plumet Basilisk], by treating his enemies as Iscariot-like, implicitly compares Hoover to Christ; this may well be the result of Mrs. Moore's influence, though Moore's own political views in this period are strongly conservative\\" (259).The author is extremely familiar with all the vast currents of modernism and intimately familiar with the work of Williams, Eliot, Stevens, H.D., and not only with their poetics, but with where their money came from, and who they were sleeping with. This is a really useful book that I took one star away from for its awkward prose, but I am so grateful that it exists that I gave it 4 stars and would advise anybody interested in Moore to skip the lit-crit and just go straight to this book. The lit-crit is not only terribly written but is just entirely wrong-headed and for the most unable to deal with this paradoxically avant-garde conservative Christian."},{"Title":"Marianne Moore: A Literary Life","review":"Because he didn't get permission to quote from Marianne Moore's family correspondence, and because she led an outwardly uneventful life, Charles Molesworth falls into the trap of more or less paraphrasing from Moore's letters to tell her story, leaving some of the big questions about this unlikely Modernist nearly untouched. He doesn't seem to see anything unusual in Moore's relationship with her mother, who she lived with for the first 60 years of her life and whose letters and sayings became such a rich source for her poems. He doesn't examine why Moore chose to be a lifelong spinster, or attracted so much interest among Greenwich Village's hard-living bohemians. Even her religious convictions are taken for granted, without much consideration of how her faith shaped her distinctive views of life and art.I wish Molesworth had looked for more creative, less literary sources on Moore: maybe parishioners from her church, or her nieces, or people who worked with her adored older brother, Warner. A more inspired reading of the poems might have helped round out the picture, too: you kind of wonder what all those aloof and armored animals that walk through her poems say about her life. This book's a little too content to take Moore and her family at their own valuation, where I hoped to see beyond the careful surface and learn more about the sources of her poetry. Helpful for sketching the outlines of Moore's life, but it left me looking for another book to add depth and texture."},{"Title":"Rachel's Cry: Prayer of Lament and Rebirth of Hope","review":"Rachel's Cry; Prayer of Lament and Rebirth of Hope, by Billman and Migliore, seeks to recover the biblical tradition of lament and protest, and exemplify its importance in one's spiritual life, especially for those who grieve while facing irrational suffering. The biblical figure Rachel is seen as metaphor \\"of the wholeness of prayer and spirituality that needs to be reclaimed by Christians today.\\" Rachel's cry, her laminations, &quot;need to be reclaimed in Christian prayer, the liturgy of the church, and pastoral ministry.\\" The prayer of lament is the \\"unsettling tradition of prayer that includes expressions of complaint, anger, grief, despair and protest to God,\\" found throughout the Bible, most often in the Psalms. One who did not believe in God could not have written these laments; they are honest, open conversations with a living, listening, God. The prayer of lament can co-exists with the prayer of praise and joy; in fact, it must if those that suffer are to be honest with them and with God. \\"How can the prayer of lament be free and joyful if the realities of broken human life are not named and lamented?\\" Lament adds to the wholeness of Christian life, and has its place with praise and thanksgiving in a holistic understanding of prayer.

The river provides a very long journey with lots of passages and several unknown elements, as it sits within a jungle habitat.It is a true story about Jeffrey Tayler's experience traveling down this expansive river starting on a barge vessel, yet not flocked with tourists. Rather, the barge transports native people from one village to another, and carries merchants who wish to sell and barter their goods (even livestock) with the people who live on the river's edge. As he approaches these on shore communities, Mr. Tayler acknowledges the many homes built on stilts, while a vast jungle encompasses the river, as well as village settings.From the beginning, because this river is disregarded by foreign travelers, Mr. Tayler is generally misunderstood as to why he is there. He appears to be a man out of his element (a white man), whom most all believe him to be scouting the river either to rape the country of it's diamond and mineral mines, or has he come to snatch and enslave people living there, as that is all these people have known of foreign white man to do. Many river people of Zaire were killed or used as slaves. With that in regard, whenever a person on the river bank would see this white man on his river journey, the typical instinct would be to capture him. Even though several natives tried, they were unable to take him from a guard/companion on the barge who would warn the natives trying to capture him with lots of fire power, which quickly turned them around to where they came from. Down the river, even cannibals exhist. But having a river guide knowing of their location would save this white man from a tragic ending!As Mr. Tayler continued down the river there came a time for him to leave the barge and purchase himself a Zairian made canoue called a 'pirogue'. As well, due to his white skin color, it was vital to his life that he hire a river guide and an armed guard for his protection.(Often times I wondered why he just didn't cover his skin with dark shoe polish).This is a true story. If you are interested in sociology, adventure, travel, history and people who live in a jungle on a river in Africa, then I recommend this book to you highly, and I doubt you will be disappointed with his fascinating, exotic journey!Thank you, Jeffrey Tayler!"},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I got through this book very fast, because I just had to keep reading to find out what happened next. If you love all things Africa or just like to read about a different kind of travel, read this book. I really like how the author was not ignorant to life and politics in the Congo, as can so often happen with travel books.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, but that's just me. Overall, a great book that won't take you long to read."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Tayler's subtitle puts it in perspective.This is the story of a modern traveler taking on a part of the Congo River in recent times, the bigger story is its comparison with Joseph Conrad's \\"The Heart of Darkness\\". Conrad's 1890's short novel sets the stage for Tayler's update of conditions in equatorial Congo. Without Conrad's work, Tayler's book is merely an interesting travel adventure.

Tayler never forgets that he is traveling this river looking at its inhabitants with Western lenses. For the reader looking for adventure, this book is full-flavored. For a fellow and perhaps struggling writer, Tayler's words speak a priceless and empathetic language. But what makes the book most successful is that it speaks to anyone who has lived, loved, and searched for that missing piece, realizing it can always be found in the journey. It is travel writing at its best, full of observations and rhetorical questions presented to the reader as writing's greatest gift."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Tayler's writing has hitherto (mainly in the pages of &lt;i>The Atlantic&lt;/i>) dealt mostly with Russia. Now he is branching out and proving himself a worthy successor, if not to Conrad and Naipaul, to the Robert Kaplan's and Paul Theroux's of the world. This book essentially starts with the author's self-dare: What's the most dangerous, outlandish journey I could possibly make? How about a trip of the blood vein of the world's most dangerous and unstable region, Central Africa? This self-discussion is accounted for in the book, and it gives the book a buccaneer quality. But this is a real and honest account of what's really going on in Africa (namely in the waning days of Mobuto's Zaire, now known again as Conrad and the Belgians knew it, The Congo). It is sad to see a just how much as nation has degenerated in the 30 years since the end of colonization. But it is refreshing to see a young author treat the subject so honestly."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I was deeply impressed by the honesty of this writer. Jeffrey Tayler embarked on a journey that he seemed to recognize from the outset as being one primarily of self-discovery. Adventure, certainly, plays a role in his story--whoever thinks that opportunity for danger and exploration ceased sometime in the late 19th century should read this book--but it was Tayler's struggles with his rationale for taking the trip, his efforts to relate to people he meets and travels with, and his remarkably objective take on his place as a comparatively wealthy white man in the midst of desperately poor people with a long history of abuse and oppression by European cultures that really make this book stand out. I know of nothing more uncomfortable than being seen as an opportunity for material advancement (perhaps not so different from how women must feel at times), particularly when there is some truth to the situation--any western traveler in a developing country, no matter how &quot;shoe-string&quot; your budget has so much more than the majority of the people around you. Tayler gives a better, and more honest, sense of this sensation than any other travel writer I've read. Writers like Chatwin or Theroux were/are remarkable observers, but there's an honesty that seems to be missing from their accounts about what it's really like. Tayler has this honesty in spades."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I love travel books, and this one didn't let me down. I loved the fact that this book wasn't sugar coated. I felt he was telling the true grit of his experience in the Congo. I bought this book because the cover drew me in, and boy was I surprised by how it held me in it's grips to the end. I had nightmares about this book, and I still catch my self thinking about Desi and the other characters. If you love non-fiction travel books, like A Walk in the Woods, without the comedy, you'll love Facing the Congo."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"A great read for anyone interested in adventure travel or Central Africa. Tayler chronicles his travels along the 1,100 plus mile Congo river in Zaire, and his personal journey to find meaning in his existence.Demonstrating laudatory courage, Tayler navigates the dangers of the Congo (e.g., weather, disease, beasts, banditry, corruption, etc.), first up-river as passenger on a barge, and then down-river along with two Zairean companions in his pirogue (a small wooden canoe) - a trip no mondele (i.e., white man) may have completed since the explorer Stanley (many of the several who have tried did not survive). The result is a compelling tale that provides a glimpse into Tayler's inner soul and the people of Central Africa, while also indirectly shedding light on political, economic and social issues regarding the developed and undeveloped world.An eminently enjoyable read that you are not likely to be able to put down, and one which may cause you to contemplate planning your own existential journey."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"'Facing the Congo' is a remarkable story of survival and adventure. And unlike many a travelogue, it is an exceptionally good read. American journalist and Peace Corps veteran living in Moscow, Jeffrey Tayler, reached his thirty-third year with a gnawing sense of despair. Who am I and what have I achieved in this life? Sinking into an ever-darkening pit of meaninglessness, he decided that only monumental action could lead to answers. A more monumental task than his couldn't have been found. To traverse the length of the Congo River in a dugout canoe. The second 'white' ever to attempt such madness, Henry Morton Stanley being the first.For both book and trip, Tayler sure did his homework. In the first part, Tayler's elaborations on what drove him to such a rash act are fascinating to mull over, even if not entirely believable. Lost in a malaise of trying 'to find himself,' Tayler hopes that his journey will give him a raison d'etre. One that he hasn't found in Moscow. Months of assiduous planning pass by and then d-day hits as his plane cuts through equatorial mists above the chaos of Kinshasa, Zaire.In lucid and gripping prose, Tayler takes us along as he soon finds himself in world that no amount of study could prepare him for. Beer-sotted, ganja-dazed soldiers nervously fondling their FAL rifles, shrieking vendors hawking everything from smoked monkey to palm grubs and shady, sunglassed characters of Zaire's secret police--SNIP--always demanding their 'matabitche.' Tayler does an amazing job in recreating this world of chilling chaos, where every 'mondele' is suspect. Catching a ride upriver with one of Mobotu's cronies, Tayler muses on the descent that awaits him. Either alone or with a guide, he is determined to make it.The second half, while not as insightful as the first, puts the reader right beside Tayler. The vivid descriptions of mosquito storms, giant beetles and electrocuting catfish make you marvel at Tayler's endurance. And perhaps where the narrative succeeds most is where it recreates the atmosphere of fear that haunted Tayler during the whole journey. The fruit of a murderous Belgian past comes to bear as Tayler soon realizes his white skin makes him an instant threat, an easy target. Something to be feared, hated and possibly killed.Refreshing honest, Tayler does reflect on the futility of his journey, but I kept asking for more. What drew me to the book in the first place was it's claim of self-discovery through trial. Yet, Tayler keeps you so engaged with his arduous trials that he leaves little or no space for self-reflection. Fully aware of the resentment around him on account of his color, Tayler leaves out the irony of it all. The spoiled Westerner goes to Africa to sort himself out, creating a drama where the 'mondele' directs and the locals do the dirty work.....guiding, paddling, portering, suffering, starving.....Not much has changed since Kurtz and Stanley. The lone white man willing his mission on the confused and exasperated natives, who yearn only to fill their bellies. Tayler hints at the shame he feels, but he leaves it at that. Understandable, as he too was struggling just to see the next sunrise. Yet, all the while I was waiting for 'extrapolation' (one of Tayler's favorite words) of the journey itself. Of the 'denouement' he wanted so desparately to find. Instead, he ends with a clich&eacute;d maxim: 'The best we can do is exorcise our demons through action.' True....but a little more 'extrapolation,' please.Tayler's command of language can't be questionned. He knows his stuff. The sentences flow unto each other like the river itself, carrying you to the end before you even know it. But as one reviewer hinted, Tayler opened his Roget's once too often. Whereas a simpler, more every-day vocabulary would have more than sufficed to tell his tale, Tayler bombards you with the heavy artillery. Sebaceous...carapace...zetor...pettifogging, Tayler was definitely out to prove something.Despite his occasional verbal over-kill, the author deserves our kudos. Firstly, for attempting such an insane test of will and perseverance. Secondly, for surviving it and keeping his crew in one piece. And thirdly, for writing such a gripping account of it. Not only can I highly recommend 'Facing the Congo' to all travellers--armchair or not--but also, it's a must read for those interested in putting their own private 'congos' to the page. Tayler provides a fine model on how to write a page-turning travelogue. So, grab your paddle and surrender to the river!"},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Jeffrey Tayler's account of his journey to follow in the footsteps of the British explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who sailed down the Congo in pirogues in the 1870s, is a very detailed journal of his daily trials and hardships and realizations.The detail is a bit overwhelming at times although it does provide you with a very real look at everything he encountered along the way, especially the corrupt political and military personnel. This detail does serve to dissuade anyone in his right mind from wanting to follow in his footsteps. His use of French words, in many cases untranslated, is a bit annoying to those of us who don't know French and a bit distracting from the text. I enjoyed the story he tells but not particularly the way he tells it. However, it does serve to entertain and describe a world few &quot;mondeles&quot; have seen or will ever see, or after reading his account would care to see.Tayler does come to realize some very important things that those of us who have actually traveled the world and experienced the suffering and injustices that dominate so many &quot;third-world&quot; countries can appreciate. That the world is a wonderous place, not to be exploited as a playground on which to solve our own rich-boy existential dilemnas. At the same time he gains appreciation that there is much to be learned from living, even when the lessons prove to be deeply painful."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"If you can't afford a trip to the Congo, this book is the next best thing.

The story itself, of Tayler's trip with a local guide down one of the deepest, widest and most violent rivers in possibly the world's most dangerous country, guarantees interest, but it is his honesty about his reasons for taking the trip, and his varied and surprising writing, that make it a joy to read. One moment that stuck out for me is when Tayler and his guide are camping in the brush on the bank of the Congo, which is so wide and deep it seems to have tides, and in the black of night a storm breaks out and the river \\"turns into a violent negative of itself\\" when lightning strikes. There are dozens of such moments and but reading them without the book will not do them justice.I read a lot of travelogues, and this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"This book is an intense good read.

It makes those in the western world appreciate more what they have compared to the desolation that wreaks havoc in this area of the world (in particular).It is the journey of an American living in Moscow who wants to retrace Henry Stanley's trek down the Congo River in modern day Zare. It chronicles his planning; the trip to Brazzaville, Congo; the ferry to Kinsasha, Zare; the barge up to Kisangani; and the trek back town towards Kinsasha. It chronicles the folks he met (those who helped and those who hurt), personal fears and human tragedy.There are even a few incidents of humor interjected (for those who have read the book: When Desi uses the toothpaste, the use of the shotgun, the TV show playing at the Kinsasha diner, among others).It is, as Bill Bryson describes it, an &quot;immensely gripping tale.&quot; I never found myself bored with it and was able to tackle its reading quite quickly (for me). I was actually near tears right at the end because I had become so involved with the book and its characters and I almost felt as if the tragedy was my own.I highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in either Zare (or Dem. Rep. Congo as it is today), Africa, or just likes to read a well written and intensely interesting novel."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"...at times Facing the Congo is an annoying read. I think the author is needlessly \\"wordy\\" in his writing. OK Mr. Taylor, we get it, you are a human thesaurus. Maybe I'm just being \\"saturnine,\\" who knows. The author also takes it for granted that the reader speaks French and Lingala. Many times the reader is given absolutely no clue (literal translations or indicators within the text itself) as to the meaning of French and Lingala words used.But, I still give the book four stars because the story is just that good. It is exciting and the author does a great job with imagery. I know in the future I will read Facing the Congo many times."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I found the book to be an exciting, interesting, quick read.

Long after closing this book, you will care, too, about the Colonel, Desi and all the others Tayler met along the arduous way of the river."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I just finished reading this book andBlood River: A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart, which deal with very similar journeys. And while I initially liked this book, the other was better overall.The author writes this as a kind of \\"finding himself\\" journey. He feels his life in Russia, with a wonderful girlfriend and steady job, is insufficiently challenging, and that he need to find out who he is. He settles on a pirogue (dugout canoe) journey down the Congo river as the best way to do this. In contrast to Tim Butcher's overland journey from Lake Tanganyika, Jeffrey Tayler starts out by going upriver by ferryboat, and then trying to go down river with just himself and a guide to paddle his boat. And while the journey upriver is interesting, the books starts to lag once he begins the downriver stretch. Tayler makes contact with many different characters on his trip, but too often, it seems his is more absorbed in his own thoughts than he is interested in the country of the people. He spends a great deal of time (understandably) battling homesickness and talking about his life in Russia. The language is much less colorful than that of Tim Butcher's book, and there are minimal historical asides. For example he mentions \\"water hyacinth\\" several dozen times, but I didn't learn until reading Butcher's book that the plan is actually not native to the Congo, and that eradication of the invader has been a major undertaking to preserve the navigability of the river.In short, while I enjoyed reading this book, and was intrigued enough to read more about the Congo, I felt I learned far more about the people, the history, the country, and even the author by reading Tim Butcher's book. Worth checking this one out, but there are other works that are more rewarding."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"This is an interesting story but it reads like an unfinished story. When Tayler's guide Desi falls ill the trip comes to a screeching halt. Was Desi really ill or was he merely demoralized and if so why? Or was he faking illness(he springs right back as soon as he boards the barge)? No matter. Did the author really have no choice but to abandon his quest after the first sign of trouble and danger - real or perceived? Couldn't he have procured a substitute guide at one of numerous riverine villages or a town? Didn't Henry Morton Stanley warn him enough of the dangers he would face? Was the pull of Tatyana and the crisp air of Moscow so irresistible after so many days of heat, humidity, bugs and hostilities? I was deeply disappointed at the abrupt end to the story. It is one thing for Tayler to paddle down the Congo river or any river on earth but as a reader I expected more after having followed him over 250 pages of his travelogue. Was the story worth writing? Obviously the answer to this question is 'yes' - the book is written. Was it worth reading? Here the answer is also affirmative. There is much to be gleaned from his encounters with the army, security, police and other forms of thuggery for anyone crazy enough to retrace his steps or even go beyond and actually complete it - in person. His description of the beach scene when he first arrives in Kinshasa is memorable if gut-wrenching. There is much to ponder about the glimpse of the welcome and the abundance of hostilities. Is the authhor exaggerating the latter to justify abandoning what he set out to do? And was he too paranoid to see much of the former? If nothing else the book shows the anxiety and trepidation that will surely visit a mere mortal traveler off the beaten path and the toll they take on one's psyche.Tayler's quest for traveling the length of the river both up and down is no doubt greatly facilitated by an army officer whose motives in lending him help remain mysterious. Whatever the motives, such help may have come at a price even when no money is demanded. Left to his own device Taylor may have been more motivated to reach out and connect with the fellow travelers on the way up the Congo river from whom he may have gotten a better sence of what to expect and how to prepare himself for his trip down."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"A good book. I had to put it down several times because the author's descriptions of his dealings with the Mobutu soldiers or the SNIP (Service national de investigation et protection) or just hungry people was too much for me to handle without pausing for reflecton.A better review than mine is John M.

Mr. Tayler's writing is very descriptive."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"It was very similar to a Bill Bryson book, which in my opinion is a good thing. It was easy to read, presented a lot of facts about Zaire, and was extremely descriptive when it came to dealing with the police, soldiers, custom officials, hotel accomodations etc. My only criticism is he tended to go on at length about his guide and his religious rantings. Toward the end it seemed as though he had written more about his guide and their relationship than he was about the country. Don't let that stop you from reading this book because it is full of facts which he has incorporated into his experience. I'll be ordering his other books to read them as well after reading this book. I think you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"This book was a very good read.

If you like a Walk in the Woods (without the comedy) you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I've never been to the DRC or the Congo, so I have no experience with Tayler's destination. What strikes me about his obviously contrived writing, however, is a tendency to turn tragedy, danger, and despair into some kind of carnivalesque form of entertainment. Tayler is constantly being attacked and hustled by the sweaty native Other, incessantly being haggled for money and favors. In his position of power, what is he to expect? There is an underlying colonial-style theme to his writing which places him as the observer and the Congolese as the observed. Why travel to a war-torn southern nation that is notorious for its poverty and despair because of the stated reason that you are having an identity crisis? I feel like this is purely poverty tourism. All of my travels to Africa (much of West Africa) have surprised me in that they never reek of the horror that is expressed about them in books such as these. Much of Africa consists of small, friendly, and good-willed villages that are founded on subsistence economies. The starkness of Kinshasa and the Congo river in the 1990s is quite a suspicious choice for trying to resolve an identity crisis."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Tayler's story wasn't bad, it's just that the underdeveloped Congo with its many hardships made an inferior setting compared to post-Soviet Siberia. I didn't find this recounting of his journey nearly as interesting as I did the other book by him I read earlier in the year. Tayler has guts to make these one-man trips into the wildest places on earth, and I expect someday we'll just...stop hearing from him."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I loved the first chapter of this book, the philosophizing about the brevity of life and making something of it, but once he got to Africa (Zaire), his choice of destinations seemed a poor one. Not because of the life threatening dangers, but because there seemed to be no point in facing them beyond the mere act of facing them. Lewis and Clarke had a mission. Their journals are full of awe and respect and love of what they were doing. Mr. Tayler's book lacked in these things. It was filled mostly with fear and shaking of his head at the things he encountered. Okay, there were a few moments of awe on the river, but far too few. And in the end he seems to realize that the trip was a bad idea from the start. Duh! His inability to connect to his guide, the guide's ultimate disappearance without a goodbye make me suspect his people skills there. Not to mention a strange obsession with bathing, an obsession which undermined his description of the danger for me. If one is under possible attack from machete wielding tribesmen, one is usually not that concerned with finding a private spot in which to soap up. The book does give some interesting background on the struggles being faced by the inhabitants of whatever Ziare is called today, but too often I found myself exasperated."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"I've recently become a fan of Jeffrey Tayler's writing. Having just finished \\"Angry Wind\\" I quickly ordered two more of his books, including \\"Facing the Congo.\\" It's quite a harrowing tale.In the 1990s Tayler traveled up the Congo on a freight barge to Kisangani and back down on a native canoe (pirogue). Throughout the narrative I found myself cringing at some of the descriptions and wondering why anyone would put themselves through such a trial. In retrospect it was a very foolhardy adventure. The problem was, however, once he was in the middle of it there was nothing to do but finish, dangerous though it was.Throughout the tale, Tayler's white face provokes and incites the people along the Congo River. There's no getting around it and at times his life is in real danger. One wonders, however, how he could come to some of the decisions he made. He hires a guide he barely knows, a guide whose incompetence is maddening. The guy buys a shotgun (with $300 of Tayler's money) that doesn't work, he lets his family use all the precious drinking water to do laundry and he spouts passages from the Bible and Zaire's employment law at night or while they're paddling downriver. What a nightmare.The lives of the Zaireans, in many cases, appear to be hell on earth. Their hand-to-mouth existence causes them to take desperate action, resulting in corrupt officials and military constantly angling for bribes, fellow barge passengers begging Tayler for anything, boldly demanding he give them money and food or, worse, trying to rob him, or (if they could get away with it) murder him with machetes. As a \\"mondele\\" (white man) he's seen with great suspicion about his motives but also as a bottomless source for riches. The people along the Congo can't believe he's not there to pilfer their country of diamonds so he's faced with hostile reactions everywhere he goes.The conditions on the barge are horrendous. People defecate into the river that they also use for water to drink and bathe in. They live off anything that swims or crawls, including crocodiles that get their skulls caved in, electric catfish and slimy slugs and live caterpillars consumed as snacks. Clouds of mosquitos and other insects torment them as does the never ending glare of the sun and the stifling humidity.I'm glad Tayler made this journey. His descriptions of the conditions along the Congo are quite vivid. The frustration he feels being hit up for money all the time is certainly understandable. To travel to a place like that, when he did, with $4000 hidden on his person (an absolute fortune to the Africans) can only be described as foolhardy. Thank God he survived. We, the reading public, are richer for it.Other reviewers have mentioned his tendency to squeeze too many obscure words into his prose. I agree. On the other hand, if we take the time to look them up we might learn something. I've studied a little French so his habit of slipping some of that language into the text didn't bother me. The day-to-day slog down the river from Kisangani got just a tad tedious but I'm sure it's nothing compared to actually doing it in a boat.I'd highly recommend this book. I still don't know why Mr. Tayler undertook this adventure (he's very lucky to have made it home) but, as I said, the result is a gripping story. I'm now on to another of his works, \\"Glory In a Camel's Eye.\\""},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Having lived along the Oubangui River (just a pirogue ride to Zaire) at about the same time that the author undertook his journey along the Congo, reading this brought back a lot of memories. I probably rated higher for nostalgia, so take the rating with a grain of salt. What I admired most about this book was the honesty that Mr. Tayler brought to it. He knows that he is a privileged, white (yes, it does matter) guy undertaking a journey for purely selfish interests among people who are literally dying around him that cannot understand the absurdity of the journey and he knows that he will never be able to explain it to them. I found it refreshing that this writer writes as much about his struggles each day with weighing these thoughts against the simple desire to complete the voyage. There's a lot to learn in this book about balancing one's selfish goals against the guilt that can come with the simple ability (financial and otherwise) to undertake them. The fact that he does so without the typical (I'm an RPCV, so I can say this) Peace-Corps-type bravado is refreshing. I won't give away the ending, but Mr. Tayler's decision allows him to face a lot more than the Congo."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"In the 1980s Helen Winternitz wrote &quot;East Along the Equator&quot; which chronicled her journey from Kinshasa to Kisangani by river barge. This stretch of the Congo river was probably first written about in &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot; by Henry Morton Stanley, who, in the employ of the King of Belgium, laid the foundation of the Congo Free State which inspired Conrad to write &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and the disintegration and aftermath of which became the subject of V. S. Naipaul's &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; and Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;.Now, Jeffrey Tayler in &quot;Facing the Congo&quot; tells the story of his attempt to recreate Stanley's voyage down the Congo river. He begins as did Winternitz, taking a barge up the river in the mid 1990s. As there are virtually no roads in the Congo region these river barges are the only transportation available to the average Congolese. They function as floating villages, filled with merchants who trade manufactured goods for forest products along the river route. As if that isn't enough for a book, Tayler then buys a pirogue (canoe), hires a guide, and attempts to paddle back down to where he started.&quot;Facing the Congo&quot; is an excellent record of his trip. He is a thoughtful and thought-provoking writer and as is the case with most good travel writing the book is not only a record of his voyage, but also a record of self-discovery. Especially interesting are his interactions with the Congolese people he encounters along the way: people who usually can't fathom why a foreigner would be travelling the way he is. Other writers might simply depict such encounters in a comical or stereotypical fashion; Tayler makes an honest attempt to see their world through their eyes. He even manages some sympathy for the military and secret police officials that block his path. A good choice for any armchair traveler or anyone interested in Central Africa."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"It is not often that one has the opportunity to enjoy an excellent book, and then, have the pleasure to actually meet the author. So be it: Jeffrey Tayler is currently my houseguest in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, where he began the arduous journey which resulted in \\"Facing the Congo\\" in 1995. The city has survived the devastation of civil war, 1997-2001, and is flourishing once again thanks to bountiful natural resources of timber, minerals and oil. Let's hope this will be enough to inspire Jeffrey to reprise his adventure on the Congo River and perhaps to share once again his experiences with a loyal following. A must read, not only for diplomats, travellers or tourists to the Central African region, but for the armchair \\"explorer\\" as well."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Jeffrey Taylor's book Facing the Congo gives an insight into the former-Zaire, as well as a brief view of Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. His book contributes immensely to an outsider's inside view of Zaire and how a leader by the name of Mobutu Sese Seko, along with western support, de-moralized and contributed to the present state-of-affairs in the newly renamed DRC. Jeffrey Tayler's cautious and realistic approach to the region does justice to the task that was at hand. Neither does Tayler make stereotypical assumptions, nor does he grossly inflate his story, he tells the situation as it was, and is.For people who are interested in the Central Africa region, this book is highly recommended as a nice travelogue written by a mondele who sought to travel the River Congo and document his experiences. As someone who has traveled throughout this region, I can personally say that I have had similar experiences as Jeffrey Tayler has had.For those who consider themselves 'travelogue-junkies,' this book will be a nice addition to your collection(s)and imagination(s). This book will give you plenty of sights, smells, and images to think about as you read the book, and to further think about after you put it down.Thanks Mr. Tayler for putting your experience on paper!"},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Part travelogue, part memoir, Jeffrey Tayler's Facing The Congo takes the reader on a memorable and fascinating journey into sub-Saharan Africa's crocodile waters and lush jungles, lush jungles, and a spectacular variety of merchants, deckhands, prostitutes, mothers, spiritual followers, fishermen, children, and many other assorted charecters. From lively marketplace banter to cramped, mosquito infested sleeping spaces, Facing The Congo is the story of Tayler's trip up and down the legendary Congo River complete with fog covered backwaters, hostile tribes, and true-life high adventure. Facing The Congo is thoroughly satisfying, enthusiastically recommended reading for the armchair traveler."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"In 1991, the Zairean military, unpaid for months, began rioting in the large cities, making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain medical care, or communicate with the outside world. The U.S. government evacuated all non-essential personnel, including all Peace Corps volunteers, of which I was one.Against all odds and good sense, Tayler goes to Zaire in the mid-1990s, after &quot;les pillages&quot;, and manages to equip himself and travel quite a distance down the Congo in a pirogue (dugout canoe).Zairois/Congolese don't understand the mondele (white person) desire for adventure; life alone is mpasi (hard); why tempt fate? I found the premise of this adventure crazy, having lived in the country, but we Westerners often travel to remote and dangerous places (where locals are trying to eke out an existence) in search for meaning and illumination. Heck, that's probably why I went to Zaire, too.Tayler's portrayal of the Congo and its people is accurate--it is a harsh place, full of illness and extreme poverty. But it is also a humbling place, where people who have nothing will help you find your way, and will share with you what little they have.I feel like I have taken a trip back to my old home, and I'm thankful to have read the book."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"This was an excellent book. It details the trials and tribulations of a mans journey down the navigable part of the Congo River before the fall of Zairean President Mobutu. Everything, from his experiences in the lively cities of Brazzaville, Kinshasa and Kisangani to awaiting the perils just around the curve of the river, make this an exciting read. This also gives some insight into Central African modern history and culture as well."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"This was a very quick and exciting read that gave me a terrifying picture of how foreign and dangerous travel can be in the Congo. The heat, the bugs, the angry villagers, the lawlessness, the language and cultural barriers made me appreciate the insanity and bravery of Tayler in even attempting such a journey. The one shortcoming that I found was that Tayler never tried to figure out Desi until it was too late. He often put Desi off when Desi tried to strike up conversation about religion. I often felt that Tayler viewed himself to be above trying to befriend Desi and was just wrapped up in his own psychological dilemnas to care. He needed Desi only to survive, not for companionship or friendship. There was no final coming together or bonding of the two. Desi remained aloof and distant and Tayler couldn't figure out why. Now I understand that Desi was ill (although miraculously recovered at the end) and Tayler was probably under extreme stress. However, I was hoping that despite this, the two would have forged a relationship. Sadly this has been the tradition in Africa. The white man coming to Africa in search for something, using the natives to get it, and never caring enough to return the favor or build lasting relationships. To Tayler's credit I think he does come to this realization, but only until it was too late."},{"Title":"Facing the Congo: A Modern-Day Journey into the Heart of Darkness","review":"Jeffrey Tayler isn't the first writer to follow in the footsteps of Henry Stanley, but he's penned one of the best accounts of the journey since Stanley himself.Tayler's trip up the Congo River on a freight barge and then back down in a pirogue--a native canoe--is the stuff of which epics are made. He made the trip during a time when the Democratic Republic of Congo hadn't yet fully devolved into a war-ravaged debacle of a nation, but conditions were anything but peaceful. His life was at times in danger and his tales of robberies, shakedowns, and forceful begging are enough to make the most seasoned traveler cringe.Facing The Congo is an exciting, instructive tale of travel in a country where modernity has yet to take hold.Dave Donelson, author of Heart of Diamonds: A Novel of Scandal, Love and Death in the Congo"},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"I love the book, and the class was even better!!

Buy the book, do the exercises, and if she's in an area near you offering classes, take whatever she's offering.

Why it took me so long (I don't know the exact duration, thanks to a hard drive crash in June 2007 that borked my spreadsheet; everything I was reading on June 17, 2007 has that as a starting date ever since, but I'm almost certain I started it in January 2006) is a long and terrible story that involves moving house twice, mislabeled boxes, the purchase of an ebook reader, and all kinds of other things, and is probably really boring to anyone who didn't live through it. So I'll just say that the first five chapters of my reading this book involved me owning four different copies of it. Which should tell you something. (Needless to say, every time I finally scored another copy at Half Price Books, the previous one would turn up within a week...)The basic idea here is a simple one, and mirrors that of many books of the Llewellyn stripe over the last ~40 years or thereabouts; there's as much psychology to be found here as there is magic (I've often wondered, though never more than idly, which way that influence flowed more strongly, and how much--especially in Jung), and the general aim of the book is empowerment. As you might be able to tell from the title, this book is sex-focused.(And okay, I get the note about the cover model just being a representation, but it's a representation that works pretty well. [clears throat] What was I saying?)I get the feeling that in most cases, Firefox is preaching to the choir here, but those uncomfortable with their bodies will probably be grateful for the gentle, gradual way Firefox gets to the more physical stages of the process (I couldn't help but thinking about Kathy Bates' immortal mirror scene in &lt;em>Fried Green Tomatoes&lt;/em>...). Sex and power have long been coiled up together, and many of our cultural taboos regarding sex seem rigged to prevent the rank and file from having either; Firefox aims to shatter those taboos on a personal level. It's a great idea, and I hope it works.On the other hand, also as with many Llewellyn titles I've read over the years, there's scads of repetition. Which is not at all a reason not to pick it up, but be prepared to skim about a quarter of the book, since you will have already read it earlier. This is especially true of the rituals section, which occupies that last ~1/3 of the book.Certainly for the repressed pagan/heathen/what-have-you, and I'd recommend it to those of a less New Age-y stripe as well who feel dissatisfied with the current quasi-Victorian state of moral standards; there's a great deal to like here. ***"},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"Yo he le&iacute;do la traducci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol \\"Se una bruja Sensual\\", soy de la Ciudad de M&eacute;xico y mi opini&oacute;n en verdad me parece un libro muy interesante, lleno de energ&iacute;a positiva con la finalidad de canalizarla a nuestro centro como mujeres encontrando ese poder que tanto hemos olvidado por situaciones externas, es un empuje a darnos cuenta de que existimos y somos una obra de arte, echando una mirada a nuestro interior para encontrar el ext&aacute;sis y raz&oacute;n de nuestra existencia!

I gave this 3 stars because I did not care for this book, but I can see where it would be helpful to a sexually repressed woman with a negative attitude regarding sex and sexuality. It contains some course language, but it is not used in a negative context. The author is trying to make the reader comfortable with her feminity by using the common, crude names given to the female anatomy by society-at-large.

I can see why someone thought they needed it.In the initial negative review, by Helen Le'Balnc, she expected the book to be \\"a cute and sexy entry into the annals of pagan publishing.\\" Imagine how dissapointed she was when she realized this book would stand out and, Goddess forbid, create CONTROVERSY!Of course this book will be too liberated for some. I feel a bit sorry for those people. But it is because of the pervading moralistic views in this country that this book is so necessary, and it being published in the first place a triumph for free speech. The negative reviewers here would be happiest if a book like this never got published in the first place. They are upset if paganism/wicca is portrayed as anything other than bland and impotent, \\"cute\\", nothing to worry about, nothing challenging. Thank goodness there are others who are willing to stand up to the mainstream, who are willing to \\"offend\\" and \\"disgust\\" and speak truth.Before you make up your mind about this book, think on this: \\"Well-behaved women rarely make history.\\" If these reactions are any example, this book is well on its way to making some history."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"This book allows women to review their roots, experience and find their true selves, learn how to draw upon their inner powers.

This is the worst bit of neo-paganism/feminism book I have ever read, and that says something.Also I find it interesting that negative reviews have a tendency to disappear from Amazon.. The truth is Miss Firefox has a legion of willing psychos to flag anything that speaks negatively of her book (if they can get a foothold on anything that may be a violation of the posting TOS despite the content of her book, ironically), which speaks volumes about her personality and insecurity. Go and Google her sometime. She actually instructs her fans to write good reviews and buy copies of her book all on the same day to boost her sale rating. Now that I think about it, it wouldn't at all surprise me if she was writing the good reviews herself under sock puppets - this book is that bad. At first I thought this book was an elaborate joke, but she really is this crazy.Think of every thing that annoys you about femanists and this book has them. Painting with menstrual blood? Check. Naming your vagina? Check. Writing poems to your vagina? Check. Playing with self in front of mirror because you are a crazy and lonely cat lady? Check check. If I remember correctly, she recommends making your friends and family gifts using menstrual blood[!!].. though I could be wrong. I'd have to double check that.Keep in mind, I am female and am totally comfortable with my genitalia. I don't find menstrual blood \\"icky\\" but I also don't find it fun and interesting. We bleed. Yay. Get over it. The only inclination I have when I read this book was to laugh and recoil in horror at the thought that someone somewhere will either read or thumb through this book and make the assumption that this is what being a feminist is all about. Given the press that most 'feminists' have had, this won't help. Thank you Ms. Firefox for setting women's rights back 100 years. If anyone ever gets to meet her, make sure to tell her that while running in the other direction screaming. Make sure to avoid looking her in the eyes - she might throw used tampons and cats at you.Note: This book makes for great male repellent and an even better doorstop."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"In reading this book I had high hopes that it would be about empowering women or at the very least celebrating the sexual side of womanhood.

A quick look into the library of LaSara Firefox reveals that this is her first full blown book. I will definitely be looking out for more from this author. Sexy Witch is one of the most daring, revealing, and inspiring books I have ever read. The fact that a book like this can be published proves that free speech is still a reality! Although the book does have some roughness, I give it 5 stars for what a special and unique accomplishment it is. I doubt there is any book in existence that pushes the envelope like this one. I found myself laughing out loud, and crying at some of the startling historical information. A copy of Sexy Witch on your coffee table is guaranteed to strike up some interesting conversations with your guests. Based on its contents and graphic exercises I would not be surprised to see this book banned. Sexy Witch has the potential to empower anyone who reads it. I especially like the \\"media fast\\" exercise. We all need to do this one, for our health and sanity."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"After neglecting my spiritual side for many years, I found it difficult to sort through the multitude of \\"witchcraft\\" books in the search for something genuine. I had seen Sexy Witch several times over the years, and was always curious, so I picked it up. I'm glad that I did, because it is exactly what I've been looking for in a guide to discovering my own spiritual sense.This book may not be everyone's cup of tea, but perhaps it would help to understand some of the more \\"out there\\" activities suggested. Many of the exercises seem to derive from things I have seen and done in feminist workshops on improving body image and connecting with women's spirituality. Some are reminiscent of workshops from the women's rights movement, when women examined their bodies closely to get over the intense shame and stigma associated with certain areas of the female anatomy. Because I am familiar with such explorations, and have even done some of them in the past, I did not find it shocking. Sometimes challenging, but it all made sense to me. For someone who is uncomfortable with the word \\"Feminist\\" or who is deeply affected by the social constructs this book aims to push aside, some chapters may seem too radical.Personally, I love a pagan book that is unabashedly woman-centric without being full of fluffy bunnies, \\"love spells,\\" and cliche praises to goddesses of the Greek/Roman pantheon. This guide is flexible enough to allow great freedom of expression in ritual. Even color and direction associations are open to your own interpretation, which is wonderful for witches who do not connect with common Wiccan-inspired practices. This book is all about learning to love, honor, respect, and fully own every part of yourself, which is something most women desperately need help with in our body-hating, consumerist, patriarchal society.This is the best pagan book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Five stars, and two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"to...How to be a joke to your Coven!I have read many books on Wicca, paganism, and witchcraft, and this book causes me to question the integrity of Llewellyn as a publisher-let alone the seriousness of LaSara as an author. Why did Llewellyn publish this book? And further more, why give the book the title of 'Sexy Witch'? The only reason for this title that I can see, is because of a 'sex sells' mentality. How can anyone read this book with any kind of seriousness to the subject matter when the forewords are written by porn stars. That should have been my first clue. I personally did not purchase the book; I received it as a gift. I feel very sorry for anyone who wastes hard earned money on such garbage.This book was a major disappointment and a travisty. In my opinion it does not empower women's sexuality or their self-esteem with regards to their bodies...it degrades them. Period.There are some, however, very few redeeming facets within the pages. I agree with her attempt to instill into women self-confidence and self-love. However, I do NOT agree with many of her methods.I was extremely unimpressed with the first two chapters. The writing style is atrocious at best. Chapter three, titled \`Pussy Power', left me reeling, angry, and fearful of the damage path that is possible from this tornado of destruction. How can any person, who is NOT a medical doctor, suggest that a women use a gynecological examination instrument on themselves? It completely floors me that a publisher or editor allowed this information to be printed. This exercise of can cause physical damage to the female anatomy. It also opens the publisher and author to possible lawsuits. Chapter four wasn't much better. The question that she discusses is \\"Why should I pet the Kitty?\\", and she is not talking about the feline that resides in your home. This is the type of juvenile language that LaSara uses to describe a women's anatomy that further tells this reviewer that even she is not taking her own material seriously.In reading the last half to the book, the rituals, I am once again unimpressed. I found some of the rituals to be repulsive, particularly ritual #3. I can't even imagine what my coven mates would think if I turned to light the Mother candle on our altar stating that \\"I invoke Pussy Pride\\". I would be a joke in their eyes, as LaSara and Sexy Witch is a joke in mine.I truly feel that my disgust with this particular author is her juvenile word use, and writing style. She definitely needs to find a new editor.I have to agree with a previous review by Helen Le'Blanc, not only am I disillusioned by the author, LaSara Foxfire, and the publisher, Llewellyn, I am extremely disillusioned and disappointed by the other pagan authors who have endorsed such idiocy. I for one will not purchase any further books from a publisher who promotes such irresponsibility and from the authors themselves who agree with such heinously written material.The main redeeming factor of this new book by LaSara Foxfire and Llewellyn Publishing is one that is extremely helpful on cold winter nights. I plan to use my copy of this poorly written farce as kindling for my fireplace."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"I found this book a few months ago as I scanned the shelves of my local bookstore. The title and cover caught my interest and I decided to give the book a whirl.I am happy I did, this book did something no amount of diets and praise from my family gave me. It made me love myself and shatter every negative image I have of how I look. Because of this book, I looked at myself in a completely new light.Through the creative and sometimes embarrassing exercises, I found my inner beauty as well as my outer beauty.A book I must say may push the envelope for some people. However, I found this book fun and funny. It also was very informative and helpful. It made me take a deeper look myself and not just at face value but really look at every crevice of myself. Sexy Witch made me touch, feel and taste myself to show me that I am beautiful.I may not the model type image that the media has plastered on their magazines. However, it made me realize I am beautiful.I love how this book uses art. It is through art that you begin a strong and important relationship with yourself and your sexuality.This book may not be for all but if you keep an open mind and just dive in, you will find empowerment and in time, you will see a transformation of how you see yourself.I believe this book should be in every pagan/wiccan's library, it will have a permanent place in mine. I gave a few copies of Sexy witch as a gift, my friends loved it, and they too see a difference in how they view themselves and beauty.Look past the negative reviews and try this book.This book will let you find and embrace the Sexy Witch in you."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"This book has gotten some mixed press since it came out-people seem to either love it or hate it. The people who hate it seem to have completely missed the point of the book. They either get freaked out by the frank use of euphemisms for female anatomy, or they run screaming from the idea of *gasp* getting to know the most nether regions of the female body, and all the various things it does. Additionally, uber-witches get terrified that *gasp* somebody might think witches have sex, and that sex can be a part of witchcraft!This is completely symptomatic of the body-PHOBIC mindset that \\"Sexy Witch\\" sets out to reverse.In this book I found a wealth of exercises determined to shatter the negative tunnel vision most people in America (and in many other places) have about our bodies. The author challenges us to venture into the most terrifying aspects of the female physical form, the parts that we're told are \\"dirty\\" and \\"bad\\", and become comfortable with them. We're encouraged to touch, to look, and to otherwise become familiar with our bodies in every crevice. And this is a *good* thing. Firefox has the right idea-rather than skirting around the fear we have of our bodies with pretty flowers and mincing, femmy steps, she meets it head-on fearlessly, showing the reader that there's nothing to be afraid of, and that we stand to gain much in the way of confidence and health by getting over ingrained hangups. She challenges gender stereotypes, even to the point of including a decent section on conscious crossdressing as a way to break out of one's preconceived notions.She gives plenty of material for both solitary and group work; the latter is particularly nice as it offers the reader the chance to spread body-positive thoughts. And while some may complain that the magical aspects of the book are too watered-down, keep in mind that the material is aimed not just at experienced pagans, but any woman with body issues who could use some help in getting over them.I can only wish that there was such a thing for men out there; while body issues in women are well-documented, body issues in men are often ignored. If you're a guy having trouble with your image, there won't really be much here for you to work with, though it may be worthwhile to read just to get an idea of some of the issues that woman face, and how Firefox recommends dealing with them.This is a brilliant work that deserves its controversy-it highlights body-fear, and for those brave enough to face it, Sexy Witch offers a multitude of methods for getting over it, already!"},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"I wish there were options for negative stars to assign this severely misrepresented book.The publisher and author have in my opinion done a dis-service to female sexuality and women in general just by the juvenile language used to refer to the female body throughout. There is NOTHING sacred, sexy, nor powerful in this pathetic tome, other than its power to reduce the Craft to a joke.Please, find some way to read just ONE chapter from this book before deciding for yourself. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.Good reviews and total misrepresentation are the only thing selling this joke, and they must be paid for because not one person whom I have shared this book with does anything but say \\"It would be funny if it were a joke\\" and then turn serious and say \\"Oh, just let the fundies get a look at this ridiculous farce and see how much fuel it adds to their fires!\\"Buy this book if you want to:1. Dress as a man for a week2. Bodypaint yourself menstrual blood and consume your vaginal secretions3. Hear your sacred parts referred to in all instances as you would expect a 13 year old boy in a gym locker to refer to them.4. Believe it or not, it goes DOWNHILL from here!If you want to truly deepen your sexuality and bring forth the true spirit of the Femenine Divine, LOOK ELSEWHERE.Following the path laid out in this book leads you to something between a punk rocker trying to be gross and someone in a padded room painting the walls with feces.As a special note to any non-pagan fundies reading up on this, let me assure you this twisted tripe is the exception rather than the rule. (Sort of like when some out-there fundies were busy burning people at the stake as a way of life when your core religion states \\"thou shalt not kill\\" and preaches forgiveness). This is by NO means a book to be taken seriously, and is clearly a poorly contrived attempt to market the unacceptable and ridiculous through total misrepresentation of its contents. It is unfit for kindling in a sacred fire."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back to into the bookstore, Llewellyn Publications stoops to a new low by abandoning their \\"put out anything and see what sells\\" mentality for the tried and true \\"sex sells\\" marketing strategy. This book would actually be funny if it were a joke, but even though written with a childlike \\"devil may care\\" style and attitude, it is perhaps the most dangerous and destructive book ever written on the subject of Witchcraft.I received this book several months ago as an advance promotional copy, and after glancing it over and reading the numerous blurbs from the myriad of both well-known and obscure authors; I made the Cardinal mistake of judging this book by its cover. My first impression was that it was going to be a cute and sexy entry into the annals of pagan publishing. Boy was I wrong! To begin with, it is probably one of the most badly written books I have ever read. Ms Firefoxe's abilities to communicate clearly and enjoyably with the written word are juvenile at best. Her intent was clearly to communicate sexual awareness and openness free from societal constraints, but the end result is a book that mocks and oftentimes makes a joke out of the unrestrained sexuality she is trying to promote.Lets take a close look at an early chapter in Firefoxe's book entitled Pussy Power! If you were to follow her instruction in this chapter to the letter, you would wind-up lying spread-eagle on your bed using a mirror to scry into your pussy (which now has freshly dyed pubic hair and a new name), surrounded by drawings you made of your vagina in different \\"moods\\", while reading love poems too it. I tried to imagine what would happen if I were to put myself in this situation and my husband were to unexpectedly walk into our bedroom... He would probably have me committed or serve me with divorce papers upon seeing me lying on our bed with a clown face painted on my crotch, singing a love song to it, and then, exclaiming \\"look honey! I'm practicing Witchcraft with Miss. Boo-Boo\\"! As I stated earlier, if this book were a joke it would be funny. But in reality it's plain and simply sad. Firefox even goes as far as to suggest that women perform vaginal exams on themselves with Gynecological implements. I'm no expert, but this seems like an irresponsibly haphazard and potentially dangerous suggestion for anyone who doesn't know what they're doing.Firefox would have been better off releasing this book as a primer for the aspiring porn-star rather than tying her strange brand of sexuality to her lame and uninspiring methods for ritual and magick. And speaking of ritual and magick, by the time she finally gets around to approaching these matters in any depth, the reader is subjected to Firefoxe's infantile pre-101 version of Wicca-Lite. Firefoxe's descriptions of how to perform her solitary and group sex-rituals are oftentimes so vague and devoid of substance, that it left me wondering if she had ever actually performed them herself and wasn't simply making them up as she went along. The only real magick I could find in this book was the magick of Firefoxe's deluded watered down magickal mentality. Firefox rants-and-raves throughout her book for women to throw off the sexual dogma of society and the media, and to free themselves from the chains of sexual marketing and supermodel mentality. She then OK's the cover for her book, which unashamedly displays the epitome of a slim, busty, supermodel porn star-Witch. Shame on you Firefox! She talks-the-talk, but doesn't walk-the-walk!Earlier in my review I stated that Sexy Witch was perhaps the most dangerous and destructive book ever written on the subject of Witchcraft. Why? Imagine a non-pagan/Wiccan interested in the possibility of pursuing our religion reading this book in search of more information...they would probably run away from paganism kicking and screaming! And what about spiritual society and serious religious scholars? Don't pagans and Wiccan's already have a hard enough time being taken seriously without this kind of superficial crap being presented to the public? Even worse; imagine a newbie Witch getting their hands on this book and using it as a basis for their spirituality and religion... When its all said and done, Ms. Firefox proves that she is nothing more than a pornographic Doctor Frankenstein running around creating monsters that she cannot control and holds no responsibility for.Shame on Llewellyn for caring more about $ than their readers and publishing this nonsense. Shame on Firefox for writing it, and shame on the pagan authors who offered-up blurbs to help promote it. You all lost BIG points in the respectability and credability departments with this reviewer.0 Stars for writing skills and credibility. Minus-110 Stars for the horrors that this book is capable of unleashing."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"After reviewing Amazon's policy for writing reviews, I am not surprised to see that my initial review was yanked due to 'foul language'. Imagine that...I list in quotation marks several of the author's \\"lovely\\" names for vaginas, and my review is yanked. So get a clue about the gutter language used throughout this book.There is nothing 'sexy' in this book. This book should not even have the word \\"Witch\\" in its title. This book is more about alternative sexual practices than anything to do with the Craft. We are talking alternative with a capital \\"A\\". Write love songs and love poetry to your vagina, dye your pubes, taste your vaginal secretions, play with your menstrual blood and do it all using the most foul names that you can think of to call your vagina. This is just a few of the 'lovely' rituals and exercises listed in this book.And can anyone explain to me how dressing up as a man right down to 'packing' (as it is called by the author);which consists of fake male parts attached to your under-wear, will assist me in my quest for body acceptance and female sexuality? Please....This book has set the Craft, feminism, and body acceptance back somewhere in the middle ages. I shudder to think that anyone would ever believe that this book is any kind of representation of witches. Thanks FireFox...Pagan elders have spent decades trying to put the dampers on the stereotyping of witches as sexual deviants, only to have you publish your twisted take on female sexuality, and put it out to the public as part of the Craft."},{"Title":"Sexy Witch","review":"The seller was great, but the book wasn't what I expected.

This book took place in Lily Dale, a small town in Western New York known for it's spiritualists (less than an hour from my home town, so I am familiar with some of the things she discussed in the book, which made it even more interesting)!.

Truly a great read, turn the night light on after reading this one!!"},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"In upstate New York lies the gated hamlet of Lily Dale, a quiet summer resort that is inhabited mostly by spiritualists communicating with the spirits of the dead. Fourteen years old Julia and Kristin are enjoying going trick-or-treating until they reach the Biddle home at 10 Summer Street. While there Kristin sees something there so frightening that she withdraws into herself and when her family moves away, she ends all ties to Lily Dale and Julie.Years later, an adult Kristin returns to Lily Dale to help her mother move into 10 Summer Street. Kristin is later found drowned in the nearby lake even though she was always afraid of water. When Kristen's mother dies, Kristen's daughter Dulcie and the child's father Paine move in to 10 Summer Street so they can prepare the house for sale. Julia, who is now a spiritualist of considerable power, vows to find out the secrets of 10 Summer Street so what happened to Kristen won't happen to her daughter.Fans of Peter Straub and Stephen King will definitely enjoy reading IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, a work that is equal parts horror and suspense. Wendy Corsi Staub is a superb writer who creates characters that the audience cares about and places them in a tale that starts out at supersonic speed and only gains momentum with each page turned. The finale is shocking and suspenseful leaving the reader feeling that they got their money's worth and more.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"The very real hamlet of Lily Dale, New York, known as a center of spiritualism is the setting for this story.Two young girls, Kristin and Julia are not immune to the spiritual energy that is radiated throughout their community. One Halloween, the girls, then in their teens make a stop at their neighbors', the Biddles, home on 10 Summer Street. Kristin apparently witnesses an apparition that terrified her to the point of silence. She would never disclose the sight that terrified her in that home.Years later, Kristin has died under mysterious conditions, leaving behind a boyfriend and 6-year-old daughter, Dulcinea (Dulcie). Themes of vision are rampant throughout the book; Dulcie is blinded after a bout with meningitis at age 3. She can \\"see\\" Kristin and other spirits who have passed; once she and her father, Paine, return to Lily Dale from California Dulcie is the receipient of many strange visions indeed.Even Dulcie's name reinforces the visual theme. Dulcinea is the vision of the ideal woman in literature; her very spiritual sensitivity and heightened awareness suggests that her name is very a propos indeed. Lovable, bright and verbally precocious, Dulcie manages to find a permanent place in the hearts of most people who encounter her. Yet...Was Kristin killed? If so, by whom? And who killed Iris, the former owner of 10 Summer Street? What REALLY brought Paine and Dulcie to Lily Dale from California? Who can they trust?This masterfully written book is very compelling indeed and the characters will remain in the memories of all who read this book. The series of mysteries are interlocked; each one segues into the next.

Upon arriving in town spooky things begin happening in the house, Dulcie who has adegenerative disease that took her eyesight can see images that seeing people can't see and has conversations with them. Julia befriends the father and child during this difficult time. She is the childhood friend of Kristin and many years ago this house frighten her and she had bitter arguments with her motherover purchasing the house. The Town Lily dale also is a character in this book. It is a town that does exist for the paranormal community. These are physics who can reach the other side and people flock to this town to connect with lost loved ones. Staub brings the town to life but doesn't force the readers to believe in ghosts. She gives you the story and lets you make your own decisions. The mystery is able to stand on its own merits without needing any supporting plots. Not only did Kristin die under mysterious circumstances, another girl of similar age was shipped off to boarding school never to be seen again. Staub weaves thesestories together and it becomes a read you can't put down as you read just one more chapter. The only thing I found wrong with this plot was the introduction of a character that could have a link to the missing girl (don't want to give anything away here) and two people who roam the county looking for ghosts.

The story is exciting and mysterious. The characters are well developed and appealing, and the heroine is a nice, normal, sensible woman (in spite of being a spiritual medium). One of the things I really enjoy about Staub's writing is that you really get a good idea of the setting of the story. This book is set in the real New York town of Lily Dale, a historic town that has been a center for spiritualists since Victorian times, and from the descriptions of the people, the houses, the businesses and restaurants, I feel like I have been there. Another thing I find refreshing about this author is that her books, while centered around female protaganists, are not romance stories. I emphatically agree with the reviewer \\"Book Maven\\": romantic cliches really annoy me too, and I waste a lot of time and money buying books, only to find that what looks like a thriller is really a Harlequin in disguise.

My first book by Staub was Fade to Black, which I picked up not knowing anything about the author. Since then, I have read several of her books and have yet been disappointed. I do not think you will be either."},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"Reading this book was a pleasure for me since Wendy Corsi Staub is from the same city as I am and that I too have visited Lily Dale also. This book just draws you right in, while explaining Lily Dale and any part of Western New York to a T. I recommend this for anyone interested in spiritualism."},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"This book was not a page-turner, but it was entertaining. I liked the characters and the story-line but I thought the suspense was lacking until the end of book. And, having recently lost someone to cancer, I found the Nan/Rupert story-line sad &amp; depressing. Other than that the book was good."},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"I have read this author in the past, and I like her style. Her plots are always interesting, if not a little far-fetched. This was one of her better books because she developed the characters so well. Even the dead girl, Kristin, is portrayed with familiarity and distinctive character traits. I found the main character, Julia, to be a little pathetic. Here she's supposed to be the sensible one and she can't see that the guy she's dating is a creep? He was sort of a pointless addition to the cast, but I think he was included in the story to provide the reader with another suspect. Rupert was a very confusing character. He will walk on a bed of nails for his wife, who's dying of cancer, but he doesn't seem to care about his daughter, whom he so easily discarded from his life. I would think a man who loves his wife as much as he does would have an equal love for his own child. However, overall, I thought it was entertaining and fun to read."},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"This was my first read by this author but won't be my last. I happened to pick it up because of the title and cover. When I read the synopsis on the back and the prologue, I was hooked. I couldn't wait to read it. I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. The main characters were very likable. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the style of writing. Personally, I prefer past-tense writing rather than present tense. I'll have to check out her other books to see if it's typical of this author. Also, the killer's reasons for, well, killing, are a bit unbelievable. I won't give anything away here. And lastly, by reading this book I can tell that she grew up in that area because she mentions a popular local supermarket, and all the other times she goes into great detail about what the characters bought and at what stores. Not necessary. I found it a bit irritating and I live in Western New York. But those are personal preferences and shouldn't deter anyone from checking out this good read."},{"Title":"In The Blink Of An Eye","review":"Wonderful book, very suspenseful, could not put it down."},{"Title":"Chelkash And Other Stories","review":"Chelkash is a very deep story, which involves a thief named Chelkash and a young man on he finds on the street and hires. The story focuses on the use of the ocean to reflect moods and events as well as the importance of money in our society. The story leads one to question how far one would go for money. The book is much deeper than the story. One must take the time to think about it before the meaning becomes clear or one can simply enjoy the story which is a page turner."},{"Title":"Chelkash And Other Stories","review":"I recently picked up a Dover Thrift Edition of Maxim Gorky's Chelkash And Other Stories. This slim book only contains three tales- the title tale, Makar Chudra, and Twenty-Six Men And A Girl. What struck me was that Gorky's style was quite different from the pre-Chekhovians like Leo Tostoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Nikolai Gogol. This modernity is evident in the very first lines of the titular tale, which follows the title character- a vagrant, and his young \`understudy' Gavrila through a series of adventures that bonds the two men before fate rend them from each other. The basic crux of the tale is how far should a person go simply for money....Gorky's reputation has suffered in and outside of Russia due to his relationship with the 1917 Russian Revolution, but whether or not he was a good man is beside the point. These tales, at least, display he was a talented writer, and a worthy successor to Anton Chekhov and his predecessors in the Russian short story."},{"Title":"Chelkash And Other Stories","review":"I recently picked up a Dover Thrift Edition of Maxim Gorky's Chelkash And Other Stories.

The characters are very interesting and appealing. I really liked all of them and they have an authentic air about them. It is a supernatural thriller, but the supernatural elements are understandable and sometimes mirror things we're familiar with. The progression of the story was smooth and it kept moving at a nice pace. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I love thrillers and I love paranormal thrillers even more. Joseph Nassise delivers a faced paced thriller filled with paranormal/supernatural suspense and drama. And to add to the appeal, he uses the Templar Knights to drive his tale. The Templar Knights, gave a mystical feel to the whole book, adding a depth that draws you into the twisted turn of events that lead to a satisfying finish.Cade, the main character, has to identify and locate a supernatural enemy know as the Adversary. An enemy he has already tangled with once before, which resulted in him having a few supernatural abilities himself. Cade leads a team of Templar Knights dedicated to protecting mankind from exactly this kind of danger.Excellent read, can't wait to start the second book, A Scream of Angels."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"...and keeps going up to and including the very last page.This is one of the fastest paced urban fantasy novels that I've ever read, if not THE fastest. This is a thrill-ride from start to finish. Whereas most urban fantasies are fantasies flavored with detective fiction, this one is fantasy flavored with intense military thriller fiction. But the characters are still well rounded and believeable, which something that can sometimes suffer in more fast paced books. That was NOT the case here.Also, Mr. Nassise's writing is incredibly cinematic and the action scenes were top notch. This was a great read and I will definitely be picking up more of Mr. Nassise's work."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The Heretic is a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride of a book. Joseph Nassise has certainly followed the advice to writers to \\"create conflict on every page,\\" because he continually raises the stakes for his characters. I really enjoyed the dynamic between the semi-agnostic Templar Cade who is willing to do anything to get the job done, and the choirboy Duncan, who is a lot more tied up in the Rule and the regulations of what he \\"should\\" do. That, to me, made the book much more enjoyable than just the plot.No point recapping the plot points here, let's just go over the facts of the book - the characters are strong, and we get enough backstory to understand their motivations without drowning in it. We get a taste of what makes the guys tick, and that makes us want to keep reading the series. We get a little hint of resolution, so the book can work as a stand-alone, but there's enough unresolved that we want to read more. I think it's a great opening to a series and am looking forward to the next one!"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This book is a book about the Knights Templar, a religious order. Because of that, I didn't expect to like it.But I was wrong! It's actually closer to the Stony Man series of books (spin-off of Executioner) about a secret special military strike force who is only called in as a last resort for extreme situations. With psychic powers, demons, and the undead mixed in for fun.In this book, the Templars still exist in modern day, and their job is to protect humanity from supernatural (presumably Satanic) forces. Although they're a religious order, the book isn't religious or preachy at all. As someone who doesn't follow the faith of the Templars, I still found it quite enjoyable. In fact, I'd say that some of the supernatural ideas in the book are quite extra-biblical. In fact, the main character, though a Templar himself, struggles frequently with his faith.The author knows how to write and create tension, as well as interesting characters and situations. I'll definitely be reading part 2."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"Good versus evil, the timeless battle, is part of what makes a superb urban fantasy.

I cannot wait to read the next in the series, A SCREAM OF ANGELS and A TEAR IN THE SKY.Five amazing more Cade and Echo Team please sparkly diamonds..."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This book reads like a blockbuster movie. Filled to the brim with great scenes of relentless action and wonderful set pieces, Joe Nassise tells a story that is as exciting as it is unique. A modern day SWAT team in the name of the vatican, out to track and destroy supernatural menaces. How much cooler can the genre get? And Nassise delivers by the spadefuls.But don't let the full-throttle, high-octane story mislead you. There is still plenty of character development and moments of reflection in here that give the story depth and root it firmly in the realm of believability.I had a blast with \\"The Heretic\\" and I think Cade is a cool character to boot. I shall now proceed to read the sequel, \\"A Scream of Angels\\""},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The author threw himself on the 'Templar beat' in order to make some money. I picked the book because I like to learn more on the subject. I was dead wrong. If I remember correctly there is 1 historical reference. The rest is just action - and not that good written either (several holes that I would like explained). Page turner, but not good enough for me to buy the remaining 2 books in the series.Cut short: if you like supernatural thrillers without any historical references; read this book. If you prefer your Templar related histories with a bit more historical references, skip it."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I don't actually own the kindle version, but I do own the hardcover. Originally it was one of those books I picked up because it was cheap. I was surprised when I started reading it and found it to be a real interesting story; then ultimately bummed when I found out it was part of a series I couldn't finish because it wasn't available in English. Well now the wait is over and you don't want to miss out. If you enjoy thrillers and templar mythology then don't hesitate. It's thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The sample chapter got me as it was well written, and I thought this was a great story idea, but the rest of the writing went downhill from there. For the most part the storyline was pretty gripping, but there were some problems with the Kindle version. It has difficult to read text, the sections run together, and the book is desperately, screamingly in need of a professional edit for grammar, style, and content mistakes. Lots of misplaced and misused words, weak transitions, and the analogies were embarrassingly, laughingly amateurish. About half-way through it seemed the author was rushing to finish it. (I know I was.) Poor sentence constructions and poor character development round out this book. When I saw the good reviews I thought I might be reading a different book, but I wasn't. I don't think I'll be reading the rest of the books if this is any indication of writing style. I wish I could leave a better review, but I can't, because I don't understand how the writer would leave this book in the Kindle library in its present state and charge for it."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I read Joseph Nassise's Riverwatch and liked it when the book first came out four years ago. It had an innovative twist on an old theme and I had some hopes for the author. I'm not quite sure where he went, but Nassise stopped as quickly as hi started. When I found that he had finally released another book, I snapped it up and found that the author had changed his style considerably over the years, but that he could still write an interesting story.Something is eating the modern Knights Templar, one commandery at a time. They have survived vindictive suppression by the Catholic Church, remaining hidden until modern times when they reunited with the church and become the militant arm of the church's defense against evil. Now, something that comes in the night can breach the defenses of a stronghold and entirely destroy the entire garrison, almost as if they were completely helpless. The remains left behind are badly mauled, clawed, and bitten. Something is playing for keeps.It was time to bring in Cade Williams and his troops. Cade is the kind of Templar who scares other Templars. He is violent, secretive, and pursuing a vengeance all his own. Badly scarred with an encounter with a demon, he recovered to discover the he had hidden talents - he could see the past of any object on touching it - whether he wanted to or not. And he can cross to the other side of reality. Now he has to find who is destroying the commanderies and why. And then put a stop to it while there are still Templars left in the US.What he finds is a nest of necromancers, allied with the same demon that murdered his wife and destroyed his face. He calls it The Adversary, and all he seeks is its destruction. They are hunting relics, sacred objects that will let them conquer the world. If Cade doesn't find the key to the puzzle the world will be enslaved. This task may be too hard for Cade Williams and his small army of loyal knights.As you can tell this is something of a potboiler of a novel. Something is always going on whether it is supernatural or military action. With guns blazing and spells going off you can imagine that character development isn't a strong point. But since this is to become a series, Nassise has the time to make Cade into something more than a killing machine over time. This is a good start, and it will be fun to see where it goes."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"A little bit of special-ops military, a little paranormal, a lot of great action.

There's definitely room for improvement in the area of organization and layout, but it was a decent page-turner (something I really value in a book)."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I read the sample and thought this book would focus more on the organization. Instead, it's about Cade and his elite squad of hunters. But once I made the adjustment, the book isn't too bad. The plot is a bit cliche and it relies a lot of deus ex machina, but if all you are looking for is a mindless, bloody story, it works.I wish there had been more character development, though. There are hints of character in Cade and the others, but those hints are brushed aside in favor of \\"more kill!\\" Maybe this will be addressed in later books; maybe it won't.Overall, this is the kind of book you want to take on vacation."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I found the premise of a modern day, SWAT team Knights Templar interesting.The story picks up pace quickly and maintains the tension throughout.

Some you could forgive...others made no sense at all."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"If I could give this a zero, I would. Bad enough that the author rips off Katherine Kurtz's much better Adept series and combines it with a bunch of characters straight out of a Rambo movie. If he'd turned it into his own thing, that would have been fine. But he didn't. Instead, we get a mishmash of medieval Templar and modern military hierarchy that makes no sense (\\"Sergeants\\" in the Templar Rule were distinct from \\"Knights\\" and therefore, the rank of \\"Knight Sergeant\\" is an oxymoron). We also get the same tired old plotline of the Templars fighting the good fight against slavering, one-dimensional occult forces that are about as frightening as a Care Bear. The author tells us that Cade loved his wife and is a good Templar knight (apparently, Nassise tossed the original Templar vow of chastity right out the window). Yet, we see Cade break the Templar Rule right and left: killing a Christian in the very first scene, disobeying orders, leaving quarters without permission, mouthing off to his superiors, all things that would have got a medieval Templar expelled from the Order. He mopes about his wife, but we never really see what made the two of them so happy together in the first place. We're constantly beaten over the head with what a great hero and leader Cade is, yet what we get is your garden-variety, jerk-off \\"maverick\\" who treats his men like crap. It makes them look stupid and didn't make me care about any of them. The only vaguely interesting character, Duncan, has an ability that he never uses for reasons that he never explains. So, why introduce it in Book One in the first place? Yes, that's right, folks--this is part one of a series. You don't even get a complete story for your seven bucks and change.A few scenes show potential--particularly the interrogation of the Revenant, Stone's death and Cade and Duncan's travel through the Limbo place. Gabbi's helping Cade from beyond the grave, though way to deus-ex-machinaey, does raise some intriguing possibilities with an otherwise cannon-fodder character. Unfortunately, the author torpedoes all possible mood or momentum with some truly godawful writing--passive verbs, single-sentence paragraphs, incomplete sentences, important scenes (like Stone's death) told at a distance in flashback. You name it; each page is full of it. Whoever edited this book was asleep at the switch.It's a shame, because I really like the idea of Templar fiction and always hope to see more on the market. Unfortunately, the reality too often consists of bad research and bad writing that is so derivative of other stories that it takes all of the fun out of it. Give this one a miss; read Kurtz instead. She delivers."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"Trapped by the sample into buying. It is not a case of bad editing, just fizzles as a thriller. Nothing to keep you reading. No depth to characters.

For years, historical novels and conspiracy theories have been bedfellows in the realm of fiction. The Knights Templar have been a subject of debate for nearly a millenium, and no one has a corner on this market.Joseph Nassise mixes elements of Stephen Lawhead's \\"The Iron Lance\\" and James Byron Huggins' \\"Cain,\\" and gives us a superna tural thriller laced with history, fantasy, and horror. Though his writing is descriptive, it never bogs down, and instead leads us on a fast-paced journey into modern Templars and a battle over a holy relic. Cade Williams is the Commander of Echo Team, a group committed to secrecy in their work for the Vatican. Cade, though, is a man wrestling with his own faith after his wife's passing. His exploits are legendary, but his methods unorthodox. He's a great lead for a series such as the Templar Chronicles. His partners are stereotypical, yet functional, sidekicks.There's not much that's new here, yet the blend of old standbys gives \\"Heretic\\" a second wind. This is straight-ahead, no-frills, lots-of-fun, storytelling. The superna tural elements are vivid, sometimes horrific, and memorable. Even as \\"Heretic\\" deals with issues of faith, it never allows those questions to derail it from entertaining and from churning the plot toward a pyrotechnic conclusion. Thankfully, some loose ends are left open for a sequel. I, for one, would jump in line for such a book."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This book surprised me. I loved it.

His wife was killed, and he suffers both from physical wounds and a faith that is fractured almost beyond repair. He joins the Knights Templar, an order of men dedicated to protecting the unsuspecting populace from all sorts of supernatural threats. But Cade's special abilities and unorthodox methods earn him the distrust of his fellows and a name the Heretic. Distrust him they might, but when the demons come calling, Cade Williams is the man for the job.After 7 long years, this new case offers Cade a new lead on the entity that destroyed everything he had ever cared for. When his supposedly dead wife also appears in the picture, he questions himself and his faith as never before. So, what's more important - the order's mission or revenge?I don't think \\"urban fantasy\\" is the right name for this work or the genre it represents. A \\"supernatural thriller\\" is more like it.

Chapter 10 says 5 years. Rest of story says 7. Also at Chapter 10 the formatting changes to italics, making it hard to read.Next, at the end of the Heretic, Duncan saves Olsen by pulling out a piece of glass, but now in the second book, he says it is a piece of pipe.The story is good, but sometimes the details need to be caught by a proofreader. The formatting needs to be consistent to make it easier to read. I purchased the three stories together to make it easier to read them all. I'm not done, but so far these details are repeatedly wrong."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"Always eager to explore the writing of a new author, I \\"borrowed\\" this e-book from the Kindle Library.The author seems to spend more time forcing himself to give detailed descriptions of the environs of his characters and descriptions of individuals than concentrating on the story being told.It is a good story, and he holds true to the storyline however there were moments that reading the book, the writing felt stilted and forced.Having read the first in this author's series for free through the Kindle library, I'm very likely to pay to read the next book in his series when I finished the other books I'm currently enjoying."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I downloaded this book as a free promotion from EReader Newsday. It's not the kind of book I would usually read, but it was free, so I thought I would give it a try. After the first chapter, I was hooked! Nassise has created a character, Cade Williams, that immediately attracts the reader and makes you want to know more. The writing style is definitely \\"male military adventure,\\" and there's an occasional awkwardly chosen word or turn of phrase, but overall, it was well written, the characters are believable and interesting, and the premise (what would the Templar Knights be like in the modern-day world) is unusual and, I thought, well presented. I liked it enough to buy the other two books in the series."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"Joseph Nassise's Templar Chronicles series features a modern-day Knights Templar organization that battles the supernatural bad guys of the world. Its hero, Cade Williams, is a member of the Templars but has an uncanny reputation among the order for his psychic abilities. The Heretic is the first in the series and revolves around a cabal of sorcerers who is attacking Templar commanderies, slaughtering the members, and desecrating the cemeteries in search of a holy relic. Cade and his unit are assigned to the problem. The Heretic could be described as urban fantasy by way of a paramilitary/religious thriller.As is apropos for a thriller, The Heretic includes a lot of action and tough-guy heroics. There's also a great deal of gore, so the weak of stomach need not apply.Unfortunately, character development is sparse. There are only two women in the book; one of them is horribly murdered before the plot begins and the other is horribly murdered early in the book. Perhaps a Templar-focused novel was destined to be a sausage fest, but I can't say the men fare much better. There are more of them, but they're not well developed. Cade is given a touch of humanity by his grief for his late wife, but this is mentioned only in a few key scenes. The rest of the time he seems like a machine. The narrative is rarely introspective, instead simply giving the blow-by-blow of his outward actions as he orders and shoots and enhanced-interrogates his way through the plot. The other characters are less developed than Cade is. Perhaps the absence I felt most keenly was that of humor; no one ever cracks a joke. I didn't realize until reading The Heretic how much I've come to count on a pinch of sarcasm and a dash of gallows humor in my urban fantasy.The writing is unornamented and occasionally has issues such as abrupt point-of-view shifts and repetitive sentence structure. The Heretic was originally published in 2005, however, and from the snippets I've seen ofEyes to See (The Jeremiah Hunt Chronicle), Nassise has grown in his prose writing in the intervening years. I would be willing to try another book of his one day.The Heretic is not a horrible book; it just isn't for me. It could be a 3-star or 4-star book for a very different type of reader. This is a novel about manly men stoically getting the job done, with little in the way of stylistic or emotional frills. If that appeals to you, give this book a try. But for my own part, I must confess I like my frills."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I thought the action was intense, but I have a difficult time accepting Jesus and the Templars as action heroes. Machine-gunning and other gory death scenes just don't jibe with my concept of spirituality and the war between good and evil. It's more like Sgt. Rock meets the Ghoulies.I was also disappointed in the lack of much of a feminine presence or influence in the book. The only female characters are both presumably dead."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This is one of the first books I got on my Fire and I love it. Well developed characters and a plot that was intense enough that I almost slept on the couch so I wouldn't have to walk through a dark house. I love books or movies that do that to me. I'm a bit of a masochistic, what else can I say.Anyway, the comparisons to the DaVinci Code are crap. There is none. These are two completely different subject matters. Granted, I haven't read or watched the DaVinci Code in quite awhile, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't include necromancers, sorcerers, magick, and a tough hero.If you want an intriguing thriller, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I came across this book on a blog that lists free reads for the Kindle. I am always hesitant to purchase books that I've never heard of but the description sounded like something I would be interested in. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The Knights Templar, thought to have been disbanded in the 14th century, are alive and well - reborn with a military hierarchy as an arm of the Vatican. Their new mission is to defend mankind from supernatural threats and enemies.Knight Commander Cade Williams, known as \\"The Heretic\\", is head of the Echo Team, a highly specialized unit whose members each have unique \\"gifts\\". Cade had been a highly-decorated Massachusetts police officer and a member of Special Tactics. An attack that left Cade disfigured and his new wife dead changed the course of his life and left him with the gift of psychometry (divining facts through physical contact). His personal mission is to locate and destroy the entity he calls \\"The Adversary\\".When a Templar commandery is attacked, leaving all of the Templars there dead but without bullet wounds, Joshua Michaels, the Preceptor for the North Atlantic region, put Echo Team in charge of the investigation.As one, then another, commandery is attacked, it is up to Cade and his team to find out who and why and to put a stop to it.This novel is billed as \\"urban fantasy\\", which kind of had me knitting my brows. It is a rather unique blend of fantasy, horror, and even paranormal. For those who aren't familiar with the Templars, the author quite nicely takes the time to briefly but thoroughly explain their history and hierarchy near the beginning of the novel. It is rather fascinating, and, if you're like me, you'll be online Googling for more information.The bad: There is a prologue that isn't fully explained in the novel. I \\"kind of\\" think I know who is involved, but at the end of the novel, I still wasn't certain. There also could be a bit more character-building (but that's just me; most of the book is centered on action, which usually doesn't leave a lot of time for character-building).The good: Everything else. There is a lot of action, some surprises, a group of evil sorcerers, corpse hounds, revenants, mystery, and wonderful tension-building scenes. I fairly flew through the book, and, in many places, had no idea what the next turn of the page would bring. Unlike many first-in-series, the ending is a satisfying one - it closes up many important threads of the story while still leaving room for more to come. Cade is an unlikely protagonist, wrestling with his own demons while attempting to fulfill his Templar duties, and when the two lines cross, watch out!If you like a touch of horror and paranormal, mixed with fantasy and adventure, pick this one up; you won't regret it.QUOTESCade thought about his impulsive decision to use his Sight while in the Preceptor's office and of theresulting flash of Power it had shown centered around the new man's hands. It would be interesting to see how the other men in the unit reacted to Duncan's unique gift when they learned about it.The air is heavy with impending rain and the electrical tension of the coming storm. In the slowly fading afternoon light the shadows around him stretch and move. He learned early on that they can have a life of their own.He avoids them now.Writing: 4 out of 5 starsPlot: 4.5 out of 5 starsCharacters: 3.5 out of 5 starsReading Immersion: 4 out 5 starsBOOK RATING: 4 out of 5 starsSensitive Reader: There is a blood sacrifice scene."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This book sucked me in right from the beginning and held me there until the very end. The only thing I didn't like about this book was putting it down.While The Heretic is about the Knights of Templar, a religious order, it is not preachy and does not force any particular belief on readers. The Heretic is nonstop action, a paranormal thriller filled with the intricacies of relationships, struggles with faith, love, vengeance and duty. The writing is vivid, the characters made me care and the plot kept me on edge. I can't wait to read the second book in this trilogy!"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The Templars...First off I have a soft spot for the Templars, i've always enjoyed the mystery surrounding them and all the theories and conspiracies that people concoct about them. It just makes great fiction. Second I also have a weakness for a story that take place in locations I know, it always makes me happy to see things i know and then know that the author was also there. So the fact that the book starts in Bridgeport CT and travels through Upstate NY... had me pretty happy.The book is really about Echo Unit, a sort of black ops/ special weapons team within the Templar order (read SWAT)... or more precisely it's leader Cade Williams, The Heretic. A mysterious force walks in and destorys one of the Templar Commanderies in a single night, leaving no clues, no signs; nothing but the bodies of dead templars. Cade is called in to investigate this crime... despite not being an investigative unit, the Preceptor wants a Weapons Team on the job to neutralize the threat immediately.A second Commandery is razed to the ground, this one made more omnious by the fact that not even the dead remain behind. What follows is a pursuit by Cade and his Sergeants as they unravel the clues. A Cabal of Sorcerors are raising the dead and tormenting them for secrets of the Order, they are looking for the Spear of Destiny.The book is fairly quick paced, only jumping POV a few times and giving you information from all sides, the last quarter of it is just one huge rolling battle, high octane stuff. Those last chapters will hook you in and you will stay with it to the last page.This is a great start to the series and I look forward to reading the rest."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"Like many of you, I've been waiting for the entire trilogy of Joseph Nassise's \\"The Templar Chronicles\\" to come out. Over the last few years, these were all translated into German and released in Germany, but not in English. That was really frustrating. Full Moon Press was going to release them, but then they closed shop. That was mind numbingly hard to deal with. Now, thanks to Harbinger Books they are in English and available right here on Amazon!For your information, the books in this series are:Book One:The HereticBook Two:A Scream of AngelsBook Three:A Tear in the SkyThe basic plot: The Templar order has been resurrected by the Vatican to fight the supernatural dark forces that surround us all. I don't want to give ANYTHING away here though.These books are a thrill ride of fun!Also, for those not into the digital side of things, the first book is also available as a paperback (from 2005, here:Heretic: The Templar Chronicles). Also, Joseph Nassise has announced on his website that there will be a physical Templar Chronicles Omnibus, but the exact details (publisher, etc) are unknown at this time.I recommend downloading/reading the first book, and if you like it, continue the rest of the series. BUT, don't read the product description for part three! It has a slight \\"motivation\\" spoiler in it. So, for those that like all of their mystery to remain mysterious, don't read that product description.So, download \\"The Heretic\\" now. Give it a good read! The price is certainly right for the amount of fun you will have."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The Heretic is easily one of the best books I've read all year. If you read and enjoyed The Adept Series by Katherine Kurtz and miss that series now that it has ended, this one is for you.There are several POVs, but the characterization is outstanding enough that I ended up caring about several characters--a rare feat by an author indeed. The paranormal elements and world building are consistent and well-done. The pacing is fantastic.This book managed to be action-packed and deal with military and Templar issues without being the least bit dry or preachy. It's got tough guy AND heart. The best news for me was to find that the entire trilogy is already available. I've already downloaded the second book.If you liked Da Vinci code, this one is notches and notches above--everything Da Vinci could have been and wasn't. If you didn't like Da Vinci code and never got the excitement over the themes, give this a shot. It did everything right."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This was the 2nd book I paid for and read on my new Kindle 3. I already have plans to get the next two books in this series. I love stories dealing with the Templar Knights and this is a good one. Special Forces for the church? You bet! Demons and magic and a Christian thriller as well."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I bought this book because it was compared favorably to the work of Katherine Kurtz. In fact, both are in English and reference the Knights Templar but that is where the similarity ends. The characters in Katherine Kurtz's novels have a deep spirituality which imbues them with certain abilities and that leads them to oppose forces that will harm the world and mankind. The characters in this book have a religious conviction that they feel entitles them to go out and whup butt. Fighting ghosts, spirits and demons with machine guns? Really? The characters are shallow, the plot unbelievable (if the Knights have been fighting the supernatural for several hundred years wouldn't they be aware that something more than standard issue military ammo is needed?) and overall I was very disappointed in this book. If you enjoy the idea of a Christian militia going out to kick butts and take names, you might be impressed. If you are looking for a good fantasy novel with a system of magic, spirituality, good and evil, pick up another book instead."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"In the Heretic, Mr. Nassise creates a hero that is believable even with his special powers. This hero manages to get the job done, using whatever abilities he has. And he has some pretty specialized abilities. Slipping into shadow, Cade manages to go where angels fear to tread...with an automatic weapon in hand! Not all of his superiors believe that his abilties are \\"God given\\" and therefore, don't necessarily agree with his use of them. I found the knife edge walking between the two worlds very well written. Keeping the reader tied to the story all the way to the end. I've been waiting for years to get access to the second and third books in the series and finally Kindle has done it. Can't wait to get into them..."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"The Heretic: The Templar Chronicles by Joseph Nassise.

The characters are well defined, the story is very good, and the writing is good. Although not as engaging a story as The DaVinci Code (but how many books of this type are), it is superior in character development. The writing in a few spots was weak, but overall, it also surpassed DaVinci code (which had clean, but perfectly sterile prose and mostly flat characters). As some have mentioned, this book could have benefited from some better editing, but I didn't find it seriously lacking in that department.This book is worth picking up in part because it doesn't mess around with insignificant story details. It jumps right into the action and creates a credibly built world. At no point did I want to put it down. It was definitely worthy of being reissued. Down the road I'll check out the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"This book ended up not being my style (hence 3 stars) but if your into \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" you will like this book.

I want to cntinue on this adventure with these characters. And that is what makes a good story teller."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"As a fan of action/adventure stories (Stoney man, Deathlands, The Destroyer) I've grown used to some ho-hum story lines but that defenately wasn't the case here. Sure, there were some of the old tried and true story elements, like the central charecter being a scarred anti-hero who \\"does things differently\\" fighting with his commander, a desk bound jerk who \\"doesn't get it\\". Where this story/series really sets itself from the others is in its story background and in its execution. Story background involves a world where there are spiritual forces manafesting all around us. The Templars are tasked by the Cathlic Church to keep these forces in check. The Templers use everything from holy relics, to hi-tech equipment and firepower, to their own unique powers to deal with the forces of darkness. This brings us the the story's execution. Unlike other story's, these charecters are rarely able to just blast their way through their opponents. In fact, half the time, they don't even know who or what they are fighting. When they finally figure out what they are fighting, they usually also discover that most of their equipment is useless against this particular foe. In the meantime they take casualties and get hurt. Usually they will end up defeating their foe by using occultic knowlege as well as firepower. In conclusion, I consider it a open-minded, thinking man's action story. You don't have to think too hard on the story, but you are not being insulted. I personally am looking forward to seeing what else Joseph Nassise can pull out of that unique mind of his and put down on paper."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"A bad-ass modern day Templar Knight who fights evil and monsters.....What's not to like?Get this book.

Cade Williams, one of the most obscure amongst the Order, is also the most enigmatic and unorthodox, instilling fear even amongst his fellows; however, he might be the only person capable of saving the world from an evil so powerful that it threatens to destroy the divide between reality and a realm known as the Otherworld.I enjoyed this novel, which thematically reminded me of a highly supernatural DaVinci Code. Structurally, it came together well, the storyline both sound and well-paced. Characterization was good, although I would have liked to have known more about Duncan, one of the secondary characters assigned to assist Cade. Technically, I found a few minor grammatical flaws, mainly the separation of compound verbs, some unnecessary prepositions, a few improperly used semicolons, and the undue capitalization of a couple of words, but those were the only reason this novel is not receiving a perfect five stars from me. The Heretic is entertaining, highly creative, and fast-paced, and I give it a solid 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"part of an excellent series of books, the are entertaining and read very well. they have interesting plots and keep one entertained."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"All I can say is WOW!

For whatever reason, mainstream horror all but disappeared for about twelve years there, and if you were the new kid on the block, you got in through one of the small presses, through Leisure, or nothin'. Now, Joseph Nassise lands himself a first-book deal on Pocket, whose last first-novel deal may have been with John Russo. Who'd'a thunk it?His second novel, Heretic, is all kinds of off the wall. First, take some misty, unsubstantiated historical rumors (the survival of the Knights Templar after the burning of Jacques DeMolay), bring them out to their logical conclusions (the Templars are now the combat arm of the Vatican), bend the rules a little (one of the Templars, Knight Commander Cade Williams, does stuff that any regular Catholic would get tossed out of church on a trencher for on a fairly regular basis) because every once in a while Mother Church can't win by playing by the rules, and you have yourself a setup. Now pit some shady metaphysical characters against the Templars for reasons unknown till about halfway through the book, and you have a plot. All that's left is to write the thing.This is, according to Nassise, the first book in a projected trilogy. Don't let that stop you, though; he knows how to handle the breaks between books. Yes, there are loose ends that set us up nicely for what's no doubt coming after, but the book does stand on its own; we have a full storyline running from beginning to end here, and a couple of subplots that also tie up neatly. It could stand very well as its own blend of religious fiction/military thriller/survival horror novel if you didn't know other books were coming after it.The writing tends a bit towards the formulaic (on many pages, you will find one adverb per paragraph, like clockwork), and treads the clich&eacute; line a little more closely than comfortable on more than one occasion, but these are things to be expected from genre fiction. And Heretic is genre fiction, but it's good, solid, readable genre fiction that combines some interesting new twists and turns with a solid, well-known plot structure. Joseph Nassise is one to watch. ***"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I have to say with Nassise's latest effort Heretic that he has really outdone himself once again. With his debut novel Riverwatch he surprised me with the fluidity of his writing and his ability to keep the reader involved in all aspects of the story.Heretic is no exception.The writing is fast paced and action packed with some genuinely scary moments which i did not expect. While a completely different book than Riverwatch in almost every aspect,Heretic is actually a better novel which if you have read Riverwatch,tells you how good this actually is.The story centers around Cade Williams, a Templar Knight Commmander of his own special unit. The Templars were thought to be a long defunct military arm of the vatican.Cade himself has had his own personal encounter with Evil in his past and uses methods that others deem \\"extreme\\" which earns him the name Heretic. But Cade has good reason for his methods. After attacks on the Templars Bases, Cade and his team are assigned to find out who or what is responsible. I don't want to give too much away so i will stop at that.Thoose of you looking for a good horror novel or even those just looking for something new or different to read, i reccomend picking this up, you will not be disappointed. My only gripe is that i have no idea when the sequel is coming out."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"When their organization was outlawed, the Knights Templar went underground until the Vatican recognized them again and they became an arm of the church fighting the supernatural enemies of humanity. One Knight Commander Cade Williams, in charge of Echo Command, joined the order when as a policeman he encountered a supernatural entity he calls the Adversary that killed his wife. He fully intends to avenge his wife's death but for now he fights the cases of the order whenever he is called to do so.Someone or something is attacking commanderies (various headquarters of the Knights Templar), killing the Templars and raising them from the dead as revenants. The group of nine led by Simon Hamilton Logan, the head Necromancer is looking for the Spear of Destiny for it is believed whoever possesses it could rule the world. The battle becomes personal for Cade when he realizes the Necromancer is in league with his enemy the Adversary. Before he can ever think of taking vengeance on his foe, he must keep the spear out of the enemy's hands, a difficult thing to accomplish when there is a traitor within his organization.Horror fans will be delighted to discover the works of Joseph Nassise a relatively new writer who can hold his own with such masters as Douglas Clegg, Bentley Little, and Stephen King. Heretic is a dark work, gothic in tone with scary scenes that will frighten even those who don't get scared by reading a horror novel. The protagonist fights on the side of the light even though he has his own agenda. Like this reviewer, fans will look forward to more adventures starring Cade and the Knights Templar.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I'm nearly done with this (93%, according to my kindle). I wonder if it is worth finishing. The blurb sounded interesting, and initially the main character seemed interesting. I wanted to like this book, but as I read, the chance of that gradually diminished.I think the idea has potential, but the writing needs to be both cut and expanded, contradictory as that may sound.The thing is very wordy, partially due to the excessive use of progressive tense (i.e., sentences with endless strings of verbs ending in \\"ing\\"). The prose is often overly melodramatic. There is tons of description that really isn't necessary to move the story along. This is the sort of stuff that could be cut, especially during the agonizingly slow (and lacking in tension) action sequences.The characters could be more fleshed out, and some of the plot elements reworked to make them less cliche."},{"Title":"Heretic: The Templar Chronicles","review":"I really wanted to love this book and I feel bad giving it a mediocre review.

That said there are things I liked about the book, I liked the way the necromancers and their abilities work, and some of the creativity and imagination put into the story.

For example, some of the categories I found helpful but which are no longer situated in the \\"Categories\\" section are: Anatomy and Health; Arms and Armor; Food & Drink; Lakes, Seas, Gulfs, Bays; Mountains & Volcanoes; Bridges & Dams; Natural History (many subcategories) Measures & Weights; Money & Coins; Tools & Implements; Wearing Apparel; Music Terms & Instruments; and some others.

There has been a fire that devastated much of Rome but the epidemic has ceased. To take their minds off the troubles of the past six months, Titus has decided to hold 100 days of games to mark the opening of the new Flavian Amphitheater (later known as the Colosseum). Flavia, Nubia and Lupus are in Rome to attend the opening games but they have returned to Rome to search for Jonathan, who mysteriously disappeared. In their search the friends manage to get access to the lower sections of the Colosseum in order to search for clues. How they get inside the workings of the amphitheater brings each a measure of trouble that challenges each.Caroline Lawrence provides a mesmerizing account of the opening games using Martial's book on the spectacles as inspiration (and there is a brief appearance by the poet). There are quite a few scenes of action that are magnificently described and the story keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. She also fleshes out her characters superbly so we see them as real individuals. The Roman Mysteries is the kind of series that you do not want to end with each succeeding book building on the prior one. These are excellent books for young adults to learn about ancient Rome but adults will also enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"Caroline Lawrence writes incredibly detailed, fascinating stories. This one is no different. The well-paced plot keeps you turning the pages to find out what is going to happen next.However, this is a very bloodthirsty book mainly because the Roman games were bloodthirsty games. The children explore their feelings about the violence and find that the bloody nature of the sport can be both frightening and addicting.I really felt that some of the descriptions bordered on too graphic. One of my main problems with this book was the part with the little girls being eaten by hippos and crocodiles. The main character, Flavia, just barely manages to escape death through the intervention of her former slave, Nubia. I found the entire scene with the girls in the water to be disturbing. It was fairly graphic and heartbreaking. I have a fairly vivid imagination and I actually ended up dreaming about this scene the night after I read the book.The bottom line is, if you have a child who is prone to nightmares or who has an over-active imagination, then this would be one I would have them skip. However, since the plot line is important to the rest of the series, it would be good to read it and summarize the events for your child. This is what I did for my son."},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"If your pre-teen reads this book, she/he may want to run to the nearest bookstore to buy an armful of books on ancient Rome. Not because there's too much in it that's incomprehensible, but because Lawrence makes it a very realistic and compelling world--both the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad.\\" The protagonists--all children--adroitly negotiate a morally difficult world where men, womnen and even children are victims of spectacular (and bloodthirsty) games in the Flavian amphitheater. However, the narration is also quite sensitive to the young reader's possible reactions, and sympathetic views are always heard from at least one character. The subject of personal loss and family tragedy is well explored here. I'm not a a mental health professional, but this books feels like the type that might help a child who has had to cope with the loss of a loved one. I've read every book in the series and as an educator in literature, I highly recommend it, and also the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"We've read the Roman Mysteries aloud, in order, to our 10-year-old daughter and were unprepared for the ramp-up in blood, gore, and threat in Gladiators from Capua. I know danger is an important ingredient in mysteries for anyone, but this book, and especially the hippos and crocodiles part, is much more violent than anything that had occurred in the previous books. (Reading aloud heightens the nausea and highlights the intensity of the bloody scenes.) By volume 8 of the series, the four main characters of the series have developed a bit but they aren't much older than they were in the first volume and the world hasn't changed all that much, even though there have been scary events since the beginning of the series. Contrast this with the slower and steadier increase in threat in the Harry Potter series, where we see the three protagonists get a year older in each installment and the threat of Voldemort get steadily stronger despite setbacks at the end of each book. Kids (and parents!) who are more sensitive can decide to pause between books until they're ready for the next level up. Other reviewers have said that the intensity of this book is a turning point or a key for further events in the series--so I won't say the violence is unnecessary, even though at times it felt like the author shared some of the spectators' blood lust. I also won't say, \\"avoid the book,\\" but at least be prepared, especially if you're a sensitive kid or the parent of one who's gotten drawn into the series."},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"This series is a wonderful introduction to Ancient Rome, warts and all. This book is the most gruesome yet, with a recounting of Titus' games of 80AD. In this book the children from Ostia are missing Jonathan, who is presumed dead after the fire in Rome, but Lupus hears of a curly haired boy beggar boy in Rome who claims to have stated the fire, and thinking this just might be their friend, the children set off once again to investigate the mystery.Full of rich historical detail, this book is also an enthralling story. Children of about 8+ will love it, but parents be warned - there is some gruesome (if entirely authentic) stuff here. Think \\"horrible histories\\" but with a better storyline!"},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"This, the eighth book in the \\"Roman Mysteries\\" by Caroline Lawrence, finally takes us to the inevitable gladiatorial arena. Set a month after the tragic events ofThe Enemies of Jupiter, aristocratic young Flavia and her freed-slave girl Nubia are still mourning the loss of their friend Jonathan Mordecai, lost in the terrible fire that engulfed Rome. But Lupus, their mute friend, is not so sure that Jonathan is dead.With the fire extinguished and the epidemic on the wane, the Emperor Titus has announced one hundred days of celebrations in order to divert from people from their recent troubles. The games will take place in Titus's new amphitheatre (what will later be known as the Colosseum), complete with gladiators, wild animals, famous criminals and other wonders on display for the populace. Flavia, Nubian and Lupus cunningly secure themselves passage to Rome in order to hunt for their lost friend, under the pretext of watching the games.The hunt begins in Rome with rumors of a dark curly-haired boy living on Potsherd Mountain, and the trail leads them straight to the Colosseum where they begin to fear that Jonathan is amongst the Jewish convicts who are scheduled to be executed. Time is ticking away as they try to discover the truth behind their friend's disappearance, but soon enough other problems beset the young sleuths: Flavia is caught up in a dangerous reenactment of a Greek myth in the arena and Nubia witnesses a familiar face from her past amongst the gladiators. By the time they reach Jonathan, it may be too late for him...Lawrence weaves a tightly plotted story around her protagonists, drawing on the \\"Book of the Spectacles\\" by Martial (a contemporary writer who was present at the games) to create an evocative and accurate picture of Roman spectacle. Though it's not needlessly graphic, it is rather harrowing at times, and readers should be forewarned that the story includes some rather gruesome executions and frightening situations. Perhaps even more noteworthy is the tension and suspense that Lawrence manages to sustain - despite being far outside the age range of the series, this reader was feeling pretty nerve-wracked at times!In saying that, Lawrence doesn't deal with the subject matter lightly, and there is an intriguing exploration into the bloodlust that stirs up in several characters on witnessing the games, just as others are sickened by it. The children in particular are interesting specimens: kind-hearted and innocent, they're naturally perturbed by the violence, but also grotesquely fascinated by the sight. In the same vein, Lawrence gently acknowledges the existence of adult interests (such as married noblewomen going to visit gladiators with their faces hidden) without being explicit. Such things will be just as much over young readers' heads as they are over the protagonists'.By this stage in the series, it is rather too late for a newcomer to begin reading - ideally one would begin back atThe Thieves of Ostiaand work their way up. Lawrence assumes familiarity with the characters and their relationships, and much of the poignancy in the children's interactions with one another can only be felt if one has an understanding of their history together. Likewise, familiar faces that pop up from other books, and the personal background of each child, are inferred, but not explained, making prior knowledge something of a necessity.Despite the gory subject matter, Lawrence has written a riveting book about Ancient Rome and its people, told in clear, illuminating prose and accurate detail. The four protagonists manage to be understandable and relatable, yet still products of their time as they grow to maturity in a *very* different time and place."},{"Title":"The Gladiators from Capua (The Roman Mysteries) (Vol 8)","review":"These books are just great for kids who love adventure, excitment and like to learn about history in entertaining way.

The photography is absolutely incredible and surreal; it reveals the shock, fear, panic, grief and feeling of impossibility the images of this horrific day evoke.

F. Thurman (Princeton) is by far the most innovative and key texts to Tsong-kha-pa's teachings and life experience as it purports to reveal Tsong-kha-pa's own account of his experience of Enlightenment and his answer to many of the intellectual muddles, hyperintllectualisms, antirationalisms that befuddled and continues to perplex many contemporary monks and Buddhist practitioners. It is a demanding read but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Central Philosophy of Tibet","review":"The context of the book is the thesis that belief in inherent existence (meaning, roughly, \\"externally self-standing, permanent, absolute, not-depending-on-anything-else\\" existence as opposed to \\"relative\\" or \\"dependent on other things\\" existence) is the source of suffering, because it creates bases for clinging to negative emotions. People hold this belief in many forms, applied to many things, at many levels. Detailed analysis of each instance and/or category of this belief can undermine and weaken that particular belief, and finally shatter it. This relieves the suffering associated with that instance or category of the belief, because negative emotions can no longer \\"stick\\" to the objects of the (dissolved) belief. Tsong-Ka-Pah's \\"Essence of Eloquence\\" is aimed at analyzing and shattering a form of the belief in inherent existence that operates at a deep psychological level, and yet which can still be accessed through conscious examination and logic. Tsong-Ka-Pah's claim is that this is the deepest such level of belief and corresponding analysis. Thurman's introduction compares Tsong-Ka-Pa's treatise, from the 1300's, with a similar finding by Wittgenstein in the 1900's. Seeing the thesis from these two different perspectives is helpful in \\"triangulating\\" the intended object of understanding. The material is challenging to follow as it requires developing and maintaining an experiential knowledge of subtle (yet perceivable) mental phenomena (such as \\"knowing\\") and complex relationships among these phenomena. By way of further triangulation, the material appears to address the difference between the \\"autonomist\\" schools and the \\"consequentialist\\" schools of Tibetan Buddhism that are outined in Guy Newland's \\"Appearance and Reality\\". The key area of belief that Tsong-Ka-Pa, Wittgenstein and Thurman address has to with \\"private languages\\" and the syllogisms that are based on them. The key message is that these conceptual tools inevitably reinforce the belief in inherent, as opposed to relative, existence. Because of this, private languages and the syllogisms that are based on them provide bases for attachments for negative emotions and thus sources of suffering. Accordingly, these conceptual tools eventually have to be abandoned, in terms of believing that they represent or are based on things that inherently exist, if a person is to achieve liberation from suffering, enlightenment, etc. \\"The Essence of Eloquence\\" appears to be aimed as showing exactly why private languages and the syllogisms have this flaw of reinforcing the general belief that things have inherent existence, as opposed to relative existence."},{"Title":"The Central Philosophy of Tibet","review":"Again Robert Thurman is a master of expertise. THIS book will be a challenge but the more I read much easier books and then come back to this more academic version the more I grasp. It is more a scholarly text book but a thrilling addition to the \\"real\\" thing. Also It's biggest gift to me was the concept of using my intelligence and brain and mind. Up to now it was all woo-woo and still the mind. This book opens the doors to wisdom which is the other part of the equation. Compassion AND wisdom. After wading thru a few pages of copious foot notes and lecture, my brain was sparking and activated. I am blessed to have discovered it."},{"Title":"The Central Philosophy of Tibet","review":"This book is a classic in the field of Indo-Tibetan philosophy. The subject, the Essence of Eloquence, is surely one of the most difficult of all indigenous Tibetan philosophical treatises -- to understand, let alone translate. So for for translating this text we applaud Thurman, and also for his inspired introduction. But we tap our feet apprehensively at some of his polemical connivings, and we wish very much he would re-edit the translation for readability, by working more flexibly and thoroughly with good English sentences. As it stands, there is a distinct redolence about it of &quot;I've been typing all night, the kids are up already, and the tip of my tie is in my coffee cup.&quot;The translation must be judged a great but unfinished work.QUOD EST DETERMINATUS, VIRTUTE ET NON VI!"},{"Title":"The Central Philosophy of Tibet","review":"I have 4 Thurman books on Tsong Kha Pa. He is very precise. I do think he could make the translation of this a bit easier, like the 'Life and Teachings' he edited . I strongly advise to get that first if you are fairly new to this subject. All of Thurman's books are over priced, even more so do to the poor quality of the various Indian publishers' used. Get used copies if you can.The introduction Pre states all he ends up translating in the actual text, yet it is very worthwhile if you, like me, are not a Specialist. Tsong Khapa can get into the most detailed minutia of any subject. 'Blue is blue, but not really blue... so much blue your mind will go numb. Tsongkhapa felt obligated to go into the most minute of details to clear up the True Middle Way teaching for all those who attempted to refute it. It deals a little with Dol Pa's views, which are rather straight forward..to me.When this text goes into the 'finest' of arguments and refutaions of Yogacharya and many other Schools;.. without being familiar with all 'the Opponent's' views and terminology... there can be quite a bit of difficulty, at least to me. This can become seemingly contradictory, if not non sensical to the Western Reader or Sophist Debator. Obviously some arguments will be non convincing due to modern knowlege and science. Not in any way an introductory text. He also shows the non contradictions in various other schools.Very few books can combine the academic and the esoteric... Mr. Thurman does that with ease, even though it may not be easy reading. The true Teaching, of the Highest Order imho.Do prepare though with the Life & Teachings. This is not a Lam Rim or Vinaya teaching...straight Reason, and Sutra based. Small font as always on his books."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"Listen... I Will Trust You. There Is No One Else, And I WIll Be Dead Soon. The Speaker is Corrupt. The Oracle is Being Betrayed. Two Things You Must Do, Mirany. Find the New Archon, Stop Argelin. Second. In My Palace Is A Musician. Oblek. Talk To Him, He Knows. Do Not Be Afraid Of The God For He Has Chosen You. Burn This. Stay Alive.The Oracle Betrayed is by far the best book I have ever read. Catherine Fisher creates a vivid landscape, close to something like Egypt or Greece, and writes of all sorts of characters, each with a unique, complex, but believable personality. The back ground point is Mirany is chosen to be the Bearer-of-the-God, the second highest ranking position in amongst nine priestessess. The first is the Speaker to the God, Hermia, who is corrupt and turns the god's word around to suit her's and Argelin's own purposes. But the God speaks to Mirany, tells her about it. And gives her a mission. Find Oblek before he is put to death with the other slaves of the old Archon (god-in-human-form (who dies at the start of the book)) The rest you have probably already read about in other reviews so i won't waste space telling you.What I disliked about this book: Well, the starting is a bit confusing, but it's all explained later on. And you repeatedly read about the Jackal's long eyes staring at someone, or his fair hair, or about the characters licking dry lips. Well, it's better than just plain \\" Seth liked his lips.\\" And that's all.What I liked about this book: All the characters are so complex and even the main ones are still mortal and will give in if it means something for them will come out of it. No two are alike- like real people. And Catherine Fisher does such a good job describing how they're like- (not in long, boring paragraphs) but how they act in different situations throughout the book that it's almost like you know them like you do a friend. Admittedly, not all the characters are like that, most have deep histories that aren't apparent until Catherine Fisher tells you or until you put two and two together and figure it out for yourself. When I read this book for the third time I started to realize that, how Mirany was helping Oblek and Seth from the Garden of the Rain, and i only started to understand who the Rain Queen really was at the third book. And when you finnish one of her books, it's clear what happened, but you still have a feeling as if their was more to it, if you cared to understand, and there is, in short paragraphs or poem-like pages that you thought were insignificant before.The Oracle Betrayed is fast paced, and doesn't take long to start up- the climax happened about 30 pages into the book, and never receded. Catherine Fisher really know's how to right suspense, and the words seem to just roll off the pages and into your mind. Suspense always leaves you hanging whenever the points of views between characters suddenly switch, and you never know what will happen next.Over all, I highly reccomend this book to anyone who loves books about adventure/suspense/awesome writing/egypt/tomb thieves/plots/deciet/betrayal/and realistic characters that you could actually picture living in the real world."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"I've started reading this series after having gone through the Edgewater series. \\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" already promises that this series will be much better and more satisfying. The characters are well rounded, the dialogue is believable, and while there is a lot of action, it all flows together as part of an overarching plot, rather than as individual episodes. This book will appeal to both girls and boys.Catherine Fisher does a great job of making the world of this story come to life. The brutality of life in the ancient world is made evident. As she describes the crowded city streets, details such as rotting garbage and the odor of dead animals make it extremely vivid and realistic. And then this is contrasted with the sumptuous City of the Dead, where the high ranking inhabitants lack for nothing, even precious water while the poor are reeling from the effects of the long-lasting drought.The two main characters, Mireny and Seth, are flawed which makes them more believable than they would have been if they had been gung-ho, able-to-do-everything types. Mireny is priestess but she doesn't believe the in the existence of her god, and by nature she is shy and uncomfortable around people. Over the course of the book her faith changes and she gains confidence. Seth begins as an arrogant scribe who gets drawn into the plot initially as a means of achieving his ambitions, but he too grows and his motives change.A previous reviewer complained that the meaning of everything is not spelled out at the beginning. That's actually what makes for sophisticated storytelling, and makes this a book that will appeal to various ages. As you read on the various layers of the the mystery are revealed and the various threads of the plot come together.For parents who are evaluating this book there are a couple of things to be aware of. Although this is listed as book for 9 yr olds, it probably is more appropriate starting at 11 to 12 year olds due to some more mature elements. There is a scene of ritual sacrifice, and while it is not graphic it might be disturbing to some kids. Also there is a brief scene that takes place in an opium den. Otherwise I highly recommend this book. It's enjoyable for anyone who enjoys a mix of mystery and fantasy."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"Mirany is a girl who had a simple life in the arid desert tundra, until she got chosen that is. She was chosen to be the bearer of the God, their idol who decides when to bring the priceless rain and normally comes to them in the form of snakes, scorpions, and other scuttling creatures. This is a huge honor for someone as young and inexperienced as Mirany, although soon it is apparent that she is much more powerful than she thinks. Nine other girls serve the god. Just after receiving her new post, her life is constantly in danger.The Archon is dead, the speaker is false, and the oracle is being betrayed. The speaker of the god Hermia tells the people what the god says through the oracle and delivers it to the people to appease the god so the rains come. The people don't know however that they are being deceived. Hermia is in league with general Argelin who has intense power over the land and its inhabitants. They are planning to betray the oracle by giving false information to the people and intend to dictate the choosing of the new ruler, who is supposed to have the presence of the god within him and is known as the Archon. This plot between the two most powerful people in the land has unearthed a disturbance and the god is not happy: there is no rain.Mirany goes through an epic adventure trying desperately to bring the rightful candidate of the new Archon (named Alexos) to the temple to bring the life sustaining rains, and ensure the happiness of the people. She teams up with Seth, an ambitious scribe who really wants nothing to do with the whole affair, and has some dark secrets of his own; and Oblek, a drunken, pugnacious, middle aged man who used to be the best musician in the land, and was the old Archon's best friend, and may be the only man who can keep Alexos alive and deliver him safely to the temple to fulfill his duties. Will Mirany, Oblek, and Seth stop the malicious plot between Hermia and Argelin? What new powers will Mirany discover during her quest?This book is an amazing science fiction novel for all ages. The Oracle Betrayed is extremely descriptive, and stirs your thoughts and imagination in the most unlikely ways. The characters are intense and convincing, you feel as though you are really there. Riveting to the last page. I recommend this book to all readers and hope you find it as enjoyable as I have."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"This book's sooooo suspensful!! it has everything i like- suspence, adventure, action, humor! IT IS NOT DULL!!!!Yeah, well it starts off kind of slow, with a confusing ritual. But don't give up on it! (that's what my sister did, but when she went back and read the whole thing she loved it!)The characters are strong and well written; no two are alike. The book has everything, musijians, tomb thieves, priestesses, betrayal, deciet. It gets better throughout the story, and at the end it's so suspenceful that i finnished it that night.So, just to help you through the first chapter, : (This little paragraph doesn't have any spoilers, just some explanations that you find out later, but i for one could hardly understand what was going on with the whole thing until i read the explanations.)There are Nine chosen priestessess. The two gods are the Rain Queen and the other God who isn't named. the priestesses are called the Nine, and consist of the Speaker-to-the-God, the Bearer-of-the-God, Taster-of-the-god's-food, Embroiderer, ect. The two most important priestessess are Speaker-to-the-Gods, and the Bearer. Anyway, the old Bearer just died, and Mirany is chosen to be the new one. But first there's a test. She must carry a heavy bowl filled with scorpions along a path: If the scorpions kill her, The god does not wish her to be Bearer. But if she succeeds, the God DOES wish her to be Bearer. Also, at the same time, The old Archon, (who acts like a sacrifice for the people (he's the God-in-human-form,) must be sacrificed. the out come, the people hope, will be rain.)All that happen's in the first chapter, and throughout the rest of the story, Mirany befriends Seth, (a scribe), and Oblek (a musijian,) in her attempt to restore the oracle. (the Speaker (Hermia) was twisting the God's wishes and saying instead what she herself wanted.)Again, i would highly reccommend this fast-paced book to anyone who likes Adventure and suspence. Also if you like:The Squire's TalesBoston Jane*****Eragonand......

She beats JK Rowling! The main female character is a teen brunette called Mirany. She is a shy, timid little thing, who is easily intimidated by her fellow priestesses, especially ambitious Rhetia and ruthless Hermia, who has hooked up with obsessive general Argelin. Her only friend in the Nine is ditzy blonde Chryse. After being secretly contacted by the ancient Archon, God-on-Earth, Mirany teams up with handsome scribe Seth, who seems to have two conflicting personalities- one power-hungey and greedy, the other ... well, noble, really. Throughout the series, Seth and Mirany have much sexual tension between them, as they quickly fall for each other. Along with Oblex, a protective yet alcoholic musician, and Alexos, the quirky ten-year-old who is the god... these characters burn in your head for time to come."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"Catherine Fisher doesn't use all the promise that \\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" has, although the book improves as it goes on. Her writing is lackluster and the setting is sketchy, but the intricate plotline has promise, if she can learn to use it sufficiently.The Archon, a vessel for an unnamed god, is sacrificed so that the drought will end and it will finally rain. But young priestess Mirany finds out something far more sinister when she goes to clean out the Archon's quarters -- he has left a note for her, warning her that the Speaker is not speaking for the god. Instead, she and her power-hungry lover are planning to set up a new, fake Archon to be their puppet.Mirany ends up befriending Oblek, a sozzled old musician, and Seth, a boy who has a deep, dark secret that he can never tell Mirany. When the god speaks directly to Mirany, she sends Seth and Oblek to find the new Archon in an impoverished village. But Mirany may have gone too far in her investigations -- and she may be the next one murdered.\\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" starts off on a shaky note. The setting is a random mishmash of ancient Greece and Egypt, and Fisher doesn't really explain the civilization or religious system at the beginning of the book. What are the Nine? What's up with that scorpion? Why's the old man dying? You'll find out eventually, but it's rather frustrating to have to take such things on faith.Fortunately, Fisher's plot steadies itself as she progresses through the book. By the time we meet Oblek, things are going at a pretty good pace. Her writing also starts off very start and dull, but blossoms by the middle of the book. Fisher seems to become more eloquent once she gets into the flow of the plotline.Mirany is the weakest character in the book; she seems rather petulant and meek. But Seth and Oblek are excellent characters. One is a boy who has made a Faustian pact with a tomb-robber, so that his little sister can have some valuable water. And the other is a drunken musician who is a lot sharper than he seems.Catherine Fisher's \\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" starts off on shaky ground, but gets better footing as the plot proceeds. A promising and enticing fantasy book, if somewhat flawed."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"Mirany, a young women, is elected to be the bearer of the Gods. She has to tell the Speaker (who tells the people what the God wants) if the God is in the people's presence. Mirany lives with the nine, who are some of the most respected people in her country. There are people in the nine like the taster-of-the-Gods who do important things for the Gods and the people. When Archon, the ruler of the land, dies he gives Mirany a note saying that the Oracle is betrayed, the Speaker can not hear the Gods, and the Speaker is making ideas up in her head and in the people's favor. Mirany has to find the new Archon, but the new Archon lives in a very poor place far away. The Speaker wants a weak boy to be the Archon so that she can control the Archon and maintain power. The rest of the book is about Mirany's attempt to find the new Archon and end the drought that has plagued the land for the past 6 months.Opinion: I thought this book was very exciting, especially at the end. It also has a lot of myth in it and is a great book for those who love places like Egypt. The book was well detailed and the author had a lot of descriptions so you understood what things look like. The only problem with this book is that it is confusing. It gives you so much to read that you forget some important ideas and sometimes things just pop up out of nowhere and the author hasn't explained that part too well. Also the book got me questioning some things which were later answered but I also had some questions left. Nevertheless it all didn't matter because it was such an exciting story with amazing things happening.

It's a great honor to become one of the priestesses. With the respect and adoration of average people, the title gives each of the 9 the status and the power to control the life of the society they live in. The only reason for Mirany being chosen is that she seems to be easily controllable. Imagine the surprise, when under the timid and shy appearance, a very resourceful and thoughtful individual emerge as the story progresses.Mirany's character grows as the story goes on; she starts out questioning God's existence (quietly in her own thoughts, terrified that someone could find out) then confronted with the fact that God might be real after all (reincarnated in the young boy Alexos), she still doesn't stop questioning God's work - the society she lives in, its inequality and cruelty. On one hand she believes that Alexos is the new Archon, but on the other she still sees everything that is wrong with people and society around her and doesn't understand how and why the God would allow things to be that way. Seth, the practical and ambitious scribe (another character from the book) seems to shear Mirany's dual attitude towards the God, but with somewhat more practical attitude - ok, God's great, but we mortals here have to fend for ourselves and help ourselves, because no one else will. Oblek, the old bad tempered musician, loves the \\"Old Man\\" (the Archon), but more like an old friend than someone to worship. These three very different people with different motivations have the common purpose - to make sure that Alexos will be chosen as the new Archon. And all three of them discover different parts of themselves during their quest.I definitely recommend the book to anyone 10 and up. It has the adventure, intrigue and \\"edge of the seat\\" suspense for the younger audience, while bringing up questions that people can spend their whole life trying to answer."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"THE ORACLE BETRAYED (originally known as THE ORACLE) by Catherine Fisher is a wonderful book for Middle-grade kids, about an unknown place set in the ancient past where Greek religious rites are blended with Egyptian ritual. There's been a drought and the Archon is being sacrificed to make rain. But who is to be the next Archon? And has the process of choosing him been corrupted by some ruthless individuals who are in power?What struck me about this book, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Chidren's Award, was the quality of the writing.They walked down the path. In the sizzling heat Hermia said, \\"are you afraid?\\"\\"Should I be?\\" Mirany whispered.The mask swiveled. \\"I'll assume that was a serious question, and not impudence. Indeed you should. Yours is a dangerous honor for a girl so inexperience.She knew that...When Alana had died all the girls had whispered about who would be next Bearer, but when Hermia had sent for her this morning and told her she'd been chosen, she hadn't been able to believe it. Neither had anyone else.The terror had come later, growing all day...Fear tasted sour. A prickling, her heart thudding, and that sickening, sweating emptiness. She swallowed a huge lump of it in her throat but it was still there, choking her...Although it is told via multiple points of view, at no time did I ever feel confused. We start off in Mirany's point of view, the young girl who's been chosen for the dangerous task of Bearer. After several chapters, we move into the point of view of Seth, a cocky young man who is a scribe in the archives. The multiple point of view works in this book because each protagonist has a rich life that needs exploring. (In a recent book that I read, written in multiple point of view, it didn't work so well. And now I wonder if that because one of the protagonists was glued to the bed suffering from kidney disease. Since he really couldn't go out and have a life of his own, having part of the story written in his voice didn't make much sense.)The only problem I had with this book was with the chapter titles. I found them distracting. But the gripping story line and wonderful writing more than made up for that. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"I like Catherine Fisher's books - the Relic Master series, the Incarceron series, the Snow -Walker sequence, and stand alones like Corbenic and Darkhenge. I like the use she makes of Welsh and Norse legends. But I just can't see the appeal of the Oracle series. It could not be more generic or more by-the-numbers. Young girl suspects treachery, aided by charming scamp boy and grumpy old man. Mystic hero and plotting male and female villains. Magical solutions to the cliffhangers. Absolutely predictable from page one with not a single unique twist or even an interesting digression. Anyone who has read many children's/YA fantasy quest adventures could dictate this book half asleep.The prose is workmanlike if not memorable. The characters are completely devoid of personality apart from what is usually assigned to characters playing their roles. (That is, grumpy old man drinks too much wine, scamp boy has crisis of conscience, hero maiden is timid but grows stronger.) None of this is bad, but it has been done over and over, usually with more excitement and flair.So, this is a perfectly fine book for a new fantasy adventure reader. Not the best, but fine. But for a seasoned reader it will be old hat. And even for a new reader there are a lot of more exciting and rewarding choices."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"This was very different and interesting. Fisher is a great descriptive writer! I could almost feel the heat poring out of this book!(The weather was hot) I wasn't sure if I would like it after the first chapter it started out odd but if defiantly took off and I will be reading the next and checking out this author for other books."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"I decided to read this after I read Incarceron. I enjoyed this book more, but I have to admit that it has some of the same problems that Incarceron had. First, the setting. I do not usually like long winded, overly descriptive novels that tell you what city is north of what body of water, but the setting seemed almost nonexistent in The Oracle Betrayed. From what I understood it is an ancient Egyptian or ancient Greek type of setting. It is certainly set in a desert environment, but I would have liked to have more information on the society as a whole instead of just the palace area. My second issue was the characters. The Oracle Betrayed is full of action, and there always seemed to be something going on. That doesn't leave time for character building and lots of introspection. Neither of those issues ruined the novel for me though. The reincarnation of the Archon was an interesting idea, and the plot is what redeemed this book. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next at every turn. Each chapter it seemed like the plan might be blown, or that something bad might happen. When bad things happened, I was biting my nails hoping everything would be ok. I think the storytelling is well done and it certainly kept my attention. It is obvious that everything will not be sunshine and rainbows in the next book, though some of the characters don't seem to realize it at all, and that makes me thankful that I picked up the entire series at once. A quick, easy, exciting read that is worth giving a try. I'm glad I read it and plan to continue the series."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"\\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" takes place in a fascinating world that is being shattered by drought. As the story begins, the problem looks to be fixed when 'the god' who lives in the temple agrees to sacrifice himself so that the goddess of rain will once more favor the land. But rather than being a solution, it is only the beginning of chaos which drags an aged musician, a temple priestess, and a too-smart scribe into a political nightmare.The setting for this book is just wonderful. It involves a society with priestesses, multiple gods, and a spirit world that messes with the 'real one' in ways that are reminiscent of Egyptian theology, had those beliefs been more real than fanciful. There's a god, for example, who every generation takes residence in a 10 year old boy. He moves to the temple where his every basic need is seen to; and yet, he lives in almost total isolation. This, of course, allows for political shenanigans, which in the case of the present generation, allows for an ambitious general to join forces with a false Oracle-priestess.The characters run the gambit in this book. Everyone from a humble scribe to the gods themselves. The heroine is Mirany, a shy girl who remains mousy until the call to action comes. Overall, I would say that the characterization is the weakest aspect of this book. The characters, unlike the unrelenting heat and thirst, aren't that well described, and their actions sometimes are not well motivated. (I am hoping that this is merely because this is the first book in the series. I know that sometimes author's struggle with the first book as they seek their footing.)Overall, the writing is good. The brief pieces from the god's perspective are downright poetic.Talking Points:::The Oracle Betrayed has some excellent writing, some brilliant concepts and world building. If there is any shortfall to this work I'd say that the characters could have been more fleshed out. As it was, I wasn't fully engaged by the story. But it did keep me reading to the end.This book will especially appeal to those who like intricate settings. It would be appropriate for Young Adults (YA) and even the MG (middle-schooler) crowd as there is no heavy violence, nor any 'adult situations'.Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews(1059)note: Just finished Book 2 and it's VERY goodThe Sphere of Secrets: Book Two of The Oracle Prophecies. This is definitely a series to check out."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"Welsh author Catherine Fisher brings a subtle blend of mystery, adventure, and the tiniest dab of romance in the first book of The Oracle Prophecies. Set in a lush, immense land resembling ancient Egypt, The Oracle Betrayed follows young and shy Mirany as she is chosen as the Bearer to the God; a position which she is unhappy about, since she is secretly unsure as to even the existence of their God. However, when the God actually speaks to her, and warns her of a massive betrayal, Mirany is thrust headfirst into an unexpected whirlwind of murder, secret combinations, and an adventure that will take her dead into the center of the very thing she was hoping to avoid from the start.Along the way, Mirany somehow gets herself entangled with an interesting group of characters. From the stubborn, slightly arrogant scribe, Seth; to the deadly intelligent thief lord, the Jackal; to the drunken, obnoxious musician who may hold the keys to all of their safety, Oblek. Each one is beneficial to the other, yet none want to reveal their secrets, creating a strange sort of bond between them.From the start of the book it is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat thriller that brilliant writer Catherine Fisher has managed to create. Her subtle blend of beautiful writing paired with the amazing complexity and depths of each one of her characters makes this book a must-read for any person, despite its direction towards youth, and will have you reaching for the next book immediately after finishing the first."},{"Title":"The Oracle Betrayed: Book One of The Oracle Prophecies","review":"I picked up this book at a college bookstore today with absolutely no knowledge of the author or her works, and purchased it after reading the first page.

The main character, Mirany, is a young priestess who discovers that the High Priestess (who is supposed to be the Oracle) actually cannot hear the god and is plotting with the chief general to control the new boy chosen as the God-on-Earth. And then Mirany discovers that the god is speaking to her, and that she has to thwart the plot and find the real vessel the god has chosen...The book incredibly well-written.

Several places I had to stop and just gibber at the sheer glory of her writing. And the characters! *meeps* No one was wholly good nor bad; the main character was a quiet, shy, frightened girl who was so terrified of what she had to do and yet knew she had to do it and so gained the strength for it; the other main viewpoint character was a scribe who was working with a tomb-robber in order to get water for his desperately ill sister. And then there was the little god... *huggles him*Oh my gosh I'm still gibbering. Just...SO GOOD. I want the sequel and I want it now and I'm cursing myself for not buying it when I had the chance.

The main character is Mirany, and she is in her mid to early teens. The time period is thousands of years ago, and the setting has to be in a island somewhere near Egypt or Italy, in the Mediterranean Sea at least. The climate seems to be very tropical but some areas are deserts. The religion, which the whole story is based on is where they have a type of God/Man. This is very similar to a pharaoh. This person is called the Archon. Mirany and all the other girls with her are priestesses who perform rituals to the God above. Mirany's job is being the Bearer-of-the-God. This has to be the worst because she has to carry a bowl of killer scorpions!!! I could tell during the story that Mirany didn't like this very much. I wouldn't either.The whole plot is that the High-Priestess, Hermia, (who is said that the God speaks through her, supposedly), lies and tries to get a new Archon that she can control for her own benefit. Then the God speaks to Mirany and tells her where the real Archon is, whose name is Alexos. It turns out at the end that Mirany exposes Hermia the traitor. Through the story Mirany also works with Seth a scribe/tomb robber, and Oblek a serious drunk. My favorite part was when Mirany was put into the tomb and she almost suffocated.

Dean LeBaron has been one of the most successful money managers in recent times. He is also a gifted writer who together with his co-author, Romesh Vaitlingam an English consultant and financial journalist, has brought out this book and its companion, The Ultimate Book of Investment Quotations. Both are books which should not only be read and enjoyed for their enlightenment but they can be put into practice as well. The real genius of the authors in The Ultimate Investor is to have been able to bring into one book the wisdom of today's leading investment &quot;gurus&quot; ranging from Warren Buffett, George Soros, Charles Ellis, Peter Bernstein, Peter Lynch, George Russell to Dean LeBaron himself. The manner in which this is done is also rather unique: A set of facts on a given subject whether it be equities versus bonds, contrarian investments, fixed income, growth investing, emerging markets or what have you is followed by a response from the respective guru or expert on the subject. The result is an assembly of investment knowledge in 300 pages which one might easily say could be found in a wall to wall book shelf. This book should be read and studied as well as even practiced in some instances by portfolio managers, investment/financial advisors, market analysts, economists and investors who want to learn what is happening and not just blindly gamble away their assets.

It is a very successful analysis of concepts that defy precision. Without seeming glib or cavalier, Dean LeBaron provides a refreshingly honest format which highlights the issues that have plagued both individual and institutional investors. The Ultimate Investor exposes the limitations of various methods of investment analysis. The Counterpoint approach I find to be particularly useful. Whether it is Market Efficiency and Random Walk, Value Investing, Contrarian Investing, Quantitative Investing, Indexing or Technical Analysis, the authors fully explore the issues.

Es una obra que se puede leer en varios niveles. Es decir, se la puede tomar simplemente como una apasionante historia de secuestros, detectives e intrigas, o se puede ir mas alla y extraer el profundo mensaje que tiene.En esencia este es un libro en el que los personajes tratan de encontrar su mision en la vida, el significado de su existencia en este mundo y al final lograr aceptar el paso del tiempo apreciando que en cada etapa de nuestra vida tenemos algo que aprender y algo que ganar.Es un libro que lo recomiendo enteramente ya sea solo para pasar un buen rato leyendo una historia que te atrapa desde la primera pagina, o para quienes deseen comprender una muy interesante filosofia de vida."},{"Title":"La Hija del Canibal (Novela (Booket Numbered)) (Spanish Edition)","review":"&quot;La Hja del Canibal&quot; is a surprising book due to its style and depth of narrative. The book is an introspective view of the world, an exploration of ones self identity as related to person, relationships with partners and parents. These plots are cleverly intertwined in a plot in which the main character, Lucia, tries to solve the abduction of her husband Ramon.The style is clear and concise, the plot unfolds quickly and keeps the reader guessing and interested. However, the real value of the narrative centers on the apparent subplots (which, in my view, are the crux of the book), in which Lucia explores her womanhood, her relationships with others and the meaning of ones self-identity.I find it unfortunate that the title of the book--meaning the cannibal's daughter-- will likely be a turnoff, and would decrease its readership. If you read it, you will understand how the title is appropiate and that it has nothing to do with real-flesh eating, but of the symbolic consumption of ones identity by others."},{"Title":"La Hija del Canibal (Novela (Booket Numbered)) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Titulo: La Hija del Can&iacute;bal.

La autora ingeniosamente va relatando las vidas de cada uno de los tres, entre cap&iacute;tulo y cap&iacute;tulo, y pasado de un personaje a otro, como pasa a su vez de un relato en primera a un relato en tercera persona. Lo cierto es que F&eacute;lix, Luc&iacute;a y Adri&aacute;n se convierten en los mejores y m&aacute;s intimos amigos, se unen de una manera m&aacute;s estrecha de lo que normalmente se hace en familia, inclusive nace y crece una relaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s que &iacute;ntima sexual entre Luc&iacute;a y Adri&aacute;n.Cada cap&iacute;tulo nos regala una experiencia nueva, o se nos niega algo ya escrito por la autora, se nos van relatando las caracter&iacute;sticaspreocupaciones de cada una de las etapas que representan los protagonistas principales(de 20, 40 y 80), en fin es una caja de sorpresas, de realidades de la vida que son tan impresionantemente escritas, que nos transmite la clara idea de que puede haber muy bueno, como muy malo, pasi&oacute;n enceguecedora, como falta de ella, hombres viles, como nobles, etc. A su vez como en la historia h&eacute;roes, son recordados como cobardes, cobardes como h&eacute;roes.

The author describes the ancient medeival model of the trivium (the three stages of learning: grammer, dialectic and rhetoric) and urges a return to this time tested method of education in a reformed Christian context. Included are recommended reading lists. I consider this booklet essential reading for home educators."},{"Title":"Classical Education and the Homeschool","review":"This little book is an excellent introduction to the methods of Classical education, especially as it pertains to a Christian worldview. It is a quick and easy read, and (best of all) inexpensive.I do have a few critisms. [1] The authors tend to get off point a few times (we don't need a primer on Latin grammar in a book like this) [2] The bibliography tends to stay &quot;in the family&quot; of the contributing authors and lastly [3] I would expect superior writing style from promoters of Classical education."},{"Title":"Classical Education and the Homeschool","review":"The author provides a good background and justification for returning to the classical approach of teaching children. The reading lists are fairly good except for the suspicious inclusion of a number of texts written by the author. I felt that the chapter concerning centering your children's education around Christ sounded very emotionally charged which greatly contrasted the author's previous chapter on logic and argumentation. I don't disagree that the education of Christian children should be centered about Christ. I do think the author should have used the logical method of argumentation described in the previous chapters to argue his point rather than lapse into emotionally charged religious rhetoric that he (and Plato) disapproved of at the beginning of his text. The most overriding lesson I learned from this text, though, is one which more homeschooling and classical education advocates must learn and teach: providing your child with a education better than that which you were provided requires that you first obtain the education with which you are attempting to endow your children. For this reason (and that teensy little price up there) I highly recommend this book to anyone who is frustrated with the quality of public education in America whether or not you are considering homeschooling your child."},{"Title":"Classical Education and the Homeschool","review":"According to the authors, Catholics are not capable of giving their children a Classical Education because they are unbiblical and Thomists. The Catholic church not only built Western Civilization, it preserved all things Classical and through the monasteries carried forth education as well as the Classics from the Ancients.The book is not as well written as I would have expected from someone purporting a strong Classical education. And, there seemed to be a big disconnect between chapters. The authors obviously divvied up the chapters because there isn't a consistent feel between them, especially between Chapters 5 and 6 versus Chapter 7. The editors should have caught this.People buying the book should be aware it is anti-Catholic. I have not ever given a 1 star review to a book before.

I am a homeschooling mom of three, and I loosely follow the classical model, but the ideas in this book were frankly shocking. \\"resist the temptation to make education entertaining\\" if I did that, I'd lose the attention of my 5 year old in about 5 minutes, the others following shortly after. This book emphasizes learning through books alone, even among the youngest students, focusing on \\"language as opposed to communication by images\\" completely discounting that at least 2/3 of the population are not auditory learners. Over all I found this book not representative of the Classical Education model, but some twisted distorted view from those who look back upon history and color it under their own biases."},{"Title":"Classical Education and the Homeschool","review":"Quick read that does a great job summing up classical education/homeschooling. Even gives intro info about Latin and Logic study that I had never been exposed to."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"Morris West is one of those rare authors who can conjure up an excellent book from minimal material. A lot of his works centers around (or is linked with) the Catholic church of which he is an excellent and compassionate portrayer, even when he is being critical.Shoes of the Fisherman, one of his best, is a heart warming look at the Papacy. Starting with the esoterics of a papal election by acclamation (an unusual procedure) of Kiril Lakota, a virtual unknown, West sees the leader of the church not as the storied infallible pontiff but rather as an earnest human being, beset by his own frailties and needs as well as constrained by the inflexible traditions and bureaucracy of the Vatican. But in focusing on Lakota (and his fellows) as a human being, subject to the same weaknesses of all humanity, West makes one admire him all the more, for his willingness to carry the burden. As the head of a religious organizations that spans the seven continents and hundreds of different cultures, the pope must make huge decisions in lonely abstract while bearing in mind the ordinary man and woman who comprise the church. This is a tremendous responsibility and a near impossible task. In the process West looks at numerous sub-themes that still plague the church (though this book is sited at the peak of the Cold War), of marriage, of theology, of doctrine and of the clergy. He makes no judgments, but in painting the essential humanity of the players, West makes the institution of the church and the papacy not only more accessible to the reader, he also generates a more sympathetic understanding of both. This may not (as previous readers have remarked) be a book with a major plotline, but it is a book that, even at its darkest, maintains faith in humanity. Highly recommended, (though members of other religions may find some of the parts hard to follow)."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"This book (and the movie which derives from it) is remarkable, all the moreso because of the the amount of inadvertent prophecy that takes place during the course of it. 'Shoes of the Fisherman' is a phrase that is sometimes used to refer to the office of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome; the See of Peter, the Chair of Peter, etc., various other historical and scriptural references are a kind of ecclesial shorthand.This story takes place during the height of the Cold War, when it was not primarily a two-way confrontation, but rather seemed to threaten to become a three-way contest with the seeming emergence of China as a communist power independent from the Soviet Union. This book sets a looming crisis between the United States and Soviet Union as the primary issue, and concludes with a major conference for peace being called (we do not get to know the outcome of this, however, from the book).Archbishop Kiril Lakato, longtime political prisoner of the Soviet Union, is released (the exact reasoning for this we are never told) by his long-time captors. He is released to Rome, where he is installed as a cardinal for his faithfulness to the church. In quick succession after this, the pope dies, and an election takes place. Remarkably, Kiril the Russian is elected pope, after giving a moving account of his time in captivity to assembled cardinals weary of the election process, and shortly thereafter commits the church to a risky idea of intervention between the major powers, to the dismay of many of the fellow cardinals, who believe the new pope is following a dangerous path.Subplots include a very timid (by today's standards), and to a certain extent a bit distracting. The main issue (rather than the plot) is to explore the theological issues behind the papal election and the use of theology and politics in the modern church. Despite being written in the 1960s, the book in fact still rings true with many of the facets of this slow-to-change institution.What makes this book and its attendant film so remarkable is that it was released a full decade before the election of another pope from the communist block. In the 1960s it was considered very shocking to consider a non-Italian pope, much less one coming from behind the Iron Curtain. This of course had the prophetic ring when Karol (not Kiril) from Poland became pope.Another prophetic instance is in the ecclesiastical trial of the radical theologian -- during his defense, this theologian even uses the words that later theologians would use, who were silenced by the Roman order, and who finally had to leave the church to remain true to their convictions in some instances.Just how the author could have foreseen these so far in advance is a mystery."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"This is the book on which the 1968 movie, The Shoes of the Fisherman, was based. The movie is vastly different than the book. It would have to be. Much of the book is introspective, reflecting the thought processes of Pope Kiril I after he is elected and is a much drier read than the movie is a view, naturally. While I found the book informative and interesting, because of my interest in the Papacy, it is not an easy read. It took focused concentration to absorb all it had to offer.In the year this book was originally published, 1963, the real world was full of fear, anger, and starvation (some things never change). The cold war was almost 20 years old, and the West's fear of its consequences unabated. Fear of a nuclear holocaust was rampant; we were getting closer to a ground war in Vietnam. President Kennedy was assassinated in November of that year. Things weren't destined to get much better. The year the movie came out, 1968, we lost Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy to assassins. The real Pope in the real world had his hands full.The Shoes of the Fisherman is the story of the election of a Russian to the Papacy, one Kiril Lakota, who had been imprisoned in Siberia for 17 years (20 in the movie) and tormented by his jailer, Kamenev, who later becomes the head of the Soviet state. Lakota's ascent to the Papacy, and his actions as Pontiff, are related in this story. We learn about some of the Pope's brethren, Cardinal Leone and Cardinal Rinaldi, for example, who impart their own histories and personality traits to one another and, hence, to the reader. The George Faber of the book is very different than the one portrayed on film. One desperate world situation is dealt with in the film. In the book, there are many. Pope Kiril I is reminiscent of Pope John Paul II as the first to see the importance of traveling widely outside The Vatican; to visit his people spread across the earth.One character worthy of mention is theologian Jean T&eacute;l&eacute;mond. In his intense internal struggle to justify God to man, he writes. His writings, often in conflict with his elders, offer his own passionate views of God, Jesus, and the Church--its leaders, tenets, practices, and views, as they relate to the people of the world, and to science. He spent 20 years in exile because of his views, only to have same put on trial after \\"coming home.\\"The movie takes many liberties, simplifies and leaves out much, but doing so makes the whole of the book's message easier to digest. Like they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. The movie is a thousand pictures, pictures that help the reader understand the content and context of this excellent and thought-provoking novel.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"Raised Protestant by former Catholics, my view of religion has been a swirl of orthodoxy and free-thinking. With no regrets, I was hooked into the fiction of Morris West. Although \\"The Clowns of God,\\" \\"The Tower of Babel,\\" \\"Proteus,\\" and others provided thrillers rich in theological and political ideas, nothing quite captured me in the way of my first encounter with \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman.\\"West was a writer of Old World elegance and, sometimes, stiffness. His characters rarely spoke like actual people; they spoke like people trying to convey concepts that would be written down for the ages. Although somewhat archaic, there was a grace and richness to this perspective that always left me satisfied. In \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\\" more than any other West novel, I was challenged with questions of what the true gospel of Jesus is all about, and the true purpose of ministry in a world of hurting people. When the Pope decides to disguise himself so that he may enter the lives of normal people, we see an example of the Son of God coming to earth in the form of a man to touch human lives. With characteristic beauty, using fictitious papal journal entries, West gives us glimpses into the mind of those called to serve God.I, for one, miss the writing of Morris West and hope to one day see him on the other side. Until then, I hope his books are not lost to future generations. He has much to say that still applies to our modern world."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"I approached this book from the standpoint of a person interested in the Roman Catholic Church's papal traditions. And, indeed, there is much of that. However, what I found was an amazing work that touches upon the daily temptations and challenges to the human soul.Anyone who possesses a heart, who longs for some insight into the relationship with God and His creation, will find themself fulfilled with each turned page.One of the ironic things about The Shoes of the Fisherman is that its protagonist, Pope Kiril I, is the first pope of non-Italian descent -- nearly twenty years before the real event occurs. Kiril's reflections and meditations on the soul, God, and the direction of the chuch bears an uncanny resemblance to those of John Paul II.I feel myself not just a better Catholic for having read this book, but also one who understands better what the soul craves, and how to understand man's relationship with the Master.Perhaps the most important thing I have taken from Mr. West's book is the difference between the man centered on himself and the man centered on God. As someone who strives to work in the public sector, this is an unbelieveably crucial thing to understand."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"\\"The Shoes of the Fisherman\\" is a novel first published in 1963 which centers on the election and early reign of Pope Kiril I, a Russian, recently released from prison, whose secret appointment to the College of Cardinals was revealed by his dying predecessor upon his release from prison. The novel begins with the preparations for the conclave and the mechanism of Kiril's election.In the course of this novel, author Morris West weaves an intriguing collection of characters and themes though the book and into each others lives, all centering on Pope Kiril. The characters include a German-Jewish, American-Catholic widow trying to find meaning in her life in Rome, an American reporter, an Italian politician, the woman torn between them, a suppressed Jesuit theologian and assorted Curial officials. Summit correspondence channeled through Kiril adds a touch of diplomatic tension to the tale.The story which each of these characters brings to the novel grasps the attention of the reader One is tempted to try to find recent Popes in the person of Kiril. Is he Paul who started the tradition of Papal travelers? Is he John Paul the Wander, another \\"Light from the East\\", whose involvement in international power politics will be studied for years? The reader is well advised to resist the temptation to see history in this novel. The ultimate story is Kiril himself, Kiril the priest-counselor, the priest-confessor, Kiril the pastor, the Vicar of the Prince of Peace, but mostly the soul searching for God's will and reaching within himself for the courage to follow it. Through the book you will wonder about the characters who flow in and out of it. At the end you will focus on Kiril as he fathoms the mysteries of God. This is what you will keep in your mind and ponder in your heart."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"A heartwarming and profound novel about an Eastern European who surprisingly becomes pope. No, it's not a fictional account of the election of John Paul II -- it was written many years before the current Pope's election.Surrounding the main plot are a number of sub-plots dealing with the very human problems of abortion, infidelity, divorce, homosexuality, and many of the other issues which continue to plauge the world and the Church.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"First read this some 20 years ago and reread it recently.Was more enthralled the 2nd time.I liked that the author appears to have inside knowledge of the Vatican.He impresses us with it as he slowly unravels the story of Kiril Lakota,a cardinal from behind the iron curtain(when there was a curtain)who unexpectedly and reluctantly is elected Supreme Pontiff.Not being of the faith it was all a mystery to me and this story managed in a little way to de-mystify a few things.How they elect a pope for one! It dawns on the reader that even persons that high up have foibles and prejudices like us mere mortals.A comforting and worrying thought at the same time. A must for all Morris West fans."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"The author did a very nice job of illustrating how the church leaders can feel very compassionate towards a person or issue, yet the churches' position comes across as cold and condescending. The character development was excellent. I developed a sense of pity for the loneliness and isolation that the Pope must feel until death. The plots that only superficially involved the Pontiff were great and really kept the reader engaged. This book gave a very well rounded depiction of the papacy, Rome, and the questions facing the church today.My only problem with this book was that it was laden with verbose narratives about evolution, faith, eternity, and other complicated issues. The book did not quench my thirst for papal history and traditions, but this was fiction, so that will have to wait for another day and other book."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"This book was written 50 years ago and yet amazingly adds depth to the real history of changes in the Catholic Church and the political world. It could almost be the beginning a book about Saint in the making (John and the JohnPauls). The problems facing the characters really existed at the time of the story and still exist today. In today's world political conflicts, ethical conflicts and the problems of how to effect change while tightrope walking between extremes still plague leaders. The wisdom and faith of Kiral are still deeply inspiring. The way the book has foreshadowed the events of years after publication is incredible. The wisdom and faith of Kiral are still deeply inspiring.I wish that the publishers of this edition had proofread the pages before printing. There were many spellcheck type errors in this edition."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"In this book the autor points out with love to the detail the italian mentality and differences between the powerful and the servers, the north and the south, the one who know and the those who execute commands. At a certain point the story itself starts to lack in credibility but the author never goes beyond."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"Even if you saw the movie, you should read this book which opens up a variety of spiritual questions. You might be especially surprised, since viewing the movie is often seen as a Roman Catholic rite, that there is a strong homosexual element that is dealt with in the book which is not at all obvious in the movie. It's also a book about victoms and predators: the Pope and the dictator of the Soviet Union are comapared as opposites but also alter-egos.It all makes for an engrosssing story for anyone regardless of religious affiliation."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment. In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.The concept seems quite interesting at first: an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope. After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed. The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens. A large portion of the book consists of a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts from Lakota.On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated. I can honestly say it never got my full atention."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"The book arrived in good condition but it took almost three weeks for it to arrive from Florida.

By the end of the first chapter, the deceased Pope is buried, and a surprising new Pope is elected with surprising speed by the Conclave. At the time this book was written, West's choice to fill the Shoes of the Fisherman reference in the book's title probably was downright shocking. To the modern reader, it seems almost prophetic. While John Paul II was from Poland, rather than Russia, there are many similarities...both are relatively young Cardinals, from communist countries, who wish to travel around the world to go to the people.This book provides a glimpse into the inner workings of the Vatican and the highest reaches of the Church's leadership. It examines the limitations of the Pope's power and his ability to implement change. It also provides a look at the challenges facing the Church in its mission to the people, by providing a second story line about the relationships and struggles of some of the Church's subjects in and around Rome.This book is not a thriller, with a fast plot and a crisis around every corner. Instead, it is a character driven story of the struggles of people to come to terms with themselves and their beliefs. Certainly not as exciting as \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but perhaps more meaningful in its exploration of the role of faith in peoples lives."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by a good friend of mine and overall I enjoyed reading it, but I must let everyone know-- this book has no plot. The book starts out promising enough-- the election of a surpise pope. However, no major plot arcs emerge. Instead we get these minor plot arcs that we recognize as being secondary and yet they often take up large parts of this book as if they were major plot arcs. This left me wondering when the &quot;real&quot; story was going to happen, but sadly the most promising story arc that is hinted at all book (a major meeting for peace between the US and Russia) never happens.But this is a well written book for what it is. West does a great job in developing the complicated character of this new pope as well as many of his advisors. West also does a great job in showing the immense complexities of the modern papacy (so many countries, so many different competing interests) while still showing a great compassion for the ordinary man and woman. It's this compassion that is perhaps most striking and the most powerful component of the book. Read this book for its emotions and its ideas, not for its plot."},{"Title":"The Shoes of the Fisherman","review":"An eery harbinger of John Paul II, this film illustrates the paradox faced by the church as it faces the twentieth, and ultimately, the twenty-first centuries.

Italy is a democracy that walks the tightrope between the extremists of the right and the left.

And Matucci has to decide how much to pay for his survival in face of a threatened coup; his life, his soul, his love for Lili Anders, one-time spy and now his mistress.This is a novel of the intrigue, the violence, the passion that is Italy; the decisions are those that face us all at one time or another.Read the complete book before you judge it.

The author gives a number of cases of almost certain and highly probable ancient cancers. He also states, quite correctly, that because 90% of present day cancers occur in people over 55...and...because most ancient people died before 55, we can reasonably expect that few ancient remains will show evidence of cancer.Besides that, the vast majority of ancient remains consist of bone, more often than not incomplete skeletons and, bony lesions secondary to cancer are present in the minority of cases, even today, the incidence of detectable ancient cancers is reduced even further.These, and other problems associated with examination of ancient remains means that detectable ancient cancers will be uncommon enough to render statistical analysis and comparisons with present day cancers virtually impossible. About all we can say is that ancient cancers did exist and are occasionally detectable especially as osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases. Like many other pathology experts, I think the author makes a mistake to emphasize the role of 'carcinogens'. Unfortunately this term has become almost synonymous with 'mutagens' which is surely a mistake. He mentions ancient and present day astestos which is a carcinogen but not a mutagen. He suggests that certain cancers might be expected to be less common in ancient people because of the absence of modern day, industrial 'carcinogens'. Maybe a little bit but my thought is that such modern day 'pollutants' increase cancer incidence only slightly."},{"Title":"Introducing Cultural and Media Studies: A Semiotic Approach","review":"Very good condition, postage and shipping process a bit slow and I was disappointed that the book was so cheap, but ended up costing nearly the same price of buying it new in a retail store because of the shipping charges, so I probably wouldn't buy something like that again."},{"Title":"Regents English Workbook 3: Advanced, New Edition","review":"I use the Regents English Workbook to help students who can't grasp basic grammar.

There have been numerous streamliner books published over the years, some of them coffee table genre, some for the hard-core railfan. Again, this book falls somewhere in between.There are some very interesting photos in this book - some of which I have not seen before. Many others are run-of-the mill, and are not much different than could be found in other books.What makes this book different, however, is that it is divided among designers of the streamliner trains. Lowey, Kuhler and the EMD Styling Group, to just name some of them, are all profiled here exhbiting their best work.In addition to the photos of the trains and their designers, there are reproductions of advertisements and other nostalgic documentation. The book's timeline starts in the 30's and ends with the Amtrak takeover of the Santa Fe Superchief.If you are a collector of streamliner books, then it could be an interesting addition to your collection.

(I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in \\"Northwest Passage\\" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway \\"Northwest Passage,\\" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting \\"true life\\" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but \\"Northwest Passage\\" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.\\"Northwest Passage's\\" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts' &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is one of the great novels of the 1930's. Little remembered now, it is the story of Major Robert Rogers and the early Rangers of the French and Indian War. Most of the book is an accurate description of what occured during that time period, and one gets an incredible feel for the hardships and calamities that befall these men. The book is written in the first person as the narrator is one of the Major's trusted associates; the story involves both men and their lives together in the wilderness and much later when their paths cross once again near the end of the 18th Century. Rogers himself commanded the first real &quot;commando&quot; unit and he is the father of all subsequent outfits like the Green Berets, the Navy Seals etc. Kenneth Roberts was one of the great historical fiction writers of his day and anyone who is interested in this time period would be wise to read this book. It is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's best-known nonfiction magazine writers back during the heyday of the Saturday Evening Post. One of his best-known articles was a profile of Hitler following the Beer Hall Putsch, which became a book in its own right at a time when no one in America knew who Hitler was.Beginning in the mid-1930s, Roberts wrote a series of brilliant but erratic historical novels about America in the late 1700s, set in his beloved Maine or in neighboring Boston and Portsmouth, NH. \\"Northwest Passage\\" (which was serialized by the Post) was his masterpiece and the most popular book in America for two years during the 1930s, although it's barely remembered today (or, if remembered, known only as the source for a mediocre Spencer Tracy movie of the same name).The book is the story of a real person, Major Robert Rogers, a miltary leader from pre-Revolutionary America whose unit, Rogers' Rangers, was America's first to fight \\"Indian-style\\" (in other words, to fight battles the way we fight them today). Rogers' great success in warfare led to him becoming one of the colonies' first published authors, a star in London, and later the royal governor of Michilimackinac (the fort at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan ... and the land westward), but his unwillingness to join with pluderers who wanted to loot the British and colonial treasuries in the name of the Crown led to his arrest and unwarranted disgrace ... and to his ultimate decision to side with the British during the American Revolution, like Roberts' other main hero, Benedict Arnold (\\"Arundel\\" and \\"Rabble in Arms\\").This novel is made up of two very different but intricately-plotted books. Book 1, which ranges in place from Harvard College to the British Army during the French and Indian Wars and the New England art world, tells the story of a young man, Langdon Towne, who becomes Rogers' personal secretary during Rogers' Rangers' expedition to destroy the town of St. Francis, home of the native group most hostile to the New England settlers. Book 2, which begins in London, crosses back to upstate Michigan and the Dakota lands, and then returns to London, tells the story of Towne's advancement as an artist and his involvement with Rogers' plan to discover the Northwest Passage.The reason that this book rates 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with a writing issue that must be mentioned. Roberts' friend Booth Tarkington served as \\"editor\\" of the first three-quarters of the book, and the Roberts-Tarkington prose is stellar. However, under severe time pressure to finish the second half of the book (due to its smash-hit status), Roberts wrote the last quarter without Tarkington's help, and the change in writing quality is jarring -- especially as it comes right during the most historically-important and dramatically-important section of the book, Rogers' betrayal by his Northwest Passage expedition commanders and by his British and American enemies. Roberts had offered Tarkington co-writing credit, which Tarkington refused, but this justaposition of styles shows just how critical Tarkington's help was. The plot continues smoothly, though, even if the writing doesn't.One more point: in researching and writing this book, Roberts uncovered (after two years of searching, and just before publication of Book 2) the actual court-marshal transcripts of the two court-marshals with which Rogers was involved, which were believed to have been destroyed by Rogers' enemies -- and both supported Roberts' sympathetic treatment of Rogers. Thus, not only was this book incredibly popular, but it was significant for historical research as well. What more can you ask from one book?"},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I first discovered Northwest Passage at a library while I was still in high school, and ever since then I have been a confirmed Kenneth Roberts fan. His ability to bring the frontier and its characters alive is uncanny and unmatched by any other author I've ever read. His research into the foods, weapons, country and historical events he writes about is unparalleled, and each character in all of of his novels seems so real it sometimes becomes diffcult to determine if they were real or not. Mingling real-life historical figures such as George Washington, Benedict Arnold and others, with fictional characters such as Steven Nason, Cap Huff, and other truly unforgettable creations, lends them a credibility that results in history coming alive. One's understanding of historical events and people that have become blase' over the years is competely turned upside down and inside out as you gain new insight and understanding of what happened, why it happened and what it meant through Roberts' masterful writing backed up by exhaustive research into his subjects and events. The characters not only are drawn larger than life in all their strengths and weaknesses, but as they move through several of Roberts' novels and are observed and encountered differently when viewed from different perspectives, we begin to realize that history is not static but is dynamic and alive. Example: RABBLE IN ARMS and OLIVER WISWELL are both books about the American Revolution, but written from diametrically opposite viewpoints ! RABBLE IN ARMS follows the struggle of the colonists to free themselves from England's grip as envisioned from the rebellious colonists' perspective, while OLIVER WISWELL is about the very same events written from the perspective of a Loyalist; many of the very same characters populate both novels, but the view one gets of them is so different from one to the other of the books that it hardly seems as if at first they are about the same thing. Additionally, OLIVER WISWELL is an outstanding exploration of the Loyalist cause and why they believed we would all be better off to remain loyal subjects of England.I've read all of Roberts' books, and have a first edition of OLIVER WISWELL purchased for $3.00 from a used bookstore with an original newspaper review that had been tucked inside the book by the original purchaser. The review is of the novel itself, and after reading that review from more than 60 years ago, it is very apparent over the years the very high and well-deserved reputation of Roberts has not diminished.My recommendation is: read them. Read them all !! You will never find finer writing or an author with a keener appreciation of his subject matter and the period about which he writes than Kenneth Roberts. All of Roberts' books should be reprinted, again and again, as they were when they were first published (check the frontispieces to see how many times his novels have been re-printed over the years --- it's astounding!). Every person who reads Roberts becomes a devotee and a reader for life, and every one to whom you loan a copy of any of his novels will then be someone with whom you can share the pure pleasure of having read a Kenneth Roberts novel, and there are many of us out there. Welcome to the astounding, incredible world that will soon be at your fingertips!"},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Northwest Passage:Kenneth Roberts was the premier historical fiction author of his day. What starts out as a simple French and Indian War tale of a daring raid on the St. Francis Indian village by Major Robert Rogers, eventually spans North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. Roberts' descriptions of wilderness warfare and survival bespeak his excruciatingly thorough research and knowledge of eighteenth century America, to the point where you might wonder if he was actually there. His battle scenes are unsparingly violent and brutal, even by today's standards, but the whole novel is infused with a quaint romanticism, that is usually avoided in modern literature. In Robert's works, warfare is bloody, and politics unsavory, but noble spirits and strong hearts prevail. Anyone who likes historical fiction, art history, or adventure travel, would do well to start with Northwest Passage."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts is my favorite novelist so this review may be somewhat biased, but Northwest Passage truly is a book people should read. It is gripping, a book I had a difficult time setting down. Roberts had a style that was unique in that the reader can many times feel the sensations he is describing. When the soldiers were hungy and were failing at hunting, Roberts could create a sensation of hunger and frustration. When he described the streets of London, the reader feels like he/she is actually there.This book is wonderful. It's full of lively, intelligent characters and solid story plots. It is as good a represtation of colonial America as was ever done in the form of a novel. Hopefully it will remain a timeless classic forever."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"As a history buff, Revolutionary War reenactor and New Englander, I was interested in reading about this author who I'd never heard of from my area. Although this story is historical fiction, the events mentioned (and many of the characters) are real. The amount of detail the author was able to put in this book is staggering. Once you start reading this story you will be dragged into the daily struggles of the many characters. In addition, you'll better understand the trials of the native Americans and how they suffered and were taken advantage of. There was a 1940 movie by the same name starring Spencer Tracy which follows the book pretty closely. Unfortunately the movie only takes in the first half of the book. Since reading this book, I have read 4 other historical novels by Kenneth Roberts and enjoyed each one. He is a prolific writer and has taken great pains to portray the events and their details in an easy reading style. Sit down with this book on a snowy evening in front of your fire and be transported back to the 18th century. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I was fourteen years old when a family friend gifted me on my birthday with Rabble in Arms in Hungarian translation. It took no little trouble and risk to locate other works by Roberts in Communist controlled Hungary. Northwest Passage was the second book by Roberts I read and this as well as all other works in Roberts 'Chronicles of Arundel' series sold me on the US. Northwest Passage is the story of revenge within the framework of the French and Indian War, a fantastic account of courage, endurance and heroism. It is also the story of one man, Major Robert Rogers; one man's life at its zenith, as he relentlessly inspires his men to superhuman performance; also at its nadir, as he descendes into debauchery, debt, and succumbs to disease. The narrator, Langdon Towne, aspiring artist, only matters insofar as he is the one,(in first person, as many of Roberts' protagonists do,) who tells the story. His viewpoint is that of a participant, not an outside observer, and this makes the story come alive even more than it otherwise would have.It is one of Roberts' masterful works. It lost nothing in translation although I consider myself fortunate to have many of Roberts' works in their first editions.It is my uderstanding that Roberts' works had been translated into over 52 languages. If any of those translation are as well done as the Hungarian version Roberts should be a universally celebrated and rewarded author.Northwest Passage is true classic. Even though the movie with Spencer Tracy now seems obsolete this deserves a remake that should closely follow the book. I wouldn't recommend changing anything just go by the book. I sure would go and see it. As it is I have the book and have enjoyed reading and rereading it over the many years."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I've spent a lot of time on the history surrounding the actual events of Rogers Rangers raid on the Abenaki village of Odanak in 1758.

Good historical escapist fun and drama."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Somehow I only recently got around to reading Northwest Passage, even though it is better known and deals with an earlier period in American history than than the Roberts novels on which I started, such as Arundel and Oliver Wiswell. I'm glad I waited.Other reviewers have commented on the differences between the first and second halves of the novel. Not only are they stylistic, but the scope of the story widens dramatically in part 2. Here's where reading NWP out of order helped, though, because the other novels created a context that made the dramatic shifts more understandable than they might have been otherwise.Without giving any spoilers, all of Roberts' usual themes are here, including betrayal, corruption, and a fairly cynical attitude towards women.All in all, great, thrilling stuff, of a type that isn't really done any longer. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Set in Colonial America during the French and Indian War, historical novelist Kenneth Roberts' Northwest Passage is an epic work about the larger-than-life Major Rogers and the artist Langdon Towne who joins Rogers' Rangers.

The vibrant style and witty dialogue in Northwest Passage greatly influenced my own historical fiction novel, Horse Dreamer.

This novel is literary art at its highest form."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"This is historical fiction at its finest. As you may have already gathered by previous reviewers, the tale begins in pre-Revolutionary War New England, and centers around the actions of a fictional protagonist (Langdon Towne, aspiring artist) and an historical counterweight of heroic-tragic proportions (Major Robert Rogers). The plot transitions to England & then back to the US. During this time you are witness to the ascendancy of one and the fall of the other.The story is exceptionally well crafted & engagingly written.

However, the novel did not sit well with me: it's really two books in one. The first part deals with Robert Rogers' St. Francis raid- our fictional protagonist joins Roger's Rangers on the eve of their raid on St. Francis. This tale is briskly told, conveying the dangers and hardships of the mission, weaving historical figures into the narrative and accurately (as far as I can tell) portraying the details of the mission. In this first half (350 pages) of the novel, author Roberts deftly explores tensions between the British regulars and their Provincial counterparts; as well as portraying the ambivalent attitudes of both toward Native Americans. All in all, the first half of the novel is a brisk, rousing historical adventure. The book started to lose me in the second half, however. The life of our fictional protagonist, Langdon Towne, continues to revolve around that of his former Captain, Robert Rogers, as Rogers' life descends into a Dickensian drama. Rogers attempts to parlay his military prowess into fame, fortune, and a personal empire in Britain's newly acquired Western territories. Rogers is no match, however, for the politics and skullduggery of imperial management, as he deals with- and runs afoul of- people like Charles Townshend, Edmund Burke, Sir William Johnson, and Jeffrey Amherst. Constantly scorning authority, the alcoholic, womanizing Rogers winds up in debtor's prison in London before returning to America to raise another Ranger contingent to fight the upstart American rebels. This second part of the tale could have been told much more efficiently; it was hampered by a contrived, melodramatic romance and repetitive ruminations on the relationships between Indians and whites in the Western territories. I almost gave up on the second half of the book. If readers find themselves losing interest after the first 350 pages, I'd advise letting it go- enjoy the tale of the St. Francis raid, but you won't miss much by dropping the book after that."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"True, the language is archaic (published 1937) and the vocabulary at times daunting (we've dumbed down quite a bit since 1937).

It not only enhanced my appreciation for New England and American history, it kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through Book 1.

Last of the Mohicans, Drums Along the Mohawk, etc...) by James Fenimore Cooper surpass this one to some extent but this one is still entertaining and is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Northwest Passage is an almost perfect historical novel .

This is a sad fact because besides being an excellent researcher and historian Mr. Roberts was an excellent writer. Because he excels in two categories (research and writing skills) he would be a perfect fit for any High School class studing 20th century American Writers and their various styles.Northwest Passage: as others mentioned this novel is broken into two sections. The first section is a pure adventure story - perfectly told. The second section is more internal, a little slow and a little long. Taken together they bring to life a few hardy Americans just before and during the American revolution.This novel is for you if you are interested in: American revolutionary history, adventure stories, American Indians, good writing skills, books that read quickly and last longer than a night or two.This book gets 4 stars only as a way to differentiate it from \\"Arundel\\" by Mr. Roberts which, in my opinion, is a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I received this book on time and its condition is excellent. The book is clean, the cover is new, not a mark on the book. Great."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"This tale, cast as a memoir by a fictional acquaintance of the historical Robert Rogers who gained fame in colonial America for creating and leading \\"Rogers' Rangers,\\" is lengthy but compellingly told, especially in its first part. As others have noted, the first section, which recounts how young Langdon Towne, an aspiring artist from New England, finds himself on the run from local authorities and thrust into the arms of the Rangers is fast paced, vivid and exciting narration. Towne and a companion soon end up enlisted in the Rangers on the eve of their departure for the Indian town of St. Francis where French-supported Indians who have been terrorizing the New England colonists are based. Under the spying eyes of French and Indian scouts in the latter years of the French and Indian War, Rogers' Rangers depart the British stronghold of Crown Point and, led by the indomitable Rogers, succeed in making the lengthy and difficult passage in secret to St. Francis where, in a surprise attack, they slaughter the Indians dwelling there. The return home to safety turns out to be the real challenge though as Major Rogers must herd and cozzen his failing and soon starving troops back to New England via a different path in order to avoid retaliation by the French and Indians of Canada.The long trek back nearly kills them all though many finally get through thanks only to the unyielding will and capacity for outthinking his opponents that Major Rogers reveals, thus gaining the hero worship of young Langdon Towne and others in their company. Toward the end of the journey back, nearly starved and dead, it is Rogers who manages the final leg to bring back help for what remain of his men and, in so doing, he earns the undying gratitude of the colonials and the British Army itself. But Rogers is a man who needs action and who dreams big and he has begun to think of something that only the boldest have dreamt of, finding the Northwest Passage through North America to the shores of Japan and China. Young Langdon returns to his hometown of Kittery, a coastal settlement northeast of Massachussetts, to take up his old life which he finds no easy task, under the circumstances. Still, despite the respect he has now earned from his neighbors, he eventually decides to pursue his artistic inclinations and, disappointed in love, finally takes ship for England. The second part of the tale is rich in the London of the period as young Towne works to earn his living as a painter so that he can one day return to America to paint Indians. But Rogers shows up in London, too, and before long they have resumed their former close relationship with Towne hero worshipping the great man. Rogers is working to get support from the English aristocratic class and, especially, from the king himself, for the expedition to discover the Northwest Passage and promises to take Langdon Towne with him when he goes.Meanwhile, Towne is enlisted in a task laid on him by Rogers' personal secretary, one Natty Potter, to find the lost daughter of the secretary's disparate youth. In a complex series of events, Rogers seems to get what he is after, all the while drinking heavily and carousing with the London upper crust, while Langdon, through Rogers' good offices, achieves some respectability as an artist himself. Returning to the Americas, his relationship with Rogers restored, Langdon Towne affiliates himself with the larger than life adventurer once more and soon finds himself in Michilimakinac, at the juncture of the Great Lakes where Rogers means to establish himself and branch out from there to discover the elusive Northwest Passage. But things don't go as smoothly as the relatively simple operation that destroyed St. Francis had and Rogers soon finds himself embroiled in a political battle with the influential Sir William Johnson, His Majesty's Indian Agent (and friend of the Iroquois Confederation), who aims to retain a monopoly on the Indian trade at all costs. Rogers' plans get in the way of Johnson's objectives and the two are set on a collision course.There is as rich a detailing of wilderness life in this part of the book as in the first half though we never see the Indians themselves in any great depth. But the narrative threads are less taut as the tale shifts from one of adventure against deadly adversity to the complex interactions of numerous personalities against the backdrop of the Johnson-Rogers feud over Indian control. In the end the forceful and energetic Rogers is undone by the subtler and more cunning Johnson (aided and abetted by the shortsightedness of Rogers' own supporters in London who tie his hands rather than fund his plans, to which they have supposedly signed on) and all of the major's dreams come crashing down upon him. A lately discovered betrayal by the major of his young protege's personal interests turns Langdon Towne against Rogers too, as he soon sets out to rescue his damsel-in-distress, spirited away from him to Montreal.The rest of the novel brings Towne at last back to London and his lady love -- and, surprisingly, Rogers, too, though the latter is no longer in the condition or state in which he had once been wont to appear. Eliciting Towne's sympathetic assistance in a Debtor's Prison in London, Rogers wins back at least a modicum of his old friend's loyalty, albeit without the same level of respect, and the two part again, Towne to become the artist he had dreamed of being and Rogers to move onto other ventures and unachievable dreams. With the onset of the Revolutionary War, Rogers returns yet again, though now on the wrong side as far as the colonists are concerned for he is still serving the British. But the man, whatever his skills on the battlefield in guerrilla war has become but a shadow of his former self and so the story fades with the fading of Major Robert Rogers himself.Kenneth Roberts has penned a worthy novel which strikes true to the historical record and populates his pages with vividly drawn characters, not least of whom is the larger than life Robert Rogers. That the historical Rogers ended up on the wrong side in the Revolutionary War goes a long way toward explaining why his name and fame largely faded from America's historical record.Stuart W.

Do not waste your time or money on this book. It does not go into any depth whatsoever, many of the thereoms shown were just pulled out of the authors hat without any proof of any kind. I honestly, had a hard time staying awake as I would read it, since it is so dull. It places far too much emphasis on phony applications and almost known on good solid theory. I only wish I could give this book a negative rating."},{"Title":"Finite Mathematics for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences","review":"This book is not nearly as bad as the other reviews indicate. I teach a course in finite mathematics at the college level and I examined it for possible adoption as a textbook. While it is not the best text I have seen, so I will not be using it, the quality is just below that of the book I use. Therefore, I would have no trouble using this book in my class.The coverage in college courses in finite mathematics is standard and this book adheres to those standards. Topics are introduced via worked examples; there are exercises at the ends of the sections and review questions at the end of the chapters. The writing is clear, and the explanations are thorough. Solutions to the odd numbered exercises and all of the review exercises are included. While I hesitate to strongly recommend this book as a text, there is no delay in saying that it is one of the better options available."},{"Title":"Finite Mathematics for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences","review":"This was the required text for my Finite Mathematics class. There is absolutely no detailed information. Students have virtually no tools to apply to problem solving.

Slow painful torture is preferable to the struggle one faces when trying to make progress through this textbook."},{"Title":"Finite Mathematics for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences","review":"I teach Finite Mathematics at the community college level, and have no problem with this textbook. While the book is not uniquely good, I think that some of the complaints leveled against the text are a little off-base. First, the book does not assume that the student has no calculator. Many sections include an addendum showing how to perform the pertinent tasks on their calculator, and the book includes a calculator tutorial.Further, while it is true that the textbook doesn't dedicate much energy to theorems, that is somewhat irrelevant. This is an applied mathematics text; it exists to show a student how to use concepts. It does not exist to discuss the origin of these concepts. That is beyond the scope of the text, and presumably beyond the scope of any course utilizing the book.This is a perfectly usable textbook, but don't expect miracles. Many students will see matrices and mathematical game theory for the first time in this text. Doing Gauss-Jordan by hand is slow, tedious work. The book can't change these types of facts. As always, math is a language.

The text is little more than a workbook; it has little explanation to go along with the problems you will get assigned as homework. I attend a large university so compounding this problem is the level of math this text is for, freshmen. Freshman classes are taught by \\"lecturers\\", or graduate students who, while very knowledgeable of their field, have little or no teaching experience so prove to not be able to effectively fill in the numerous blanks this book leaves. Also, these size of these classes tend to be in the hundreds and with the lecturer himself/herself being a student as well, can not devote the time needed to teach this subject because of the strains their own course loads put on them. Also this book claims that it \\"aims to provide students with the quantitative skills needed for their chosen fields and to lay the foundation for more advanced courses in mathematics.\\"(qtd. by Amazon from Book News, Inc.) My college uses this text for Business Mathematics but having worked before attending college I can not recall some of the examples in the book as being used in my office...ever. As an example the book uses the old \\"bag full of different colored marbles, probability of pulling out a given color\\" exercise. There is also the \\"5 people on a row of 8 seats in a movie theater different combinations\\" exercise. That might have been just the example the lecturer picked but I saw no real exercises in accounting and such. The book also assumes that there is no software or calculators in existence to figure out compund interest and such other things so one has to painfully struggle through word problems with one example that is supposed to fit the dozens of different problems given in the book. So, if you are a weak math student like me, prepare to ask lots of questions and go to office hours regularly to beg for help when this book has no explanations. All in all this book leaves you scratching your head unless you already know the math concepts in the book(in which case you should not be taking a class that uses this text). Anyone who has a choice of what text to get should avoid this one. Also, if you can take a course with a different text then by all means do so.

I was disappointed with this book as Paine states that Jesus Christ was \\"a virtuous and amiable man\\" and that he sees no reason for not believing that people like Mary, Joseph and Jesus existed. Where did Paine get his info that Jesus was virtuous and amiable? He doesn't say. He provides nothing in the way of evidence to support the notion that Jesus Christ was a real person.At least he points out the purpose of religion: to terrify and enslave mankind. I think he wastes too much time on the absurdities of that tedious and unpleasant book, the old testament. In fact, in one footnote he admits that the old testament is \\"too ridiculous for criticism\\". So why waste so much time on it?I found the letters to Samuel Adams at the back of the book more interesting and perhaps he could have covered some of the topics of these in his book, e.g. the act of prayer as an abomination that indicates that the person who prays is the sort of person who either distrusts God or who wishes to dictate to him.Overall, not bad."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine was right on then in the context of his time.

I would say this book proves that the bible does not live up to it's word and is therefore suspect.And oh my goodness. It seems as if some x-ians do not even know their own bible. It doesn't say God just created light. That preceeds the verse when God said that he seperated the light from darkness with that light.Any open-minded person would realize that. Then, later in Genesis 1:14-19, it seems as if God repeats himself. The easiest explanation for this is that he/she/it doesn't exist. Of course to some x-ians that isn't enough, but if it were actually a coherent story from an omnipotent deity, it wouldn't contradict itself."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"If you want a little more paine than what is written in common sense, this is definately worth your while!"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This book is most certainly a very illuminating and controversial account written by a man who found the dogma of the Christian religion burdensome and somewhat unfulfilling. I personally feel that Paine's attitudes were primarily a reaction against Christian fundamentalism and dogma, and it is clear that Paine failed to appreciate that the true spirit of Christianity resides far deeper than the dogmatic framework of fundamentalism and regulations.At the time this book was written (in the 1700's), Christian fundamentalism and its narrow minded message of eternal damnation for all non-Christians, was promulgated at a far more extreme level than it is today. Of course, there are still fundamentalists today, but I feel many Christians are waking up to the fact that dogma, Biblical literalism, and narrow minded regulations are far from what the true spirit of Christianity is all about.In the 1700's, it was asserted by almost all Christians that every other world religion was &quot;wrong&quot;, and that all non-Christians would spend an eternity without God - even though I feel that many of these fundamentalists had failed to find any kind of spiritual peace in their dogma in the first place. Contrary to what Paine believed back then, I feel many religious folk who know anything about spirituality happily accept that all religions are in touch with the same thing - the Word - or whatever other label we may choose to call Him. Christians (such as myself) believe that God made the ultimate divine revelation through Jesus Christ, even though many Christians do not believe that Christianity is the ONLY path to God. Rather, they believe that the WORD is the only way. (There's a difference, which doesn't contradict Jesus' message in John 14.6).Spiritual faith is an issue which should be greatly respected, and Paine himself possessed a lot of faith in believing that there is one God, a life after death, and that his Deity was good - without any kind of Holy Scripture to base his faith upon. (There is certainly nothing in nature which reveals these issues - Paine claimed that Creation itself was his Deity's scripture to mankind).With regard to the Bible, Paine failed to appreciate the nature of figure of speeches and metaphors, which many Christians clearly see as reflecting deep, spiritual truths. Indeed, it is quite obvious that Holy Books such as the Bible ought not be approached in the same way a scientist would approach a literal account of the make up of a plant cell, for instance. Many of Paine's objections to the Bible can be easily refuted by simply breaking out of literalism.Indeed, a number of reviewers below who claim that the Christian message is a &quot;myth&quot;, themselves possess a lot of faith that Jesus was a liar and that the four writers of the gospels were also liars who made up an unprecedented story just for the sake it.Paine failed to appreciate the spiritual meaning of the Christian message, which is a message that I personally find makes a lot of sense. 'Sin', (which is anything 'not-Godly'), is inherent to mankind due to our natural, fallible ways. So God made the perfect sacrifice in order for us to enter into communion with Him without us being 'spiritually dirty', (for want of a better phrase). Hell, according to the Bible, is a spiritual realm where God is not, and the descriptions of Hell reveal exactly what Jesus has saved us FROM.Paine's book is useful because it reveals that many people's outlook toward the Christian faith is directed more at the dogma, biblical literalism, and narrow minded regulations. Really, the heart of Christianity is oriented toward spirituality, inner-strength, inspiration, fulfilment and liberation. It was this spiritual heart that Paine, and many other people, have failed to appreciate and have failed to discover.To me, this book is good for revealing a doubter's perspective, which fails to appreciate the deeper side of Christian spirituality."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Just buy it....that's all I can say.."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"In his book, &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, Thomas Paine, attempts, with some success, to destroy the two Western religions, i.e. Christianity and Judiasm. His major thrust is to undermind the Bible, by pointing out some irregularities in the text. He also attacks the morals of the Hebrews in the Old Testament(i.e. slaugtering the people of Canaan), and those in control of the Christian religion. These points are convincing, and I have not yet read a rebuttal of them, but not convincing enough to discredit either religon. On the downside, he gives himself way too much credit for liberating us from such &quot;faults&quot;, and many of the things he attacks don't seem quite as ridiculous as he believes them to be. Also, I find it interesting to see that Mr. Paine's 'Republican Religion', that is Deism, is all but dead, at least in form, yet Christianity and Judiasm continue along as they have for centuries. As a Christian, I found the book intellectualy stimulating, but nothing earth-shattering."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine in his work considers Christianity as pure myth. His reasons for doing so are rather weak as he attempts to validate his work by apparent contadictions. Paine and others of his ilk (Voltaire, Rosseau) embraced the French Revolution and its logical conclusion in the Reign of Terror. The madness only stopped when Napoleon ended the revolution. So much for &quot;Free&quot; thinking men who believe that man is the measure of all things."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"The greatest thing about &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is that it makes the reader think rather than blindly follow the herd. However, there are serious problems with the book from there on out that make it inherenty untenable.Consider Paine's argument that he can't accept the Bible because it is someone else's revelation and therefore hearsay--using this logic, we can't accept what Paine says as fact because the ideas presented are his own revelation to himself, meaning that it's all hearsay to us, his readers.Furthermore, Paine's argument in favor of &quot;reason&quot; in accepting or rejecting religion is fatally flawed. First of all, subscribing to a supernatural belief system, by its very nature, is an act of faith--reason is not even relevant when you're taking something on faith. And secondly, Paine himself is relying on faith rather than reason when he claims that God is evident through the creation of nature. How does he know God made nature? Where is his proof? How does he know it didn't get there all by some great cosmic accident? The answer is: he can't know. He's taking it on faith that God made nature--just as much faith, in fact, as a Judeo-Christian uses to believe in the word of the Bible. Deism, which still embraces a belief in God, is an odd stance to take for someone who spends an entire book ripping another belief system to shreds.Indeed, Paine's hostility toward Judeo-Christianity makes him more suited to be an outright atheist than a Deist, and one has to wonder whether Paine would have been an atheist had he lived today, with all the scientific/evolutionary information available to him that was not available at the time of his writing. Either that, or he would have become a Buddhist, since Buddhism requires no belief in anything supernatural and asks its followers to focus only on the here and now, because that's all there ever is. This approach would have suited Paine very well.As for the rest of us, I believe that all of us can truly only call ourselves agnostics. We can want to believe in a God, but there is no way of proving his existence, neither through nature nor a supposedly holy book.And as for the Bible itself, Paine is just as off-target in trying to interpret the Bible factually and scientifically as are the fundamentalist zealots who take every word at face value. A holy book is to be looked at for the lessons it teaches, not taken as literal and not analyzed for mistakes and contradictions. Both approaches are ludicrous.Paine also proves in this book that he's somewhat of a hypocrite. He quotes liberally from the Bible to advance many of his views in &quot;Common Sense,&quot; yet here he trashes that same Bible as superstitious nonsense. Apparently the Bible was useful to Paine only when it helped to promote his own cause.If nothing else, though, &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; does dispel the myth that all of our Founding Fathers were fundamentalist Christians. I'm sure that some were, but many--Jefferson and Franklin included--were in the Deist camp with Paine."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I rate it as a very interesting critique of the Bible. He is very critical of the Bible as a history book. He is shocked by all the violence. I think he is correct. However, he has not found anything in the book that is worth taking seriously. I'm not sure if I agree with him. I still like to read the Bible."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"The Age of Reason is a brilliant defense of freethought and freedom of religious belief. Paine is NOT an atheist as claimed by fanatical believers. Paine is a Deist and an opponent of atheism. Paine dissects the Bible's origins, falsehoods, fables and contadictions. Paine had tremendous courage in writing this since religious belief is usually the most fanatical and anti-intellectual when it's fangs are extended. Paine wrote this to enlighten the human mind and show how organized religion warps the mind and causes reason and investigation to become trumped by superstition, metaphysics, and revelation. A great book to open the mind."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"When reading the Bible, read it in a literal and logical manner. Taking each sentence of the word of God to be gospel and you will probably come to the same questions and conclusions that Thomas Paine, the author did in 1794.Make no mistake, this book will not be enjoyed by many. It is an attack on Christianity and the Bible but not an attack on God, which the author professes a belief in.Chapter after chapter breaks down the different books of the Bible and disects their words. How do they contradict themselves and each other? Can we prove or disprove that the books of the Bible were written by those who they are attributed? Read this book to find out.This book is for the person who can think for themselves and not accept everything that is spoon fed to them.

It is informative and readable, well presented and (mostly) well reasoned.There are perhaps a half dozen or so times where his vitriol overtakes his reason, and the heat of his hatred for Christianity becomes rather tiresome, but other than that, I think his criticism holds much water.As to the science, I think that outside of a few times where he strays past the limits of the history and archaeology of his day this book holds up surprisingly well today.I would like to have seen more positive arguments for Deism as opposed to negative arguments against Judaism and Christianity (and Islam to a much lesser extent) but I think, probably, he was writing to an already Deist audience."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Great read,The age of reason has been around for 220 years and I just got around to reading it.

However, this book is by far the most thought-provoking document I've read in a while. He discusses his personal belief in deism, and refutes Christian dogma and teaches the viewer to question things, such as the concept of \`mystery' and the fallacy of believing something just because others claim it to be true (revelations). He gives his opinion on major biblical/historical figures such as Moses, and the murders of innocents which occur throughout the old testament \`in the name of God.'In fact, it is just such elements which need to be questioned and have been used to brutalize the \`enemy' for centuries. There are two sides to every story. Paine's writing and gift for words is expressive and thought provoking. I'm glad I read this book, and I will do so again, because it was too deep to understand in one session.One thing to consider when reading Paine's world, is that in the world and time in which Paine lived Religion and dogmatic practice held sway over the populace. It was very different back then, and for Paine to write something like this would have him ostracized for life and would alienate many. Thus, I'm heartily convinced that Paine was also a brilliant and brave individual who wrote what he thought regardless of the consequences."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"The thoughtful reader will enjoy this classic.

Paine must have been an extraordinary human being - certainly the attack of power-entrenched religious orthodoxy has been fatal to many that trod before him (as well as after) so I am firmly impressed by the man's courage. But beyond this I also \\"got\\" a profound sense of moral goodness - he speaks of the \\"Rights of Man\\" with such integrity that it violently stirred my own emotions.It would have been interesting to see what would have come from Paine had he known of the theories of Darwin, Einstein, Freud, as well as the modern theories of cosmology and physics, as it was these areas of natural science that inspired his belief in the Divine."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Even though this book is not perfect, it has more than enough philosophical and historical value to qualify as a must read.The one thing that bothered me about the book is that Paine lets anger get in the way and it shows through in some of his weaker arguments and ad hom attacks. That aspect robbes him of some credibility, which is a shame because this book should be read and talked about.One of the most striking aspects of the book is not in the book itself but a reflection on it. Anyone who is exposed to Christianity in America is made aware of heroes of the faith who have accepted persecution and even death because they spoke out for Christianity. Well, here's a Deist who literally risked his life by writing this book. Did he do it for a heavenly reward? Apparently not because he wasn't sure that there was a heaven. He did it because of principles."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Given the vitriol with which Christians have denounced Thomas Paine for more than 200 years, one may be under the impression, as I was, that he was an atheist. He was generally denounced as such, and Theodore Roosevelt's reference to him as a \\"filthy little atheist\\" was not atypical. But upon actually reading this famous tome of his, I discovered he was in fact a devout man of God. It was only Christianity and other organized religions he had a problem with, and he explains why.Paine was a creationist who believed nature is God's primary revelation of himself to humankind. In this revelation are all the tools we need, to understand, to behave, to treat others with respect and kindness, to stand in awe of the creator and worship him. Thomas Paine did not appreciate anyone belittling God by suggesting he behaved as \\"revealed\\" in those old writings of men who did dastardly things and then justified their behaviors by claiming God told them to do it! Paine could see that the biblical God was created by men the same way they created all the other pagan gods of the day. (Christianity was not the first to have a virgin birth, resurrections and blood sacrifices.)With no written description of God, and only the creation to go on, Paine was in the uncommon position of actually having to think for himself about what God must be like, what he expects of us, how we should behave. Thinking is work, but like most work, it can be invigorating and rewarding--written descriptions are severely limiting, confined to the words used, while one's imagination is limitless. (Similarly, the more literally one takes something, the more limited its application.) Unfettered by the feeble, misguided words of the ancients, Paine loved observing and imagining what God must be like.Those of us conditioned to getting our description of God through written material might at first think Paine to be at a great disadvantage. How silly, we are tempted to think, to imagine our understanding of God could be complete merely by looking around us. How could we possibly figure out that God wants us to have slaves, keep the Ten Commandments, offer sacrifices, flatter him more on Sunday (or is it Saturday?) and burn witches--all merely by observing nature? Then it dawns on us, and wow! If we believe God is good, then without these writings our imagination about his goodness is limitless. Throughout our lives, no matter how much we mature and grow in understanding, at any given moment we push the limits of God's goodness to the extremes of our imagination--never fully comprehending it, only approaching it. We are filled with awe and we are drawn to emulate that goodness. How silly all this stuff about a touchy biblical god who throws his weight around killing people at the drop of a pin if they don't offer the right sacrifice begins to look!Thus Thomas Paine was offended by the pettiness and absurdities of man-made religion. By observing God directly, he did not find himself in the awkward position of having to create excuses for God's supposed evil behaviors, his weird pagan-like fascination with blood sacrifices, his horrible temper or his morbid fascination with punishment--like stoning unruly kids to death, striking people dead for small infractions and imposing the death the penalty for every human being's mistakes, misdeeds or mere failures to flatter him (to say nothing of torturing them to death by endless fire). Paine wasn't saddled with the burden of explaining why the deity he worships doesn't want women in pulpits or gays in love. He's not stuck with having to defend fantastic promises that are (let's be honest) never kept, and prophecies never really fulfilled. Ironically, the only thing he ever had to defend was God's reputation--which Bible writers had dragged through the mud by attributing their own wicked pursuits to God.Paine's respect and adoration for God was pure, unadulterated by human contraption. In other words, he worshipped God without all the baggage. And all the while, Christians called him an atheist for not helping them carry theirs.It's worth noting that Thomas Paine's contemplation of God was not some kind of nebulous feel-good meditation. He was moved to action. In addition to defending God's reputation, Paine personally worked to end slavery, particularly with his 1775 essay, \\"African Slavery in America.\\" That makes Paine a better person than the biblical God, and not by a little; I mean, God isn't even neutral on slavery, he encourages it (emphatically and repeatedly, according to the Bible). And, of course, while Paine worked to end slavery, his biggest obstacle was Christians who defended the practice on clear biblical grounds. They got their understanding of God through a written description, while Paine got an entirely different understanding of God merely by contemplating God's real revelation, the creation.Would Paine still believe in God today? Who knows? When he died, Charles Darwin was but four months old. In that day, there simply was no plausible explanation for the origin of species.* Nearly everyone, including Paine, chalked it all up to God--the source of all things existing. Things of mystery have always been affairs of the gods.*(It is a common misconception among Christians that evolution attempts to explain the origin of life, but it does not.)But for the fact that Paine was not an atheist, one might consider The Age of Reason a foreshadowing of today's popular works by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and others. They and Paine all easily demonstrate how the writings that eventually got voted into the canon that is our present-day Bible could not possibly be a revelation from God. But unlike the others, Paine's purpose was to defend God's reputation, not doubt his existence.This book affords an additional plus. We get a fascinating glimpse of Paine's life and times in the 18th century, 200+ years ago. I was especially interested in his arrest over the nature of his writings. And while this review is a mere overview, Paine's meticulous tribute to \\"the age of reason\\" is a thing of real substance--you'll find detailed arguments not routinely employed by today's writers. You'll also get a more balanced view of deism than we usually get from Christians, who typically misrepresent it as a message of gloom and doom (God created us and then just \\"abandoned\\" us). The founding fathers of the United States were more deist than anything else, and thus not Christian, contrary to popular belief."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's &gt;&gt;The Age of Reason&lt;&lt; is a work of matchless clarity, boldness, and courage in an area the author obviously feels passionate about. Written more than two hundred years ago, it exposes the Bible for what, in my belief, it really is: A collection of myths and legends so arranged to enable certain clergy to &quot;terrify and enslave man,&quot; as Paine himself put it. You need not read any modern book on atheism or comparative religion or critiques of Christianity, for this classic work reveals so many of that religion's absence of foundation. Most of the objections about the Bible that were raised by Paine have not, to this day, been addressed by Biblical scholars and Christian apologists. This book is must reading for all skeptics of religion, as well as for all people who call themselves Christians who want to examine critically what they profess to believe."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine makes as powerful and argument as one might hope to make against the idea that the Bible - both the Old Testament and the New Testament - can possibly be direct revelations from God. His logic is very sound that revelation only occurs first to one person, and after that to believe in revelation is to put a great deal of trust in the person to whom revelation was supposedly delivered. He also makes fine textual criticism of many parts of the Bible. While some of his analysis and criticism is not well-founded, the whole of his argument against revelation seems forceful. (five stars on that) Where I dissent with Paine is his overall bitter diatribe against the Christian religion itself (two stars on that). There is much yet good in the Christian message, and I wonder if Paine did not give enough credit to the Quaker belief system, which was undoubtedly formative for his father and for himself. Paine does not describe much about Deism as an alternative, save that it is faith in knowledge of God through Creation. One should read this book for its good (and not so good) arguments - but don't acquire the Nuvision Press copy. It is chalked full of embarrassingly bad typos that should have been fixed before publication."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"After the American Revolution, Tom Paine went to England on a hopelessquest to promote an invention. While there he was inspired to write TheRights of Man, his greatest political tract. The British government tookoffense, and Paine only just escaped arrest for sedition, crossing thechannel to revolutionary France. The French, whose own revolution owed nosmall debt to his writings, gave him a hero's welcome, but not much timepassed before he fell out of favor with the revolutionary government there.Aging, ill, and out of favor, his mind turned to philosophy and he began toput down &quot;my thoughts upon religion.&quot; He sets forth two themes at theoutset. First, contradicting the modern notion that he was an atheist, hewrote, &quot;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyondthis life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religiousduties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make ourfellow creatures happy.&quot; But a second theme dominates most of the book: &quot;Ido not believe in the creed professed by...the Protestant church, nor byany church that I know of. My own mind is my church. All nationalinstitutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear tome no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind,and monopolize power and profit.&quot; And with that he deployed the full powerof one of the most amazing rhetorical voices ever raised, with no smalleraim than to destroy the credibility of all religion, and especially that ofthe Christian denominations. He completed the first part of the book theday the French arrested him; it was published while he spent months in acell waiting to be guillotined. Released at last, he sat down to completethe work. The second part is a detailed and savage deconstruction of theChristian Bible. When Paine wrote, the idea of examining the Bible as atext objectively, let alone critically, was unheard of. Paine finds many ofthe internal contradictions and barbarities of the Bible and lays them outwith withering scorn. After going through the Bible &quot;as a man would gothrough a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees,&quot; he lays out ina few pages a positive vision of the Deity he believes in and of a possibleafterlife. These quieter pages are touching and have an astonishingmodernity. However, Paine's contemporaries could not grasp the idea ofloving God while hating the Church, and decided that he was an atheist.Returning to the States, he was hounded and vilified the rest of his life,eventually dying in poverty. Finally, even his body was lost, and there isno Paine grave today."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"In \\"The Age of Reason\\", an angry, well-researched, and surprisingly witty book, Thomas Paine makes the case for deism. The book is divided into three parts: the first part attacks organized religion in general, the second, written much later, demolishes the Bible piece by piece, and the third sums it all up. Included in this edition is a very thorough biographical introduction to Paine, written by Philip S. Foner in 1948.The problem is that Paine's work depends largely on two basic assumptions, neither of which applies today. First, most of his criticisms of Judeo-Christianity are aimed at Biblical literalism. For instance: Matthew and Luke disagee about Jesus' ancestors; therefore the Bible is not divinely inspired. But many Christians today acknowledge some Biblical imperfections, and say that the underlying message is what's important. So errors of chronology and inconsistencies would not disprove the Christian religion. In fact, many more liberal Biblical scholars have devoted themselves to finding and explaining Biblical imperfections.I say this not because I disagree with Paine that Judaism and Christianity are false, but only because his critique is insufficient to deal with religion as it is practiced today. This book is sure to baffle any fundamentalist, though.The second problem is Paine's assumption that deism is the \\"true\\" religion. He bases this on the order of the world and universe, and because conditions on Earth are so amenable to man that a higher power seems likely. Paine was writing before Darwin's theory of evolution, however, which would have provided an alternate explanation for this. And explorations into black holes and the like have shown us that the universe is much more chaotic than we once thought. I can't help thinking that Paine would be an atheist, or at least an agnostic, were he alive today.Nevertheless, Paine's defense of science and his intellectual courage are outstanding. His book is well thought out and a lot of fun to read. We can't judge him by our scientific standards today; the criticisms are just something to bear in mind as you read the book, which you certainly should."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I must agree with \\"troybert\\" that Rickythereader has an obvious agenda in his \\"review\\".Little Ricky is similar to the trolls who haunt progressive weblogs ready to defend their flawed pet causes and equally flawed heros with a plethora of misinformation, propaganda and outright lies. In this case with his 4 \\"reviews\\" (all 4 cut and pasted from one book review to another) of Thomas Paine's writings (specifically targeting Age of Reason) proves it is quite obvious that little Ricky is nothing more than Amazon.com religio-troll.First off Ricky -- what is the deal with your bizarre obsession of Paine's leaving school at the age of 12? Paine was born into an impoverished family in pre-industrial age England. The fact he left schooling at the age of 12, at which time he went to work as an apprentice with his corset-maker father, is neither extraordinary nor indicative of the level of the man's intellect at the time he wrote Age of Reason. Your constant harping on that theme alone throughout your review (meaning bitchy, intellectually bankrupt harangue) is reason enough to question your objectivity as well as well as the maturity of your cognitive thinking abilities (assuming they even exist in some measurable form or level).Secondly -- it's painfully clear you have either never read \\"Age of Reason\\" in it's entirety (both Part 1 & 2) or you read it with such a polluted pre-conceived bias towards the writer and subject as to leave no doubt as to the outcome of your faux \\"review.\\"I'd like to specifically address the absurdity (as in hilariously child-like absurdity) of the following statement by little Ricky:\\"A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.\\"IMFAO!! What a crock of imbecilic drivel! Paine's beliefs, in a nutshell, were rightfully questioning of the blind credibility granted to the \\"supposed\\" writers of the 4 Gospels by Christianity and it's purveyors (the clergy). As it turns out, and if you had any shred of honesty or capacity for reasoning you would acknowledge, even the most credible Theologians now take it for granted that the Gospels were not written by the individuals with the 4 names ascribed to them, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In fact by all available and examined evidence it is entirely probable the Gospels were written hundreds of years after the events they described supposedly took place. Paine simply noted that the anecdotal and contradictory writings of the Gospels (kind of amazing in itself when you consider they've been imposed upon the world as the divinely inspired recounting of the death of God's son and savior of mankind) ought to provoke suspicion in the minds of those with the ability to think and reason for themselves.The asinine proposition that perhaps Thomas Paine never \\"even lived\\" or \\"never existed\\" because he questioned the authenticity of the authorship of the Gospels has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever read in my 45 years of living on this planet (oh wait -- maybe I never really lived or existed on this planet either because I too have questioned the authenticity of the Gospel's authors -- ROFL!). Using little Ricky's pre-kindergarten logic, it stands to reason that Paine's literary and political contemporaries, such as Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Ben Franklin, Edmund Burke, Gouverneur Morris and many, many others, all of whom mention Paine in their own writings, also never lived or existed. Imagine that . . . a who's who of America's founding fathers historically re-classifed as nothing more than imaginary characters simply by guilt of association/recognition of the infidel Thomas Paine.In the end Ricky I ask you this -- is it not too subtly ironic that the title of Paine's incredible work \\"Age of Reason\\" was written over 200 years ago with unthinking, sanctimonious mental midgets like you specifically in mind? Will wonders never cease?"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"There has been a unique failure on the part of the educational system and the Left in America, which has left too many people with the mistaken impression that the Founders were a monolithic block of &quot;God-fearing&quot; Christians who intended to make this a nation based on Biblical principals above all.While not a Founder in the strictest sense, Paine's work had a profound impact on many of them, and his &quot;Common Sense&quot; laid the foundation for the American Revolution. His contribution to the cause of American Independence is certinly on par with that of Franklin, Jefferson, and other great thinkers who articulated the goals of the Revolution. By clearly and concisely stating an opposition to hereditary monarchy, Paine stirred the spirit of the patriots who would later put his words into practice. Would that they had done the same with &quot;The Age of Reason.&quot;&quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; while a little optimistic in its title, is a splendid indictment of Christianity and all other religions who purport to hold The One And Only Truth in their musty tomes. His belief in Deism, which was echoed by Jefferson, may seem a little dated to us now, as the rise of Atheism as a legitimate alternative (though the Christian litmus test for President still lurks among us) has made the need for a position between organized religion and Atheism largely unnecessary.This book should be required reading for all who would carve their sectarian inclinations into law. From politicians seeking to demonstrate that they are &quot;God's candidate&quot; to fundamentalists who would place religious laws on the walls of courthouses, our nation is in a dire need of a cool drink of Paine's wisdom.It is a good thing that he is not with us now- the posturing that politicians on both sides give to superstition and mysticism in their quest for votes would kill him again."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Unlike so many books pointing out some of the absurdities of fundamentalism, this volume is neither shrill nor dry. Paine wrote one of the funniest, liveliest, wittiest volumes on religion there ever was. With a gifted eye for nonsense and logical inconsistency (allow Paine to walk you through the Bible and it will never seem the same to you again. He is able to point out so much that others have missed), Paine uses the scriptures as a basis for what amounts to being one of the funniest monologues ever written. He hammers home his arguments with a razor sharp intellect and a gift for the concise, epigrammatic, hilarious statement.It is too bad that Paine was better at working for others (the early colonies of the USA) than for himself. He died quite poor, almost completely forgotten and neglected, usually drunk, and often in the company of women who were beneath him. His fiery temperament was more suited to conflict and great causes than to retirement. Without a cause, he easily fell into dissolution. As so many other great men discover in their later years, the stimulation of the carnal appetites serve as a poor substitute for the excitements of their younger, more productive days. If it were not for the gift of a farm, he would have starved.The US owes him a great debt as his other writings galvanized the colonies and are pretty much the reason why we are no longer a part of Great Britain. I, for one, tip my hat to him."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I read this book and am reviewing it as a former christian. I left the church and the christian religion many years ago,thank goodness! I now call myself a deist and belief wise, deism is what I now see is the only true path for myself and I am just now getting around to have read the book. I would have still ended up leaving the religion anyway, whether I read the book or not,It was just basically a question of when I would eventually leave the religion. But after having read the book now, it has only more deeply confirmed for me and convinced me that I made the right decision for myself by earlier leaving the church and the religion.I think every Christian should read this book. It should be required reading especially for fundamentalists and evangelicals. But be forewarned, this book isn't for the faint or weak of heart and not for those who don't like to have their personal Christian beliefs and faith challenged, which is exactly what this book will do. It will not only challenge your faith and your personal belief in the bible and Christianity in general, it will also quite possibly destroy it for you as well.Thomas Paine, an idealist,a radical and a master rhetorician, was definitely a man with a self appointed mission with this book, He so completely and so totally destroys the bible and decimates and obliterates it like no one I have ever seen before. He is completely thorough in his devastation and destruction of the bible. He holds no punches.Nothing in the bible escapes his visciousness. He attacks the bible from within, using only the bible to prove the absurdities and contradictions and fallacies and falicious lies contained within it. He uses the bible as proof to disprove itself. He is relentless and ruthful in his attack and he doesn't let up for a single moment.From the very start, he comes out swinging, in his examination of the old testament.Methodically and systemically, book by book,chapter by chapter and verse by verse, he rips out the internal guts of the bible,and he lays it out in the open,and exposes it for all to see it for what it is. He metaphorically swings the bible like an axe with deadly accuracy,precision and aim, when he is done, and the smoke and the dust cloud settles, the bible lay heaped and crumpled up,mortally wounded in the corner,just a shell of a book,all that is left of it.Thomas Paine, makes you definitely stop and think as you read it. As you read his book, I highly suggest opening your bible and lay them side by side, and you can follow along,step by step, and virtually walk with him down the bloody path of annihlation and destruction which he will leave in his wake. It's easy to see, he was way ahead of his time when he wrote this book. He was centuries ahead in terms of thinking,when he wrote this book, and it's easy to see why alot of people in his time didn't want to accept his ideaology. I can easily imagine he made alot of enemies for himself when he wrote this. Alot of people must have absolutely hated him after he wrote it, and it's easy to see the controvercial firestorm he set off when he opened this can of worms. He was too radical for his time and people weren't ready for the book or for his particular way of thinking.People couldn't easily accept him or his book at that time.Even though this book was first published in 1795, it almost seems as if he were writing it for our modern times. This book really speaks so much to our present modern day world and our society today and it's just as true and applicable today,as it was back in his time. Most christians probably have never ever read the bible through completely from cover to cover, while other christians mostly believe the bible only because they are told to believe it by family, and friends,associates ect.....Most American Christians don't even really know what's even in the bibleThe really amazing thing about his book....It cannot be refuted. no way. not even. I don't care who it is, I don't care what kind of education or theology degree a person has, you will find what Thomas Paine says about the bible is true, check it for yourself.open your bible and read the bible along with his book,side by side and follow along with him. You will find what he says is sincere,honest and straight forward. He has no reason to lie, but unfortunately the bible as well as the church has very good reasons to lie to society and to impose this book and their beliefs on the rest of the world.Any Pastor,Preacher,Bishop, clergyman, probably even the POPE himself would be definitely hardpressed and mentally challenged to even try to refute this book. Thomas Paine wrote this book in such a way, as for it to be virtually impossible for anyone to refute his evidence and his proofs and whoever tries to refute it, they will have their work cut out for them. This is the book your church and your Preacher or your Pastor doesn't want you to read.I for one am so glad I bought it and read it. It has changed me,personally and deeply. I don't see how I ever really used to believe in the bible before. I believe in God, very much, of course, don't get me wrong. I believe in God, I just don't believe in the bible,or in Christianity as an organized religion and I can now begin to see how the world and how our society would be alot better off without both the Bible and organized religion.Buy the book. Read it. face your fear and challenge your personal beliefs and faith if your strong enough and if your not afraid. Open your eyes!....see the truth!...be changed. Personally, I don't see how a person could buy this book and read it and not be a changed person by the time they are done reading it. Thomas Paine did a great service for both his society and ours when he wrote this book. This book will always be in my personal library of books. When your done reading the book, start from page 1 and read it again.One of the best books I have ever read, and wish I would have read it alot sooner."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine, the man who coined the words &quot;United States of America&quot; and another of the USA's non-Christian founding fathers, has written what is easily the best book about deism, period. I personally do not accept the arguments from either design or the anthropic principle, so I am not a deist (luckily, you won't find nasty words like &quot;anthropic&quot; in this book, just some outdated English).But what this book does for biblical criticism is wonderful. Paine burns the &quot;Good News&quot; to ashes with his wit and brilliant prose. This book, although it would clearly violate the separation of church and state to have it read in schools, should nevertheless be read by young people (I read it when I was 18) who are interested in religion. Paine honestly looks at the bible, and finds it (correctly) to be a pack of lies.I won't quote from the book, but I can say that what you read in it will never be used by the religious right when they spout their drivel about our's being a Christian nation.We are lucky to have had an American as bold as Thomas Paine to write the truth about religion, I only wish there were people like that today."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"You have got to read this book. It is one of a kind. Many books have been written about the bible. This one, however, can be called the Genesis for bible criticism.

In fact, it simply lays out one man's opinion of a body of work that never made sense to him.It is a two part book, Age of Reason I and Age of Reason II. The first part was written without the aid of a bible. He refuted it strictly by memory! In part II he had access to the \\"Good Book\\" and successfully destablized its foundation. This is why his writing is so interesting. Paine makes a convincing argument that the bible cannot be a legitimate authority to live by.Overall, the book is well constructed and easily accessible. If anyone has read the Old or New Testament and has not read Tom Paine's Age of Reason, they have only got half the story. Buy this book. Read it. Talk about it with other bible readers.

That is a total shocker to \\"evangical\\" Christians, but only because they have been brainwashed and their minds cannot be open to any ideas except those they have been taught.Thomas Paine was ahead of his time.

Thankfully, we have scientists and engineers who understand this and are hard at work.Unfortunately our religious leaders and politicians are on a different track and have another agenda.

It is my pleasure to recommend this book to any individual questioning the blind theology that we, as humans, are force fed from the day of our birth. The format of the first part of this book is composed of logic driven arguments as to the validity of biblical text. Paine uses the tools of reason and intellect to condemn the most influential text of the modern world with incredible precision. The second part of this book is the reaction to the average priests attempt to blindly nullify his arguments in the first part. With this Paine takes each section of the bible systematically and tears down the validity of every part of the new and old testament alike using the bible as its own weapon. A truly timeless and inspiring book."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine:I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.But, lest it should be supposed that I believe in many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to qualify himself for that trade, he begins with a perjury. Can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this?"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I read many of our forefathers thoughts on society at the time of their presence. It is so important to understand the political, religious climate at the time these people made everlasting constitutions for the future. Why?At the present we are far removed from anarchy, yet it can happen again, and far removed from religious domination from a single dominion, even though we have had a run in with other faiths claiming they are right and we are wrong. So can this past thought process bring you up to date, of course! It is alive today as it was yesterday, and I urge everyone to get a primer on what is important in life, and read this book.Church and State must rmain seperate if we want freedom preserved."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I am ashamed to confess that I came to read this book so late in my life.

I observe that the negative reviewers here are using some of these tactics still.One reviewer commented that many of Paine's contemporaries rejected this book, which is a classic \\"appeal to authority\\" fallacy. (And in the case of the quotation by John Adams, what I know of him and his views on religion makes me doubt very seriously that he ever said what the reviewer attributes to him here.) So what if many of his contemporaries rejected it? Had any of them studied the Bible in the kind of depth Paine had? Why should their authority count for more than Paine's in this case? More importantly, why should you, the reader, be expected to dismiss Paine based on what others said, rather than judging for yourself?Another of the negative reviewers referred to this book contemptuously as \\"a dated pile of poop\\", yet had absolutely nothing convincing to say in the way of refuting any of Paine's arguments. The best he can come up with is assertions that Christ instills faith and the contradictions were taken too literally by Paine. But if the book is so dated, why is it that, as I said earlier, no Christian apologist has been able to offer a convincing, reasonable refutation of Paine's arguments in the two centuries since this book was published? If anything, the Bible looks even shakier now than when Paine wrote \\"Age of Reason\\", since scholarship has since uncovered more errors in the Bible, and science has proven Biblical assertions about the origins of man, the earth and all life wrong again and again.Another reviewer insists again that Paine is making too much of the contradictions, especially in the resurrection story, and that the overall story is what counts. Such critics are missing the point. Paine has noted, correctly, that the resurrection story is a two thousand year old story (1800 in his day), of which no original manuscript survives, which makes some vary extraodinary claims; the story is corroborated nowhere else (even though the works of about sixty historians alive at that time have survived to the present day), and the story CONTRADICTS ITSELF! Face it, this is not the most reliable source material; and yet oceans of blood have been spilled over the message contained in it.Paine was right, reason is a better way. Some people need to wake up and start using theirs."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine's work masterfully exposes the Christian religion as the silly superstition that it is. He clearly shows the fallacies of accepting any divine &quot;revelation&quot;(think about it, if God wanted to tell you something, why wouldn't he tell you himself; or at least give you enough information to distinguish the true prophets from the false ones)and exposes many of the contradictions of the Bible as well as undermining the absurd doctrine of biblical infallibility. I now turn to some of the comments posted by Christians on this and other skeptical works: The Christian's favorite ploy is to argue that one must have &quot;faith&quot;(belief in the abscence of evidence and/or argumentation)in order to understand their mythology. However, if the Christians honestly believe that only if we believe a position will we be able to understand it, then why do they bother criticizing skeptical views? Surley they can't understand skeptical arguments without first being skeptics themselves. How do they know that we atheists are not able to access some special rational insight that non-atheists cannot have? As you've undoubtebly noticed, these are poor reasons for being an atheist-yet this is exactly the rationale many Christians use to justify their belief in God. Another common defense is to claim that the Bible's failings do not disprove the Christian religion. But if the Bible is thier one and only revelation from God and they acknowledge that it is chock full of erorrs, what is left to base their belief on? How can they claim that any narrative of rape, pillage, and genoicide (such as the Old Testament) is &quot;divinely inspired&quot;? What kind of divinity would inspire such a monstrous work? Paine was correct when he said that the Bible would be better called the word of a Demon than the word of God. If we cannot accept the Bible, then we cannot accept Christainity, period. Paine even gave an enlightening response to the religous apologists who attempted to refute the first part of his manifesto and defend the Bible, striking at the heart of Christianity when he said of the apologists &quot;each understands it [the Bible] differently, but each undersatnds it best, and they have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that Thomas Paine understands it not.&quot; Unfortunatley for the Christains, Thomas Paine understood it all too well."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual leaders of the American Revolution. Unfortunately, he is neglected in U.S. education today because of his enlightened views. His books \\"The Age Of Reason\\" and \\"The Rights Of Man\\" should be required reading for all students. For me personally, this is one of the ten most influential books I have read.This book is a superbly written, logical, clear analysis of revealed religion in general and the Judeo-Christian mindset in particular. As Paine points out, revealed religion is really second-hand religion for everyone but the original so-called prophets or inspired writers who received the message. For everyone else, their faith is really in the veracity and sanity of the people who claim to have had certain revelations. Paine points to the historical and scientific mistakes and the self-contradictory passages in the bible. He also points to the moral flaw in the whole concept of the so-called \\"chosen people\\", as well as to many other moral deficiencies in the biblical law. Chief among them is the idea that the creator of the universe would command a nomadic tribe to wipe out the original inhabitants of Canaan so they could worship him there.Paine points out that the best way to understand the creator is to study the universe he has created. His morality is based on common sense ideas which are accepted today in every advanced society. There is a creator, an immortal soul, and punishment and reward in the afterlife. It is based on philosophical arguments.Paine was not just a writer. He was a revolutionary soldier and a very courageous champion of liberty and moderation both in America and France. In other words, he put his life on the line for his beliefs, as much as any religious person.If you want to read the views of a true hero of enlightenment and human progress, buy this book! Give it to your children to read, because they certainly won't get it in school. It will not only teach them the truth about so-called revealed religion, it will teach them how to think and write clearly on a controversial topic.For those who are still struggling with religious belief, read this book! It may help you think more clearly about the whole subject."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Since so many able reviewers have provided insightful and lengthy reviews of this book, I shall keep my comments short.This book, to put it simply, should be THE starting point for any and all who question or wish to think about the doctrines of (primarily) Christianity, though the discussion of the Old Testament clearly has relevance to Judaism, too. Paine makes an assault on these religions, and utterly rejects their holy books and doctrines, because he sees them as horribly divergent from what a rational conception of God requires. Paine explicitly advocates Deism, but the arguments he makes are equally useful to atheists, agnostics, theists, and all others interested in religion.These arguments may not be accepted as decisive by all, but they will indubitably cause any open-minded individual to seriously consider them. This is simply one of those books that anybody who seriously considers the philosophy of religion must read."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine was an English born American who was instrumental in the cause of American independance and is considered to be one of our most important founding fathers. In 1798 he wrote The Age of Reason which was a controversial piece on his thoughts concerning religion. It attacked Christianity, judaisim and to a lesser extent, Islam.During the time the piece was written, the church was still very powerful and people were hardly receptive to such criticism of the bible. One would think that given the religious climate of America at the time, Paine would make an effort to question the authenticity of the bible in the most subtle and respectful manner possible. Paine however does no such thing. When considering the time period the book was written, the reader cannot help but laugh at some of the words and phrases Paine uses to describe the bible. I can hardly imagine how the simple, humble christians of 1798 must have gasped when reading Paines words.Paine routinely refers to the bible as \\"stupid\\", \\"ridiculous\\" \\"absurd\\" ,\\"a book of fables\\" and \\"a nonsensical lie\\" among others. I was stunned at his \\"in your face\\" style. Although the writing is bold and provocative it is still eloquent and articulate.The thrust of Paines argument is that God would never reveal himself to us via written religous text. Such text would easily be misinterpreted and corrupted by the hand of man. He points out obvious discrepencies in the acts of Jesus found in various books of the new testament. Some are small, like the books of the bible differ on the geneology of Jesus, some are big like when he states \\"According to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee, to meet Jesus in a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according to John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by appointment, but in secret, for fear of the Jews.\\" Both books cannot be right about this because Jesus couldnt be in 2 different places at the same time. One contains a falsehood. Paine argues that if we cannot believe some of the more trival parts of the bible that we know to be false, why should we believe the fabulous parts, like that of the virgin birth?Paine goes to great pains to impress upon the reader his sincere belief in the existance of God and that of an afterlife. He was no athiest dispite what others have said. Those who accuse him of such have not read The Age of Reason.Personally the paragraph of the book that had the greatest impression on me and probolly summarized the book to some extent was the following\\"To be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselves to objects that can accompany the mind all the way through life, and that we take the rest as good in their day. The mere man of pleasure is miserable in old age; and the mere drudge in business is but little better: whereas, natural philosophy, mathematical and mechanical science, are a continual source of tranquil pleasure, and in spite of the gloomy dogmas of priests, and of superstition, the study of those things is the study of the true theology; it teaches man to know and to admire the Creator, for the principles of science are in the creation, and are unchangeable, and of divine origin.\\"For me this is one of the most profound and brilliant statements I have read. I encourage everyone to read this book and give it serious thought. Be prepared to question your most cherished beliefs. Those who dismiss Paine as having misinterpreted the bible or taken the bible too \\"literally\\" only serve to prove Paines assertion that God would never reveal himself to mankind through a mysterious book often written in abstract terms whose meaning is open to interpretation.The reviewers who attack the book most likely didn't read it. This is especially true for the reviewers who cite that Franklin had harsh criticism of the book. Anyone who actually read the book would notice that Paine only speaks of Ben Franklin in the past tense, thats because Paine didnt start writing The Age of Reason until his imprisonment in France in 1793. Franklin died in 1790"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's &quot;Age of Reason&quot; is a brilliant refutation of the Christian Bible. Paine affirms his own deistic belief in a kind and benevolent Creator and then proceeds to point out the many frauds of Christianity. He exposes the inconsistancies, the contradictions and outright falsehoods of the Bible. Paine also shows how the christian clergy uses religion and dogmatism as engines of power, control, and profit.Paine presents a view of a Creator who is powerful,yet benevolent. Paine also points out that the way to serve God is to do good to your fellow man, not to battle over mystic and incomprehensible doctrines. If you are a freethinker or a christian,and have an open mind the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; is a brilliant &quot;bible&quot; of freethought and is a must read."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This book is like the bible for Deists. You don't have to be a Christian to believe in God. Thomas Paine makes that very clear. Instead of following the Bible to find the Creator, Paine follows nature, science, and reason to come to the conclusion that God exists.Using reason, the author shows why the Bible cannot be the word of God. In an age without the printing press, it wasn't hard for writers to change sentences or omit certain words. In fact, at the end of the essay, Paine mentions how a printer in America changed a sentence in the first part of Age of Reason. The New Testament is at least 1700 years old, so it's extremely likely that we are reading an altered form of the Bible.One intangible is language. The original Bible was written in Ancient Greek and Hebrew. Parts of the Bible are lost in translation. Would the \\"Word of God\\" really come in human language? Paine doubts it. It's impossible to convey the same message in two different languages. Instead, the Word of God is Creation itself. It's a universal language. It requires no translation, and everybody can experience it.You do not need to be a Bible scholar to read this book. While it's probably good to have a frame of reference, anybody can understand the message Paine is making. Paine writes about fundamental contradictions in the accounts of the authors of the New Testament. Luke and John have different versions of the resurrection, and about the events after it. While they both mention a meeting with Jesus, they don't elaborate. Nobody has any idea what Jesus said after the resurrection. Don't you think that would be an important scene?I enjoyed Paine's sharp commentary and witty writting. He really was a firebrand. Paine was correct, however. Reason is a very powerful tool, and it leads us to the true theology: \\"Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born- a world furnished in our hands, that cost us nothing?\\""},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason was the deciding factor in my decision to reject Christianity as a truthful world-view. I struggled for years, growing up in an evangelical church, with the idea of accepting the blood of a god-man as the ultimate resolution to humanity's shortcomings. I am so thankful for the enlightenment that Paine's work introduced to me. I couldn't personally affirm the Bible's accounts of prophecy and miracles were works of fiction until I read Age of Reason.Paine writes in such a manner that is sometimes impetuous, but always guided by common sense. This is why Paine is so fun to read! While reading (more than twice) I would frequently slam the book down and exclaim \\"That's so true!\\". This work has survived the test of time. It continues to speak to fresh generations of free-thinkers. Age of Reason is an excellent introduction into other works of higher Biblical criticism, like those of Dr. Robert M. Price, who, if you haven't heard of him, is a brilliant scholar.If you loved Age of Reason, try The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, by Dr. Price. It's far more researched, and provides further insight into many of Paine's arguments.My only hesitance to the Age of Reason is that I get the sense that Paine honestly believed that the church would crumble after he wrote his book. For example, he wrote \\"I have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the ground, but they will never make them grow.\\" and \\"Certain as I am that when opinions are free, either in matters of government or religion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail.\\"Although I vehemently agree with Paine in both cases, and I hope that TRUTH will finally prevail, it seems the world is growing more in superstition and not less. Paine's success in instigating a revolution of government certainly encouraged him in attempting a revolution of religion. No free-thinker can blame him for hoping, but for being so certain I may have to. Although the time-period in which the book was written may excuse his overconfidence.Age of Reason is a great classic, and a work of genius. If you don't own this book you should."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's \\"Age of Reason\\", which earned him hatred and ridicule to this day, is nothing less than a brilliant exposure of the fraud and unhappiness on mankind that organized religion has been throughout the ages and continues to be.The man whom Theodore Roosevelt called \\"A Filthy Little Atheist\\" (Paine was a Deist, by the way) opens with some general observations on revealed religion and proceeds to demonstrate, through stringent logic, that the Bible, the so-called \\"Word of God\\", is really nothing but a collection of anonymous tales, and as such is without authority. A must-read for all Christians."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"To be honest, I was disappointed by this book in many ways. I don't know whether his other writings were in the same style, and I didn't notice, or if it's just in this book, but he seems like he's trying to impress his reader with his grammar. Unfortunately, like so many people who use this tactic, he simply ends up looking ignorant. For example, at the end of the first paragraph in the Preface of the second part, he writes, \\" ...that the same danger was approaching myself.\\" I have to admit, these sort of mistakes are the most annoying to me, but it's still inexcusable to use that sort of language to impress readers.As he admits in the second part, he didn't have a copy of the Bible with him at the time he wrote. He seems to only try to shoot down Christianity, regardless of the actual merits of his accusations. For example, in the first part, he discusses the word \\"prophesy\\" meaning simply making poetry and uses a passage from Samuel about Saul to prove this point. Upon hearing this, I immediately looked into our Oxford English dictionary for its roots. Well, it turned out that poetry and prophesy did at one time mean the same thing, but the Greek \\"prophet\\" was one who directly spoke to God, so the common interpretation is correct. Paine, while he could certainly have researched this and definitely saw the need to, simply relied on the reader to take his word for it.After I've said all of this, Paine, when not dealing with specific facts trying to denounce Christianity, certainly makes some very valid points, especially about the Bible being the perfect Word of God and Faith. His language and reasoning, in most parts, is certainly as passionate and persuasive as in his other works. If you're looking for some argument material to dispute your Christian buddy, definitely look here, but if you're looking for the truth, you may want to seek it somewhere else or take this with a grain of salt as far as the factual basis for some of his attacks on Christianity go."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine who failed out of school at the age of 12 was not one of the best thinkers of all time. He joined the American Revoluntion immediately prior to its onset, and he met with the founding fathers and expressed the ideas of the American people of the time in Common Sense. Because of the fame he received from Common Sense he attempted to influence Christian nation he was living in. Although some of the other founding fathers were also deist, Paine's writtings in the Age of Reason (which contradicts his earlier statements)lead to his downfall. He attempted to take advantage of his limited fame and failed.Some of Paine's arguments state that he can't accept the revelations of others because he cannot be assured of THEIR credibility. This comes from a man that failed out of school at 12 years old, failed at every job he attempted, and is only remembered for his statements in support of the American Revolution, which he only was apart of for a few years before it took place.Much of Paine's arguments contain fallacies. His belief of an Age of Reason is not supported by logical or reasoning abilities. One example is the logical fallacy Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (after this therefore because of this). One of Paine's arguments is that Satan was punished by being sent to a pit; Paine then states that the Greek god Jupiter punished his opponent (giants) by confining one under a mountain (Paine claims resulted in volcanoes). Paine claims that BECAUSE the legend of Jupiter imprisoning his rival allegedly preceded the concept of Satan being imprisoned that the Christian belief in Satan must have been derived out of the Jupiter legend. Paine's assumption excludes the fact that earthy crimes committed throughout all ages have had punishment or prison associated with them, and the claim that the Jews would have had to study Greek mythology to create their own beliefs is a complete hypothesis on Paine's part.Paine's statements are wishy-washy to say the least. He makes statements that the Bible is only hearsay and has no merit, and then at other times makes statements based on Biblical passages as though they were a matter of fact. He states that Jesus was a great teacher, and that he (Paine) is going to stick with the philosophy of Thomas (doubting Thomas) and demand to see proof of everything. If Paine's theories were true that the Bible was only hearsay, he would have no way of judging what Jesus taught as his (Paine's) beliefs do not allow for Jesus or Thomas to have even existed.A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.In LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE it says: \\"Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible teach the same doctrine? It does not.\\"This concept of God being a God of Justice and Truth is taken from the Revelations of the Bible and not from the Deist's use of Reason. By simply observing Creation to understand God as Deist claims you would not come to the understanding of God as a God of Justice and Truth. The world is not naturally just. If you base your religion on observing nature you are more likely to conclude that God is growing people in order to eat them, as that is what is observable in nature. Human's raise animals for food and are not concerned about providing the animals with truth and justice. These traits cannot be determined by observing the movements of the sun or the actions of man.Observing the nature of man; to rob, rape, and kill would appear to be a natural state of man, as these actions have been recorded throughout all history and still exist today. If Deists hold to the belief of judging God by observing the creation without giving any thought to Biblical Revelation then there is not cause to label such actions as sin. Revealed religion is what labels these instincts as sin. Paine's view originates in his Quaker up bringing, which he then perverts and intermixes with his concept of Reason to make up his odd belief and questionable belief system.Paine also rests some of his arguments on the new definition that he gives to the word Revelation. He redefines the word to meet his desires. The problem with this argument is that when debating the usage of a word relating to a topic thousands of years earlier it is necessary to use the definition of word at that time. By changing the definition of the word thousands of years later you do not invalidate how it has been used for centuries. This argument is also a logical fallacy called the Straw man in which Paine creates his own new definition of the word and argues against his own definition and not the actual topic.Much of Paine's view on Reason comes from ethnocentric thinking that He (educated to the level of a 12 year old boy) has a superior ability to think than those who have lived in the past. Paine views himself as an enlightened thinker when in fact the opposite is true. He values the usage of Reason in gaining wisdom, but the Reason that Deism promotes is ignorance. It involves a lack of study or research, and is simply the concept of \\"Believe whatever you reason without considering anything other than your own opinions\\", and leaves man to his own devices. The problem is that the Bible documents the results of man being left to his own devices, and if REASON were really being applied then an enlightened thinker would STUDY and learn from the mistakes of those of the past to prevent themselves from falling into the same snares.There is nothing enlightened about reasoning through ignorance. Much of Paine's problems with Christianity are not actually with the Word of God (as Paine claims they are), but are against man's hypocrisy and use of religion wrongfully. The Bible is also against these things, so Paine's attacks on the Bible are misdirected. Paine's argument that Christianity is wrong simple because other religions exist is foolish. One would not assume that all foods are poisonous simply because some of them are. If you do not want to eat poisonous food the answer does not lie in blindly making up your own recipes and biting into them hoping you wouldn't die, but lies in studying the good and bad recipes to determine where the poison is in order to use the correct recipe that will allow you to live; that is how REASON is to be used intelligently. If you are an enlightened thinker then you would analyze, evaluate, contemplate, understand, and reason to determine the truth. Making up your own philosophy based on what feels good to you is not enlightenment, and it is not even a new way of thinking; this error is commonly documented in the Bible.Paine's arguments show only a superficial understanding of the Bible. If he were to put effort into studying the Bible and applying reason to it then his questions and objections to it would be answered. He would also be able to answer why some religions are false ones and why they are so. As it is Paine argues that all religion say they are right and since they all cannot be right Paine assumes that none of them can be right. This is another error in his reasoning. Certainly there are an infinite number of examples of people doing things wrong, but someone else being capable of doing it right."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"By all means read this book, if you want to hear the skeptical side, but dont take it seriously. Paine argues that since the bible was given to us he has no knowledge of that personally and thus has no reason to accept it as being true. Obviously Paine cant believe anything anyone tells him. After all, why stop at the bible? He then argues about the supposed contradictions in Genesis. One that comes to mind, is that he claims that light was created before the sun, and hence is a contradiction. But the bible does not mention that the light was from the sun, it simply said there was a light. Which could have been Gods presence. All his other arguments can all be easily refuted, by anyone who has even a little knowledge of theology. He then claims that the God of the bible doesnt exist, but he replaces him with the deistic God. This God has all the great attributes except knowledge. Is there anything more ridiculous? God is perfect being. He cannot be lacking in any perfection, least of all knowledge. This book is a glaring example of the authors ignorance. However, what is even more shocking is the high reviews this book has received."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I found Thomas Paine to be an interesting study on the road to a lifelong exploration of our founding fathers. It was in fact many of his ideas of governance that laid the foundation for our founding documents, at least those presented in his pamphlets &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;. I read the other pamphlets and decided as he did to make this my last before moving on to other greater minds.Unlike most self-proclaimed scholars today who only read, study or quote the traditional 10 or 15 founders. I am fully aware that there are some 250 - 300 actual founders both men and women, who must be considered to get a true feel for the great history of the American birth.Of coarse they are purposely obscured by the left to move their hedonistic agendas forward. In fact there are many other great contributors and minds listed in books like &quot;America's God and Country&quot; by William Federer. Or &quot;Original Intent&quot; by David Barton as well as &quot;Our Sacred Honor&quot; by William Bennett who lived prior to, during and after the Independence and Constitution era, who had even more profound philosophies that significantly helped to shape those 250 plus and their decendents thoughts.After completing this book just one in a series of Thomas Paine Pamphlets. I realized that although most of our founding intellectuals, at least the vast majority of them, were kindred spirits in moral, ethical and ideological attitudes with my own and the vast majority of Americans. Yet there were some like Paine however, that I would have definite disagreements with, if we were to have a sit down discussion back then or even today.Paine was so filled with the spirit of Independence, freedom, liberty, representative government, self-proclaimed reason and affection for his own personal idea of God, that it is very difficult at first to understand the overwhelming intolerance, self-centeredness and near psychotic hatred of the Word of God. Hate is the only word that adequately describes his view of Biblical matters, and that is perhaps why I found this book an embarrassment to his obvious intellect in other areas.In all his other pamphlets I find a profound wisdom and intellectual nature. A nature that seems to drain from him, as if he had slashed his own wrist in writing this book, and let his brilliance seep out with his blood, due to his rigid and unrelenting attempt to discredit both the old and new testaments.The comments on the back of the book pretty much sum up his ridiculous attack, but give the researcher a good look into the mind of some of the modern day anti-religion extremist of the liberal left thinking icons in the Democrat Party.Yet I did not do what most, I assume do, as did many of the original founders when they got into his ranting and raving about time, names, events and verbiage. Which was to throw the book down and ridicule his reasoning.Instead I stayed the course and remained engaged and found it and him fascinating. To see a man of such intellect on other political matters betray some of his own principles and concepts were intriguing to say the least. For instance he would marvel and preach the power, omnipotence, unquestioned ability and worthiness of praise of his vision of God. Yet in the next paragraph or chapter begin to put rules, regulations and restrictions upon that all-powerful God he had just created, because of some Biblical tale he wanted to debunk.That was very odd for a man of such care in journalistic, political and intellectual acumen in previous works. In any case for the strong of heart and faith, this is still an important read to understand the history of America and our founders.My faith was in fact not shaken a smidgen after finishing it. I actually found that it was even more strongly reinforced than before and after this I am pretty sure my faith will be able to withstand just about any attack. His logic is just plain flawed and only those dupted by a fanatic loyalty to Paine would be gullible enough to buy it hook, line and sinker.I actually found myself slightly laughing at his onslaught as if he were a child throwing a tantrum and holding his breath in his anger &quot;until he died&quot; as many children threaten. I just waited for him to fall over faint from ranting and then start breathing again. My faith perfectly in tact and dismissing this misguided work as one giant brain fart, by an otherwise great man."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"After all I'd heard about Thomas Paine, and after all the quotes I'd read against Christianity from his book, I had always assumed that Paine was an atheist, or at least agnostic. But when I picked up this book I was surprised to discover that he was a Deist. (On the first page he writes: &quot;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.&quot;) So I read with interest exactly what Paine's famous 'reason'able views were, and why so many people hailed him as such a hero. But it soon became apparent that his views and conclusions weren't very reasonable at all, and many of his arguments can be easily refuted.Firstly, Paine's views about his Deity's 'Scripture' are far from reasonable. Paine says he does not believe the Bible is the Word of God because it was written by man, and it could have been altered or counterfeited. He then tells us what he DOES believe to be the word of God. He writes: &quot;Do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the Scripture, which any human hand might make, but the Scripture called the creation ... which no human invention can counterfeit or alter&quot;. Okay, let's read some pages from Paines' Scripture called creation. What do we see? Suffering, cancer, disease, pain, starvation, earthquakes. We can obviously see that Paine's Deity is a sadist, or even evil. But Paine holds that his Deity is good. I can also see nothing in Paine's Scripture which tells us whether there is one, or many Creators, or whether Their intentions were to create good or evil. There is also nothing in his Scripture which promises &quot;happiness beyond this life&quot; which Paine so hoped for, (and I pray to God that he got it).I have just illustrated that Paine's Scripture can be as equally altered or misread as the Bible, and its message to mankind is even more fallible than the message in the Christian's Word of God. It is through FATH that Christians believe the Bible is the Word of God. As it happens, the Bible completely acknowledges the fallenness of Creation, and it also reveals insights into why suffering exists in creation. The reasons for 'suffering' in Creation can be found in the Bible's view of a self-limiting God, (the divine &quot;self-giving&quot; is central to the Christian faith). An infinite Love will not manipulate the beloved, (in this case, Creation), and from the Christian perspective, God's omnipotence is understood as God's capacity to enter into love with all its costs. So just as God cannot create square circles, He also cannot prevent 'pain' from being a consequence of self-giving Love.Paine spends a lot of time reflecting on the dogma of the Church, and he concludes that there is no 'spirit' to Christianity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Paine ought to have been aware that the Church was originally founded as a man-made framework in order to 'embrace' the Spirit of God in such a way for man to be able to focus in an ordered, disciplined manner. However, over the years, due to OVER-discipline, and due to egotistical, narrow-minded fundamentalists, the focus has gradually shifted from the Spirit to the framework and regulations itself. Paine seems completely unaware that the heart of Christianity resides way deeper than the framework itself. The dogma is no more spiritual, vital or alive than a mud brick - and can be equally as damaging as having the said mud brick shoved in one's face. It is the Spirit of God that the heart of Christianity focuses upon.Paine's arguments against the validity of the four gospels are negligible. If four different people sat at four different sides of a football stadium, and watched exactly the same event, and then wrote an essay on the event 70 years later, then I would expect to find a number of minor contradictions in the four essays - even though the event was completely true. As it happens, the core elements of all four gospels complement each other. Where is the problem? Paine wilfully invents problems where there are none. It is through spiritual FAITH that a person accepts the Christ event as true, for it is certainly not possible for a Christian to scientifically prove the event, just as a scientist cannot disprove it.To conclude, while reading 'The Age of Reason', it struck me that Paine's views aren't very 'reasonable' at all. Quite the contrary.Jesus Christ - He's a righteous dude."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I was challenged to read this by a friend and thought it would bring up some intersting questions to debate. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of Paine's arguments. It was written before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and without the benefit of modern scholarship, so the arguments are antiquated. It is more of a rant than a scholarly essay on reason. It's probably something people should read simply because Paine is so well-respected, but I recommend something by William Lane Craig instead."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I feel that many of Paine's comments and conclusions in 'The Age of Reason' are irrational, and are quite UN-reasonable. One such example is Paine's refutation of the four gospels. He highlights the cosmetic contradictions that exist in the gospels and concludes: &quot;The disagreement of the parts of a story PROVES the whole cannot be true.&quot;This assertion is completely false, and his case against the gospels is far from convincing. Think about it logically. If you were to take a significant event, and were to take four different people who KNEW the event were true, and then asked them to write a separate account 70 years after the event occurred, then it would be EXPECTED to find cosmetic contradictions in the four accounts. Paine spends his time nit-picking the cosmetic contradictions and then concludes that the event must have been false. Paine seems completely oblivious to the fact that the underlying message in the gospels is undeniable.Do any of the gospels assert that Jesus was not resurrected from the dead? Do any of the gospels claim that Jesus did not perform miracles? Do any of the gospels deny Jesus' deity? It is this underlying message that Christians have faith in.One event which Paine highlights as &quot;proof&quot; that the gospels cannot be true, was the account from Matthew 27.51 which the other gospels omit: &quot;The earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many.&quot;Paine then says &quot;Had it been true, it would have filled up whole chapters of those books, and been the chosen theme and general chorus of all the writers. ... The writer of the book of Matthew should have told us who the saints were that came to life again and went into the city, and what became of them afterward.&quot;Here, Paine completely misunderstands the nature of the gospels, and he reads these words from Matthew as scientific literalism. There are many paragraphs in the Bible which contain profound spiritual truths and should not be taken literally. See, for instance, Matthew 10.34, when Jesus says, &quot;I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.&quot; St. Paul is influenced by Jesus' spiritual terminology in Ephesians 6.11 when he says, &quot;Put on all the armour that God gives you so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks.&quot; ... &quot;Accept salvation as a helmet and the Word of God as the SWORD which the Spirit gives you. Do all this in prayer.&quot;So if Paine were to continue his line of &quot;rational&quot; analysis of the gospels, then he ought to have pages asking question such as: &quot;Why didn't the writer of Matthew describe the type of metal which formed the sword?&quot;, or &quot;How much flour and water was used in the bread which Jesus referred to as his 'body'?&quot;, or &quot;Why didn't John say whether he meant a bed-side lamp or a candle light when he said that the Word is the 'light that shines on all mankind'?&quot;It is clear that Matthew's words that &quot;the saints which slept arose ... and went into the holy city&quot; is referring to a profound spiritual event, rather than a literal, physical event.In Luke 17.21 Jesus says &quot;The Kingdom of God does not come visibly. No one will say 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!'; because the Kingdom of God is within you&quot;. What would Paine's 'rational' analysis have been? &quot;Was Jesus referring to my liver, or the chicken I ate yesterday?&quot;More importantly, this quote from Luke undermines Paine's argument that Jesus was wrong when he prophesied that the Kingdom of God would come within the life-time of the people he was addressing - a popular argument from atheists.The main problem about Paines' (and many other atheists) refutations of the Bible stems from their refusal to break out of literalism. The inherent nature of the Bible is deep and it reveals spiritual truths which shouldn't be read as scientific, literal accounts.Paine then highlights the apparent 'contradiction' in the OT and NT's view of God, and he continues to scoff at Christians who believe the Bible is the word of God. He asks why the God of the Old Testament would encourage the extermination and massacre of whole nations, while the God of the New Testament preaches love, harmony and forgiveness?Here is my answer:Just as the history of mankind reveals a history of evolution, so does the Bible reveal an evolutionary UNDERSTANDING of the nature of God, according to the people's capacity and insight - until the fullness of God's revelation in Jesus Christ.In this sense, the Bible is not so much a contradiction of two opposing views of God, but rather the emergence of an evolving understanding of His very nature. God remains the same - man's insights have progressed.This evolutionary trend is apparent throughout the Bible. Moses' reaction to the people's harsh attitude of the day (i.e. a 'life for an eye' and 'life for a tooth'), was that of &quot;an eye for an eye ... a tooth for a tooth.&quot; Jesus says in Matthew 5.38: &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But now I tell you: do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you.&quot;Christians do not hold that the Bible was written directly by God in magical, spiritual ink. Instead they freely acknowledge the 'humanness' of the prophets and the writers of the Bible. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the Bible is fallible. The Bible was inspired by God in the sense that it contains central issues of wisdom and spiritual insights about the Plans of God and about the nature of God.To me, Paine's attempts to undermine Christianity ring hollow."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"If anyone sincerely thinks that Christianity can be undermined with a dated pile of poop like Paine's effort here, then it's time people started wizening up to reality.The weakest argument I have ever heard is the argument against &quot;faith&quot;. Faith is inherent to the human condition. The only way anybody would have a faith-free understanding is to be infallible - to know everything, which is a characteristic given only to God.Christians believe in Christ, not on account of any authority, but because He Himself instils such faith in us. True faith is when someone finds something deep, and experiences it as being REAL. If another has not searched for or discovered it, or has not experienced it, then so be it. But there is nothing more closed-minded or dogmatic than to assert that the Christian faith is &quot;wrong&quot;.&quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;. If you believe &quot;In the beginning was 'nothing'&quot; then that is your faith. If you believe &quot;The Universe just IS&quot; then that is your faith.Jesus Christ just IS. That is the Christian faith. If God, who exists beyond the framework of science itself, dwelt within Jesus Christ 2000 years ago as an act of the ultimate sacrifice of all time, then would you really expect a scientist to come and prove it?The quote &quot;If we cannot accept the Bible, then we cannot accept Christainity&quot; is one of the most narrow minded assertions I've ever heard. Who cannot accept the Bible? Thomas Paine? Just because Paine cannot accept the Bible means Christianity is debunked? If anyone doesn't understand the Bible, then it's Paine.He takes figures of speeches' literally, he reads deep spiritual themes as if it were a physician's text book; he chalks up numerous passages as &quot;contradictions&quot; as much as he would say a parent is self-contradictory for allowing a child to eat with his fingers while demanding an older child to use a fork and spoon.Should we be expected to rely on the authority of skeptics and the likes of people who deny the necessity of 'faith', when the matter concerns the source from which believers are to draw the truth for their lives?Let's start getting real. Let's start growing up in faith. And as for little Tommy Paine? God bless his sweet little soul."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Rather than ask you to listen to my opinion of Paine's book, listen to what the Founding Fathers who knew him said about it:Ben Franklin wrote to Paine after reading the manuscript: &quot;I would advise you . . . to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person. . . . If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be without it?&quot;Samuel Adams wrote to Paine that his book was &quot;repugnant to the true interest of so great a part of the citizens of the United States.&quot;President John Adams wrote, &quot;The Christian religion is . . . the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard [scoundrel] Paine say what he will.&quot;Benjamin Rush said Paine's book was &quot;absurd.&quot;President John Quincy Adams said that in view of this book &quot;Mr. Paine has departed altogether from the principles of the Revolution.&quot;Patrick Henry called it &quot;the puny efforts of Paine.&quot;John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, wrote, &quot;As to The Age of Reason, it never appeared to me to have been written from a disinterested love of truth or of mankind.&quot;The Founding Fathers rejected what Paine wrote in this book.

He has helped me not to also."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"After reading this work, the reader comes away thinking that Paine not only finds the concept of YHWH impossible, he finds it downright blasphemous. Paine obviously was fearing the theocrats that plagued the world then (and indeed now). Given that this work was put together in the 18th century, it also is notable how long many of the questions about Biblical errency have gone unanswered. It still stands up today."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"With The Age of Reason, Thomas Paine sets out to argue against the truth of the Bible from a perspective of deism. His main argument hinges on the fact that most parts of the Bible are based solely on hearsay and are published by anonymous authors whose credibility is unknown. At times his refuations seem a bit lengthy. The mere fact that the Old Testament history spans such a long period of time (well past the life-span of a single man) plus the fact that it mentions Moses' death is sufficient to prove that Moses did not write these histories. But Paine points out every pain-staking detail just to be sure. He does the same with the texts attributed to various other people, noting that their word usage and descriptions of certain historical events rule out the possibility that they wrote these texts. He also points out that the Gospels were written many years after Jesus's lifetime, and that there is no reason to suppose the writers were eyewitnesses.Of course, throughout the book Paine also offers all sorts of other evidence. He points out many of the injustices of the Bible, from Elisha's causing she-bears to devour children to God's commands for the chosen people to kill women and children. Now, he does not issue a logical argument about how such attributes are incompatible with an all-powerful, all-good deity, but he brings them up to show a sort of instinctive reason to doubt that a being that could create such a wonderful planet could also commit such evil. (Nevermind that this planet contains such wonderful things as parasites and viruses!) Another of Paine's argument is that \\"to prophesy\\" originally meant \\"to sing\\" in the Bible, and the predictions of the prophets weren't meant to apply to descriptions of events hundreds or thousands of years into the future, but to very recent events in the prophets' lifetimes.Overall, The Age of Reason casts much doubt on the truth of the Bible, although it does so in a very common-sense manner. Paine is very rigorous in bringing out the contradictions and exposing doubts about the book. Anyone who accepts the Bible's truth with unwavering certainty, or even anyone who feels a lingering doubt about it, should definitely subject their beliefs to Paine's quick criticisms. A healthy dosage of skepticism never harmed anyone, after all."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I accept Thomas Paine into my heart as my personal Lord and Savior! Before I even read the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; I knew what I believed, but I did not know there was a word to define my beliefs: Deism. Those who still adhere to organized religion do not know what they are missing. When you read Thomas Paine, you simply can not ignore the clear flawless syllogisms that prove revealed religion false and useless. So, parents, if you want your children to grow up as moral, spiritual, logical individuals, you should expose them to Deism and read Age of Reason to them before they go to sleep. That's what I'm going to do."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine's writing is rich with stunning clarity. He was one of America's most brilliant and inspiring writers. That is if you don't read any of 'RICKYTHEREADER's reviews. RICKYTHEREADER has reviewed exactly four books on the amazon website, all about Paine and all delving into proselytizing (over 50 mentions of the bible or Jesus between the four reviews). Further, he's obsessed with the fact that Paine failed out of school at the age of 12. Does this mean we must discount his body of work? Einstein was a slow learner, perhaps that 'lightbulb' idea wasn't quite as good as we all thought. Hey, think what you want, but disliking someone's views has little to do with the quality of their work. Especially of someone as deservingly revered as Paine. If he's such a mediocre writer, why did RICKYTHEREADER dig into FOUR of his books? I love Paine, but I've not read that many! My message to RICKYTHEREADER: Love God if you wish, but don't write reviews with an agenda.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"You won't see Thomas Paine's face added to Mt Rushmore. Although he played a great role part in the founding of this nation and its principles of government, some give him credit for writing a huge part of the Declaration of Independence and his genius in writing is readily displayed, he just wasn't politically correct enough for the role of a \\"Founding Father\\".In writing the Age of Reason, he sat down while waiting impending fall of the guillotines blade and dashed off a few thoughts on religion as he saw it being used for profit, power and political gain by exploiting humanity for decades. He believed in God, but not the mythologies created by man. I would also recommend The Faiths of the Founding Fathers, by David L. Holmes if you're interested as to why deism was so popular at the time."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I have read lot of books and most of the writers are very good at expressing themselves and there are few who catch the attention to the readers. Thomas paine is one of them. He is very good and specific at expressing himself and I have seen few writers who are fully determined about what he is talking about. He wrote what he only believes without even hesitating about what other people might think about his opinion. He was very specific and sticks to his decision. He conveyed the message to the people about what he belief and disbelief.The age of reason is divided into two sections. The first section, the writer mentioned about how he believed in one God and he completely disbelief in any Church and talked about his thoughts upon religion. The second section deals with the Old and New Testament and the overall analysis of them.In the first part, Paine talks about what he believes and why should he believe something without having enough evidence or proof. According to him, he only belief in one God. He does not believe the creed professed by any church. Every other church possesses some mission from God that is communicated to human being and they have certain books to follow. Paine disbelief them all because they are not the actual word from Almighty, but instead the message is conveyed by people from generation to generation. His argument is clear and precise. The churches do not have any evidence to prove that they are the actual words of God and he does not have any authority to believe them all. He made a good argument when he said that it is false to call the science human inventions but rather it is the application of them that is human. Human being only discovers the principles but cannot make it. His second part mainly emphasized that the bible is an ancient fables written by different authors.This book is concise and is very easy to read it. It will help you to express yourself like the author, who did not even hesitate to express himself freely about what he believes."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

But to accept this challenge, one must be willing to swim against the current of religious &quot;group-think&quot;; to give up the reassuring and dogmatic belief-system that replaced Santa Claus and the other fairytales of our childhood. And there is the rub! Paine uses the internal inconsistencies and factual errors in the Bible to expose it for the man-made fabrication that it is. And since his arguments are devastating and unanswerable, the only recourse for his detractors is to engage in ad hominem tirades against him or to challenge the propriety of his endeavor. Indeed, in his own time, Paine was made to endure unconscionable hardships and humiliations for challenging the foundations of the clericalist establishment.A more exhaustive expose of Biblical self-incrimination is presented in Joseph Wheless's book &quot;Is it God's Word? However, Paine's book, written more than 200 years ago and directed at the general public, is a historical landmark of religious dissent.Paine's religious views share much in common with the &quot;cosmic religious feeling&quot; described by Albert Einstein as linked to the &quot;sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves in both nature and the world of thought.&quot; Paine's book dares us to consider that yes, Virginia, there is a God, but not one with long hair and a beard who punishes little children for not saying their prayers at night."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I have seen reviews here and elsewhere about Thomas Paine being ostricized, rejected, and living in poverty as a result of this book.

Benjamin Franklin did not write anything in response to this book given the fact that Franklin died (1790) two years before Paine even began to write the Age of Reason (1792), not to mention Franklin himself was a deist as stated in his own autobiography. This book was the highest selling book in America in 1794, 1795, and 1807. Yes a few of our founding fathers did not like the book, and a few did. If you are curious about something you should find out for yourself, make your own decisions, or think with your own brain.

I am proud to be an atheist."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is the exact reason why I must say that I'm proud to be an american, this literary classic totally de-bunks what is \\"expressed\\" in what we call the 'holy' bible. Thomas Paine had the courage to write this essay at A time when he most likely would've been imprisoned or executed for heresy. Thomas Paine, the man responsible for entitling this great country of ours the \\"United States Of America\\", he is A great american hero."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"The Age of Reason is realy the best book there is to discover or re-discover Deism! In an age where you usualy have the choice between revealed, dogmatic (and sometimes fanatic)religions and cold atheism, this small, easy-to-read book by the Apostle of Freedom gives you another REASONABLE choice: Deism. Unlike other books written on religious philosophy, The Age of Reason uses plain, understandable language for everyone. After all, today, DEISM is a very un-known word, but yet, how many are un-counsciously Deists! I strongly recommand &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; to anyone who has left Christianity and wishes to satisfy his God-given reason. Anyone interest in religion and/or Deism ought to have this book: the closest thing to a 'deist-gospel' there is."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"If Cosimo do employ a proof-reader, he or she ought to be sent for a drugs test, or investigated for being a fundamentalist Christian deliberately trying to sabotage this masterpiece, the first logical attack on Christianity's shaky beliefs. Or should I say, they should consider a lawsuit against the printers. Those were my thoughts as I went through the book. The text often stops in mid-sentence, where another one will start, and you have to search halfway down the page to find how the sentence before had ended. Then to the end of that paragraph, and back up half a page to where you left off. By then you've lost the flow of the sentence and have to repeat the procedure. The footnotes have been allowed to mix in with the main body of the text in a confusing manner the likes of which I have never seen in a book before. That's besides the host of other routine misprints which alone would have been worthy of criticism. Using 21st century technology, Cosimo have surely been beaten in the accuracy game by the publishers/printers of the 1795 original. Naturally, none of this is the fault of Thomas Paine, and the book itself is a great read, and surprisingly readable for a book from that era. Like some have pointed out though, later scientific discoveries, like the theory of evolution for example, or the 19th century archaeological discoveries of the Middle East which showed the origins of a number of classic biblical stories, may have led Paine to rethink some of his statements on the universe and existence of God, and refine his opinions. But what he worked out and argued alone, without the help of much source material, is much to be admired. That he could have done so in an age of incredible ignorance leaves one all the more astounded that over two centuries later there are still so many followers of this destructive, immoral and unethical religion which has blighted our planet for so long, when the source material which Paine would have died for to use in his arguments is now at our fingertips. So read the book, just not this Cosimo version."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Very thought provoking! I actually got my bible out and confirmed the data in the book. It's all true.

I am a deist, if you can call yourself that anymore. Thomas Paine is a literary genius. He writes it perfectly. It amazes me, everything that he wrote about in this publication I have thought about numerous times. It's wierd it was written 200 years ago. If you are at doubt of your stance on religeon, or are researching deism, this is the book to read. It cleared up all the questions that I had. It has helped me alot, and contuinues to help me."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"To hold and read the same words that Thomas Jefferson so loved-- the same book that broke the religious shackles of Lincoln and Mark Twain-- is quite awe-inspiring.This great work was not only a breath of fresh air from a stuffy era of dogma and magical thinking, it is still quite the oasis of reason even today as we deal with a delusional President taking orders from his imagined god to attack the wrong country.All of you who are religious (Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Jew etc) do not need to argue with the non-religious advocates of this book. You need to argue amongst yourselves to decide whose \\"imaginary friend\\" is real. All of you have been engaged in putting each other to death-- essentially over what you believe happens AFTER death-- for thousands of years. Leave us out of it. We have no orders from imagined egomaniacs in the sky for an agenda of bigotry, bloody crusades, or missions to fly planes into buildings.Odd that your \\"omnipotent\\" gods aren't strong enough to do all that killing for you."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine uses reason and logic to demonstrate, in his opinion, that the Bible (Old and New Testaments) is a convoluted and contradictory collection of historic fables written by anonymous authors, and subsequently voted by a group of \\"Christian Mythologists\\" as \\"the word of God\\". Paine expresses many of the problems that Christians have had regarding the Bible but were perhaps afraid to question.Paine is a master of the quip, and this is sure to insult some readers, while delighting others. Paine's writing is very direct and, at times, intentionally insulting. For example, Paine notes the unusual \\"Christian arithmetic\\" where three are one and one is three. Or in response to the preaching of tithes based on Deuteronomy ch. 25, v. 4, \\"Oh, priests! priests! ye are willing to be compared to an ox, for the sake of tithes\\".Paine had intended that a discussion on religion would be his last work. Due to the changing nature of the French Revolution, Paine realized that his liberty was to be short-lived, so he quickly composed the first part of the Age of Reason in Dec. 1793 and Jan. 1794. He had no Bible at hand, and as such the discussions are general. Within hours of completing the first part, he was arrested. In a few months and after a serious illness, Paine was released from prison. In 1795 he wrote the second part of the Age of Reason partially in response to written criticism of the former part by priests. This time Paine had a Bible, and he composed a detailed book-by-book attack.Typically using no more than the Bible itself as evidence, Paine points out so many inconsistencies and immoralities that this work could not possibly be the word of God. An example inconsistency is Christ's two vastly different natural genealogies according to Matthew and Luke, and an example immorality is Numbers 31, 17-18. Paine thought that the collapse of \\"revealed religion\\" was imminent, as mankind entered a new age of reason. However, Paine was no more a prophet than those of the Bible, as reason is no match for faith in the short term.While criticizing Christianity, Paine promotes his own religious belief, Deism, which was a common tenant of intellectuals in Paine's day, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. In short, deism recognizes one God as revealed to us by nature. One may reasonably consider that some of Paine's Deist beliefs also crossed the line between reason and faith."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Within the next revisions of this magnificent book, you will find one single low rate provided by Mr. Chad Woodburn, in which he ascribes a letter to Benjamin Franklin, condemning Thomas Paine for writing The Age of Reason.I find it very difficult to be true, since Ben Franklin died in 1790 while The Age of Reason was written in late 1793.This sort of logical criteria, is the one that Thomas Paine uses throughout his book to unmask lies told to us from early childhood."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Age of Reason was an excellent book, it DESTROYED Christianity in my eyes, its nice to live without the irrational fear that there is a tyranical GOD breathing down your neck.....All hail Thomas Paine"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Hello to all those who have read this book. After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something. WHy are you so set against God and Christianity? One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity. Christianity is not some weird religion, it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much. Where are you going after you die? Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life. The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired. There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it. there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true. So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ. I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word. If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible. The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity. PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble. Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is a wonderful book. I wish I would have read it earlier in my life. In the Age of Reason Paine is trying to free human thought from the bondage of Organized religion's scare tactics and superstition. Think what the world would be like today if we were Deist and quit arguing and killing over religous text. Paine's arguments are well organized and easy to read. I also believe this book should be taught in schools. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is an excellent book, very analytical and exacting. It'll open the eyes of many good Christians, if they will only open their minds to the truth.

Here was someone who had deep faith (like myself) explaining in a clear and intelligent manner all the questions I have had since I was five years old (the age of reason! ) about the christian religion. If you have ever questioned why Moses, a supposed &quot;man of God&quot; - ordered his troops to &quot;kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him; but all the women-children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves,&quot; and other acts of violence, murder and mass murder are upheld as &quot;The Word Of God&quot; in this culture, this book will help you sort it out. Paine's words ring so true: &quot;what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty?&quot; Have you ever wondered why Christianity holds that great men and woman of faith, produced by different cultures through history, who inspire us with their good lives and great devotion to God, must, according to scripture, burn in hell, because they were not Christians? Whomever said, &quot;All great men are the same religion&quot; was of the same mind as Paine. Whatever faith you are (I happen to be a pagan) if you have deep faith but cannot shut out common sense, logic, justice and reason, you will share this man's faith. For me, as a pagan, I understood Paine's idea that the only True Word of God is creation, not one of the hundreds of man's written mythologies from around the world. He points out beautifully how creation itself, in all its beauty and savage intensity, shows the face of God far better than the flawed and violent history of the Jewish race. A blade of grass, he points out, cannot be altered or mistranslated, etc. Thomas writes: To charge the commission of the acts upon the Almighty, which, in their own nature, and by every rule of moral justice, are crimes, as all assassination is, and more especially the assassination of infants, is matter of serious concern. The Bible tells us, that those assassinations were done by express command of God. To believe, therefore, the Bible to be true, we must unbelieve all our belief in the moral justice of God; for werein could crying or smiling infants offend? And to read the bible without horror, we must undo everything that is tender, sympathizing, and benevolent in the heart of man.&quot; I think this book explains well why so much killing has been done in the name of Christianity. If you have an open mind - if you are interested in hard questions that are not easy to face if you ascribe to the Christian faith - if you know in your heart that the &quot;Word of God&quot; is more than the rules and history of a violent middle eastern people, and if you have felt that &quot;God&quot; is far to wonderous to be as petty and confusing as Christianity makes him/her/it out to be, then you will love this book. Read it!"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"It discusses his beliefs in which he thinks the New and Old Testament are not true because it is from here say, which is the word of man and not the Word of God. He wonders how people can believe something written in a text and not something that was personally told to them. His biggest argument was how we can believe in something we have never seen. This is a good book to read because it explains many beliefs and misunderstandings that you may have about the bible and of various religions."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's Age of Reason was intended to spark a revolution in the world of religion in the same way that Common Sense helped fuel the political Revolution in America. They are both written very plainly and are wildly accessible to most readers. The big difference was that Paine's posturing in Common Sense reflected (or at least tapped into) the sentiments of the average colonist. On the other hand, the personal honesty of Age of Reason did not appear right for this planet.Were the Age of Reason an essay about deism, it would harldly be notable. Paines asserts his deist beliefs in the first few pages, spends no time justifying them or arguing their merit and gets right to the primary thrust of the work: assaulting the Bible and what is sometimes called \\"organized\\" religion. The shock level of Paine's work can be easily gauged by considering the shock level that it generates in the typical reader today. The fire simply leaps from the pages! I guarantee it. Open it anywhere. Start reading. See what happens.Some of Paine's criticism are downright silly on their face - like complaining that one verse suggests it was \\"dark\\" and another suggests it was \\"morning\\" (as if it could not be both). But others are altogether amusing. The differences in the Gospels, for example, are often attributed to the fact that different authors are likely to remember - and emphasize - different things. There is sense enough to that. But only one Gospel mentions graves opening and dead people walking around in the streets after the Crucifixion. Paine humorously guesses that such an incident should probably have been remembered by more than just one writer. Age of Reason is full of fury, but it does provide a few good chuckles like that along the way.Whereas Common Sense calls for specific steps to aid in the political Revolution, Age of Reason does not outline a path for the future. As a result, it can leave readers with a sense that Paine was simply rambling, albeit in his usually entertaining way.Having written all of that, I must write this: It is certain that many Christians would be deeply offended reading Age of Reason. While I understand and respect that, my personal view is that this work has as much potential to make strong believers as it does to push readers in other directions. On top of all that, I think it is sobering (and perhaps useful) to observe that Paine, who, for the most part, rejected the Scripture, appeared to have far more interest in it, and far more knowlegde of it, than the average Christian today. Indeed, it would be my guess that most of the irritation and annoyance that this book would cause in a believer today would be the direct by-product of an inability to \\"give an answer\\" for the \\"hope\\" that lies within them."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine, who questioned the authority of kings and established the greatest country on earth, now investigates the authroity of priests, churches and scriptures. His simple but powerful premise is, that if God speaks to me it is revelation; but if you tell me He spoke to you, your assertion is heresay. Hence all scriptures of the world religions are also heresay. The only revelation he heard was what he could see--nature.His space-age insight that since there are many worlds, and life is likely on more than ours, an effective savior would have to hop from planet to planet sacraficing himself for fallen man or fallen aliens is hysterical and brilliant.This book is very unique, because Paine, unlike his contemporaries who shared his views (e.g. Jefferson, Franklin and Washington) dared not speak them. Even outspoken Paine waited until he neared execution before exploring the limits of religion from the vantage point of age in prison.His courage and effort have brought me a great deal of comfort. His methods show me how to analyze current issues in religion, morality and politics. He gives me a better yardstick with which to measure morality, churches and human behavior. Both tumbs up."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"For the first time in my life, I realized how often I had allowed others to tell me what I believed. Few books have ever had such an incredible impact on my life. Am I still a Christian? Yes. I am grateful for Thomas Paine for turning my blind faith, into a faith with my eyes wide open."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Paine does an excellent job debunking many of the spurious claims found in the bible. He also clearly shows the many similarities between Christianity and pagan mythology. Many believers in the bible do not follow every tenent or believe in every story as it is told i.e. Adam &amp; Eve, Noah, etc. Do most Christians really believe it is a good idea to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;? The light of reason causes most people to at least wonder about these philosophies and stories. This is in essence what Paine does in this book. In the end, the Bible does not stand up to reason.It is interesting to note that despite all the criticism towards Paine from religious people, today and in the past, he was one of the first and most influential abolitionists in America - in a time when many religious Christians owned slaves or felt it was justifiable through the bible!"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"We could use this American forefather in our Age Of Emotion, but he would never find a publisher and if he did people wouldn't read what they don't want to hear. Paine is direct, factual and relentless. Even in this short book his condemnation of scriptural religion becomes tedious in his effort to be complete. To Paine, scriptural religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - are the study of \\"opinions and fancies of men\\" confusing the message of God, which he says, is to be found in nature, available to all, unhindered by translations, rewritings and Church censorship.His knowledge of ancient mythologies and understanding of how the early Church evolved as a direct overlay of the Roman Empire with assumption of the Roman pantheon as Saints of the Church is impressive for 1794. He precedes our modern day Dominic Crossan by 200 years when he reports there was nothing new in virgin births or miracles in the ancient world - a common occurrence. To believe such events as resurrection from the dead Paine finds no different from any other superstition. To Paine Jesus was a heroic figure, peerless among men, but a man all the same, made into a God by those who loved him.Part 1 is concerned with the unreasonable like prophesy, which he shows to be hindsight not prediction. Likewise, Biblical moral conflicts of human sacrifice: \\"If I owe a person money and cannot pay him\\", writes Paine, someone else could assume the debt for payment, averting debtor's prison. But \\"if I commit a crime... moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself.\\" Part 2 is concerned with inconsistencies or impossibilities in the Bible itself. Like Moses writing of his own death, or the city of Dan which did not exist until 331 years after the Bible says Moses died; God's promise to save king Ahaz from Assyrians in Isaiah, while God slaughters him with Assyrians in Chronicles. The list is long, suitable for critiques, but tiring. Paine can also be amusing. Reviewing the Garden he notes the snake \\"enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is in no way surprised to hear a snake talk.\\" With these complications, and a list of reason violations, Paine writes that scriptures are \\"atheistic blasphemy\\". If you want to know God, he says, learn science as it is the true theology, revealing God all around us.Reading scriptures literally, as we do today, Paine reveals the obvious. But if Joseph Campbell's mythological tips are accessed we can see more to the stories than simply God's murder of innocent first born or his too-human characteristics of jealousy and revenge. Though it may be hard to see past the carnage of scriptures there remains a mystical element, like art, communicating past the painful present, penetrating the mystery of being alive and having to die, written by people without our clutter and with time to think about such things."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. It has helped me feel better about being an agnostic. When I confront Christian friends with the arguments Paine raises, they never are able to give a solid answer. This is without exception.The amazing thing to me is that Paine wrote this before Darwin, before the space age, at a time (around 1800) when it was almost unthinkable to attack the Church. It shows that Paine had guts, as well as an abundance of brains."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine, like others among our nation's founders (Ethan Allen, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Joel Barlow), considered himself a deist, a term that encompasses a wide range of beliefs but is principally based on &quot;religious rationalism&quot;: that, initially created by a benevolent God, the universe operates on rational rather than supernatural principles. Paine (and Allen), however, departed from the cautiously nuanced approach to religious issues adopted by his peers and vociferously rejected Judeo-Christian tenets and scriptures. In &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; Paine outlines his objections to theism and his belief in deism, and he dissects the inconsistencies in both the Old and New Testaments.Paine published the book in two parts: the first he hurriedly finished in January 1794 when he realized he would be arrested during the French Revolution (passages were in fact written from the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, where he was imprisoned). The second part was written the following year, and he responds to the critics of the first part with a no-holds-barred attack on the veracity of the Bible.Paine presents his basic belief that &quot;it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of God can unite,&quot; and later in the book he says that &quot;the creation is the bible of the deist.&quot; To Paine, the Bible is the word of man, not the Word of God, and he confronts many of the literalist beliefs proffered by the clergy and worshippers in his day. Many of his arguments, once shocking and blasphemous, are now taken for granted. For instance, he analyzes internal evidence in the books allegedly written by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to show that it's impossible for Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to have written them--a view that most Christians and nearly all biblical scholars acknowledge today. In other ways, he is way ahead of his time, pondering the minuteness of our world in the immensity of the universe, speculating that other planets around other stars may well hold other intelligent species, and mocking the resulting conclusion that &quot;the Son of God . . . would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death.&quot;Paine believes that God made a complex multi-world universe (rather than a single world) so that it would serve as a textbook for humankind: &quot;As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man.&quot; It is through this &quot;revelation&quot; of nature that believers can know God: &quot;The principles of science lead to this knowledge; for the creator of man is the creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see God, as it were, face to face.&quot;Even if one disagrees with Paine (and many obviously do),&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is an essential book both historically and philosophically. It should be read whether you hope to provide support for your own beliefs or to discover what non-Christians thought two centuries ago. It's inevitable that every reader will approach this book with an agenda, but even Christians should wrestle with Paine's arguments--since many of them are still heard today."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"It is evident to me that the staying power of Paine's Age of Reason is strong-- I need only look through the mixed opinions here at Amazon to see how dramatically it impacts those who read it. For me, it was a great wake-up call. I read Age of Reason at the beginning of this year and didn't know much about what to expect. From the first few pages I knew that I had found a book that reflects how I feel about religion. Paine offers a sensible alternative to atheism and the vast supply of revealed religions that abound in the world. To be logical, Paine points out, you need not give up a belief in a Higher Power. But you also don't have to sell your soul to charlatans and holy books written hundreds of years ago by men, not gods.The first half of Age of Reason outlines Paine's own beliefs as well as those he rejects. He gives reasons for every point he agrees or disagrees with and it is clear to the reader how Paine feels. Paine wants to spell out what his thoughts are so that he won't be misjudged by his peers. (Jefferson went through a similar ordeal-- because of his connections with France, he was labeled &quot;a French infidel and atheist&quot; neither of which was a true statement. See _The Religious Life of Thomas Jefferson_ for more info.)In the second half, Paine sets out to show the Biblical discrepancies to those who wanted to prove his ideas false by using the Bible as their &quot;evidence&quot;. In a relatively small number of pages, Paine debunks and demystifies (in my opinion) a fair amount of 'Christian' theology and scripture. If one man can do it so well in only a few pages, what does that say for revealed religion? That question is for each of us to answer individually and Age of Reason is required reading for anyone who is serious in doing just that."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"If the title above seems like hyperbole, I am prepared to defend it: Thomas Paine was one of the most important figures of the American revolution, his pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; did more to bring the colonies to revolt than any other document. After the revolution he went to France believing the French revolution to be the next step in the development of the freedom of mankind. While there he was condemned to death by Robespierre and detained pending execution. Believing that his death was imminent, Paine wrote Part One of Age of Reason, which is a compelling critique of the Bible and the faults of Christianity. His analysis is thorough, detailed and compelling, which is particularly impressive since he did it entirely without access to a Bible! This topic will offend many (which explains Paine's current demise from the pantheon of revolutionary heroes) but it should be read both for its analysis of the Bible and for appreciation of one of America's founding fathers."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"\\"Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity.\\" [Age of Reason, conclusion chr.]This statement sums up beautifully what Paine set out to do with his iconoclastic Age of Reason. While we have good reason to believe that a good number of American revolutionaries were non-traditionalists about religion, Age of Reason leaves no doubt Paine's feelings towards Christianity. His goal with this book is to show why the religion of \\"revealed Christianity\\" should be abandoned.The first of two sections of AoR is devoted to showing how foolish the very belief in such ideas as revelations and miracles are - two things Christianity is premised on. Paine has a particular bone to pick with the idea of revelation. Something can only count as revelation, Paine says, to the person who directly recieves it. From there, it is only hearsay gotten second-hand. Thus, the Bible is not revelation, but hearsay. And miracles? Can they not be (a) things we don't understand yet; (b) mistakes in observation; or (c) lies, if we are told about them second-hand? There is no reason they cannot be any of these three.The second part of the book goes into exacting detail to show that the Bible was likely not written by those originally claimed as authors. Was there any of the Bible written by Moses? Exegesis gives reasons to reject this as absurd. Samuel? The same applies. And as we should well know, the New Testament was written much later than would have been necessary to have any first-hand knowledge of this man called Jesus.The secnod half, to be honest, may have been controversial at the time, but is hardly so now. Religious scholars seem on-board with the idea that the Bible and particularly the New Testament contain little if any first-hand accounts of anything.And that is what makes Paine so angry: that we are taking books with no confirmed authorship, and whose honesty may easily be doubted, as the revealed word of God. Paine is a deist who obstinately holds that the best way to know God is through nature - His Creation, if you will. If God created the universe, then why do we need a book to tell us about God when we can just look at that universe?To some - this author included - many of Paine's arguments will not be new. I've seen many of them elsewhere, from Bertrand Russell's \\"Why I'm Not a Christian,\\" to Sam Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\" to George Smith's \\"Atheism: Case AGainst God.\\" What makes Paine so special, though, is his rhetorical flair. Writing in an age where language was to be flowery and sentences were to be long, Paine writes in a remarkably terse and modern tone. He is obviously passionate about the subject and that makes for an exciting and invigorating read.For anyone who wants a better idea at one of the 'religous' currents in America circa 1800, this is an exciting book, right up there alongside fellow deist Thomas Jefferson's own \\"Jefferson's Bible.\\" And if you are a Christian who wants some food for thought, read this with... both eyes open."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine believed in a creator. He saw all around him the evidence of a creator. Within himself, he felt the inspiration of a creator. But he was repulsed by what he read in the Bible. I am in full agreement with Mr. Paine that the god depicted in the Bible and the man-made systems of religion which claim divine inspiration for authority are an insult to the creator. This book, whether one would agree with its conclusions or not, at least will inspire the reader to think about the books and teachings to which men tell us to bow. Paine analyzes the logic of revealed religions with the critical thinking he was given and encourages us to do the same. And why shouldn't we? The fact is, most people I have met have thought more about what kind of car to buy than about their religion. They have taken the religion of their parents as mindlessly as they put on socks. And most organized religions don't push the issue as long as the tax-free money keeps coming in. Thomas Paine states clearly and unflinchingly the arguments against revealed religions. And Paine's writing stands the test of time without the need of apologetics."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Tom Paine's excellent thought provoking book, The Age of Reason, did much to help me clear my mind of superstition and develope a much more realistic idea of the Creator.Paine shows there is a profound difference between &quot;revealed&quot; religion and God. He points out that all the different &quot;revealed&quot; religions have their own various &quot;holy&quot; books and all claim the other &quot;revealed&quot; religions and &quot;holy&quot; books are false.Deism is offered as an alternative to both &quot;revealed&quot; religion and atheism. Deism is a reason-friendly spiritual philosophy/religion that teaches belief in God based on reason and nature, not on any of the books written by men. It's a revolution in religion! It's spiritual, not dogmatic!Paine makes clear that if we want a better world WE NEED TO DO IT! We can't pray and dictate to God what needs to be done. We need to use our God-given reason and correct the problems we all face.The Age of Reason also makes clear that the best way to serve God is to serve our fellow human beings. Being kind to others is key to Deism.I'm very grateful to Tom Paine for having the courage to write this wonderful book. It has really helped change my life for the better. I'm now very active in the World Union of Deists and feel very postive about it!"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is the best book on freethinking that has walked the face of the earth.

The more ironic thing, is that the religious conservatives know they have they basis for their claims, and when someone uses facts to prove them wrong, they can't handle it.Paine points out that the Catholic religion was more cruel than the Greek religions. The reason is because in Greek times, religious people welcomed philsophers and scientists. In the days of Christianity, the free thinkers and scientists were burned at the stake. The Age of Reason means you think outside of oppressive thinking, which generally happens to be religion. Sorry, that's a fact and you can read history to see that more people have had their lives and freedom taken away in the name of God than anything else. It still goes on today."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I have been a freethinker for a year now, and I find the topic of religion as fascinating, especially now because I am not a part of it.I have read many books from various skeptical authors like Ingersoll, Doherty, Acharya S, Twain, and Barker. I always avoided Paine because I thought 1700's literature might be a little dry and difficult to read. I was also getting to the point where I wasn't really expecting to get any new insight or critique of christianity. I WAS WRONG. Even if you have lots of good skeptic books, buy this one for the following 3 reasons.1) Thomas Paine is a great writer! He is witty, humorous, and insightful. I only raised my eyebrow one or two times because of the language. (Shew = Shown btw)2)Thomas Paine did not have the benefit of carbon dating, and a lot of the biblical documentation that skeptics take for granted today. He critiques the bible using the bible itself. His critiquing of biblical history and authorship book by book is eye candy to any skeptic. For example:[If Moses wrote the pentatauch in third person then isn't] \\"Moses ridiculous and absurd: for example, Num 12:3 'now the man moses was very meek. Above all the men which were on the face of the earth' If Moses said this of himself then instead of being the meekest of men, he was one of the most vain and arragant coxcombs...If he was the author, the author is without credit, because to boast of meekness is the reverse of meekness, and is a lie in sediment.\\"Paine also uses clever internal dating techniques to show these documents were not written when they were supposed. How could Moses have known about the city of Dan (Gen 14) when its name wasn't changed (from Laish) until 331 years after his death (Judges 18). These little inconsistancies fill the second part of his book.3) This book, especially the first part, tells about the history of paine's unique life and times in which he lived (especially france) through his own words.Buy this book! If you like it, Buy any book by Robert Ingersoll they are all solid gold. I also recommend Dan Barker's \\"Losing Faith in Faith\\" for any beginning skeptic. Barker changed my life for the better.\\"Where freedom is, there is my home\\" -Ben franklin\\"Where freedom is not, there is mine\\" -Thomas Paine"},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"Thomas Paine's book against Christianity is a classic to Free-thinkers for its revolutionary courage and thought. I loved it for the honest, simple, eloquent language Paine brought to the work, and the countless errors and absurdities he found both in the Bible and the Church orthodoxy. The author gave the reader his opinions on religion, but his opinions consisted of far more than simple statements about what he thought of the doctrines of the Church. He gave his reasoning behind his denial of the virgin birth and mosaic account, and each reasoning is a blow to the religion's reasonable contentions. His belief in Deism and therefore a belief in God may be categorized as showing faith, but many do not realize the politics attached to the work. He wanted to take power away from the Church hierarchy while leading others from reactionary athiesm (believing in no God because of the belief was corrupted by the Church). Also, athiesm was not a rational conclusion during this time period because Newtonian science showed an intelligent system to the universe. The best recommendation for this book comes from those who did not give it 5 stars. They obviously disagree with the book's conclusions in some way. The atheist or agnostic cannot get over the fact that he accepted a God who revealed himself through science. The Christian says he missed the &quot;true meaning&quot; of the religion. They both remain silent about the evidence Paine brings against the Bible because they know he is correct, and so do I."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is a book which was written in 1795 but surprisingly enough is as clear and easy to read as books written today. The book consists of two parts, the fist is a discussion of deism as a rational religious belief and he second part consists of a textual analysis of the bible.The second half is probably the more interesting part to read today. Payne goes through and compares the internal logic of the text of both the old and New Testament and Old Testament. The four gospels vary significantly in their account of a range of issues which Payne suggests proves that they were written in isolation from each other and suggests that their origin is hearsay. One example he raises is the account that suggests that when Jesus died the tombs of saints opened and they were returned to life. This rather significant event is not mentioned in the other gospels and that suggests that it was not true. He uses a similar approach to other gospels. In regard to the Old Testament he suggests convincingly that the suggestion that Moses wrote the first give books of the bible cannot be true. The key to understanding this is a close examination of the text. These books not only describe Moses life but also his death. The writing is inconsistent with personal authorship in other ways. (The text for instance suggesting that Moses was modest. If one was to make such an assertion about oneself it would not be consistent with the nature of the assertion)The book is very short and apart from the discussion of the bible it is an interesting work in the context of history. It was written after the revolution but before Napoleon proclaimed himself emperor. Payne had little idea of what was to come and how quickly Catholicism would be re-introduced in France. An interesting book and the critique of the Bible is one of the foundations of modern scholarship in the area."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"This is one of the most thought prevoking books I have ever read. Paine is a master at putting together the most logical reasoning. He compels an individual to think for himself.Many will find Paine's arguments about religion, Christianity and the other major religions disconcerting. He believed in God but not the god depicted in the Scriptures, not the god of the Isrelites, the god that slew the enemies of Isreal.He challenges the reader not to accept doctrine and dogma without exposing it to the application of reason. His arguments are powerful and not for the weak of heart. In a way he leaves you with a feeling of sadness, realizing that an eternal life hearafter is probably no more than wishful thinking."},{"Title":"The age of reason","review":"I never understood why all Catholic beief deadends are explained simply as Dogmas.

If this was built to be informative, cool ... but reading it I couldn't help but feel that maybe this was some Theosophic concoction written to bolster some auxilliary occult claims or austere.I did appreciate the author's treatment of telepathy. How he regarded it as so real it's nothing. I agree with the other reviewer who said that this is a disgrace to Tibetan Buddhism.The buddhist monks depicted on the cover look Mahayana Shaolin, not Tibetan.

Rather,this is a wild mixture of Ascended Master's teachings, some Christian ideas, hypnosis, new-age clairvoyance, remote-viewing, some UFO-logy,etc. Though almost none of it in itself is completely wrong, on one occasion there is a dangerous confusion between relative = dualistic and absolute = non-dualistic reality: here Rampa states that hell was invented to keep people in check, but that hell does not actually exist, or that earth already is hell. The TRUTH however is obvious: as long as we live with a dualistic mindset (good/evil), there logically is a hell indeed and heaven is its dualistic twin. Only when a truly non-dualistic mindset is attained (easier said than done), hell ceases to exist. Authentic Tibetan teachings make this point also very clear.For a really breathtakingly fascinating spiritual adventure story that also accurately portrays Tibetan teachings, I highly recommend David Michie's \\"The Magician of Lhasa\\"."},{"Title":"The Vertigo Tarot","review":"I would HIGHLY recommend this deck; it is a PHENOMENAL deck...

On a positive note? It is easy to read, you'll find a brief description of various insects that live in Florida. I enjoyed Mr. Maxwell giving us an idea of those that are beneficial. Several times he referred to raising insects and giving us his hands-on experience.We have crickets galore on our property. I have had a problem with them in my vegetable garden. I ASSUMED they were bad though I never saw them eating any of the plants. But who knew that they are also aggressive toward other insects? He placed a grasshopper and a female field cricket in a bottle. She attacked and killed the other. I learned my lesson and won't be so judgemental in the future.The downside? The pictures are in black and white. He points out beneficials to us but he is not ashamed to recommend Malathion, Dursban, Diazinon, Trithion, Ethion, Zineb, Baygon, Pentac, Vendex and some others as a solution to getting rid of ones we don't want around.His solution for scorpions? Nothing since Chlordane has been banned by the E.P.A. I have found three near the house on different occasions. I used my foot and crushed them. I have had problems with other pests but nothing too extreme.He does not list all the pests we have but he touches on over one hundred that are well-known. Are their better bug books? Yes. But make no mistake, this is a handy little reference which I believe was the author's intention.What have I learned? I am trying to encourage more birds. We have set out four bluebird houses and we finally have some couples raising their young.We are trying to plant more natives to encourage wildlife. We now hear an owl on occasion. We have hawks that visit us. I recently witnessed one with a squirrel. We put out a bat house. I have installed broken pots around the house to encourage toads and have had some success.To encourage numerous beneficial insects I have planted African Blue Basil in my garden and in pots near the house. I started them from clippings from the original plant I bought a couple of years ago. The seeds are sterile but it is very easy to root. Because they are tender, they will only overwinter in areas with very mild winters such as southern Florida. The plus? I have never had a plant that drew in so many other insects when they are in flower. It thrives in our heat and humidity. To encourage continual blooms just cut out the old seed stalks early in the morning about once a month.I will keep this book on hand to use as the occasional reference. I'll ignore those parts that I differ with him. Since it is a manageable size it can be kept in a drawer near my seeds so I have it nearby when I start to plant new herbs, flowers or vegetables."},{"Title":"Florida Insects","review":"My neighbor shared a book with me that was published several years ago.

Metzger's Lexical Aids seems to be for the Revised Standard Version, whereas this reflects the UBS-4/NA-27 editions, so it has slightly different numbers of word occurrences than Metzger's Lexical Aids. We did use both books, but I found this one much more helpful at times. Metzger is more concise and lists cognates and helpful hints for memorization.What is most helpful about this book is that it splits up word lists into manageable lists, about 40-50 words per list. It goes down to 10x word occurrences in the GNT (like Metzger). With verbs, what is also very useful is that it lists all the occurrences that lexicons (like Dr. Mounce's Analytical Lexicon) also have: Present Active Indicative, Future Active Indicative, Perfect Active Indicative, Aorist Active Indicative, Aorist Passive Indicative, and Future Passive Indicative, if they exist in the Greek New Testament.There are some good diagrams, like a verb-chart for omega-class verbs (e.g., luw or luo), as well as preposition diagrams. Not every word is translated, but some of the more uncommon words in the Greek New Testament are translated, verse by verse (similar to Zerwick's and Grosvenor's &quot;A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New Testament&quot;).Think of this book as an updated for NA-27/UBS-4 version of Metzger, with better diagrams and charts, plus a chopped-at-the-knees version of Zerwick and Grosvenor. Metzger still has better hints and helps for memorizing the words, and Zerwick and Grosvenor completely comprehensive in parsing New Testament words, verse-by-verse."},{"Title":"Reading New Testament Greek","review":"This is a great resource for moving beyond introductory Biblical Greek.

Most of these short stories were about strange appearances of someone or something or strange disappearances of people or things. As far as I could tell there weren't any aliens or supernatural life involved in any of the short stories. These kids in every story just seemed to happen upon something while they were moping because they were depressed or angered about their \\"destructive\\" families.

Geron L. a reader"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"It is not often a cultural phenomenon like Star Trek is responsible for a spurt of growth of interest in the hard sciences that serve as a backdrop for the various television shows and movies in its canon. Lawrence Krauss in THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK attempts to confront the unspoken assumptions that go on in the viewer's mind under the helm's countertop when Captain Kirk orders, 'Warp factor three, Mr. Sulu.' Apparently what goes on in reality is the merging of pseudo-science with some very clever writing that distracts an audience that is not particularly science-literate anyway. Krauss discusses the widespread Star Trek use of holograms, warp travel, matter transportation, phasers, inertial dampers, time travel, and nano-technology. In each case, he points out with some tongue in cheek the present impossibility of actually developing and using such devices. Krauss is a physicist who likes to write,or judging by his lengthy list of published books, he is a writer who likes physics. He has a smooth style of explaining the grotesquely unfamiliar in terms of the beloved familiar world of the Federation. TPST is a book written for those whose knowledge of basic science is gleaned from watching shows like Star Trek. He asks many questions, elaborates many details, but provides precious few answers. In short, he is just like my 10th grade physics teacher. Perhaps that is the inner lesson of this book: to probe beneath the smoke and mirrors of the writer-magician's blanket to see if the immutable laws of reasonability are being obeyed."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Krauss' book helped pioneer popular science and made the crossover between science and geek science fiction acceptable and mainstream. For this, he should be commended. His writing style is lucid, if a bit wordy, and his enthusiasm for the Star Trek franchise is evident throughout.Unfortunately, when reading Krauss' defining contribution to pop culture science, one can't help but picture the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons attempting to correct writers on continuity within the Radioactive Man mythology. Instead of focusing on what Star Trek got right, and how Star Trek has inspired science and the appreciation of science, Krauss is more apt to focus on the negatives. Unlike science writers such as Michio Kaku who look at the science fiction and dare to dream about how such things could be done given our knowledge of the potential trajectory of science today, Krauss boxes himself in and shoots down almost every piece of Star Trek technology based on the economics of energy. Although one can appreciate the pragmatism of looking at energy costs, Krauss doesn't dare to dream of advances in energy technology or physics that could make this possible. He walks a fine line between pragmatism and pessimism, and more often than not, falls over that edge.It's interesting to think that a man who would rather send robots to space than men would pursue writing a book about Star Trek, but his very hesitancy to support a manned space mission carries some of the same personality that is apparent throughout his book. One could assume that the negativity found within its pages is highly influenced by his personality rather than solely the science.Although a fun read (and the final chapter discussing science bloopers is very entertaining due to its light-hearted jabbing - the only chapter that doesn't come across as a bit condescending), the book suffers from being light on actual Star Trek information (it simply uses Star Trek to begin a lengthy talking point of in-depth physics), and lacks the enthusiasm and forward-thinking that has made physicists such as Michio Kaku and Brian Greene so popular. It is also unfortunate that a reader today will probably see this book as a rehash of topics that have been covered better in Science Channel programs such as Through the Wormhole and Sci Fi Science, and PBS series' such as Fabric of the Cosmos. Just keep in mind that the original edition of this book not only pre-dates those shows, but helped set the table for them."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"The Physics of Star Trek, by Professor Lawrence Krauss, is a fun book to read. Who amongst us has not at one time or another wondered while watching Star Trek, either when it first aired, ro in watching re-runs, if all of that magic might someday really come to fruition. Tractor Beams, photon beams, dilithium crystals, the holideck, beaming up and down, a physical exam with a cell-phone like device (without having to have to give a blood sample!: wow!Professor Krauss, a professor of physics at Arizona State University, is well equipped to assess the possibilities and probabilities of occurrence of all of these dreams. For the most pare, he doesn't come out directly and say something is absolutely impossible or practical: he takes us through an estimate of the energy that might be needed, or the amount of computer storage space that might be needed; we're left to somewhat draw our own conclusions.As an example: the ever popular tractor beam. Just how might that work? When a tractor beam is sent out to capture and pull in some object, why doesn't the Enterprise also move? We all know that if we tug on one end of a rope and something else tugs at the other end, most likely we'll both move, unless one end of the rope is firmly anchored to something \\"immovable\\". What in space might the Enterprise be \\"firmly anchored\\" to?Another example, my favorite: what characteristics of the holideck are possible,and what are impossible? Or is it all possible?Occasionally Professor Krauss wanders off into the tall grass of astrophysics or of quantum theory, and the text tends toward journalese. But that's ok: it showed to me areas in which his passion for the subject showed through.I thoroughly enjoyed this little book: 228 pages. A fun read."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I found this book to be very interesting. I've only watched a handful of Star Trek episodes in my life, but I was still able to follow along with most of the topics that were mentioned in this book. Lawrence Krauss does a good job at describing the physics principles have been incorporated into Star Trek. I was surprised to see that Star Trek really does involve a lot of things that involve physics!Something that I found very interesting in this book is when Krauss discusses travel in space. He describes the great distances that are between our world and other parts of the universe. Because these distances are so great (up to millions of light-years), Krauss says that traveling that far in a straight line is impossible for us. And so, the writers of Star Trek invented the \\"warp drive\\" in order to overcome this obstacle. In this book, Krauss talks about how \\"warping space\\" is the only feasible way of traveling great distances. He then discussed the physics behind the extra dimension in space which makes it possible to warp space time. I found this to be very remarkable.Another interesting thing that I read about in this book is the author's analysis of the holograms in Star Trek. In the book, Krauss talks about light beams and their wave-like properties. He mentions how if 2 waves are added together and are in phase with each other then the amplitude will double. If the two waves are not in phase with each other then the waves will cancel each other out. Krauss then connected this idea with holograms. He said that if you have a photographic film that measures the intensity of the waves, you would then be able to extract the information and recreate the object that scattered the waves. This would be used to create a hologram.My only criticism for this book is that sometimes the author jumps to conclusions too quickly. For instance, Krauss said that it would be impossible have sufficient computer memory which would be needed to store all of the atomic information about a person getting beamed. Krauss then said that his computer hard drive can only hold up to 16 megabytes of information (which is the basis of his argument). Since the time that this book was published, however, we can see that computers have improved drastically. For this reason, I don't agree with the author that computing power would limit the ability to beam a person. It would be very hard to predict the power that computers will have in the future.Overall, \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\" is an interesting book and is fairly easy to read. Some parts of the book were a little confusing for me because I haven't seen every episode of Star Trek, but I was still able to follow along with most of it. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys physics and/or Star Trek."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"This book was great fun to read, it actually made learning about physics fun. Yes, I will admit I enjoy Star Trek which probably made this book even more interesting, but even for those a little interested in both physics and Star Trek I would highly suggest this book. It took what could be extremely dull and made it fun to learn about. For example who knew that the phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" could come with so many issues, or warp drive, black holes and laser beams. I am really glad I read this book, it has changed the way I watch Star Trek, I can now spout off useless, yet interesting, physics trivia while watching the classics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Ever wondered if traveling faster than the light of speed is possible, or if calling out those famous words, \\"Beam me up Scotty\\" could actually transport you instantly to a different location up 60 000km away? The Physics of Star Trek, brilliantly written by Lawrence M. Krauss, provides an educated look into the reality of concepts Star Trek writers incorporated into the series. Krauss illustrates that vast impossibilities exist due to the constraints of the laws of physics. Krauss takes many advanced ideas that have been developed in physics and explains them so that average people can grasp their complex principles. This is an interesting read for anyone who wants to better understand how our universe operates. I suggest that any Trekker out there, anyone who gazes into the stars at night and wonders if others are out there, or anyone who just loves to have their brain expanded by the intrigue of the vast universe read this book!!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I like this book because it reads like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time, or Carl Sagan's Cosmos: it's a light-hearted discussion of the related science with lots of connections made easy for the reader and lots of examples given, and all in easy-to-understand language. I think it's clear that Krauss loves and knows his Star Trek as much as he does his scientific research, and his purpose in writing this book must have been both to educate and to entertain, and I think he scores big on both counts. Plus, the forward by Stephen Hawking, and the references to Hawking's poker game with Data, Newton, and Einstein, sets a fun tone right from the start. I think there is no way you can read this book and not learn something you didn't know before, or think about something you knew in a different way, I don't care how much of a Trek fan you are. And there is no way you can not have fun reading this book. A must read for all Trek fans!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I never took biology or chemistry let alone physics in school, so I am easily intimidated by big words with Latin prefixes and Greek suffixes that explain the mysteries of the real world let alone the \\"Star Trek\\" universe. You say \\"quantuum\\" and I say \\"leap.\\" Lawrence M. Krauss, Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics and Professor of Astronomy and Chairman of the Department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University might be making stuff up the same was as Gene Roddenberry and his heirs, but he sure makes a compelling case that is easily understood even by scientific illiterates such as myself. He certainly has the credentials, even if he spells his first name funny.This book takes nitpicking about \\"Star Trek\\" to a whole new level, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\" is divided into three sections. The first, \\"A Cosmic Poker Game,\\" explores the physics of inertial dampers and tractor beams as they apply to warp speed, deflector shields, wormholes and time travel (The short answer is \\"No, but...,\\" which is where it gets fascinating). The second, \\"Matter Matter Everywhere,\\" covers transporter beams, warp drives, dilithium crystals, matter-antimatter engines, and the holodeck (see above short answer). The third, \\"The Invisible Universe, or Things That Go Bump in the Night,\\" looks at the great unknown of the future where we may (or may not) encounter alien beings, multiple dimensions and other fun thinks from the \\"Star Trek\\" universe. There are nice diagrams to help the explanations along, filing in for Krauss' classroom chalkboard. Krauss also proves he is not alone in his major league nitpicking as he includes a Top Ten Physics Bloopers and Blunders from \\"Star Trek\\" that were selected by Noble Prize-winning physicists and other Trekkers.In his foreword Stephen Hawking points out what we have known since Jules Verne: \\"Today's science fiction is often tomorrow's science fact.\\" I believe it was Jim Kirk who said things were only impossible until you did them. If I had read this book when I first watched the original \\"Star Trek\\" in syndication it might have kindled my interest in science to a level at least appropriate for polite social conversation. I can easily imagine what reading this book might do for somewhere who loves science; opening the minds of students to the possibilities behind the television show they enjoy watching."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Because it's 10 years old, it is a tad dated, but lawrence Krauss nails it.

I suggest this book for everyone to read. Whether you are a fan of Star Trek or have no idea what Star Trek is, whether you like science or think it is all meaningless and boring. If you are a big fan you will love this book because he goes into great detail about individual episodes all the way from Captain Kirk to Captain Archer. The book talks about certain incidences in some of the episodes that not even I can remember and I have seen every episode. If you have no idea what Star Trek is this book will still be one of the best books I think you will ever read. It is very interesting! Talks about how everything you see on T.V. is different than from real life. How you look at one thing on earth and it will read 2+2=4 but then you look at that same thing in space and it will read 2+2=5 everything in space is completely different and this book has the best examples that I have ever seen. I highly suggest that everyone reads this book.

Not terribly technical, Krauss does an excellent job of explaining complicated theories so a dummy like me can comprehend them and with a joke."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"This a not-so technical book that many Star Trek fans will love. Of course it requires a previous knowledge of general physics but it is very good. I enjoyed reading it and of course I have to have a college physics book by my side to get the most of it."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"For me, this book was like chocolate milk for children. If you have had a child, or had a clever mother, you may have been given chocolate milk in the past. Your mom probably didn't want you to have more sweets, but she also know that it was the best way for you to drink your milk. Same concept here.Mr. Krauss is a scientist and a teacher who loves physics. He knows, however, that physics aren't loved by many people. So he has hit on a clever idea. He teaches us physics while discussing a popular and fun series, Star Trek. So, beware, you will learn, if you read this book.You still, however, should have fun. In this book we learn the scientific foundations for some of the more fanciful technologies found in the Star Trek series. Everything from warp engines to phasers to holograms and deflector fields are discussed.Some of the conclusions of the author, I noticed, have disapointed some of Star Trek's hardcore fans. I don't know why. I watch the series to enjoy myself. I still do. The fact that one person doesn't believe warp power, for example, will ever be practical doesn't detract from the Star Trek's stories. Indeed, the fact the warp power may be possible, but to expensive, was shocking.Some of the other discussions found in this book were also very surprising. The author, for example, talks about how the computing aspect of transporters may be possible by the 23rd century. He also thinks that more active holograms are possible, but ones that touch or interact with people physically, he believes are unlikely.Again, by discussing these aspects of science, we learn alot about our current technology. This is a fun, informative read, and a good tool for teachers who want to excite their studies about their studies. For a science book, therefore, I would give it a &quot;5&quot; for fun. Overall, I have given this book a &quot;4&quot;, but it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I loved this book. It explained things in two hundred pages that twelve years worth of science teachers have failed at, and I'm no Trekkie.

We've got to get out of here. Engage, I say!Data: But sir, according to Lawrence Krauss, a distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy from the 20th century, such an action would require energy far greater than is possible in order to manipulate spacetime around the Enterprise sufficiently to travel at \\"warp\\" speed. Also, for the same reasons, Dr. Krauss essentially ruled out the possibility of a \\"cloaking device\\" and many other things we like to believe are real.Picard: Data, we don't have TIME for this! Get us out of here now!!Data: Captain, I am sorry, but it is simply not possible. Also, I hate to inform you that, according to Dr. Krauss, our deflector shields will not work either. But, fortunately, neither will the Romulans' phaser beams.Picard: What are you saying, Data?!?Data: What I am saying, sir, is that although we THINK we are aboard a starship called the Enterprise, and although we THINK we just saw 2 Romulan warbirds uncloak, it is all just an illusion. All of these things would violate several basic laws of physics, including Einstein's general and special theories of relativity, which of course are still valid today.

If in your entire life you only want to read one book on physics, then this should be it. I suspect, that Krauss will interest you enough that you'll want to read more. But even if you don't, you'll enjoy learning the wonderful info contained here."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"This volume by Lawrence Krauss is a physicists' exploration of the scientific feasibility of &quot;Star Trek science&quot;. As a student of science myself and a Star Trek fan for many years, I was intrigued by this book. Apart from drawing attention to curious inconsistencies (such as &quot;how come we hear explosions in space, where there's no air to carry the sound?&quot;) this book addresses a wide range of issues, such as WARP drive, transporters, the Holodeck, Black Holes, and Data, among other things.What this turned out to be is a nice and easily accessible introduction to modern day physics using Star Trek as a model. Overall the book is very interesting to read and often thought-provoking. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a significant limitation because of its attitude. The &quot;Physics of Star Trek&quot; tests the feasibility of Star Trek phenomena based on our understanding of physics today. Thus many things are deemed &quot;impossible&quot; because the author cannot visualize a way to make them work using 20th century science. The problem with this attitude is that it lacks vision. Had he been writing with this attitude in the 1940s for instance, he would have discounted any possibilities of having any automated thinking machines and dismissed any aspect of the computerized world that we enjoy and take for granted today. The beauty of Star Trek is that it is visionary in nature, and a fair analysis of the show needs to make some educated guesses about what the science of the future will look like and not merely confine thinking to the science of today.Having said that, I do concede that this book is a very nice, fun to read, and interesting introduction to the science of today, and I highly recommend it to any Trek fan interested in real science!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"As a former aeronautical engineer who had the opportunity to study quantum physics, I very much enjoyed this book. The author was able to show that science fiction at the level of Star Trek carries on the dreams and hopes that we all have, and, more specifically, those from which physicists make their lives.The ingenuity of Star Trek physics bases itself on what is already amazing in comtemporary quantum physics. Most of us would already be amazed by what quantum physicists are dealing with every day. The author also points out some amusing inconsistencies which are almost necessary for the sake of entertaining our 20th century peoples. Reading this book makes you want to learn quantum physics and feel that you already live in the future."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Although the title suggests otherwise, this is not really a book about Star Trek. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist, quotes Star Trek, but his further explanations largely neglect what can be seen in the series and, rather than that, strictly adhere to the laws of real physics. This alone is no criticism. We need popular books about physics (and this is a good one), but the title just doesn't suit it.A typical chapter begins with examples from the series, but subsequently it becomes like a general analysis of science (and) fiction where one could easily replace &quot;Enterprise&quot; with &quot;Star Destroyer&quot; or anything else. In the chapter on warp propulsion, for instance, Krauss discusses a general theory of FTL travel without even mentioning the term &quot;subspace&quot; which is actually the key Star Trek's warp drive. The same happens in his reflections on the transporter. He assumes that a human being should be reduced to bits, although Star Trek's transporter is supposed to transmit the very matter of an object or person. Agreed, from the viewpoint of actual physics Krauss is right, and I would wish that he gave certain Trek authors a few repetitional lessons in physics. Anyway, I don't understand why he calls a book with rather few Trek-specific content and much more real world physics The Physics of Star Trek and not &quot;The Physics of Science Fiction&quot;. I usually don't like to speculate, but maybe because the book sells better with &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the title, or does he intend to disillusion or even convert die-hard Trek fans? Well, I rather go with a positive explanation that Star Trek just covers all facets of fictional science and technology, so it was the obvious choice.Speaking of disillusions, this book will have several for those fans who firmly believe that it just needs a bit of research until we get warp or only impulse drive or a transporter to work. Krauss makes very clear how much fuel it would take to accelerate a starship to &quot;only&quot; 0.5c and decelerate again (6561 times the ship's mass!), and what a resolution would be required to beam up a person's atoms from a planet surface (that of a lens as wide as the distance to the planet!). As I said, I think the book isn't supposed to spoil our fun of Star Trek, and I hope it won't have this effect on anyone. So if we keep in mind that Krauss is just talking about general concepts and not about how the technology works in Star Trek, this is a very good lecture for all who like Star Trek and all who like to know more about the limits of physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I was given this book a few years ago as a gift and I finally picked it up and read it. It is really mostly about physics and not too much about Star Trek, but the cool thing is that he uses ST to demonstrate some advanced topics of physics.

It rekindled my intrest in these topics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"This is an interesting book that has a great amount of valuable scientific information included, such as the basics (and the not so basics) of many of the technologies employed in all of the Star Trek shows.

To his credit, the author does tell of many of the innovations that the Star Trek show led to, and also tells of the particles/concepts that they somehow got right before researchers discovered them. The shortcoming is the closedmindedness. All through the book he tells of the impossible energy requirements to accomplish many things, such as warpspeed, but they're only impossible according to current knowledge. Go back to BC times and ask their scientists about flying machines: impossible.

A must for any science/Star Trek fan."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"\\"Physics of Star Trek\\" is a light-hearted, informative, thoroughly entertaining and yet, paradoxically, entirely serious overview of the physics of Star Trek - arguably the longest-running, most popular, and most famous franchise in the history of television and movies. Dr Krauss regales us with essay after essay on what the writers got right, what they got wrong and how their imaginative brilliance sometimes made them look like prescient scientists instead of script writers - black holes, parallel universes, time travel, quantum gravity, phasers, holographic virtual reality, warp drives, teleportation, replication, alien life forms, scanners, tractor beams, antimatter fuel and much, much more.Similar in content and style to Michio Kaku's popular \\"Physics of the Impossible\\", Krauss' approach to the academic side of the physics involved is just a little more light-hearted and easy going which, of course, will appeal to the less-informed readers of popular science. If you feel up to the challenge, this makes a great prequel and companion read to Michio Kaku's excellent book.For diehard Star Trek fans, Krauss also regales us with a set of laughable physics bloopers and ends with the hint of a sequel to come that he will entitle \\"Physics of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Krauss\\"! Now that's hilarious.Well done, Mr Krauss. Highly recommended. On a side note, I recently had the privilege of hearing Mr Krauss speak live in a physics \\"debate\\" at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario. If you ever get the chance to hear, be sure to take the opportunity. His speaking is every bit as entertaining as his writing. (Or is it the other way around?)Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Chances are that if you consider a complicated and thought-provoking series like Star Trek to be entertaining, then you'll find Lawrence Krauss's discussions of scientific realities and almost realities to be similarly enthralling, especially when he throws some good discourse on ethics into the mix. I am not a science person by any stretch of the imagination. Math hurts my brain, 10th grade Chemistry bored me silly, and I'm relatively comfortable in trusting that Geordi LaForge knows what he's talking about when he reels off explanations of matter/anti-matter mixing, force field frequencies, and inertial dampeners. Yet Krauss masters a balance between complexity and accessibility in his book, making everything easily understandable even while helping you to comprehend the basics of cutting edge physical laws and theories. This guy should be everyone's first science teacher.Krauss' exploration is just fascinating, whether in discussing how transporters might work (do you actually transmit the atoms or simply destroy the original person and clone them on the other end? How are consciousness, memory, and the soul transmitted?), or the problems involved with faster than light speed travel and time relativity. Krauss isn't just some holier than thou critic who seeks to tear apart the science of Star Trek, either. Instead, he offers possible explanations for how much of the technology might actually be able to work, all while pointing out that, a decade and a half later, many of the imaginary scientific concepts used in these shows have turned out to be more accurate than not.This is a book written for those of us that enjoy the scientific and ethical aspects of Star Trek (and this book focuses primarily on Next Generation). If that's the case for you, then \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\" is the logical next step. It's far more accessible than the Next Generation Technical Manual, and it's far more rewarding, as well.**Note: This review was based upon the original 1995 printing of \\"The Physics of Star Trek.\\" Amazon is selling a version that was last revised in 2007.

I've been an on and off fan ever since. The same can be said for my interest in the developments in quantum mechanics and origins.While some of the commenters have criticized Dr. Krauss for what I would characterize as \\"stuffiness\\", I found his approach to be more whimsical, with a hint of being a true Trekkie. The book title will perhaps lead many young readers to pick it up and, perhaps, increase their interest in science and physics... thereby improving the number of young candidates who ultimately choose a career in science or mathematics. That, of itself, gives the book value and I thank Dr. Krauss for his efforts.One issue I had with the explanations was that of the pulsar. One of the observations stated that a pulsar could spin at greater than 1000 pulses per second and rotate at 1000 r/sec. It would seem that this pulsar, if properly oriented, could present 2000 pulses/sec to observers. So, not to pick nits, but precision in criticism is its own reward. ;)While Dr. Krauss notes that not all SF screenwriters are physicists, I would point out that very few physicists are adequate writers.

The entire time it keeps you intrigued and open-minded about the possibility of space travel, wormholes, and the like. Initially I had no idea how in depth the Star Trek writers went when creating the series. Each possibility was addressed and backed up by facts and theories of some of the smartest minds our current physics world has ever seen. This book truly gives insight into the physics of Star Trek, as the name portrays. I would recommend this book to anyone and it is interesting the whole way through. After reading The Physics of Star Trek, I was truly curious about Newton, Einstein, and Hawking's work toward time travel and all science fiction related to Star Trek. The examples given by Krauss are very helpful in understanding how all of this was thought out and expertly wrapped up in this book, in a relatable and comical way, as well. It is easy to read also, anyone can just pick up this book and read it the whole way through.

This book opened up the world of Science Fact vs Science Fiction, but often I found the author to be overly detailed on his explanation often going on and on before getting to the point. While I first found this interesting, the examples tended to go past my point of interest or above my head. I wasn't expecting blunt one liners, or just the simple \\"No it's not possible\\", but more of a good example to why it is or isn't without it being over stated line after line. I also think for the younger reader much of what was stated might also be above their level of understanding.I also think that though the author originally published the book in 1995 and later revised it 2007, a lot of what we did see in Star Trek has become a reality in some shape or form, maybe in some respect influenced innovation and invention, maybe not in the form of transporters, warp drives, time travel, holodeck and etc. but things we now have at our fingertips or had since the initial writing of this book. Chapter after chapter, the author tended to focus on the obvious though left out the things that did become a reality and or might still become possible one day though much of it won't be possible. I think the other review on \\"narrow mindness\\" is correct as well."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I saw Mr. Lawrence on youtube and liked how he articulated scientific ideas for the \\"everyman\\" so much that I decided to give this book a try.

I highly reccomend this book to anyone who has even a mild interest in physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Great overview of current physics theories using the popular cultural icon of Star Trek. If you want to brush up on what recent theoretical physics ideas are out there, this book is a good way to do that. Using examples and what ifs from the popular movie and TV series helps the explanations. Don't expect a too detailed, in-depth discussion. Think of this book as an introduction to or a brush up on such topics as partical physics, Einstein's General Relativity, and string theory."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"This is a fun and educational book. Lawrence Krauss,a physicist who loves Star Trek, offers gentle criticism of much of the physics in the show. Sound waves do not travel in space, to take one example. At the same time, he concedes some of Star Trek's supposedly far-out ideas are conceivable, if unlikely (e.g. traveling faster than the speed of light). Anyone who has even a passing interest in Star Trek and has ever wondered \\"could that really happen?\\" should read this book."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Fascinating review of how the science and technology of the fictional 24th Century of Star Trek compares to current scientific theory. From warp engines to wormholes, from teleportation to tractor beam's, Dr. Lawrence Krauss explains how these marvels might and might not(!!) work within the constraints of the universe as we understand them today. Dr. Krauss credits Star Trek's writers not only with getting much of their science right (at least in theory) but also with frequently making up terminology which is prescience in its accuracy. (Who would have thought that &quot;anyons&quot; really exist.) In addition to pointing out the most egregious of the gaffes like sound waves in space and the subtle problems of quantum theory, Dr. Krauss also enumerates the mind-boggling magnitudes of energy that warping space and beaming folks around would consume. All in all a quick, fun read, especially for the &quot;hard&quot; science fiction fan"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Some things in the 'Startrek Physics' are possible..Maybe not as denoted in the series/movies but in some fashion.Let me list items that could be considered TREK technology.1. Cellphones (though more in style/form that fact).2. Visor (the visor used in STNG) is real today.Certain kinds of blindness can see 2d B&W; with this visor.ITs been around for years.3. Pc's ... in a way the original STartrek could have had todays pc's or similar ...4. Some of our medical technology is a direct cause from the original startrek in that the major inventor of much of our medical stuff in ER is from a person who watched startrek as a kid and grewup specifically to invent as much ST stuff as he could.Yes many things in SCIFI are not possible, but much of it is in some fashion.Besides, often what is impossible today, is often possible tomorrow.Remember these comments:1. We wont need more than 5 computers in the whole world.IBM (I think).2. We will never need more than 640k (BILL Gates, confirmed).3. We might as well shutdown the office, everything that canbe invented, has been invented.

While 'Surprise' could explain how I felt to know the today's science was just practicing baby steps, 'Amaze' would not even be a strong term to describe my feeling to know how far the future science can go. Throughout the entire book, I was filled with the excitement of learning the incredible science facts that have never charmingly appealed to me. Not only as a reviewer of this book, but also as a student of the author's Physics class, I can confidently tell you that Professor Krauss is in love with Physics, and he feels so good about it.Note: You are required to have at least elementary school education in prior to read this book. :)"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I had high hopes for the book after hearing the author on the radio but I found the book to be really heavy on physics and lacking in references to Star Trek.

Must be over my head, like the book thought it would be. But I understood the thought processes of the author from start to end. (I learned something in science class after all.) Good explanation on how it should work. Too bad it won't work with todays thinking. Just wait - there will be someone to come along with a gadget like the 'Heisenberg Compensator' to make it all work the way SCI-FI saids it should work. Even if it shouldn't work because of the Laws Of Physics."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Discusses and explains a lot of intriguing concepts, and has been MUCH more educational than any science class I have taken as yet. There is a lot of explanation for people who are not familiar with the physics topics covered, like me. There are two problems though: 1) Warp drive is discussed without mention of the involvement of subspace. My impression is that warp drive could not exist without subspace. 2) Nothing about force fields, on which the holodeck relies to give its holographic objects more realism. So if you know a lot about physics already you will probably be a little bored, but if not, judging by my experience, you will find it fascinating. Just do not treat the author's explanations of Starfleet technology as necessarily the way it actually works, because this is definitely not authorized by the makers of Star Trek."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"A great little book in exploring all the possibilities of the Star Trek universe.

Well, this book helped answer a lot of those questions. You don't have to be totally familiar with the laws of physics to read this book, for the most part it's reader friendly. I do, however, recommend the reader acquaint him/herself with some of the terminology...or have a reference near-by."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Krauss has taken Physics to a new level of understanding, for the layman. His focus on Star Trek makes it more fun and relevant. Most of the points raised in this book describe similar scientific situations common to all modern science fiction stories and movies. Happily, much of Star Trek's &quot;technology&quot; isn't bunk!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I thought this was a very good book. It was a little difficult to understand, but I should have expected that, considering most of ideas I've never heard of. Anyons? Soliton waves? I had no idea. I do have an idea for the Undiscoverable Country chapter, though. I just got finished watching the Voyager episode &quot;The Gift&quot; and I noticed something at the end. Somehow, Kes propels the ship 9,500 light years in a matter of seconds. I didn't do any calculations-the show just got finished-but I'm pretty sure that that is faster than Warp 10, which the Voyager series already proved was almost impossible in a shuttlecraft, let alone a full-sized starship. That brings me to something else that Dr. Krauss can add. It isn't really a physics problem, but more of a continuity error one of my relatives informed me of. As I have already stated, Voyager has proved the impossibility of travel over Warp 10, but in more than one episode of ST:TOS and ST:TNG, ships have gone over Warp 10. I believe Dr. Krauss noted one such episode in his book, but I would just like to say that there are many more."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"One of the best books I ever read!Lawerence and Steven really did awosome in portraying the charaters and events"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"\\"The Physics of Star Trek\\" is a great book for all science enthusiasts. I have personally never seen an entire episode of Star-Trek all the way though, but I loved this book. This book is fun, while also educational. This book talks about errors the writers made in certain episodes, also it addresses issues such as: can we really hear explosions in space, The Holodeck, black holes, warp drives, phaser beams, and a wide variety of other topics.This book is a great way to learn the basics of physics. The author goes into in-depth detail on many topics related to Star-Trek. Every question you ever had about Sark-Trek Is answered in this book. Questions such as: What happens when you get beamed up, and are time loops really possible. \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\" not only addresses the possibilities of Star-Trek, but also the impossibilities. Such as can The Enterprise really travel warp 1? Lawrence Krauss does an excellent job of portraying the physics of Star-Trek.This book is by far the best non-fiction book I have ever read, and I would recommend it to every science enthusiast and every Trekker out there."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Good read.

The author is one of the best popularizers of science around. The writing is engaging, and humorous. I completely disagree with the reviewer who didn't like the writing and argued that this is for physics neophytes. Even those who are familiar with popular physics will get new insights into the exciting world of modern physics and astrophysics. And those who aren't will get a great first introduction to the wonders of the universe."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Did you know that many of the world's best physicists like to watch Star Trek, and then discuss what's right and wrong about the science displayed? Well, apparently they do.Drawing on contacts within the scientific community and on-line bulletin boards, Professor Krauss has written a sprightly review of what physicists think about when they see these shows. He translates these observations into simple concepts that the average reader should be able to follow, assuming an interest in Star Trek or science.As a non-scientist, I had always assumed that 70 percent of the &quot;science&quot; on a Star Trek show was just so much imagination. The reason I thought that was because I could see so many obvious errors (seeing phaser light in space, hearing sounds in space, effects occurring too soon on the space ship, holograms acting like they were made of matter, and permanent worm holes) based on what little I knew. Was I ever surprised to find out that these obvious errors were the bulk of all the errors in the shows!Apparently the writers have been working closely with scientifically knowledgeable people to keep what is covered reasonably possible . . . along with some poetic license.The physics of cosmology are fascinating, but I can quickly get lost in matching quantum mechanics to general relativity and so forth. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that I could follow the arguments much better when they used a familiar Star Trek episode as a reference. Like the child who learns math when it involves counting his or her own money, I can learn physics more easily when it relates to Star Trek. Very nice!The book takes a look at the common Star Trek features like warp drive, transporters, replicators, phasers, sensors, subspace communications, and tractor beams. You also get special looks at less common features like multiple universes and special forms of radiation.You can read this book from several perspectives as a result: (1) to appreciate what's happening in an episode; (2) to learn some science; (3) to think about where Star Trek could become real and where it is less likely to become so; and (4) what problems have to be solved in order for Star Trek technology to develop. I found the last perspective to be the most interesting. Professor Krauss's speculations about how rapidly technology might develop and what could be done with it were most fascinating.Where the book fell down a little was in being quite strong in stating that certain &quot;laws&quot; of physics would never be changed. If we go back in 100 year increments, we find that a lot of earlier &quot;laws&quot; are later somewhat amended if not totally changed. That may happen in the future as well, as we learn more. Professor Krauss is a little too confident in many places that there is nothing else to learn. Most modern technology would look like Star Trek science fiction to someone living in 1700, despite being based on sound scientific principles not understood then.After you finish enjoying this interesting book, think about what questions no one is trying to solve. Why not? What benefits would occur if they were solved? How could curiosity be stimulated about these questions?Ask and answer important questions in interesting ways to make faster progress!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"As both a Star Trek (old series) fan and popular science reader, I was greatly intrigued to see Lawrence Krauss' The Physics of Star Trek at my local bookstore. Often disappointed by past efforts to connect to the bandwagon of popular culture, I was delighted at how learned, clear, yet sprightly Krauss' short book was. In the first part, Krauss attempts nothing less than an explanation of Newtonian physics, general and special relativity, and other physics concepts to explain warp drives, tractor beams, wormholes, and other Star Trek staples that -- under the laws of physics as we now understand them -- are probably impossible. Subsequent chapters address and deconstruct the transporter beam, warp drive, etc. The clarity and humor of Krauss' writing is just wonderful. Perhaps the most amusing chapter is the last, in which Krauss lists his &quot;top ten&quot; Star Trek scientific bloopers -- events, plot devices, and the like that just could not occur. Because he is a trekker, Krauss does not treat these foibles with contempt or ridicule; as a scientist and writer, he ably outlines those errors."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"As I looked through my local bookstore for an interesting read, I could not help but notice this interesting title in the Physics science section. Being a sporatic viewer of Star Trek myself, I picked it up for a closer look. As I read the first section of the book, I realized that it was more than blatant critique on scientific errors. Rather, it was an interesting view of future possibilities and also impossibilities in the field of science. In this book, Krauss explores the existence of things such as wormholes, black holes, and existence of other intelligent life in space. Krauss is also relentless in his discussion of Einstein and other renowned Physicists. He often writes about highly esoteric subject matter, but on the whole this book is well rounded and a relatively interesting read. However, keep in mind that one must have an interest in science, specifically fields such as quantum mechanics and relativity."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Lawrence Krauss examines the technology of the Star Trek universe and discusses whether such technology is possible or not according to physics as we know it today. As it turns out, most of the technology is either impossible or improbable when considering the laws of physics. For example, to use warp drive or impulse drive, it would take more energy than the entire planet uses at present. Another example, which would probably be impossible, is the transporter. Krauss raises the issue of whether the transporter transmits the matter or just the information of a person. If it transmits the matter, there is the problem of scanning, storing, and transmitting the data of the location of each molecule,--a feat that would take an astronomical amount of calculating power. If it only transmits the data, then the transporter is effectively a human replicator. If that is the case, what do they do with the original body? Also it raises a lot of ethical issues as well.I really recommend this for those fans of Star Trek who are interested in finding out if the science in the Star Trek world is feasible or not. It's very easy to read and very entertaining too. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Nearly everyone on the planet has seen at least one episode of Star Trek. At the same time, nearly everyone has wondered about certain aspects of the show. For example, if their civilization is so advanced, how come no one has invented a cure for baldness? On the more technical side, certain questions pop up again and again. For example, what really happens during the process of &quot;beaming up&quot;? Why is warp 10 not attainable? How does a tractor beam work?...Like Mr. Wizard, Lawrence Krauss, who holds a Ph.D. in physics, answers all your questions - or most of them. All the major topics are covered, including a few minor ones. The text is non-technical, clear and concise, but also complete. Although it is impossible to discuss certain ideas without the use of graphs and equations, Krauss keeps them to a minimum.For each particular advanced technology of the future, the theory behind each application is dissected, explained, and examined. Also, given present day knowledge, the author examines the theoretical or practical obstacles that would have to be overcome in order to achieve this technology. In transporter technology, for example, what exactly would be involved? Would the actual atoms and molecules have to be sent, or would just the information (code) be sufficient?Would both (atoms and information) be necessary and how would such a task be accomplished, if at all?This book is highly recommended. Even if you are not a Star Trek fan, you will be interested. This book is easy to read, faithful to the physics, full of Star Trek trivia and always entertaining. Voyager and Deep Space Nine episodes are also mentioned, when relevant to the particular topic under discussion."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I never took biology or chemistry let alone physics in school, so I am easily intimidated by big words with Latin prefixes and Greek suffixes that explain the mysteries of the real world let alone the Star Trek universe. Lawrence M. Krauss, Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics and Professor of Astronomy and Chairman of the Department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University might be making stuff up the same was as Gene Roddenberry and his heirs, but he sure makes a compelling case that is easily understood even by scientific illiterates such as myself. He certainly has the credentials, even if he spells his first name funny.This book takes nitpicking about Star Trek to a whole new level, and I mean that in the best sense of the world. &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot; is divided into three sections. The first, &quot;A Cosmic Poker Game,&quot; explores the physics of inertial dampers and tractor beams as they apply to warp speed, deflector shields, wormholes and time travel (The short answer is &quot;No, but...,&quot; which is where it gets fascinating). The second, &quot;Matter Matter Everywhere,&quot; covers transporter beams, warp drives, dilithium crystals, matter-antimatter engines, and the holodeck (see above short answer). The third, &quot;The Invisible Universe, or Things That Go Bump in the Night,&quot; looks at the great unknown of the future where we may (or may not) encounter alien beings, multiple dimensions and other fun thinks from the Star Trek universe. There are nice diagrams to help the explanations along, filing in for Krauss' classroom chalkboard. Krauss also proves he is not alone in his major league nitpicking as he includes a Top Ten Physics Bloopers and Blunders from Star Trek that were selected by Noble Prize-winning physicists and other Trekkers.In his foreword Stephen Hawking points out what we have known since Jules Verne: &quot;Today's science fiction is often tomorrow's science fact.&quot; I believe it was Jim Kirk who said things were only impossible until you did them. If I had read this book when I first watched the original Star Trek in syndication it might have kindled my interest in science to a level at least appropriate for polite social conversation. I can easily imagine what reading this book might do for somewhere who loves science; opening the minds of students to the possibilities behind the television show they enjoy watching."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"...for anyone who likes both \\"Trek\\" and science. Laurence Krauss shows that it is possible to enjoy \\"Trek\\" while using it as a tool to teach some physics fundamentals (usually to the effect that \\"Trek\\" physics/technology is impossible or wildly improbable).

Actually 'Star Trek' is only used as a jumping off point to talk about physics and possible advances of physics in the future. It also presents the other side, and will give the scientific reasons that some form of Star Trek technology (such as transporters) will probably never be possible. I thought the explanation of various scientific principles (usually related to something in Star Trek) were done well without being either condenscending or obtuse. I was actually surprised that the author (apparently a Start Trek fan) found that, for the most part, the scientific concepts used in Start Trek were generally more accurate than the usual SF TV show or movie. Usually the science in these shows is pretty bad. It appears that the Star Trek technical advisors have been doing their homework. I recommend this book to those interested in science and physics and are also familiar with Star Trek. The connection between the two makes the science more palatable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I loved this book. It explained things in two hundred pages that twelve years worth of science teachers have failed at, and I'm no Trekkie. I assume it is physics in relatively simple terms, given that I could understand most of it, but I feel like a scientist now (did you know that quarks come in three colors?).

If you are a fan of Star Trek, you likely have enough of an interest in science and physics to enjoy this read. The book's concept is simple enough, that physicists, as a group, have somewhat of an obsesive-compulsive disorder over anaylyzing the scientific feasability behind the fictional events on the show. Krauss, being a physicist afflicted with Star Trek OCD, decided that writing a book on the subject might be good therapy.Regardless of whether the treatment worked for Krauss, it works for readers. The book is always entertaining, teaches a surprising amount of physics along the way and introduces the reader to some novel problem-solving approaches. Fans of Star Trek will also get an appreciation for just how large an effort the show's creators put into scientific plausibility, even if they occasionally bend the laws of physics to enhance the plot.Highly recommended for fans of physics and Star Trek."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"Given what we puny late-twentieth-century humans actually donow understand about physics, how might all this Star Trekstuff work?If something is theoretically possible, what are the(always sizable!) engineering difficulties that must beovercome before we can quickly travel between stars and beamto the surface of planets?Great book for anyone who enjoys physic and Star Trek! -- Jeff Bezos"},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it really went in depth on how or if certain technologies of Trek work or don't.

Every iteration of Star Trek from the \\"classic\\" first series up to Deep Space Nine is addressed in this very readable book. This is not a snotty ivory-tower \\"Comic Book Guy\\" treatment: the author makes very clear his respect for the series, and the fact the shows do get some things right. Dr. Kraus takes the reader from warp drives, and phasers to the transporter and cloaking devices, with some time travel thrown in. His explanations of special and general relativity are, I think, some of the best in print. (They even drove me to dig out my copy of \\"The Meaning of Relativity\\" by Einstein-which I quickly put back on the shelf realizing there was a time I actually could follow the equations...) The bottom line is while some of the technology is theoretically possible i.e. warp drives, just ain't no way Scotty's ever going to/did? Beam anybody anywhere. The material is written in such an approachable way, that this would make a great supplement text for a high-school physics or calculus class. Highly recommended-even if you're not a Star Trek fan."},{"Title":"The Physics of Star Trek","review":"I'm certainly no expert in physics. But I've always been a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and fascinated by the incredibly clever details in the ST episodes that make it a believable world. Speaking of details, this book is full of them. The author explains how and why certain things could work and others couldn't. And I was again impressed by the sheer genius and consistency of the ST writers. Sure, it's disappointing to find out that some of the processes they invented could never actually work. What surprised me was that I actually understood why!

How fast can the star ship Enterprise go? What have they learned about star systems in the galaxy? What is known about the sentient beings in the fourth quadrant? In science-fiction, we suspend our disbelief for a while to enjoy an alternate future. We know the science is not real and we hope that the underlying positive view of the future might come to pass.But instead I found myself reading a sneering criticism of the science assumed by writers of the Star Trek shows. Krauss is a predator searching for weakness in Star Trek science. He is at once feeding on the popularity of the series, and then from his position of science authority pointing out the faults in a disapproving way. In Chapter 10 he says,\\"Any sensible trekker-physicist recognizes that Star Trek must be taken with a rather large grain of salt. Nevertheless, there are times when ... writers cross the boundaries from the merely vague or implausible to the utterly impossible. While finding even obscure technical flaws is a universal pastime, it is not the subtle errors that physicists seem to relish catching. It is the really big ones that are most talked about...\\"Finding flaws is not the universal pastime of Star Trek fans. We can fly faster than light. We can watch a star born. We can imagine not worrying about money and having a library of all human knowledge available.Krauss goes on to say, \\"Star Trek science mistakes validate the perception of many physicists that physics is far removed from popular culture -- not to mention the superior feeling it gives us ...\\"He is right in the notion that his physics is far removed from popular culture. Physicists like him miss the point. It is not the technical details but the human story that is important.

I was interested to know how some of the technology that was invented for the show might be practically applied, or how it could work in the real world.But the Author goes about destructing the technology and \\"physics\\" of star trek and telling us that \\"it wont work because...\\". That might be a better title for this book \\"Star Trek technology wont work because...\\"OK, so we all know that star trek is fiction - It is not real. If you think its real your in a bit of trouble. But it is nice to once and a while escape into a world of make believe and fantasy.This book goes about systematically disproving and destructing the technology and \\"physics\\" of star trek, umm ... we know its not real ok? For example, there is a section on Warp Drive. The author spends (too much) time setting the scene of a ship in orbit and the captain tells the ensign to set a course and go to warp. He then goes about explaining that if the ship went to warp everybody would be turned to moosh against the back wall. Then goes about explaining why warp drive is not possible because you cant handle the G-forces. Wow! What an insight. Star Trek will probably tell you that there is other technology helping prevent this ... like inertial dampers perhaps, and the main deflector \`deflecting' space dust?This is all beside the point when you consider that Warp Drive is theoretical at this stage only, and it was made for TV. It is like a University in USA that performed wind tunnel test to see how the Enterprise would handle space flight. Then witting a report explaining that the design of the ship is totally wrong and it would break apart. How stupid can you get, why would you bother going out of your way to disprove a fictional technology.I would have preferred this book to acknowledge that the technology in star trek is not possible in its current form, but would it not be wonderful if we could transport from one place to another in a blink of an eye, and this is how it might work?If you are considering this book as part of your star trek collection, better look elsewhere.Anoth reviewers wrote the following that I think are importaint points also...Mr. Krauss does a great job of explaining why Star Trek technology is impossible in the real world.

Many parts are clich&eacute;d, the only crime in this being that the clich&eacute;s do not even seem to connect with the writer on the level suggested, let alone a reader. I thought Kahn used too many words; conveyed an expectation of the reader to devour and accept rather than to read.

Today, investment banks' primary mode of self-defense is to argue that capitalism needs them. Brandeis argues vigorously to the contrary, and it's not at all hard to carry his arguments from the nineteen-teens directly to now.When we tip our hat to bankers, we typically honor their role as intermediaries: they direct money from depositors to valuable investment opportunities. Most depositors cannot be expected to evaluate the claims of businessmen, so bankers function as a vehicle for judging risk and establishing reputations. Hence the now-famous dialogue between J.P. Morgan and Samuel Untermyer:'Untermyer: \\"Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?\\"Morgan: \\"No sir. The first thing is character.\\"Untermyer: \\"Before money or property?\\"Morgan: \\"Before money or property or anything else. Money cannot buy it...because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom.\\"'You will presumably find few people today who view bankers as this sort of lantern-jaw-held-steady, coldly-responsible &uuml;bermenschen.On the other side of the risk-judging coin, bankers are supposed to finance the little guy. The entrepreneur just starting out who needs a few dollars at the right moment -- this man is capitalism's hero, and he's the one to whom bankers are supposed to direct money. As the entrepreneurs' hero, the banker is supposed to be our hero as well.Think again, says Brandeis; bankers only give money to enterprises which have proven that they hold no risk whatsoever. In an absolutely devastating chapter entitled \\"Big Men And Little Business\\" (search ahead in that link for \\"Chapter VII\\"), Brandeis gives example upon example of how America's rise to industrial might owed nothing to the bankers. In fact, J.P. Morgan's main job was to combine pre-existing businesses -- on which inventors had toiled thanklessly for years -- into monopolies (the famous \\"trusts\\"). It was news to me that the House of Morgan was responsible for the behemoth known as General Electric. And I was floored by Brandeis's description of Morgan's role in forming AT&T;, the short version of which is that entrepreneurs nearly bankrupted themselves to fund Alexander Graham Bell, Western Union tried very hard to kill the new technology, and Morgan only came along decades later after the phone's fate was secure.So we don't need \\"the great banks\\" to keep capitalism churning. It gets worse, says Brandeis: the \\"great banks,\\" in their mania to form monopolies, destroy businesses along the way. A lot of Brandeis's anger in Other People's Money comes from his fight against the Morgan acquisition of the New Haven railroad, which larded the New Haven up with debt that it couldn't support, and eventually led to its collapse -- reminiscent, today's reader will note, of the 1980s' leveraged-buyout craze. \\"Was there ever a more be-bankered railroad than the New Haven?\\" asks Brandeis, along the way probably using \\"be-bankered\\" for the only time in the history of the English language.The banks' failure might not be quite so offensive, were they not doing all their work with \\"other people's money.\\" The banks' main chore is to take $1 from depositors and turn it, through loans, into whatever the government allows them to turn it into -- $10, say. The people have granted banks that right under the expectation that they'll guard those deposits carefully. The banks have manifestly failed to do so. Brandeis's disgust is palpable on every page.The solution, he says, is to sidestep the banks altogether. Form depositor-owned co-ops. If the railroads want to raise money, they don't need banks; they have (or had, at least) thousands of stations from which they can solicit capital from their riders. We've been deceived into thinking that we need banks, when what we need is capital to fuel innovation.Other People's Money is a devastating book, written with eloquence, force, and passion. This befits Brandeis, the future Supreme Court justice and one of history's greatest Americans. As it turns out, he wrote a book that applies just as well in the early 21st century as it did in the early 20th.Perhaps the best part, for my busy readers, is that Other People's Money is only 100 pages long. You can polish it off in one sitting. I suspect you'll be as floored as I was by how effortlessly Brandeis's arguments carry over to today."},{"Title":"Other peoples money, and how the bankers use it","review":"I have been reading dozens of books within the past 2 years on investing and the stock market / US business history. I read this book after Galbraith's The Great Crash 1929 [really excellent!] and am currently reading Josephson's The Robber Barons [also excellent]. All three of these books are over 50 years old, and can seem dated in their prose style [not a problem for me - maybe since I am also over 50], but the material is very fresh and timely, if a bit depressing. The rigging of our financial system to fleece the many in favor of the few did not start in the dot.com era or with the junk bond kings.I highly recommend the edition of Other People's Money edited by Urofsky because his introduction adds a great deal to this slim volume which began life as a series of even shorter magazine articles.Overall, Distressingly familiar [even many of the names have not changed after 100 years]!"},{"Title":"Other peoples money, and how the bankers use it","review":"That this book was written nearly 100 years ago makes it somewhat harder to read due to style and useage differences. However, this is a small caveat. What I found rather unnerving was how much of what Justice Brandeis said then about a different crisis, sounded like it could have been written about our current financial crisis.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the financial history of the country. And to anyone who enjoys an excercise in \\"the more things change...\\"."},{"Title":"Other peoples money, and how the bankers use it","review":"Like almost all older books, the best thing about this book is that its written from a &#34;close to the ground&#34; perspective. That is, Brandeis WASN'T writing a book researched after the event. This was BEFORE Wilson's &#34;New Freedoms&#34; legislation passed, much less Glass-Steagall. I think it makes for excellent reading regardless of your political affiliation because whether you side with Brandeis or JP Morgan, Brandeis WAS probably the greatest intellect on his side of the debate. This is a short book, that will teach the reader a lot about how the US Economy worked in the late 19th and early 20th century. Also, don't be put off by the Title, which sounds (to me at least) like the words of a demagogue. Whether all of Brandeis's contentions were always accurate or even fair I have to leave the reader to decide for themselves because honestly my knowledge of the US economy at the time the book was written is pretty limited, but I can definitively say he does appear to make an honest and fairly close-reasoned case for his positions. Bottom line, this is a wonderful read for anyone interested in the world of finance 100 years past."},{"Title":"Other peoples money, and how the bankers use it","review":"If you want to understand how the bankers have consolidated power over the nation's largest corporations and have then used their power to gain control over the levers of the nations power and wealth, then this is a MUST READ book.

It has been some time since I read a book this up to date, this exciting, this accessible on the subject of entering the Japanese market in the English language. The main shortcomig of the book is its misleading title: the book is really about the changes in the Japanese market due to the changing consumer demographics and attitudes, regulatory restructuring, and the ongoing revolution in distribution systems; about the recent experiences of US entrants (1994-98) into the market; and the reasons why some succeeded while others failed. The books makes three exellent points: that the Japanese market place is changing dramatically; that foreign companies with the commitment and the resources to enter the market directly can and do make lots of money in Japan almost immediately; and that Japan offers much better profit and growh prospects to American companies than the ephemeral but fashionable emerging markets of SE Asia. The book presents issues of doing business in Japan from the point of view of large, determined, well capitalized companies entering the market through their own directly owned subsidiaries and makes the point that this may be the only fool-proof method to do well in that market.

While there have been equally brilliant eras in the history of the world, few have surpassed the achievements of reign of Augustus Caesar. Augustus managed to bring about a period stability to the Roman world after the collapse of the Roman republic. As commentators, such as Kenneth Clark, have observed, this stability is apparently necessary for any particular dynamic creative era to come into being. By ending the eternal fights between ambitious aristocrats, Augustus can claim not only political success, but also social and cultural success as well.Like most successful leaders, Augustus was able to achieve political success by convincing most of the Roman polity that he was restoring institutions of the past. In reality what he had restored monarchical government, a system as odious to the Romans as it would be to 21st century Americans. One of the great moments of early Roman history as described by Livy was the exile of the Tarquin kings and the establishment of a republic. While the Romans wallowed in the civic virtues of \\"republican government\\" modern societies would not recognize it as anything of the sort. It was, and remained, an oligarchy in which the aristocratic element managed to fool the lower orders into believing they had more of a role to play in the government than they did. Voting was done by assemblies of Roman citizens and carried out by tribes. The older and more established the tribe, regardless of the numbers in them, got to vote first. The head count, the last and largest of the tribes in terms of numbers of members, voted last if it voted at all under Roman rules. The only time ordinary people had a voice in the political life was when it rioted.What Augustus did was to revitalize tradition institutions, like the senate, to restore temples and religious practices that had fallen into obscurity, as well as bringing former anti-Caesarians into the government. He was the restorer of the past and the promoter of stability. All the while he ruled while observing the forms of the republic while inventing the imperial tradition. It is noteworthy that the members of the old senate class who wrote the histories that dismissed most of the emperors as tyrants, generally portray Augustus in positive terms.The book is very strong on a number of points. First and foremost are the ways in which the various classes interacted with each other, these were the aristocratic class, the knights, ordinary people (to include former slaves) and slaves themselves. The economic dynamic is also examined, urban land speculation and money lending were the basis of more than a few fortunes during the Augustine age.The Augustine age was also a highly cultured one. The theater had reached its pinnacle during the second century BC with the comedies of Plautus, but Virgil, Horace and Ovid were very much a part of the scene. Augustus knew each of them. Virgil was very much a respected figure and Horace a friend. Ovid was banished because of his involvement with the sexual intrigues of Julia, the daughter of Augustus. Augustus was a great builder who supposedly found Rome a city of brick and left it one of marble.This is an excellent history and well worth reading if one wishes to see why the Augustan age is so fondly recalled to this day."},{"Title":"Rome in the Augustan Age (The Centers of civilization series)","review":"After you have read a dozen or so Roman historical novels, I strongly urge you to invest in this book. Not quite a textbook, but definitely not a novel, Rome In The Augustan Age was written for the Rome enthusiast. First published over 20 years ago, \\"Rome\\" walks the reader step-by-step through historical artifacts, written and architectural, to explain the ancient society at the end of the Republican era...and beyond. Gladitorial games, religion, culture, and government all are seen through an intellectual magnifying glass. As near as I can tell the author bases all his conclusions on actual historical evidence. The reason I am so positive about this book is that it clarifies much of what I am reading in the historical fiction I am so very fond of studying.The chapter on Religion, Morals, and Ideas is worth the price alone.

Reviewing his contribution to Canadian wilderness literature, Arctic Magazine in March 1991 said that, \\"While his writing skills earned him a wide and appreciative audience, he was more than a skilled wordsmith. He was also careful and sympathetic observer, and intrepid explorer and a meticulous historian.\\" Many of Patterson's works are autobiographical accounts of his explorations in Canada's British Columbia and the Northwest Territories set in a fabric of historical, geological, anthropoligical, and botanical insights. I discovered this works by accident: planning for an expedition to the Thutade Lake region of central British Columbia, my Internet searches led me to Patterson. it was a wonderful discovery.Patterson was born in 1898 in Darlington, England. His father served in the Boer War and spent most of his life in Africa. His interaction with Raymond was episodic, though influential. In April 1917, straight out of secondary school, Patterson went into England's wartime army as an artillery cadet. Early in his military career, on March 21, 1918, Patterson was captured. He spent the next eight months as a prisoner of war until armistice in November 1918. Returning to England, he entered St. John's College at Oxford as a modern history major. There was plenty of time for extracirricular adventure, which he pursued vigorously. With the aid of an exceptional short-term memory, he passed his final exams in a heroic, last-minute effort.From university, he went to the Bank of England, a likely course for a promising young professional. Yet the cosmopolitan life was an ill fit. Among the Bank's austere columns, he learned of his father's death in Africa. Patterson wrote in another of his books, Buffalo Head, \\"With the going of that man I came up to the surface again and took a look at the workaday world of London. And by God, my father was right! It was grey and it was a desert of stone! [London] was a swarming city like a nightmare by H.G. Wells. It was a vast human ant heap through which the inmates scurried with set, expressionless faces, tied to some fixed routine.\\" He siezed the reins and set course for North America where there was still wildness. At the age of 26, he pounded his tent pegs into Western Canada, where he remained for the rest of his life, making his way variously as a rancher, explorer, and writer.He was a peripatetic explorer whose meanderings served up fodder for several books. Patterson twice canoed down the treacherous Nahanni River and wrote the best-known of his five books, The Dangerous River. In 1949, eager to understand the early history of exploration up the Rocky Mountain Trench, Patterson explored the Parsnip, Finlay and Peace Rivers in a 17-foot canoe. This trip served as the basis for Finlay's River, published in 1968. The book was the first to deal with the Finley River from its mouth at the Peace River to its source, Thutade Lake. As Patterson describes his motivations, \\"my first trip to the Finley was purely to see, and I remember it is a happy summer and one that led, later on, to some very interesting to store the work.\\" During the exploration and the subsequent research, Patterson came to know some of the men who had traveled, explored, and mapped much of the remote country along its trace. He did so at the end of an era. Though the earliest explorers were dead, those who surveyed this country were aging but alive. Patterson made it his business to speak with these early surveyors, and consequence is grand: a number of early photographic plates and recalled narration make their way into the text.For historical context, Pattison summarizes the expeditions of the Finley River from the 1700s to those of the early 20th century. During this broad sweep of roughly 150 years, most of the technology available to these explorers was rudimentary and unchanging. Heavily laden canoes, axes, dry goods, and other stores and sundries were packed on their backs and in their canoes up the hundreds of miles of rough, roadless wilderness. There were no maps, satellite and cell phones, GPS data, outboard motors. Nor, of course, was a ready supply of emergency aid or material assistance available. Such circumstances are almost wholly alien to modern explorers. Patterson wrote at the nexus of two eras and the contrast is dramatic.Patterson describes the early explorations of the great North Westers Alexander MacKenzie, James Finlay, and Simon Fraser. These were the vanguard, exploring this country in 1793, 1797, and 1808, respectively. Each intended to open the country for trapping and trade. Each reached the Pacific Ocean - MacKenzie in one terrific journey in just one year, Finlay in an obscure journey over the Ingenika River, and Fraser in one of the greatest feats of canoe travel all time. Each failed in their ambition, for none found a practical trade route to the sea. Patterson describes their various journeys with the precision and eloquence that impart the soaring ambition that brought them to this beautiful country and the brutal toll it extracted. In the bargain, Patterson also recounts in detail the journeys of Samuel Black, the early trapper who made a first full expedition to the Finlay's source on Thutade Lake and others who followed Black in the late 1800s.Here Patterson introduces us to a cast of extraordinary modern characters. There was Captain W.F. Butler who took leave from the British army in 1870 to make an epic winter journey from the Red River to the Rockies and back, passing the fur trading forts of the Saskatchewan and compiling a report on the condition of the Indians in that vast territory. Along the way he he became a hardened winter traveler, journeying on foot and on horseback, by Red River cart and dog sled, with every hazard of northern travel successfully overcome. He subsequently made a trip up the Finlay and then ascended the Omenica River, passing beyond Patterson's narrative.We also meet Alfred Selwyn who in the 1880s explored this country on behalf of the Canadian director of the geological survey, laying the groundwork for the great gold rush that followed. Patterson also gives this extraordinary detail on the journeys of Canadian surveyors Fleet Robinson and Frank Swannell. These two men were among the first pioneers to take the measure of this country. Both were extraordinary men. their narratives, published reports, and photographic records remain. Some of these are included in Finaly's River.This history is wonderful and welcome. But the book also shines as a travel narrative of Patterson's own journey up the Finlay. He has a practiced eye (as we would expect from an artilleryman) and a splendid pen (as we would expect from an Oxford history major). The book's descriptions of the wild rivers, challenging canoe portages, the difficulties of surviving the territory are alone worthy of the read. Patterson is a strong believer in communicating the practical arts as well: he allows descriptions of his own fieldcraft and that of the old river hands he encounters along his way. This provides a snapshot into a bygone era, revealing insights for wilderness travelers that are unavailable in contemporary writing.Among these merits, Finaly's River is also a book of historical significance. Patterson's work here he is among other things an anthology of personal and historical information about a region that was drastically altered and flooded by the Peace River Project. This Canadian reclamation effort of the 1960s dammed the Peace River and transformed the Rocky Mountain Trench and the vast country described in this book into a windswept reservoir, Williston Lake. Today, the old traces are gone: the river loads, the trapping trails, the cabins, and the remote outposts along these wild rivers are now submerged and exists only in books like Patterson's.I loved Finlay's River and have since bought Patterson's other books and an anthology of his shorter works. David Finch recently produced a biography, R.M. Patterson: A Life of Great Adventure, which has received good reviews."},{"Title":"Finlay's River (Laurentian Library 41)","review":"Both my Husband and his friend that we sent the book to for his birthday have loved this book and talking to each other about the book."},{"Title":"Linux Bible","review":"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!

The different chapters (with the exception of Part 3) are all designed to teach you the basics of Linux apart from any flavor. This allows you to learn core skills that can transfer between whatever distribution you might be using at any given time. Part 3 gives a short coverage of each major distribution available on the market. If you're wondering about the pros and cons of each, this section of the book will help you decide where you want to start your specific distribution-specific learning.Like all Bible titles, this is pretty big (800+ pages). While there's a lot of useful information, I don't know that I'd recommend this to be your *only* Linux book. 200+ pages deal with the distribution information, which leaves considerably less room for core Linux information. The other chapters cover the gamut of Linux software (server, desktop, productivity, internet, games, etc.), so there's not a lot in in-depth coverage on any one particular area. I'd probably position this as a very good entry level book to teach the reader about Linux and help them decide what distribution to pick.

If it does, you can reboot and install Red Hat's Fedora Linux from the same DVD. If you only have a CD drive, the book also includes a CD with a small, bootable Linux and a Debian Linux installer.

It also introduces how to set up Web, mail, print, and file servers.Any introductory Linux book you buy should have a good tutorial on the shell and at least an overview of major administration tools (such as YaST and system-config tools).

Its design, based on Unix (a multi-user, multi-task operating system), was from its start multi-tasking and multi-user. Windows was built on DOS, a single user, single-tasking operating system, which was evolved slightly from the CP/M operating system created by the small company Digital Research. Windows began as a paste-up on DOS. (Digital Research had a GUI operating system before Windows, on which using Ventura Publisher, I wrote two illustrated engineering textbooks. Linux has, by now, almost too many variations. That is to be expected, since in the open software movement anyone can attempt to build a better mousetrap on the shoulders of those who have gone before.

What's more, some of them can be run on your Windows PC directly from the optical drive without ever writing to your hard disk. Although program fetching is a bit slower thanwhen from a hard disk, since your memory is used to store data, operation is still quick.The major alternative to using \\"the Bible\\" to explore using Linux is to download gigbytes of system loads and write them to your own CD or DVD. In that case you also must go back to the 'net for help that you can locate more quickly in the pages of \\"the Bible\\".

Each time, something I really needed was not easily available, for example connection to the Internet. In this case, using a PC that was hard-wired to my router, connection to the Internet was automatic. Linux has come a long way, thanks to thousands of volunteers. This time I will join the bandwagon. It doesn't mean I will stop using Windows, but I plan to use Linux for most web activity. Since I already used Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird under Windows, and use Open Office in Windows for text, spreadsheets and other office tasks, I plan to move everything I can to Linux while still retaining current Windows."},{"Title":"Linux Bible","review":"This review originally appeared in the AZTCS journal.There are things I don't like about this book.In Chapter 3, I'm disappointed there isn't more detail about alternate window managers. I think too many people feel KDE and GNOME are the only choices available ... or the desktop is Linux ... or don't know they can start with a blank xwindow and make their own desktop and menus.The book should include more about shell scripting, not so much to teach it as to give an idea of the power available. I feel slighted he didn't mention Emacs in the text editor section; honestly I think this is a tremendous oversight on his part as Emacs is a popular and powerful text editor.Another thing I didn't like was with the CD/DVD set. A lot of older computers don't have DVD readers making installation of the distros on DVD more difficult.There are several things I like about the book. I think it gives an objective view of Linux. The author introduces and quickly acquaints the reader with the command-line. Many authors seem to feel the command line should be avoided, but Negus plunges in and makes the use of the command-line, if not easy, at least not scary. The command-line is a part of Linux. He is not afraid to expose his readers to the terminal and to its use.The CD/DVD collection contains an excellent range of distros ... from a distro that will run from a floppy (I recently used a floppy distro to fix a forgotten password in XP) to some desktops that are a little cramped on a PIII with 512 MB memory. Negus shows, although there are some specialized distributions, most have the tools and versitiliy to handle any task. If you want to surf the web and check your email and chat on-line, build a full webhost, add a firewall to your home network, recover files from a crashed Windows system or are looking for something VERY interesting to do with your computer, Linux probably has something for you.His instructions are generally clear and concise. Where necessary, Negus gives step-by-step examples. He explains but, to me, manages to balance between overinforming to the point of boredom and talking down to the audience.

You are rarely explained the basic structure of the commands you are about to use. For all practical purposes the author prints the line-or lines-to be inputed in the shell and the reader is expected to be happy just because... well it has worked, as if by magic. But this is by all means not a proper way to learn, at least for me. I have to undersand exactlly what each sintax in that line means, and the author does a very poor job at explaining this. Yes, if you just want to have some help installing linux this may be the book for you. What seems to be extremelly problematic is that the author does not mention-at least not in a way to be easily found-how to install new programms (packages) and how to access them.

He's written widely on the subject and I've learned from everything of his that I have read. He does push the envelope on occasion, though, and this is one of those times.Negus tries to cover the essentials and differences between 18 Linux distributions. First of all, the differences aren't all that great. Second, there is only so much you can do in 816 pages, especially when you attempt to cram directions for using Linux for gaming, multimedia, word processing, using the shell, programming Linux and so on.It's just too much to accomplish well.But that doesn't mean this edition of Linux Bible isn't worth buying.Beginning users may find the fairly detailed instructions on using certain aspects of Linux to be helpful. Please note that I specify beginning users - there really isn't much here for anyone beyond the beginner stage.Negus' writing is, as always, crisp and clear. The book is well organized and, blessedly, Wiley did not use its idiotic gray ink schema. (Wiley has taken to printing some books with ink in about 80% gray which renders them essentially unreadable for more than a few minutes at a time.)The idea here had some merit: provide a birds-eye view of 18 Linux distributions. But it is an idea that works better in theory than in practice.Anyone beyond rank beginner status will be served better by many of the numerous distribution or language specific books on the market.Jerry"},{"Title":"Linux Bible","review":"This book is not Linux bible in any way.

I was attracted to it as it appeared to be inclusive and got it on \\"final\\" sale of closing Borders store. In fact, it is a loose collection of unrelated articles all are very superficial. Linux is a practical subject, it requires not merely knowledge but developing skills and this \\"bible\\" is almost useless for this. I orderedFedora 14 Linux, 4-disks DVD Installation and Reference Set, Ed.2011and its included library of free books is much better. The Linux that comes with this bible is disparately outdated, incomplete and failed to install. In short, this \\"bible\\" is total bust.

I wanted a good overview of what was available, and the opportunity to play with different versions before I selected one for my class use. I have been wanting to break free of the Microsoft system and monopoly on the operating system within the United States, and explore other options for years. Unfortunately, until the last decade, that has been difficult at best. Now, however, with the Open Source Projects, and GNU Licensing programs, and, most importantly, the porting and developing of comparable software to the LINUX OS, it is now possible to see what is outside in the real world.LINUX is available for both the Intel x86 and AMD CPU chipsets. I have tested installations on both CPU's now. Almost all major software publishers now publish for LINUX. This includes Adobe (Acrobat and Reader, and plugins, Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, OpenOffice, Corel Wordperfect Suite, and more).So, IF you have an interest or just have a curiousity in alternative operating systems to Microsoft Windows, the Bible series for LINUX is a good introduction. The text includes a DVD and a CD that have 'LIVE' bootable distributions or versions of 18 different flavors of LINUX. Besides giving you a general overview of LINUX features, you, also, get a general overview of the more popular flavors of LINUX. The real grabber for this book, IMHO, is that you can try different distributions without installing onto the harddrive. You will find some versions to be easy to work with and are graphical user interface (GUI) based like MS Windows, and others are more complicated using a Command-Line-Interface much like the old DOS before Windows.Should you decide you want to install, you have several options:1) Replace your existing operating system2) Use a multi-boot system3) Install as a Virtual Machine4) Install to an external drive (My personal choice for testing and playing.)I feel quite comfortable recommending this book and the Bible series in general for computer information. I hope this helps you to decide which book to purchase for your personal interest.MJR"},{"Title":"Linux Bible","review":"nice book for the beginner, I can get information all variant of Linux & choose which better for me, CD&DVD contains complete distro as live or boot CD"},{"Title":"Linux Bible","review":"I taught from Negus's Fedora Core 3 book for several semesters at the local Community College.

It really comes down to Individual Preference; If you prefer Paladin as a figure of mystery, then disregard the name...If you want more background on the character, this book supplies it.)There are three novels featuring Paladin...One is a Whitman book, intended for chidren...another a terribly-inaccurate historical effort that fails in many key details established about Paladin...Then there is \\"A Man Called Paladin\\"; entertaining and quite true to the character as depicted in the series.Enjoy !"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I joyfully read Jan Karon's Mitford series to learn more about Mitfordians, as they feel like real neighbors and friends. It's apparent this book was produced at the behest of someone other than the author herself. Normally, she fills her books with thoughtful and apt turns of phrase, showing us the highs and lows of various lives, coloring and shading with rich dialects. While this book has the characters we've come to know, it rings hollow. It's a shame, too, because I felt a real let down while reading the book.

One might assume that a writer would only do so if there had been something left unsaid. Not in this case. Karon rehashes many of the same scenes from the previous books, and adds nothing to the scene but longer descriptions of hair and flowers. Familiar faces and situations are tossed in with a gratuitous air. Okay, reader, here's your reminder about the famed marmalade cake. Father Tim's diabetes. Cynthia's books. Dooley's voice.Sales of A Simple Song will tell the publisher that this was a fabulous strategy. Readers will realize that Karon's days in advertising and manupulating markets have surfaced.

We came to care about Dooley, Father Tim and Cynthia, and even Barnabas, the dog. Jan Karon's new book, A Common Life: the Wedding Story, is a poor excuse for a book. It serves up cardboard characters, very little plot, and a rehash of what we've already read in the previous books. It even calls into question Cynthia's sanity. In previous books, she was portrayed as endearingly unique, but in this book she doesn't even take the time to comb her hair before her wedding. Does that sound like normal female behavior? While this book measures the same size as its predecessors, the actual printed page is much smaller, easily read in one sitting. It makes one wonder how they dare ask ... for such a sparse volume.

There is so much border art, it is obviously intended to take up space &amp; make the book look longer. Jan Karon has a very faithful following for the Mitford series. I am disappointed that Ms. Karon thinks so little of her readers, that she would trick them into buying this."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was disappointed that this book was not longer! I wanted it to keep going. It does answer questions that aren't answered in the other books. Next book please!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Having read all the previous books of the Mitford series, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the latest installment. When I learned it was to be a prequel telling the story of the wedding, I became a bit concerned. After reading The Wedding Story, I must say that I consider my concern justified. I found the book boring, disappointing, and frustrating. There was no new information, no mystery, no conflict. It was obviously written quickly and did not require much creativity. I can only conclude that Ms. Karon wrote it to capitalize on the previous success of the series -- this is, to make money and to appease fans who were tired of waiting for the next installment. I, for one, am far from appeased. This book did nothing to further the Mitford series or, in my opinion, Ms. Karon's reputation."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"As a long-time fan of Karon, I must say I was greatly dissapointed in A Common Life and embarrassed that I purchased it before reading everyone's reviews here. I would have certainly checked it out at the library and been equally dissapointed but $... dollars richer.I feel cheated as a reader and a fan because it seems as though Karon took advantage of her fan base. This magazine-length story is marketed to &quot;appear&quot; like all her other books, while a quick flick through the pages indicates larger fonts and hyper-margined text pages. While I might have forgiven her for what could have been a publishing decision, Karon obviously left her writing talent elsewhere while penning this story. As other reviewers stated so well, there was nothing new to add with this addition, and even what there was wasn't written very well. I kept asking myself, &quot;why bother?&quot;Well, I've learned a good lesson from this purchase, and I have lost some respect for the author. I'll give her another chance, but not on my dime!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Jan Karon did a wonderful job of tying this novella into her series of Mitford books. I loved reading about how romance had found its way into the lives of so many of the other characters, as they recollected their own loves and romances. I also believe that the main characters of Father Tim and Cynthia were developed even further, as Jan Karon gave us a glimpse of their deepest fears and hesitations even as they celebrated and anticipated their wedding day. I started crying around about page 67 and didn't really stop until the end, and the reading of it only took a couple of hours. This book was never touted as a continuation of the series, but rather a novella and an additional joyous piece of Mitford. I'm looking forward to the cookbook!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was anticipating the arrival of book six...what a disappointment. First, take note that it does not pick up the story where we left of in the fifth book...it is confusing to stick this book in the middle of the series and make the reader go back in time. Could the font get any larger without being &quot;large print&quot;...huge margins = Karon didn't have time to write a full novel, but she wanted the money from one. Writing was ok, but clearly not as good as the past books. Disappointing...wait for the paperback if you buy it at all."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This was a charming and delightful keepsake book!! Beautifully presented!! We all love Mitford and Jan Karon, and yes, we always want more---But, for those who are disappointed it was not longer and decided to be disparaging and trash the book because of its length and lack of chronology, I would like to make some points:This book was always promoted as a novella, for well over a year.Complaints that it is out of order, are to my reasoning, completely out of order themselves--I would much rather read this moving story out of order than not have the opportunity to read it at all. Those are our only choices, folks!!Future readers may of course read this between A Light in the Window and These High Green Hills. We can too, upon re-reading the series.I am delighted that Miss Karon has filled us in on this central, integral part of the Mitford saga. I especially liked the insight into each individual's personal trepidations/joys about love in his/her life, as well as the opinions of Tim and Cynthia's upcoming nuptials.Having read the series two times, I can say, this was not a rehashing of the previous stories. Miss Karon beautifully rounded out the characters we loved. We got a glimpse of their hearts in a way we never had before.Most importantly, she gave us exactly what we asked for, and exactly what she promised--&quot;The Wedding Story&quot;. If one buys a book with that subtitle, please don't be surprised that is exactly what it is about.On a practical matter, it could not have been a continuation chronologically of the story unless Father Tim and Cynthia got married again. Now, we really wouldn't like that, would we?The format is beautifully done. I don't mind wide margins. Some of my favorite keepsake books and poetry and Christmas tomes all have wide margins.The fact is, there are exactly as many words as she wrote. If they were all scrunched into a small little cheap edition, people would also complain about that. A story about something so special deserves special treatment, which it got.It is of uniform size with the other harbacks, which is lovely for the bookshelf. The publishers have struck a good compromise. The story is the story, no matter how many pages they put it on.Most descriptions on line give the number of pages of a book, so maybe check that out, if you are unsure.I am disappointed that so many people are disappointed in such a negative way--Why don't you give it another chance, and review it for what it IS, not for what it ISN'T.No one forced people to buy this book. There were ample ways to find out about content before purchase.If you are unsure, there is always the library.For the future--there are two books coming out this fall--A book of Father Tim's quotations and a little stocking stuffer about the Snowmen of Mitford.There have been numerous comments on this site that indicate people are already grousing that if those don't continue the story line, they are going to be upset.Sorry, get real!!! If it says it is a book of quotes, by George, it probably will be. Stocking stuffers about snowmen are probably not going to be in the league of War and Peace. Please inform yourself before purchase, but don't malign Miss Karon because she delivers exactly what was advertised. It just isn't fair!Many authors write in several different genres. Please be gracious enough to allow Miss Karon to do the same. It is her gift to do with as she desires. You are not required to buy her books. As in life, pick and choose what you like.My closing comment is really a question: For those who feel so negatively about this book, would you REALLY rather have not had the opportunity to read about the wedding?I was delighted and bought an extra copy as a gift--a gift of love. That is what this sweet little book is. I encourage others to give this special little treasure another look.Anita in Maryland"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I bought this book yesterday, just hours after its release and read it in one sitting last night. I have absolutely loved every other installment in this series but I must say that this one is a disappointment. First, it's shorter than what I would have liked. Second, the margins on the pages are wide so it really is shorter than the number of pages would indicate. Finally, I was disappointed in the story itself - for no particular reason, it just wasn't the same. Perhaps I had built myself up too much in anticipation but I hope the next book in the series will continue where the storyline previously left off and again be the series that I dearly love."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book was a little piece of magic in an otherwise crazy work week for me! Jan Karon promised she would write about Father Tim and Cynthia's wedding and told us it would be a novella. This is what her fans asked her to do!! As for the margins and the type and the cover and all that other stuff--this is a love story about a wedding and must be properly packaged, don't you think??? This would make a wonderful wedding gift--the stories of our favorite Mitford character falling in love!! What better gift to give than the stories of love from our favorite town??!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"As enthusiastic fans of the Mitford books and newlyweds ourselves, my husband and I loved this delightful addition to the series. Jan Karon tells the wedding story with all the charm and delight she has threaded into her previous stories about the Mitford community, and we were delighted with this chance to &quot;attend&quot; the wedding we missed between two of the earlier volumes. We read this one aloud during our daily commute to work, and the book never failed to start and end our workday with laughter. As a native of a small Western North Carolina town much like Mitford, I can also attest to the authenticity of the dialect and the characters. Although this shorter story left us hungry for still more Mitford, we welcome the addition and eagerly look forward to the next volume! I highly recommend this book to other Mitford fans."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Of course I loved this book....it is about Mitford, by Jan Karon. Any Mitford fan would! B-u-t, it left me wanting.......to know more about the wonderful people of Mitford; what's been happening in their lives since the last book. This was a very nice book, but out of order.......an appetizer.....when we Mitford fans want so much more! Please, hurry and get the &quot;full&quot; novel finished, so we can once again revisit the town of Mitford. P.S. The picture of Jan Karon on the back cover was almost startling to me! That is almost exactly how I pictured Cynthia to look, in my imagination!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Though the book claims to be in the 180 page range, it's really much less with its HUGE margins and blank pages separating the chapters. It skips around A LOT -- doesn't cover the whole summer that they're engaged and says NOTHING of the actual reception. Which could have been such a pleasure to read! The only good part of the book is the deeper look into Cynthia that you get. If you're a diehard Mitford fan, you're going to buy it no matter what. Just DON'T expect Karon to keep up her track record. And it seems it'll be quite some time until we get another Mitford like we expect -- in the spirit of J.K. Rowling, Karon will be publishing two mini books this coming Fall which will only take away from the next full size Mitford novel."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"The day this book came out I was at the store when they opened. The only hardback books I own are the books in the Mitford Seris. I left the store holding my book like a treasure. Each and every one of my Mitford Books are like treasures to me. I was gravely disappointed in &quot;A Commom Life.&quot; The richness of Jan's characterizations were missing. The story did not have the depth of her first five books. When I began reading this series I made a quote book noting pages that had beautiful passages that I wanted to make reference to later. These books, and their beautiful passages have helped me through some rough times. In reading &quot; A Common Life&quot; I only found 3 passages to add to my book. I knew before it came out what it was about, and that it would be a novella but Ms. Karon seems to have been under pressure to get this book out. The characters and story lack everything that the other books gave us. There seems to be a lot of commercialization going on here which is totally oppisite of her Mitford stories. How about the marketing of items at Hallmark?? Her new book that is coming out in fall is also going to be short, and be about the Mitford Snowmen sold exclusively at Hallmark. Will that book only be available at Hallmark&gt;?? I would imagine so. Too bad that it seems that money instead of loyalty to fans seems to be a motivator for Ms. Karon"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A Common Life was just that - nothing extraordinary here. I was so eager to have this next book that I purchased it without doing my homework. All the reviewers who expressed disappointment were correct - this looks like Jan Karon sold out. She wrote a short, quick, easy story (the plot was already crafted in a previous novel), just to get the income. Though I had been eagerly awaiting the next in the series, I would certainly have waited longer for a quality book. If you are compelled to read it - at least wait for the paperback, this book is not worth it.What a shame!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I bought this book without opening it. I love all of the others and I was anxious for a little more Mitford. The margins are large, there are a lot a blank pages in this book -- and -- it is extremely &quot;wordy&quot;. It appears that Jan Karon needed to turn in a paper for her &quot;middle school&quot; English class and it needed to have a certain number of words. She must have opened her thesaurus periodically to just write down descriptive word, after word, after word. This book was definately NOT up to the standard of the others. I would not buy it - check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. It is NOT worth adding to your book library with the other Mitford books. Trouble is, now I'm not sure I want to buy her next book - I'll have to read the reviews first next time."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Like many others, I, too, was terribly disappointed with Jan Karon's latest episode from wonderful Mitford. I did want to read about wedding trials, tribulations and joys of Father Tim and Cynthia, but found a lot of white space and fluff instead.And I also found a glaring mistake. When the second novel ended with the publishing of the banns for the couple, the Main Street Grill had been forced to close due to rot in the basement. Ms. Karon seems to have forgotten this as the Grill was going strong as A Common Life begins. It would not have been open again for two months. Shame on the editors and on Ms. Karon for missing this important detail."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Jan Karon promised her fans a novella about the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and she has delivered a keepsake to be treasured! This is a beautiful book, both in appearance and content. Reading &quot;A Common Life&quot; was as refreshing to my spirit as attending the wedding of beloved friends and I devoured this book as though it was a piece of Ester Bolick's famous Orange Marmalade Cake. I can hardly wait for the next volume in the Mitford series! Hurry Jan, write faster!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Fortunately for me, I was able to read this book between book 2 and 3 and not at the end of the series as so many disappointed readers have. Too bad that didn't help make this a worthwhile read. I noticed that the page numbers were obscured by a clever scroll put over them; an attempt to hide the scant number of them no doubt. Heavy paper stock, wide margins and large type makes this short story SEEM like a novel but it clearly is not. I will finish the series glad that the worst of them is behind me. Rehashed events and lengthy prayers do not a novel make. Borrow, don't buy this one."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book is a response to the requests of many disappointed readers who wanted to read about the wedding that happened after the end of book two but before the beginning of book three. Jan Karon went back and wrote the story of the wedding and this is the end product. I'm a hopeless romantic and I'm all for romantic love stories, but this book was WAY over the top, to an unrealistic degree. It seems like every other page, Father Tim is marveling at the joyful, desperate, blissful, dazzling, breathless, mesmerizing, overwhelming, extraordinary, happy, dazzling, astonishing, overpowering love he feels for his fianc&eacute;e (these are just some of the MANY adjectives used in much overabundance throughout the book). It just got too sappy and I didn't feel a connection with the characters at all. I listened to this book on tape from Recorded Books, and the last tape is an interview with Jan Karon. This was the one redeeming quality of sitting through the whole story. Karon sounds like a wonderfully nice person with great inspiration and a solid faith. Even though the last few books have seemed a little too unrealistic and dry, I enjoyed hearing the background of how the Mitford novels came about. I don't know if I'll read any more books in the series. It's gotten to the point where the description of ordinary people living ordinary lives has evolved into a near-utopia, with little to none of the problems that ordinary people in the real world experience."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A Common Life was a big disappointment after loving the rest of the Mitford series. Seems like Karon threw together a new book to capitalize on recent success. A Common Life lacked the familiar details of the characters we had come to know and love. The first five books in the Mitford series were wonderfully detailed about the community of Mitford and its residents. A Common Life wasn't a horrible book just a quick and simple read. If you don't already know and love the Mitford characters, don't bother with A Common Life."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I didn't particularly mind that this book was &quot;out of sequence.&quot; What I did mind, however, was the quality...or more to the point, the lack thereof...of the writing. For the most part this book sounded like it was written by committee, and a not particularly literate one at that. The overblown writing, the cliches...I think a beginning level creative writing class could have done a better job. This really was an appalling piece of work."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have loved the Mitford books and eagerly awaited the latest one. It arrived today and I've already read it!! I have the feeling that Jan Karon felt pressured to come out with another book but didn't want to spend the time to really develop a plot, so she simply rehashed what we've already read. The story of the proposal, the wedding plans and the wedding are sweet and it's nice to revisit the familiar characters, but I felt she churned out something with the least amount of effort possible just to get it done. I was ready to learn more about the lives of all the people we've come to know and love and what they're doing now, not going back and devoting a whole book (I say that with a wink) because this book is more like a short story. Frankly, I'm disappointed and I feel cheated."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A Common Life : The Wedding Story (The Mitford Years) by Jan Karon 4-11-01 I was VERY disappointed.

I was excited to find a new book in the Mitford Years.... but then to glance through it and see it is a rerun of what has already happened. I for one did NOT purchase this book. I love Jan Karon's writing style, but am uncertain why she would allow this book to be released two years after Tim and Cynthia's wedding had been in publication. I am looking forward to the next release.... hopefully the continuation of the Mitford family .... did they return to Mitford from the beach? What about Dooley and his siblings? What new jokes does Uncle Billy have to share?"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"For anyone who has followed the delightful Mitford charachters, this book is a &quot;must have.&quot; The wedding story is like a lovely slice of Esther Bolick's orange marmalade cake!

It wasn't as good as the other 5, but I did enjoy it. We go back in time to the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and how he proposed to her. Jan Karon is such a talented writer, and as usual I hated to see the story end. If I were going to complain it would be that the book was too short. I was listening to it on Recorded Books Audio and out of the blue the narrator said, &quot;the end&quot;. I was so surprised as there was still one whole tape left to listen to (which ended up being an interview with Jan Karon). If you have read the other 5 novels about Mitford then this book is a must, but a reader might not get much out of it if they start with this book. The characters aren't delved into very deeply."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Very good, Fun to know more about the wedding day and thoughts and preparations for it."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This would have made a good short story or,better yet, the last chapter of book #2 or the first chapter of book #3. I had looked forward to the next Mitford book, but was disappointed. Her publishers must have made her publish a new book before she was ready.

Hopefully, Ms. Karon will spend more time on her next book."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I agree with everyone who said it seemed the author just took advantage of her audience.

The story was shallow, uneventful, and boring.The story doesn't take you back into the lives of the towns' colorful characters- only hitting on them very briefly. It definitely needed more a storyline and should have followed in sequence. It also was too short. I really am sorry to give this a 1 star- I was hoping to give it10!

I selected this particular tape because I had read the first book in the series and wanted something light and entertaining, something that wouldn't distract me from my driving but would ease the boredom of the highway. It was the perfect choice.This is a simple story, simply told. I think it would have bored me to tears to read it but Dana Ivey presents it with just the right amount of acting (changing the voice only slightly for each character, for example)to be entertaining."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I agree with most other reviewers. A Common Life is not one of Jan Karon's better wrks. Still, it is sweet and upllifting with a wholesome message, much like Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin and The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Any visit to Mitford is a worthwhile trip. Even though this book is shorter and more simplistic than the others in the series, I enjoyed reading about the characters we've come to know and love. It was great beach reading! As an author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I appreciate the small details that add so much color to Jan Karon's stories.

I hope Karon's next efforts revert to her previous talent."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I have enjoyed the previous Mitford books.

I still recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good and uplifting story."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"While the previous 5 Mitford books were each a sumptious feast, The Wedding Story was more like an appetizer. Got far too over the line into just mushy emotions, not the fun and rich and inspirational story lines of previous series. This could have been better handled on fewer pages within the series time line. But I have no doubt I will buy the next Mitford book. Hurry, Jan and get it to us!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This is yet another utterly charming vignette by Jan Karon about the people of Mitford, a village in north Carolina. These stories in the Mitford series are a puzzlement to me; there is no plot! In this particular story, it is all about the Episcopal priest, Father Timothy Kavanaugh, getting married to his next-door neighbor, Cynthia. There is no single over-arching conflict to resolve--no villain; only the myriad small tales of the village's inhabitants within the main story of the preparations for the marriage.There is no real suspense at all, only the interplay of the personalities involved. In so small a village, everyone interacts with everyone else, and the beauty of the story is to simply absorb the atmosphere the author manages to impart of a friendly village inhabited by nice people.Jan Karon says she writes &quot;to give readers an extended family, and to applaud the extraordinary beauty of ordinary lives.&quot; In this, I think she succeeds admirably.This book will not appeal to detective story aficionados, or those who like to read things in the James Bond genre, but it was a delight for me, anyway. I would have given it 5 stars, except that I had expected the story to continue the series, and so was disappointed. The events in this book, number 6 in the series, actually precede the events in number 4, &quot;Out to Canaan.&quot; I have no idea why it was published after the other. However, each story stands alone well. Both my wife and I enjoyed each of them.Joseph H.

There were people we know and love missing from book..surely they would have been at the wedding. The next time we meet, Ill be expecting a lot of news and stories from Mitford!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS BOOK CONTAINED SO LITTLE SUBSTANCE. WHERE IS THE NEXT MAJOR STORY I EXPECTED, A NEW CHAPTER IN FATHER TIM'S LIFE?"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I thought this would be a continuation of the other Mitford books. Instead, it is a throwback to the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia. It is not captivating, and I did not even finish reading it. I reads like the society pages of the wedding pages from the 1950s. Boring. I won't buy any more Mitford books until the previous plot line continues."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was very disappointed once I received this book. I have so loved the Mitford series, this new book read too quickly with no substance, even though the Wedding was left out of earlier books, I anticipated this to be about Dooley and Lacey and their wedding."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I love the Mitford series. I recommend them to everyone. I, like most people, were left out when there was very little mentioned of the wedding in her last book. Unfornateley, this book left me very dissapointed. She really should have included the wedding in the last book. There was no plot. It only gave daily descriptions of what the characters were doing. There was no story line, or a plot. I kept feeling like Jan Karon, just hurry up and get to the wedding. Everything else was filler. I am so glad that I got this at the library and didn't waste my money on it. I will still look forward to her other books though."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Dear Mitford Readers,You are cordially invited to the wedding of our beloved Father Tim, and our dear Cynthia Coppersmith!I highly suggest you don your best Sunday outfit, and don't miss this blessed event!!Jan Karon, stated that her readers dearly wanted to know what happened at Father Tim and Cynthia's wedding, and now she has taken us and given us this rare treat of what did actually go on.She has shown us more of Father Tim, and Cynthia's characters, she has taken us inside the minds of all the other characters, and we have seen for ourselves, how they felt about this marriage, and how they go back and how they felt about the loves of their lives!!I loved this book from the moment I saw it! I loved the cover art, and the pen and ink drawings. To me it is the most beautiful book of them all! It is beautiful inside and out!!I knew this book would be a &quot;novella&quot;, and this is what I was expecting, not a continuation of the larger books!!I am not in the least disappointed in this book, as I have just finished reading it, and I had tears pouring down my face, as I read about this great event in Mitford history!!I urge every Mitford reader to give this book a fair chance. Jan Karon has said that she loves this book, and its very special to her, and I agree, I love this book too, and I can feel the love flowing through her words!!Jan Karon, is one author, that has never failed me, and I have read each book, and am rereading the series for the third time, and she has not failed me with this book either, as I knew she wouldn't!!Again, I highly recommend this book, for any Mitford lover, for any bride and groom, and for anyone that wants to be given a glimpse of heaven on earth!!As long as I have breath in my body, I will sing the praises of these glorious, books!!To Jan Karon, I again thank you from the bottom of my heart, for giving me, the most joyous and soul-satisfying books I have ever read!!Your devoted fan, Becky Carden, aka The Mitford Cheerleader!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A Common Life was written, as I understand it, in response to a clamor from the readers of her books, to write \\"more\\" about Father Tim and Cynthia's wedding. I did not feel that same need, although I bought the book the minute it arrived in my town.This book has been referred to as a novella, which is appropriate; it was never meant to be another major novel in the Mitford series.This novella presents a different perspective than the other five. After some introductory pages of At Home in Mitford, we gain practically every bit of our knowledge and feeling for the characters through the experience of Father Tim. Everything comes to us through his eyes. Almost nothing takes place--no conversation, not a piece of information-- that does not come through his direct experience or his reflections or through conversations to which he was party.Even the author's commentary, which would from a lesser writer come to us from the distance of the third person--the author as author--seems to come from Father Tim's own thoughts and feelings. Jan Karon hides herself so beautifully within her central character that she and he become one and the same. She herself, the author, hardly ever intrudes upon his mind and heart--at least, not that we are aware of. Rarely have I read any author who does this so delicately and with such skill. Then, of course, we, too, become Father Tim: we know everything he knows and feel what he feels and as he feels. This is what makes, I believe, these books so delightful and reaches so many people, touches them so deeply.And, then, of course, it is simply genius to write a book through a man's eyes, have him fall in love with a beautiful neighbor, and we (I suppose it is mostly women who first read these lovely things and then introduce them to their husbands, as I have done) then revel in all her delightful ways and so cherish reading about how his feelings for her plummet and soar. So, then, we are, in an odd way, the object also of his deep and romantic feelings that grow and blossom page after page. And how I have loved reading what is like a beautiful hymn to love, to good, wholesome love, and, of course, to this special Cynthia--and then feel as though I, too, am Cynthia! Don't you?The novella gives us the thoughts of many characters from Dooley and the Bishop, to Emma, to Miss Sadie and Louella, and Hessie, and the boys at the grill. It is a completely different perspective.In The Common Life, the chapter about the Bishop was amusing. The response of Cynthia to Timothy's letter and her fears were poignant; and we felt with her. The last chapter is a lovely thing. How many authors can, in a minimum of words and in only a few sentences, describe a man's reflections on his first joyous steps into the inexpressible and delicate mysteries of married love.Some books almost treat their readers, at best, as bystanders of the action, or at the worst, as intruders, collective peeping Toms, those who don't belong, unwelcome outsiders, probing into people's lives in an unseemly manner, like gossips or nosey old ladies. Jan Karon treats us as cherished, invited guests and beckons to us with charm and winsome words to come so that she can reveal her heart to us and the heart of Mitford. She urges us to come; she wants us to come.There are no dilettantes in Mitford, no secondhand experiences, no third- party observers.It is at one and the same time, as comfortable as an old shoe and as uplifting as a poem or a verse from the Bible. What a treasure!How can we wait for the next novel? What will it be called? Don't you just lick your chops over the prospect?"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I had not yet received my copy of the book when I read the first few reviews posted. My only response after reading the book now is, what did you expect? I read the promotional material, and I knew the book was a step back in time, to cover the events of the wedding, so I was not disappointed. Far from it!I think the writing was up to the usual high standard - intimate, genuine, and thought-provoking in its own gentle way. Perhaps it's because I was a bride myself a few months ago, but the details of the events (especially the personal thoughts of others, like Dooley and Esther Bolick) made it more special and real. Jan Karon reminded us that a wedding is not just an event between two people - it affects the community. I don't know how much of the groundwork for this book was laid at an earlier time, but I think Ms. Karon did a beautiful job of capturing the personality of the characters at that time in their lives. Father Tim hadn't been through the lesson in the cave, and his thoughts and fears reflect this. Not an easy task, but well done here. Overall, I was very pleased with this book. It made me smile, and even laugh out loud several times, and the bottom line is that I felt like I had spent some time in Mitford.One last parting thought to those who were upset that this book didn't pick up where &quot;A New Song&quot; left off: isn't it possible that this book was needed to fill in some gaps so that you will understand events in the book to come?"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I read all five of her first books and absolutely loved them. I was so excited to see another come out that I ignored the reviews and ordered the book immediately. Having just finished the book, I walked away wanting. This latest look into the life of Father Tim didn't have nearly the character that the first five books had. The citizens of Mitford were barely visable and I really don't understand why Ms. Karon chose to write the next volume smack in the middle of two previous books. I didn't miss the wedding when I was reading the other five. I would have much more enjoyed to know what Father Tim and his followers are up to now. It seems like Ms. Karon didn't put much thought into this book. She just pumped it out to keep her readers happy. This certainly won't stop me from buying the next book. I just hope that Ms. Karon gets back on track."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Okay, people, get over the margins and stop whining that the book isn't long enough! Ms. Karon had stated, long before A Common Life was published, that it would be a much shorter novel than her others, and it was only about the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia, and that there will be two more Mitford novels after this one. And that doesn't include the quote book and the bedside companion that are coming out this fall. This is a lovely story about the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia. Real Mitford fans have been dying to know what happened at the wedding, and Ms. Karon has not disappointed!!! What is extra special about this story is that we get a glimpse into what the other Mitford citizens are thinking during this time. This story is a treat, and it's fun to have Miss Sadie with us again, too! So get over the wide margins, get over the blank pages between the chapters, and just enjoy the story for what it is! Thank you, Jan Karon, for inviting us to the wedding!!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have read many of the reviews posted here and I'm disappointed that so many people who obviously enjoyed the other Mitford books did not like this one. I think the problem is that they expected a continuation of the story that left off in A New Song. Before I ever had this book in my hand I read a short blurb describing it in a catalog and that was when I realized it wasn't a continuation of the series, but was meant to go back and give some details of an event that was alluded to but not really described in any of the other books -- the wedding itself and the events leading up to it. I was disappointed at first to see that this book was not a continuation of the story -- like everyone else, I wanted to find out what happens next. But, when I read the book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also read, somewhere in the book or on the book jacket, that it seems there will be at least one more book like this, one dealing with Christmas. I am looking forward to it. I liked how A Common Life let you sort of get inside the heads of some of the other characters, learning a small bit of their histories that you didn't know before. I really liked this book and I hope all of the negative reviews here don't keep people from buying this book!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Okay, so this wasn't a long missive about our beloved Mitford and its wonderful inhabitants.This was a glimpse into a brief moment in the life of Father Tim and Cynthia Coppersmith and their joyous wedding.Maybe the story was published out of order and maybe it was too short but to me, any story of Mitford is better than none.After reading this little book in one sitting, I felt even closer to Father Tim and the love of his life....and I felt a deeper understanding of Father Tim's spiritual life.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I appreciated seeing events through other characters' eyes for a change (instead of only through Father Tim's). This book deepens all the characters in a series that's not exactly known for its profound character development. The only negative is that the book is shorter than the others. I don't blame the author, who said in interviews last year that she would be writing a mini book about the wedding. What I see is the publisher's greed in trying to publish a small book in a large book format and at a large book price. Shame on the publisher! However, the book IS STILL WORTH IT IF YOU LOVE THE MITFORD SERIES.Or, wait a few months, and you can buy a softcover version at the right price!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book was worth waiting for! It gave us a beautiful overview of Tim and Cynthia's wedding which we missed in the original series. Many readers seemed to expect that this would be a continuation of the series, but I was always aware that this book was a &quot;look back&quot; and not a &quot;new&quot; installment. It was wonderful to see the personal struggles that both Tim and Cynthia faced in the days prior to the wedding and the way that they both worked through their doubts and surrendered to the love they always knew they shared. There will always be time for the next installment in the series, but I felt privileged to get to go back and share in this special time. I would highly recommend this to any Mitford reader."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Jan Karon proposed (no pun intended) this book to be something different than the previous &quot;Mitford&quot; books. And different, it is. Jan Karon's style is prevalent, as is the charm of the characters in Mitford, but is an intendedly uni-dimensional story covering events surrounding the wedding. Everything is as Jan Karon promised - no more and no less. Thank you Jan, for creating a marvelous place that millions of people love. I look forward to every word in every book, regardless of margin widths or length! 5 stars, hands down!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Okay! I'm one of the people who bought the book and LIKED it.I was forewarned of the backward glance it would give and that did not bother me. I was well removed from reading the other books in the series, which I loved and gave away in sets to friends and loved ones. And I think this little volume, so beautifully appointed with wedding graphics and chapter separations, is actually rather inspirational.I had forgotten how Karon's skill in dialogue makes her characters come to life. I was chuckling softly all the way through it, trying not to disturb my sleeping spouse.The Reverend Tim's revelation of his good news at the Grill is priceless, presented as it is around the marvelous ballet of who is ordering what for lunch. And each encounter with the regular pairs of characters, the Bolicks, the mayor and her spouse, Miss Sadie and Louella, Uncle Billy and Rose, Dooley and Barnabas, just warmed my heart.On a smaltzie note, Tim and Cynthia's love and committment to one another is refreshing and endearing giving hope to the old romantics in so many of us. Their fears and hesitancies are quite real, too. The saying, &quot;There is no fool like an old fool,&quot; does not go unheeded in their cautionary moments.This is a feel good shortie that whets the appetite for another Jan Karon biggie. With such talent, another title should be coming or another series starting. Anticipation of such is good."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I read this book in about an hour and a half. The story added little to developing the wonderful characters I've come to love through the other books. The book seemed to be just a quickie fill in."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"The style of the Mitford Years books, the last of which is &quot;A Common Life: The Wedding Story&quot; is refreshingly believable and upbeat. The characters are so realistically crafted as to allow the reader to become their friends, acquaintances, or sometimes enemies, along with Father Tim and Cynthia. These two, courting and then marrying late in life, are much like many of us who have had the same experience, and it is pleasant to relive these experiences with them. The frequent reference to Biblical passages, the absence of foul language and detailed descriptions of violence, make this book, as well as the others in the series, a relaxing pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I feel as though I have been cheated by the author. The Mitford Series was delightful and I was so looking forward to Jan Koran's new book, but I am highly disappointed that events are repeated. Dooley went off to college in the series. This book takes you back to where Dooley is a young boy living with Father Tim and wondering how he will feel about the marraige.Deja vu! Been there and done that."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I echo the review above, I am/was disappointed. This is NOT a 'continuation' in the series, it is a step back in memory. We all know how it all turns out. For the first few chapters, I kept having that 'de je vu' feeling. I kept turning back to the title page to make SURE it was published in 2001. Then I wondered WHY. Why after all this time, with Father Tim and his love being married and sent to the coast, am I reading about the wedding? I think the author goofed!However, as I said in my title, it IS Mitford and it's been a long time between doses. I DO wish book 6 had been a more current offering, however. The wedding story is nice and anything to do with Mitford is great, but I'm sorely disappointed that I'm not current with the gossip etc. in Mitford.How long do we have to wait for the REAL continuation to be published??????????"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Thank you, reviewers, for the great advice of checking out this book from the library, rather than purchasing it! I, too, am a great fan of Jan Karon; one who has purchased her books as gifts for friends and relatives; however....this book is a simple &quot;easy read&quot; which, I am grateful, I got it from our local library, and not a bookstore!! Please, please Jan Karon, bring back Fr. Tim and Cynthia to Mitford--let us know how Dooley and his mom and the other parishoners are doing!! We love your books, and want to keep reading about the adventures in MITFORD!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have been an avid Mitford and Father Tim fan since the first wonderful volume. My disappointment in A Common Life is tremendous. why was this rerun even written? I sincerely hope that Jan Karon's Muse has not died. However, judging from this sappy retelling of a wedding that took place volumes ago her muse is indeed gone. I hope that it returns soon, for I am a true lover of all things Mitford. Jan, I sincerely wish that you could explain what has happened here."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Not up to the standard of the rest of the Mitford series.

Strictly for those readers who like wedding stories."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I enjoyed my visit into Father Kavanaugh's little world once more. He was enchanting and winsome....Cynthia was sweet...and they both deserved each other. This is how love should be. And the other characters were believable in their behavior....Jan Karon takes us into their thoughts....jealousy, dislike, infatuation, insecurity, stubborness...those very human emotions.While I enjoyed the story very much, I think &quot;The Common Life&quot; would have fared better written in two or three chapters of another story. Entertaining though it was, it lacked the richness of the preceding &quot;Mitford Years&quot;"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I enjoyed the book, as I have all of Jan Karon's other books; however, it was mainly a rehash of some of the other books."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have loved every one of the Father Tim books in the Mitford series.

A beautiful world that's not necessarily perfect, but lovely just the same.Her characters are delightful, the plots are sound and develop at the perfect pace. She gives encouragement and teaches spiritual lessons without being preachy.I thoroughly enjoyed the Wedding Story. Every page was precious.

Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have bought and thoroughly enjoyed Jan Karon's first 5 books. My daughter, who has also read them, bought &quot;A Common Life&quot; for me for Mother's Day. And, I might mention paid the full price of $25.00 at her book store. We were delighted to finally get another Mitford story. Imagine my disappointment when I read the whole book in the same time it took me to read one chapter in her previous books. And then to realize it was a chapter that could have been added at the beginning of book three? I can't believe Ms. Karon would think her devoted public could be fooled by a double spaced, wide margined book. I think she owes us an explanation and an exceptionally well written next book. I read on the book jacket that one of her next books will be some of Father Tim's favorite sayings. I will not be purchasing that one! I already have everything he's ever said in the first five. Finally, I'd like to say to Ms. Karon, if she reads these, that I apologize for not writing about your first five. I didn't even know I could do this until just recently. They were the best fictional books I've ever read. Thank you for the Mitford Series and please turn out another great one!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I fell in love with the Mitford Series and thought of Father Tim and the rest of the town as family. When this book came out, I raced to the book store anticipating another great book - I was so disappointed - I wish she had included this within the series - I didn't like going back (Miss Sadie had died already) I wish it had just continued from the island and included more of Dooley and what happened to him. I really hesitate to buy the one about snowmen - So sad in Indy!!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"After listening to and enjoying the audio tapes of the Mitford series on my way to work every morning, I was really disappointed in &quot;A Common Life&quot;. Too much thinking from the characters and not enough story."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book was a major disappointment - I considered it &quot;filler&quot; and not much more than a rehash of the prior books. I really expected more after waiting so long for a new book. The book could have been written &quot;in order&quot; and would have made a great deal more sens."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"...okay, so Jan Karon said to expect a 'novella' rather than a full blown 'novel'. But, I found that this was a total letdown. The soul, richness and depth inherent in the other Mitford books is lacking in &quot;A Common Life&quot;. Like many others, I preordered this book - not only for myself but for my mother and mother-in-law as well. I took my copy along on a trip to the UK, hoping that it would last me the trip - only took a few hours to read.Something else I missed - the wonderful illustrations that are so much a part of the earlier books. The bouquets throughout the book are nicely done, but I would have liked to see Cynthia, Fr. Tim, Dooley, Barnabas, etc. decked out in their wedding finery!Of course, most Mitford fans will purchase this book regardless - but I suggest you wait and get it at a much lower price. This book should have been list priced at less in my opinion. What a let down!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Jan Karon is a fabulous writer, and has given all of us such a wonderful gift in creating Mitford. We all love Father Tim, Sadie, Louella, Dooley, Cynthia... But she chose to let us dream about their engagement and wedding, and we chose to believe that we could not! Karon was continually deluged by Mitford fans with requests for the wedding story, and now that she has written it, we have got to admit that even she could not do justice to the sweetness of the Timothy/Cynthia story! So we need to quit whining! A Common Life is a retrospective story about their wedding, it is a short read, and it is not a continuation of the Mitford series. But then, it was never promoted as one!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Having read the first book of the Mitford Series in 24 hours and the next four within two weeks, I preordered &quot;The Wedding Story&quot; months in advance. What a disappointment!! It appears that Ms. Karon has succombed to money and making her publishers happy by pumping out a book rehashing old topics and leaving the reader wanting. Her advertisement at the end regarding a book of Father Tim's favorite quotes further fuels the impression that she's on a capitalistic turn rather than a literary one. PLEASE give us more of the good father and his adventures!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This is the laziest way to write a book I've ever heard of.

It is not a story, it is a means of conveying from the heart, exactly what commitment, respect, honor and love is ALL about in marriage today. With the actions of marriage today, so much of what Jan Karon has written about has been lost during the hustle and bustle of a wedding, THE plans, THE moment, THE schedule of events. Jan Karon has reminded the world about THE feelings, THE commitment and THE life of a marriage. I think it was a most enchanting presentation of the realities of marriage and a wonderful book presenting issues and feelings that a bride and a groom SHOULD be concentrating on as they enter into a most sacred of trusts and sharings. This book would make a WONDERFUL gift for a bride to be...a book to be shared with her daughter on her wedding day. Nothing is wrong with Jan Karon....everything is perfect with the writings.

Upon opening this book, I expected to be drawn into it as I was with all her others but was terribly disappointed. The characters (which I am very familiar with) did not come across as having the same dimensions as usual. The story line was dull and repetative. I felt as if Karon wrote this book as a filler and to make money off of her readers.

It seems to me, based on what I've read in these reviews, that the events will flow more naturally. And to those who have already finished the series, change your perspective and enjoy! Who of us hasn't had to relive a past experience? It's still a good story. A similar retelling of the trip to Ireland in Book One would also be welcome!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I too read this in one sitting. It was more of a short story than a novel. Ms. Karon's other books ran 350-400 pages. This was a mere 180 with HUGE margins. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book signals a return to the beloved characters of Mitford, specifically Father Tim Kavanaugh and his next-door neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith. It chronicals the 62-year-old Episcopal priest's nervousness upon proposing marriage for the first time in his life, describes the gently amusing engagement period, and the disasters and eventual triumph of the actual wedding and honeymoon. This book falls chronologically into the middle of the series, but gives some charming details about the Kavanaughs' wedding. Karon's prose often sounds suspiciously like poetry, and her insight into human nature and its frailities and successes is a joy to behold. Her stories are always lovingly and carefully told and this book about the Mitford years is a worthy addition to its predecessors."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This was a nice little story; it was good to hear some kind of news from Mitford even if it isn't exactly fresh. I had to wonder if Jan Karon is getting extremely burned out, yet feels compelled to keep writing about Father Tim just to hush the clamoring of her many fans who are hungry to read about where Father Tim and Cynthia left off. As pleasant as this was, I am not particularly looking forward to the Christmas novella unless it can provide something new. This all goes to show that writing books for a living probably isn't as nifty a job as we readers all think it is."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"It was nice to get invited to the wedding. I was always sorry it was skipped over. Yes - it could have been a longer book. Yes - the margins are rather wide. But it was a lot of fun to hear all the details about the flowers and food and people. So if you arent a die - hard fan, you might want to wait and read a library copy, or borrow it from a friend."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Like many others, I would love to have every Mitford book be 1,000 pages long. That is not the case with this one, but, for me, that didn't substantially detract from the pleasure I received from reading it. Once I realized that the book was more of a &quot;story behind the story,&quot; I was able to relax and just enjoy Karon's writing and the feeling of seeing old friends again. I also liked the glimpses she gives us into the personal lives of some of the more minor characters via their reminiscences. Yes, look forward to the next book, but don't discount this one."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I knew what the book was going to be about, and did enjoy the story, but felt that for $20+ list price, it was rather expensive for such a small book. (Yes, the graphics were beautiful, but I'd rather have had a smaller price tag and less artwork.) If I could, I'd give it 4 stars for story and 1 for value for money."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"It is hard to believe that Jan Karon needs money badly enough to have written this book. It is the only reason I can derive for what is an elaboration of a story line from a previous book. After eagerly awaiting the publication of a new Karon book, to say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Like other fans, I hope that a true installment of the Mitford story is in the works. If Karon yields to commercializm, in the vain of Grisham and other popular authors, she has lost this, here to fore, devoted fan."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I ordered 4 copies prepublication, for myself and three friends who are devotees of the series. Next time I will wait until I can peruse a copy before ordering! &quot;Common Life&quot; is closer to novella than novel, with its double spacing and chapter illustrations attempting to stretch a work rather lean on true material. I was disappointed that it did not further the Mitford saga, but merely expanded on a small retrospective piece. I hope Jan Karon has a more substantive novel in the works for her fans, or her following will greatly dwindle."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"What a waste of time. Pressure to publish? Can't think of any other reason for this volume."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was very disappointed in the story also. I thought the story was continuing and then we go back to a marriage that I remember as being nice. I wanted to go on from the beach. The other thing the book was very short compared to the earlier books. I think it is sad that the author has to stoop to this level just to sell a book. The first five were wonderful, this was a bomb. I will not buy the next two, as this was not worth my money. Get back to the good job, Jan. I have an aunt that was named after the same book you were named after, and I was also a carrier of a part of the name. Hope your next two are better, but with two coming out in the fall, I am not thinking very positive of the end result."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book was good. I think that even though it left a lot of questions in my mind about other characters, the plot was very entertaining. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Okay, I know this book was promoted as a short novel about the wedding but what was the point in writing it in the first place? If Jan Karon wanted to write about the wedding then this should have been the third book. Most of us Mitford fans were looking forward to a continuation of the story and this is not it. In my opinion, this book was disappointing, shallow and seemed to be just a way to get another book out there for us to buy. I hope Jan gets back on track and continues the story ( the next two books don't sound too promising either- Father Tim's quotations and hymns and the Mitford Snowmen? What snowmen ( never mind, I don't really care ) just get on with the story. PLEASE!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I knew before buying this book that it was about the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia. But I was still very diappointed in the shortness of it, and the skipping over Ms. Karon seemed to do for a lot of the characters. There should've been more in the book of the people and their thoughts on the wedding. There is no real substance to this book compared to her others. It's almost as if someone tried to write this in Ms. Karon's place. And, for as long as it took for this book to come out, you'd think she could've done better."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I loved this book, as I did all of Jan Karon's \\"Mitford\\" series. I have read them all. It just proves that a good story, well written, stands on its own and does not need profanity and sex in order to sell. If Jan writes any more books, I wil; buy them and read them."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I absolutely love this whole series and don't think any of the books were a failure! Perhaps this book is not a necessity but, being a detail person, it was fun to fill in the gaps with Father Tim and Cynthia's wedding day and honeymoon. I give it a definite two thumbs up."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have now completed the Mitford Series of Audio Books and every single one of them are in excellent condition and I have enjoyed all nine of them - I think three times and am now lending them to a couple of friends, who are also enjoying them. Thank You so very much. Marilyn Schulman, Fort Worth, TX"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book, about a third the size of the others in the series, appears to be something left over or deleted from about the second volume. \\"A Common Life\\" is way out of sequence and just isn't very interesting. It deals solely with the marriage of Father Tim and has little to do with Mitford or the other characters. I found the novel (it is scarcely that) a real disappointment, compared with the first four books of the series. If the author felt that the information therein was significant, why was it not included at the appropriate place in time? The question is never answered."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book is a lovely edition to the Mitford Saga. Those who didn't seem to like it appeared to have expected more from the book than it was meant to do. It was not meant to be a full-fledged novel as the other books in the series are. It was meant to be an interlude, a love story, a peek into a episode that undoubtedly many readers had clamored for. And in that regard it succeeded admirably. It is a sweet and enjoyable read, giving us a brief peek at many favorite characters during a special time in their lives."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Having read &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the first five Mitford novels, I was anxiously awaiting book six. A Common Life is disappointing &amp; certainly not up to Jan Karon's usual quality writing.The fact that it is out of sequence makes me feel it was an after-thought or that it was hastily written in response to readers' disappointment with lack of detailed information about Fr. Tim &amp; Cynthia's actual wedding. Whatever the motivation, the story lacks character development, plot, &amp; substance.If read at all, it should be read BEFORE book five!That being said...I will definitely buy In This Mountain, the seventh in the Mitford series."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I gave my mother a book gift certificate for Christmas with a note that she should use it towards this book when it was released in April. She bought it as soon as it was released and read it right away. She called to tell me what a disapppointment it was and after reading it myself I agree. I didn't want to go back in time , I wanted to move forward with further character development. (What happens to Dooley?) We have already lived through Father Tim and Cynthia's engagement etc. I was ready to move on to the next phase in their lives and their friends. Going back was a huge disappointement, especially after having waited so long for this book. I hope the next book in the series no longer leaves us hanging....in the meantime I am going back and rereading the first books in the series so I don't forget all of the people in Mitford."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I find it interesting that so many obvious fans of Jan Karon were disappointed by A Common Life. It was such a wonderful book and was very well written. Yes, I will agree that the timing seemed to be a little off, having it published AFTER the fifth novel, but I don't believe that that made this book any less wonderful. And for those who were wondering what will be published next, check out the end of the book. Coming this fall we can expect to be awed by Jan Karon's work once again."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"After reading the first few pages of A Common Life, I knew this was not the sixth book of the Mitford series that I'd long been waiting for. Instead what I read was a pretty little book that, for someone who's read the series twice, contained nothing but yesterday's news. My recommendation: Buy this book as a gift for a friend who's never read anything by Jan Karon. It's a sweet story and a new reader will love it. As for the rest of us Karon fans - all we can do is hope that our book is still out there!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"When we first received our copy of this book, we had two thoughts. (1) Hadn't we already read about the wedding? (2) The book is somewhat large for so little text. After confirming that we had not read the wedding story in one of Karon's earlier volumes, we settled down to read her most recent offering.We were not disappointed. The story that unfolds in &quot;A Common Life&quot; is anything but common, to use the vernacular. The author graces us with her vision of what a Christian marriage should be like, and dishes out an uncommon amount of good advice for how a couple should get started in building a successful married life. (Of course, the &quot;common&quot; in the title is actually referring to two people who share one life in a solid marriage.)On the other hand, we would have preferred if the book had been considerably smaller in size. Since we purchased it sight unseen, we cannot complain that its moderately large physical size was misleading. To those who pick it up off a shelf in a store without looking inside, however, there is almost certain to be disappointment. A small volume (&quot;marriage missal&quot; size) that one could carry in one's pocket would have been more agreeable. I hope, however, that this does not keep anyone from buying the book. It is well worth the price!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Compared to her earlier Mitford books, this one was a major disappointment. Not much text even though the hardcover book was 186 pages long: too much white space including wide margins on each page. The character sketches seemed more like outlines than in-depth discussions by and about the people we thought we knew. The quality of writing that I'd come to expect simply wasn't there, but perhaps the author was responding to pressure by the publisher to get this book out in a hurry. What a shame, since she's already proved she can do better."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"After waiting a very long time for the latest Jan Karon book, my only disappointment was that I could not stretch the delightful experience of reading this book beyond a few days. That's what a novella is all about, I guess. It was a wonderfully romantic story that I promptly passed on to one of my friends and I would recommend it to your readers as well. Once again -- well done, Ms. Karon!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I had heard that A Common Life wasn't worth buying. So I waited and waited for the library finally to get a copy. After reading it, I am ready to buy it. To me, it's all about expectations. Karon clearly has written this for Mitford lovers who cannot get enough details. It was not meant to be on the scale of A Light in the Window or A New Song. Rather, it is a lovely, enchanting interlude in which we enter the hearts and minds of characters who have become our friends. Thank you, Jan Karon, for reminding us of grace, redemption, love, and the God Who alone makes these possible even in these dark days."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A large portion of this book is taken from the Book of Common Prayer; much of the rest is pulled from her earlier books. I've read all of her books &amp; have enjoyed them except for this one which is different in narrative voice from her other books and really does nothing to further the story line. The book is printed on very heavy stock to give the impression that there is more to the book than there actually is. Buy this book if you like heavy stock, not if you want a good story of the caliber of Karon's other books."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I approached this book with enormous anticipation, having loved the previous books in the series, blew through it in less than two hours and will not keep it because I cannot ever imagine wanting to re-read it, as I have done all of the earlier Mitford books, again and again. Jan Karon, having already beautifully told the story of the romance between Cynthia and Father Tim, here retells it with far less grace and almost no charm. The peripheral characters, whom all Mitford readers have come to love, are almost non-existent. What a waste of time and money!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I've been waiting for this book for 2 years, and was a bit disappointed at its content. It didn't have nearly the depth of Jan's earlier books, and I wish it had been written in sequence. But -- all the lovable characters are there, and it was a pleasure reading their thoughts about the upcoming wedding. It was as if Jan felt she needed a &quot;filler&quot; to keep her readers happy. I didn't get full enough! I hope the next 2 anticipated books (Father Tim's quotes and Mitford Christmas) give us a little more to chew on! Keep writing!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Let's face it; if you're a diehard Mitford fan, you've got to read this book, no matter how short it is, and despite the fact that it's not in sequence. Everyone we love is in it, although the visit may be very short. And Jan's writing is as soulful as ever. It just doesn't have all the delightful twists and turns (it does have one or two) that we love in her books. This is a teaser (or appetizer) to get us along until the next BIG book comes out; not til 2002, I guess."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Another great read! A little shorter than regular Mitford books. Interesting how she would hold off on the wedding chapters for a later book. I just can't get enough of Mitford!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"You can only imagine how thrilled I was to receive a copy of THE WEDDING STORY from my sister-in-law last week.We read Jan Karon's first five books (all in two weeks!) and fell in love with MITFORD and all of its residents!Well, the WEDDING STORY was a very nice story but should have been incorporated into one of her other books! Talk about spacing out copy and wide margins and thick stock to boot!The story was sweet. But, it left me feeling that somewhere down the Mitford series road, Cynthia Coppersmith is going to succumb to her publishers and whip out a 13 page VIOLET STORY about the slice of swiss cheese she left in New York!For better or worse, I'm still hooked on Mitford.Hope the story continues.Disappointed, but I'll get over it!

I have read almost all of the 'Mitford Series' and I hate for them to end."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Great Mitford story!It's great to read a Christian novel like A Common Life. It's powerful, fun, thrilling and packs a Christian punch to make it all round great reading. It's not easy to find a good novel like this, where those with Christian values and principles win in the end, or you are not subjected to thrill killings or horror junk stories. Stories like A Common Life make fiction worthwhile, and worth reading.I came across a set of fun, exciting and thrilling Christian novels written 100 years ago by Horatio Alger that had just been reprinted. It was a Christian friend who also likes to read personal growth books, (Tony Robbins, etc), that first noticed Alger. Alger was famous for writing very good \`rags to riches' stories - what I did not know, was that he peppered his books with Christian values, ethics, etc, that were partly the reason for the success of the hero of the story. Interesting too, Alger wrote the practical reasons that the hero's make his achievement, thus you can learn a lot of good business principles that that just as useful and valid today as 100 years ago. Perhaps more so!To top it off, Alger was a great fiction writer, great plots, thrills and lots of hurdles that the main character has to overcome to succeed - just like any Christian today.I can recommend both A Common Life, and any of the Alger books; here are a few if you would like to experience them too!The Cash Boy: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Driven from Home: Carl Crawford's ExperienceThe Errand Boy: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Frank's Campaign: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Luke Walton: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I love this series on Father Tim's life.

Especially wedding details."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This is a great book. The detail in it is stunning, and I think that you can almost see Jan Karon sitting at her computer, meticulously writing this intricate tale of love. If you enjoy weddings, this is a great book for you. Although it may not focus on some of the other characters in the other Mitford series books, it is still an Amazing book!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"There is nothing really new in this tale of a wedding. Readers of the Mitford series are well versed in the storyline. Well, there is one thing new ... I've never seen such an abudance of blank space on the pages of any book, about 25 lines per page. The pages are 5.75 in. across and the print covers 3.75 in. That's 35% of nothing - in addition to the double spacing. Maybe the book is supposed to be poetry, but it certainly isn't tree-friendly. Good-by Viking Press and Jan Karon, enjoy your money while it lasts."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have been anticipating the next Mitford book since finishing reading the last one. This book is a disappointment to me, as it is not what I was expecting. There was not the usual depth of characters. I did not feel like I was involved with what was going on, but was merely an onlooker. I think, to be fair, that if I were to read all the books again, and read this one in context between volumes 2 and 3, it would be alright. It took me less than a few hours to read; I had been hoping to savor it for a week or two, as I usually do. I hope this is not the last of what we hear from Mitford - I need to know what is going to happen with Dooley and siblings!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Though the characters are still charming and unique, this poor, thin excuse for a book proves Karon has been bitten by the commercialism bug.

There MUST be a continuation of the Mitford story...we have to know what happens to those we have grown to love and that all is well. . . AMEN!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Once I discovered Jan Karon's engaging &amp; uplifting Mitford series I immediately devoured all six books in just a short period, relishing the anecdotes of Father Tim Kavanaugh &amp; his faith-filled community.Here in A Common Life are the long-awaited answers to these deeply probing questions: Will Father Tim fall apart when he takes his vows? Will Cynthia make it to the church on time? Who'll arrange the flowers &amp; bake the wedding cake? And will Uncle Billy's prayers for a great joke be answered in time for the reception?Reading A Common Life is somewhat akin to enjoying a flashback episode of a favorite television series. While the story is enjoyable, I was left wanting. My only wish is that Jan Karon will continue forward with the Mitford series &amp; the tales of Tim &amp; Cynthia &amp; their extended family."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have read the entire Mitford series by Jan Karon and loved them. I was very excited when this new book came out. However, I was very disappointed when I read it and found out it was just a review of all the other books. The author did not go into character development, so if this was the first book I read it would not have drawn me in to the lives of all those in Mitford. I was very disappointed. I will think twice about buying another Mitford Series book."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I am deeply shocked at the lack of quality in this book. I guess Ms. Karon thought we were all well hooked into her series and this would allow her to skate through with a nice fat paycheck. I haven't even finished this latest (lack of) effort from her. I LOVED the previous 5 books and nearly embarrassed myself with Joy while in the bookstore at seeing this latest edition. When I got it home, I was deeply confused. Didn't they get married already? Did I mistakenly pick up a previous volume and had just forgotten the name? And didn't Miss Sadie die in #5??? I kept looking at the front matter trying to find out just where I went wrong. It was greatly comforting to come to Amazon and find out that I was not the only other lost soul! Ms Karon...what a mistake you've made!! I feel taken advantage of and will think twice at buying or even looking at your next installment. IF you even bother to write one!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Oh, thank you thank you thank you, Jan Karon! You gave me just what I wanted... the details prior to and including the wedding of our beloved Father Tim and his bride-to-be Cynthia! I, along with many friends, felt so let down when the wedding was just mentioned in passing in &quot;The Light in the Window&quot; and was thrilled to hear of plans for a novella about the wedding. I so enjoyed hearing Father Tim's proposal, and the reaction of all my favorite characters from the series, and especially Dooley's heartfelt albeit jaded thoughts on the subject of marriage.I definitely had to keep the box of tissues nearby for all the tears... happy and sad ones!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book. If you love Mitford and love the characters, don't ya know, this book will bring you back home."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I wonder which was the bigger driver in producing this book: Karon going for the green, or her fans sending her letters telling her how disappointed they were not to have been able to read about the wedding.No matter which, this is a book that should not have been written. It detracts from, rather than adds to, the series. One reviewer called it \\"sappy\\", and I agree. Did Father Tim suddenly enter his second childhood? Gone is his dignity, replaced by mushy dialogue. I almost expected Tim and Cynthia to start calling each other \\"Pooky\\" and \\"Snookums\\". Or did they? I'm not sure, because I was unable to finish this book."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"The richness that you found in all the other Mitford books was unfortunately lacking in A Common Life. The book does provide some additional insights into the much loved Mitford residents, but I found the book lacking in many areas. It would have been fun to read about the wedding arrangements and the reception. Also, I would have liked to read about the reaction that Edith had to Father Tims engagement. I hope that Jan Karon publishes further stories in the Mitford series that are as rich and enjoyable to read as the previous books."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was so excited to see a new Mitford book and expected it to take up where we left off at the beach. As I started reading, I thought I've already got this book. The characters are the same wonderful ones, but we need to move on. Quite disappointing I must say. I'll keep it just to say it's part of my Mitford Series, but again, I'm disappointed at the lack of imagination and rush in publishing a book just to say another one has been published. I don't want to rule out purchasing the next Mitford book, but I will think about it before buying it."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Heard an interview with Ms. Karon on this book by Recorded Books. She explains that this single purpose book came about to satisfy a strong demand from many readers and fans. People wanted to hear more about the wedding and subsequent honeymoon. She does skip over the nuptial event rather quickly in the second book, moving right along to Father Tim and Cynthia's new life ahead. It fits as the third book in sequence, but as a gap-filler, can be picked up later on its own. (Otherwise, these books really need to be read in order.)It is an interesting visit with about every individual family and town character, giving their personal perspective on the wedding event. The only one conspicuous by her absence is the antagonist, Edith Mallory. That struck me as a missing note, as Ms. Mallory has staged an outrageous ongoing campaign to ensnare Father Tim. Such a potent element in the storyline would seem to beg a response of some sort from her regarding this major foiling of her schemes - if just a sentence or simple reference. It will be interesting to see if she is eventually won over, as other antagonizing characters have been - Buck Leeper, the temporary tenant of the former rectory with an ax to grind, the island's anti-social neighbor and the dropout husband, as some examples.Regardless, Ms. Karon has created a warm and wonderful human world, gratifying pictorials of places and events, and much to contemplate along the way. Very much appreciate this inspirational and gifted author."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Disappointing for Ms. Karon's readership -- very mundane and you could skip this book entirely and not miss anything with the Mitford happenings.

However, it felt good to read about all the other people in Mitford.Good easy read."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I always look forward to NEW books in the Mitford Series. I was very disappointed in that I was rereading history. I felt cheated even though there were details explained in this book not previously revealed. But I really didn't care about the who what and color of the flowers or bridal suit.....bring on NEW stories please!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"One of the only frustrating things about the Mitford series is that sometimes Jan Karon doesn't give details for events mentioned in the book. In this case, Ms. Karon has realized the error of her ways and has written a delightful little story detailing the much-anticipated wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia Coppersmith. I read this book between the second and third (exactly where it fits in best in regards to the series) and it made a lot more sense than it did for my friends who read the series in order. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's too fast a read. Yes, you will be entertained by it. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Not sure why Jan Karon even wrote this book. It gives you nothing new to the story. It was written as if her publisher wanted something new so she wrote this in 5 minutes just to please her publisher. This book is so unlike her other books. She's a wonderful writer with stories that just sweep you off your feet and characters that find their way into your heart to stay. As far as this book is concerned, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"i should have believed the poor reviews but had to find out for myself...the book was an absolute bore...i kept reading and hoping that something/anything was going to happen...this is such a common, boring, disappointment to an avid reader of life in mitford...but this will not stop me from buying/reading the next book in the mitford series - i can only pray to the lord's chapel that jan karon returns to her familiar format and cast of characters that most of us have grown to know and love!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I knew before the book came out that it was going to be the story of Tim and Cynthia's wedding. I was very excited to learn about this episode in their lives that had been skipped in previous Mitford books. However, when the book was released, I was extremely disappointed in the writing, which seemed rushed. The characters did not come alive as they had in previous installments. I love the Mitford series, and I look forward to Ms. Karon's future books, but this one was by far the least fulfilling of the series."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This book stunk. It was to mushey. I dont get what took her this long to write it. This book comparded to all her other ones stunk. Father Tim was actting like he could not live witrh out his wife. I like it when she writes about Emma &amp; Dudley, but this book did not have much about thouse two. Also the wedding was weird. Every one was crying to much. So don't bother with this one! I hope her next book is much better and comes out faster!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I waited a long time for a very thin book. It was good but if you took out all the empty pages and spaces it was only a 100 pages. What took her so long to write so little."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I read the book and 110 of the posted reviews. I found the reviews much more entertaining and interesting than the book!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I read some of the 107 reviews, I agree with most of them, there was no heart and soul in this book, It was just thrown together, I was very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was also disappointed by the book. Jan Karron will have two new &quot;money makers&quot; out in the fall - a Christmas story and Father Tim's book of quotes. Please Jan go back to the series!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was so excited when I saw the announcements on television that a new Mitford book had been released. I have enjoyed all of the previous books tremendously and was eagerly anticipating the next installment of the lives of all of the characters. I bought this book at a local buyer's club at a discounted price. After looking at the book when I got home, I was very glad that I'd gotten it at a discount. The book is only 186 pages long, has huge margins on each page. The timeframe of the book is several years earlier than the last book. While it was great to again meet all of the characters of the town and be involved in the actions and thoughts of their lives, it wasn't enough. This book is like a good short story or perhaps a couple of good chapters the usual Mitford book. I've been reading it for around 1 hour, and have only 20 pages left. I need more!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I love the Mitford series. A Common Life is no exception. A good read for Family oriented people. We can all identify with the story."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Waste of time. Boring. Slow moving. Love the author. If you are a HUGE fan and have to read everything of hers, then read it. Otherwise, move on."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"While the information on the jacket implies that this sixth book is a continuation of the story, it backtracks into an event not previously covered in detail. Moreover, this is a short story packaged as a novel - with large print, lots of white space, and little to say. Definitely a disappointment. It appears that the author ran out of original ideas but needed to make a deadline (or more money from her previously loyal fans)."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Being a firm Father Tim and Mitford fan, I have been waiting to be invited to the wedding, and I wasn't let down when the invitation finally came. Jan Karon paints such realistic characters that you wish you could be transported to Mitford and become a resident. I wish Karon a long life and many, many more Mitford books. Father Tim finally gets the proposal out of his mouth to Cynthia, and the wedding of the year takes place. Now, I want a book about their honeymoon in Maine."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Once I discovered Jan Karon's engaging &amp; uplifting Mitford series I immediately devoured all six books in just a short period, relishing the anecdotes of Father Tim Kavanaugh &amp; his faith-filled community.Here in A Common Life are the long-awaited answers to these deeply probing questions: Will Father Tim fall apart when he takes his vows? Will Cynthia make it to the church on time? Who'll arrange the flowers &amp; bake the wedding cake? And will Uncle Billy's prayers for a great joke be answered in time for the reception?Reading A Common Life is somewhat akin to enjoying a flashback episode of a favorite television series. While the story is enjoyable, I was left wanting. My only wish is that Jan Karon will continue forward with the Mitford series &amp; the tales of Tim &amp; Cynthia &amp; their extended family."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This wasn't one of Jan's best efforts. But I think she just wanted to have something out &quot;between books.&quot; I'd sure recommend reading Hickam's Coalwood books in the meantime - October Sky and The Coalwood Way - better in a lot of ways than Mitford!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Any faithful reader of the Mitford series could have written this book. I love the first five books in the series dearly and highly recommend all of them to everyone. But, A Common Life: The Wedding Story is not in the same class. There is precious little really new in the book and the writing doesn't look familiar. Perhaps it is because of the various view points. However, that approach could be interesting and give us new insights into the supporting characters. But, it gives us very little.We love you Jan and we'll be waiting for book 7 (and 8 and...)."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"For anyone who read the other Mitford Years books, this one fills in the gaps about the wedding of Cynthia and Father Tim. It actually is very quick reading, easily read in a night or two. I love all the Mitford Books. However, I always missed the important parts that she leaves out between the books, such as the wedding. I was thrilled to finally see how Father Tim and Cynthia were wed.There is something very genuine and soothing about her writing. There is nothing of nudity, cursing or immoral behavior that is found in so many books. Her writing is relaxing and truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"This is NOT a book. It is a novella at best and as that, it is not that bad. The type setting and such stretched this out a bit in size, but if it had been printed as a real book it would have been thin indeed. The writing is just ok...those of us who have loved the Mitford Series have been waiting so long for this litle window on their world that we lapped it up without too much complaint until we realized we had been had. We loved to have our characters back and we laughed and cried at the few things of interest that occur, but at &quot;the end of the day&quot; as people like to say these days, we are left with the thought that Jan Karon is out of ideas with the people that made the Mitford series great. This should have been in the fourth book and would have taken two chapters. To publish it as a long awaited 6th book at full book prices is an insult to her readers. I hope we will look at the 7th book that she is obligated to by contract with a lot more caution. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Thank you Jan! You said you would write a novella about the wedding and that's what you did. I enjoyed, not only spending special time with Father Tim and Cynthia, but getting to know a little more about the &quot;romances&quot; of some of my other &quot;friends&quot; in Mitford. I am giving a booktalk on this book at two libraries in my area. I have &quot;talked&quot; on each book as they have come out and local &quot;friends&quot; are anxiously awaiting chatting about Mitford once again. Please, please give us at least a few more books."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"A Common Life lacks the delightful storyline and dialogue that characterize the earlier Mitford books. In this book, the writer does not produce the character depth, spiritual tone, and charming witticisms of her earlier novels. I would not have guessed it as the work of the same author. Overall, I was very disatisfied with this purchase and do not recommend it to Mitford fans. It spoiled the series for me. Be content with the other volumes."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Yet another of Jan Karon's wonderful books in the Mitford Series. I would highly recommend this series to anyone. I purchased the series for my sister in the Midwest and every Sunday she and I discuss where she is presently at in the series and discuss the different characters as if they were our own friends or neighbors. We are considering rereading the whole series again. Wonderful reading."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"large print bookusedsent in timely mannerwas in good condition"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"the wedding story has all the ingredients of the other mitford books,humour, deep feelings, tough relationships plus a wonderful wedding. i loved this edition too it was really special. i also liked the fact that the actual wedding day of father tim was full of surprises and tender moments."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Great book. I have all the Mitford books and they were very good. Most ofthem I ordered from Amazon and was pleased how fast I received them andthe good condition they were in.

So freshing."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Most wonderful fiction series I've read in many years! I love Jan Karon's Mitford Season, and can't wait until the next ones come out. The characters have become so real to me, I feel like I've known them all my life. It's hard to find good Christian fiction, which are loved even by those who do not usually read Christian literature, but these fit the bill! I give them for gifts to many."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Another in the wonderful Mitford series - I have enjoyed each up-lifting book! The characters become like family and neighbors; you laugh and cry with each one; and as soon as you finish one book you can hardly wait to read the next."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"While this book was shorter... it was nevertheless a great story! It is well worth the money and time!Mitford is the kind of place that we would all love to live.... a slpeey little town in the mountains where you know your neighbors. I recommend buying this book... and curling up in your favorite chair with a warm blanket and cup of hot chocolate! Turn the phones off and slip away... I guarentee that you won't want to come back!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have loved all the previous books in this series but was disappointed with this one. It didn't have much plot or story line other than \\"they get married\\". The other books had so much more depth, drama and character development. Any drama that might of been present was taken away by the fact that the book is out of place in the series. Anyone who read the earlier books already knows what happens in the marriage, in Dooley's life and the other story lines."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"As with the ones before it, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"A COMMON LIFE\\". I look forward to her last book of the series coming out in Nov. I just hate to see the series end."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I just received the book and haven't even read it and am VERY DISAPPOINTED. I too, as so many other readers, was expecting this book to pick up where the last one left off and not a re-hash of something that happened in her other books. I do hope that Jan Karon receives some of the reviews that have been written so that she knows her readers are expecting something new and current from Mitford. I was so anxious to get this book, I didn't pay attention to the reviews. If I had, I would not have ordered it!!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"If I could return this book, and receive a refund, I most certainly would. How disappointing to find Karon resorting to an adolescent review of the marriage event. This indicates to me that she is out of material, and has given us this poor substitute in lieu of a true sequel. Unfortunately, this too often happens when an author has enjoyed financial success with previous books. They start to churn out dribble that has dialogue that even a thirteen year old would find laughable. Oh for the days when an author only published a work that reflected work, not speed. I will not buy any more of this author's books. Based upon this latest &quot;effort&quot;, I see that she has nothing left to give that is worth my money."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Was looking forward to the release of this book. At first I was confused. Why would Jan Karon re-do the wedding like it never happened? I found &quot;A Common Life&quot; by Jan Karon very disappointing."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"The Mitford books have affected my life in such a positive way, and I felt somewhat cheated after finishing this book a day after starting it. There was little plot, and while the character insights were nice to read, there was nothing to hang on to, nothing to go back to time and time again like every other Mitford book. I've read the series many times over the years when I'm feeling down or needed to be inspired, and this is one volume I'll skip in the future."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book, even though I knew it was not the next one in the series. I knew it was to be a book about the wedding, but I am really disappointed and surprised at the 'lack' of story. I have to agree with fellow reviewers; the short pages and the margins make it appear as a 'short story' rather than a book. For the price, it is very deceiving!! You can easily read the book in a little over an hour's time. Although, it was nice to be with old friends again (Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Emma, Uncle Billy and Rose, etc.), they only appear in very minor ways. I want my Mitford friends back! I want the strange ending of A New Song wrapped up and let's go home to Mitford for the next adventure in the series. This book seemed like it was just written on a whim without much thought put into it. I'm a huge Mitford fan and have loved every book in the series; I am really disappointed in this one."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I was so disappointed with this book that after the first chapter I returned it! I'm insulted that one of my favorite story tellers would re-write and attempt to sell what she already sold!"},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"I have read all of the Mitford series. Although lacking in depth and true depiction of life, they are pleasant books and have some nice Christian messages. I am very disappointed in &quot;A Common Life&quot;. It didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know. It also treats a sexual relationship between husband and wife as an embarrassment. It's silly to think that an older engaged couple would dread the discussion of marital sex with their bishop. Describing their sigh of relief and profuse blushing at the brief statement mentioning &quot;lovemaking&quot; was ridiculous. The complete exclusion of the couple having any physical life at all was disappointing. I do not like books packed with illicit sex. However, healthy married people do have relations. Hinting at that important part of a newlywed's life, and the adjustment to that lifestyle, could have been done tastefully. Instead we are given a victorian view of a beautiful, God-given gift. In other words, let's pretend sex does not exist. Cynthia and her &quot;dearest&quot; ( gag ) having a sex life is not the embarrassment here, Jan Karon's unrealistic portrayal of human nature is the true shame."},{"Title":"A Common Life (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","review":"Like the last two reviewers, I purchased this book on the strength of the previous Mitford books. This book is so sappy and lacking in plot that I will think twice before buying the next installment in the series.
