If you had to read one book then it would have to be this. The very concept of delving into the mind palace of a 'monster' such as Dr Hannibal Lector is exquisite. Harris not only shows the reader some eerie background history to this most unique of villains, but also leaves the reader with something to consider at the conclusion. The end, for me, is brilliantly evil. Even though Starling may appear to be safe, one can not be quite sure whether Lector will not change his mind and use that cross bow of his. Starling will always (as does the reader) have that lurking fear. For me, inviting Paul Krendler 'for lunch' was just amazing. Harris knows how much we (and Clarice) hate Krendler. It therefore seems utterly fitting to gain 'our' revenge on him in the manner described. The ends do justify the means in this blinding array of plot and action. Mason Verger turns out to be seemingly just as evil as the thing he tries to catch. And the added bonus of F.B.I politics adds to the ever growing struggle that Starling goes through to try to reach her goal.One must also bere in mind the very title of this classic. By plainly calling it 'Hannibal' the reader is now on first name terms with Dr. Lector and thus become ever closer to understanding him as such a unique character. In the previous incarnations, the story never wholy revolved around the doctor. But with each installment of the Lector series, we gradually come closer into the fascinating world of this gentlemanly villain. Many have argued that by revealing Lector's past we are losing a mysterious edge to his attraction. Not so. I find that it is even MORE frightening that we are given the privilege to go inside such an horrific mind. And so, even though we know how he thinks, what his tastes are and of his fantasies, we are still drawn to sympathise with the Doctor. Is that not frightening?Within this fantastic novel, Harris explores everything that western society holds as its supposed morals and tastes. Of how we are lured by voyeurism, relatively relaxed at shocking things. Harris pushes the reader to the limit of acceptance. Those who merely disregard the scenes of graphic violence and horror as simply unecessary are missing the point entirely. Are we shocked at what we read? If we are then Harris has finally found something atrocious that holds our attention. Feeling sympathy towards Lector? Sick as it may seem, it is possible, and Harris succeeds in bringing it out in us. That is the measure of the man! We regard our society as civilised and progressive. Harris shows that in many ways we are (through the character of Mason Verger) just as barbaric as the seemingly 'primitive' behaviour of Lector. Western society should look in a mirror once in a while.Overall, never have I read a book that played with my mind as much as this did. A stylish, almost gothic novel such as this even manages to drag (as already mentioned)some sympathy towards Dr. Lector. A book that can accomplish that is superbly crafted.I Know that in parts I did not want this fiendishly good villain to perish, I was over joyed that my wish was granted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has the ability to say terrible things and present horrific images with a verbal delivery so &quot;deadpan&quot; and swift (in its economy) that for the reader it is like being raped before we realize any of our buttons have been undone. The author's &quot;neutral&quot; stance on inter-species and human cannabalism, for example, can only be seen as a great comic vision that &quot;this too does not really matter.&quot; Harris, the ironist, identifies God (p.256) as the great sadistic ironist whose games of human cruelty pale into insignificance Hannibal's own little predations. This realization comes to Dr. Lecter as a six year old, after seeing the baby teeth of his cannabilized sister in the stinking feces of her anonymous human predators. The final &quot;dining scene,&quot; so finely wrought with its elegance and utter sophistication, once again is best understood as comic -- given the incongruity of the highest &quot;cuisine aesthetic&quot; juxtaposed with the gentle feeding on a living human brain. Dr. Lecter's ruthless and powerful seduction of &quot;goodness&quot; (Starling) is greatly aided by the ever-presented documentation that the universe is unbelievably cruel, arbitrary, or at least profoundly uncaring. That the fully trained and brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, knows this (as does the author) is his only redemption. The refined feast of evil presented to us in such an orderly and dispassionate fashion in this novel is the comic cover for the dark, limitless, and terrifying process of entropy that we as readers are allowed to apprehend only from a distance."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris ties up all sorts of loose ends in this frightening, satisfying, and surprising work. Of course we want to know what went into the making of the demented genius, Hannibal the Cannibal. How could we leave him, and Clarice, without knowing what is to become of them? Therapy for the therapist, release of the true personality, removal of masks both perceived and hidden, true heroism... Harris is excellent at developing characters according to their own inner truths. I wish he would write more ordinary mysteries, however, with tidy little murders in them. Sometimes the &quot;ick&quot; factor gets to me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Perhaps the screen play will be void of the lackluster plots Harris has used in this novel. I must admit that I was a true fan of the Silence of the Lambs piece and was expecting much more with Hannibal. For me, it was not near as appetizing!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"liked the pigs thought that was unusually well done. I'm also a writer and wish I was as good at narratve and dialogue as he is. But EXCUSE ME, the ending was ridiculous!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The characters draw you right in. Dr. Lecter becomes our anti-hero evoking abhorrence and sympathy at the same time.

A very compelling read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The characters draw you right in. Dr. Lecter becomes our anti-hero evoking abhorrence and sympathy at the same time.

Without a doubt it is absolutely the best book I have ever read in my 20 years of avid crime and thriller reading. I waited for years for this book to come out and every minute was well spent! My only big disappointment is that I can't wake my husband up to put the fire out! Thank you so much for your excellent craft. Sincerely, amateur writer and Avid Fan..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As I did not read the first in this series,as most, I saw the movie. But as I read this, I was spellbound, I couldn't put it down! Mr. Harris kept the suspense going, never letting us know what Hannibal would do next. Also, Mr. Harris' knowledge and discription of Hannibals surroundings gave the reader the impression that the reader was not a reader, but a true onlooker to Hannibals maddness. Also, the technique that Mr Harris uses to allow us to &quot;Get in Hannibals Head&quot; was amazing! Of course, the last chapters will shock everyone. (At least I was!!) READERS RECCOMENDATION: Dont read this late at night with only one light on in the house!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris stayed with his &quot;delicous&quot; and &quot;intriguing&quot; characters all the way to the end. Without letting our appetite &quot;down&quot;. Thank you Mr. Harris. If I had to add something of an &quot;untasting&quot; critic, it would just be about Starling's unlucky episodes almost all the way to the end. The women in your novels don't have enough &quot;spice&quot; in their lives... that's all folks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know this won't be a popular review but when Hollywood puts this to film, I sure hope they come up with a better ending. Fiction or not, I couldn't buy into Lecter's personna as I did with &quot;Silence...&quot;. You get the impression that Harris got writer's block 3/4 of the way through and that the only purpose of the ending was to lend itself to another sequel. Way too wordy at times. Harris inconsistently goes from third to first person narrative. Interesting but disappointing read. Little if any substance to Starling's character. In fact, there were too many characters, several of whom the story could easily have gone without! Perhaps Hannibal Lecter will go the route of Rocky Balboa. Hannibal IV, Hannibal V....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to admit that I wanted to like this book. My first reaction after reading it was disbelief. &quot;What happened?&quot;, I thought. Then I realized what this book really was. Thomas Harris obviously disdains the popularity of the first two Hannibal books. It seems that he wanted to make sure that this book was a curveball, from the one-dimensional new villans down to one of the most laughable endings in literary history. He wrote a book that could never, ever be made into a film. Perhaps he felt his characters had been taken away from him. Don't worry Mr. Harris, it won't happen again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is very well constructed and a good read. However, very few people will be satisfied with the ending (As most of these reviews seem to already indicate). Without giving anything away let me just say this... Hannibal (the character) is a monster and we cannot expect him to behave against his nature (most people accept this). But Harris has violated our collective view of Starling and this creates the anger that you see in these reviews. I can understand what he was trying to say/do but I cannot help but feel betrayed by the fact that Starling was not able to avoid (or rise above) the weakness that destroyed her own father."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Oh, I don't know, maybe I over-anticipated after anxiously waiting all these years. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, those books were read in one day and re-read over the years. So far, not the same with Hannibal. Good points to this tale are the obvious research put into the life of Hannibal in Italy, but for the most part, the other characters have yet to make me give a hoot. Reading some of the other reviews here make me wonder if I'll even bother going the distance. (Oh, I will, but will probably regret it.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really WANTED to like this book, but I don't think it lives up to the previous works in this series. What I liked best about Harris' previous work was his cool detachment from the (ghoulish and horrible) characters and events he was describing. This detachment is nowhere in evidence this time around, with the second person intervals and his obvious affection for Hannibal. When Salon Magazine synopsis for 'Hannibal' I thought it was a hoax...surely Thomas Harris wouldn't deliver such a far-fetched mess! Alas, I was wrong. I enjoyed the book, but it feels like it was written by someone trying to mimic Harris' work without possessing his gift for elegant prose and (usually) seamless story lines. A sad disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I would like to know who MR HARRIS'S editor is because I can not blame a reclusive autor for believing he has created somthing worthwhile but surely a writer relies on his editor to just tell the truth.So let me do it.MR HARRIS this book is terrible. Your initial opening reads like a bad action movie. Your middle section is reasonable . You should have maybe based the entire book in Europe . But........oh dearie me where did you get your ending from. It is absolute tosh. I found myself laughing through the final 10 chapters and I presume this is not the reaction you were looking for.But hey you're rich and I'm not.You created RED DRAGON . Now that was good.Please buy all the copies of this book back from the general public and have them pulped.Ay Carumba Mr Harris what were you thinking about."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Afer reading this sequel, I feel that Mr. Harris has stripped his characters of their former selves. I am still left unsatisfied as to what makes Hannibal Lecter 'tick' and Clarice has become nothing but an empty shell. The ending was absolutely horrible and a real sell-out for what I've always thought were really interesting and moving characters. This book lacks the psychological tension and suspense from Harris' previous books. Mason Verger was boring, his sister - the typical sidekick, and throw in a couple of thugs - you have your cast of characters. The only one that added any new insight was Barney.Sorry, Mr. Harris - I think I would of been better off not reading this sequel. Compared to your other novels - this one was like having to eat bad airplane food, when you know you can enjoy an exquisite boxed lunch instead..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"On Page 459 of this slapstick horror fantasy, Dr. Hannibal Lector is trying to decide on a flower arrangement. Thomas Harris writes: &quot;He could see that he had too many flowers in the room, and must add more to make it come back right again. Too many was too many, but way too many was just right.&quot; Here in a nutshell is the book's misguided formula."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was a fan of Red Dragon long before Silence of the Lambs made Hannibal Lector a household name. That book still ranks among my top ten favorite novels. I enjoyed the second in the series, although not nearly as much, but I was really looking forward to reading Hannibal. I don't know why, but I had hoped that this book was going to be the tale of how Lector became a cannibal and about his eventual capture by Will Graham. Unfortunately, very little of the dynamics behind the root of Dr. Lector's madness are revealed, and there is no mention of Will Graham anywhere (significant mention anyway). Don't you think Will would have been one of the good doctor's first victims after he was released? Still, I decided to give Harris the benefit of the doubt and continued to read. It wasn't a hard book to get through, but it spiraled so far into unbelievability, that by the end I was more than disgusted. I realize that Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector are Harris' creations, but I felt that by the end of Hannibal he has them much too far out of character. The changes in person were pointless as well. I don't usually review books like this, but this time I felt compelled to warn people. I'm always the first in my group to read new books, and I'm telling all my friends not to bother with this one. If you have to read it, by all means wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed. The writing, plot development, and especially the charater development, is inferior to Harris's other work. I am glad that I got it at 50% off."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris did as good a job as anyone could do in following up &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. But I wish he had done what I did in preparation for this book. I reread &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, just to update myself on Dr. Lector and to be able to move smoothly into the sequel. Harris apparently failed to take another look at his previous novel. There are several discrepancies in details which detract from the sequel's credibility."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started Hannibal on a rainy Sunday morning and finished it the same day. Thomas Harris' latest novel is a captivating, imaginative book that is difficult to put down. Its content is often gory and dark but it is all along illuminated by beautiful, poetic language, interesting details, complex characters, and skillful storytelling.Days after finishing this book, the story and its brilliant ending are still giving me food for thought. An interesting, satisfying read that will give both the occasional and the passionate reader an exhilarating literary experience. In this reader's opinion Hannibal's value far exceeds its price."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found Hannibal to be well written, captivating and thrillingly lurid. The attention to detail is remarkable and speaks to exhaustive research by the author. I give special credit to Mr. Harris for taking the risk to end the book the way he did: while it seemed plausible, even logical, to me, I can understand how some readers will find it a point of contention. This book is clearly above the average and is well worth reading.Given the above, why not a higher rating? First, Conan Doyle was writing engrossing and highly descriptive tales of crime and detection over a century ago. Second, and more importantly, the story, while undoubtedly suspenseful, offers nothing new. For a truly profound, thought-provoking exploration into what makes a person commit unspeakable criminal acts, one from which insights will continue to be drawn, everything pales by comparison with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I dropped everything to read this book. The story of Mason Verger and his pig procurers is so richly detailed and depraved it practically stands on its own, almost overshadowing the main story.I appreciated Hannibal's character more against the backdrop of his childhood. All through &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I kept wondering how such monsters are made.Clarice Starling was given short shrift in this sequel. Harris writes about her in a flat and one-dminensional way, leaving her uninteresting and weak.I was very disappointed in the ending. I, along with those who will admit to it, was very curious about where the obvious mutual respect and interest would take Hannibal and Clarice, but the ending was totally unbelievable; worse, it tainted my opinion of the rest of the book because it was so outlandish. I was so underwhelmed that if a movie is truly in the works, I won't be seeing it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started reading Harris late, I only read the novel of Silence Of The Lambs a few weeks prior to the movie opening. I loved it and have read it three times since then. Immediately I purchased myself a copy of Red Dragon and loved it as well. When I heard of this novel I was excited to say the least (at the time it was titled The Morbidity Of The Soul and after reading the novel it would have been more appropriate)There is little possiblity I see here for a movie unless they reduce the middle of the novel to a few scenes or less. The scenes in Italy throw the flow of the novel out the window. I commend Harris for the work he must have put into some places but theres just no structure here. All the waiting I did to hear more banter of Lecter and Starling never came. To say I was disapointed would be an understatement. These are just my own opinions of course and you are all entitled to your own.I'm not even going to comment on the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"EXCELLENT!!! Great book! Not only do we have a perfect plot, dialog, descriptions, and ENDING, but we get some great recipes. I can hardly wait for the movie and the next book by Harris. THank you Thomas!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris takes you on a journey that is unimaginable. This book makes Silence of the Lambs seem gentle. As I read more and more, I could feel myself tensing up and scared to read on, yet afraid not to. If you get wrapped up in a book when you read, the way I do, then I guarantee that you will be in for a treat."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting such a long time to read this book I was very disappointed. Had this book not been written by Thomas Harris I believe it would have gone totally unnoticed and unread. His previous books had you turning the pages as fast as you could to see what was going to happen next. The tone of this book was very weird and I kept wondering: OK, when will this start? There is very little action involving Clarice Starling and all of a sudden we are expected to see Dr. Lechter as a romantic idol? This was totally BIZARRE and just AWFUL. What a waste!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am so glad I didn't put one red cent in the hands of Thomas Harris for this piece of drivel he probably wrote in one day. I have never been so disappointed in a book. The novel seemed to have been written by a different author about different characters. Where is the strong Starling we all loved and cheered? Where is the creepy Hannibal? Shacked up in South America? I don't think so!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris catches us up with the life and times of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling and leads us down the path towards a conclusion that's guaranteed to keep the reader on pins and needles the whole way. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment for a couple of reasons.First, the writing aspect. I expected a better crafted, well-written story. Harris switches from a traditional narrative pov describing the story, it's actions, etc. (e.g.- John Doe walked through the cathedral, wondering what lurked in the shadows [not words from the book] to the present tense (e.g., He walks through the cathedral, he wonders what lurks. . .). I found it distracting and confusing, and continually re-read earlier sections to see if I had missed the entrance of another narrator. Second, it seems that in an attempt to preserve or perhaps redeem the character, Mr. Harris' attempt to resolve the story was greatly contrived and was nowhere close to any of the possible resolutions he leads the reader to consider. A touch of &quot;deus ex machina.&quot; In short, I felt let down. If and when a movie is made, I hope this will be changed.On the positive side, however, up to the point of resolution and ignoring the distractions described earlier, I enjoyed the character development and was drawn into the various scenarios, especially those of Verger and his sister. It was disappointing that more was not done with Jack Crawford."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"10 year sabbatical for Harris brings nothing forth here. Can't believe how bad it is - serial killer books now are an effort to make the next book even more &quot;over the edge&quot; in creative gore. Don't even bother to get this trash at the library (where I did). A waste of time and a crime it was written and published."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book starts off strong and stays suspensful all the way through. There are some graphically disturbing scenes scattered throughout the book, seemingly more vivid than his previous books. The ending seemed not believable and somewhat contrived."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What happend? Good God, I've been waiting in eager anticipation for this book ever since finishing Silence ( which I believed to be better than Red Dragon, although many disagree with me). The book was simply ludicrous. The stuff with the killer wild boars was laughable...as was Lector unscrewing a skull and eating from it. His relationship with Starling didn't feel right either. The set-up in Europe was nice though."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I bought Hannibal I knew what I was expecting. I knew what I thought I could reasonably expect given the genre and dictates of story. This would be the third part of the Silence of the Lambs/Red Dragon saga. It would be well written and a part of the same tradition. I had always been impressed by Mr. Harris's brilliance but I was not expecting something completely original. What happens in this book with these characters is something I never expected to see in commercial fiction. So I'm at a strange loss-- Did I like the book? Yes. Was it a good book artistically? Yes. Do I recommend the book? Yes-with caution. This is not comfortable fiction of any genre. It's not pushing the edge of the envelope it is outside it. Not for the faint of heart, mind or stomach. It is nothing like you have ever read before and if you are starved as I am for something new and different Hannibal is a welcome treat."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Do not let the naysayers put you off this book. This is one to read for yourself. Harris is a wonderful writer, and Lecter has to be one of the finest characters of modern fiction. Given all this richness, its beyond me how people can dismiss the book because the ending does not fit their prejudices."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I remember New Yorkers rushing out to bookstores the week Silence was released. Harris with Red Dragon had completely set the standard for this genre, and we weren't let down. Hannibal reads like it was written in the last few months, and Harris has obviously lost it. Bad storytelling and ludicrous ending, such a letdown."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My wife and I pre-ordered HANNIBAL from Amazon in hardcover, something we almost never do. That's how much we wanted to read this. Well, we've read it and we're in agreement--Thomas Harris blew his readership a HUGE raspberry.Short of posting a major spoiler I can't go into detail, but the ending totally contradicts everything we know about Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Harris has ruined one of the most perversely fascinating student/mentor relationships in literature--and it's clear that this was a deliberate choice on his part.Clarice Starling's once-promising FBI career has, in the intervening years, gone down the &quot;Mulder track&quot;. At the mercy of all-male superiors who despise her for being (a) female, (b) too willing to speak her mind, (c) unwilling to sleep her way to the top, and (d) female, she's reduced to &quot;loan-outs&quot; to BATF and other scut jobs. The portrayal of constant on-the-job sexual harassment is so heavy-handed that it could have been written by Katherine McKinnon &amp; Andrea Dworkin, and Clarice's inability use solving the Buffalo Bill case to secure herself a spot in Behavior Science strains credulity.When Lecter, after a silence of seven years, writes her following a botched BATF-FBI raid, her former mentor Jack Crawford is able to wrangle her a spot on the Behavioral Science team at last. But it turns out that a former Lecter victim with wealth and influence, Mason Verger, is also interested in capturing the doctor--so he can feed him to his specially-bred man-eating hogs(!).Most of the reviews have pointed out that the middle of the book is its best part, and I'd have to concur. Seeing Lecter going about his (legitmate and otherwise) business in Florence and later the U.S. is undeniably fascinating. So is the two-pronged hunt, as Lecter proves an elusive and resourceful adversary. But any goodwill the midsection generates is completely blown by the outrageous ending.For the record, the book's as well-written as any of Harris's previous novels, though more episodic. But ultimately, this is a sour end-of-the-millenium work, and a profound disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did not expect what I received! Hannibal is pure entertainment and a &quot;can't put it down book&quot;! Thomas Harris is amazing with his characters and their development! Mason Veger &quot;almost&quot; gave me nightmares! Clarice Starling continues to evolve her humanity - what strength and insight! I can not wait for this to be a movie, and only pray that they keep &quot;to the book&quot;! Plus bring back the &quot;orginal cast&quot;! Mr. Harris may take years to write a book, but I just hope that this senior citizen is alive to enjoy the next one as much as Hannibal! Good work! I would recommend this to anyone who want to sit, have a great adventure, and often shake their head in amazement, with occasional little shudders!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"--and maybe that's why I don't feel at all disappointed by Thomas Harris' long-awaited latest. I found it immensely satisfying-- good, creepy, highly literate fun. Unlike most of my fellow readers here, I thought the ending was perfectly in keeping with what we know about the characters and their relationship.After an 11-year lapse, it's easy for fans to get way too emotionally invested in a sequel. I think that that's what's happened with the reactions to this book, but I don't share that attitude at all. Harris made some fascinating choices here, supplied some grotesque moments on the far edge of believability, and did it all with wonderful, evocative prose (notice the creepy effect he gets by mixing a sudden first-person-plural voice into the normal third-person narration? It's like suddenly finding the narrator standing there behind you).No, I think that this book is an absolute artistic success, and, in response to one reader in particular, eminently filmable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone who enjoyed _Silence of the Lambs_ and/or _Red Dragon_ will find it impossible to enjoy _Hannibal_. The book is populated by loathsome, repulsive characters, and those characters from the first book who do make an appearance (excepting Lecter) have been fundamentally altered. The stong and resourceful become nothing more than puppets to the predators who take center stage for action of the novel.Leaving violations of the writer's craft aside, _Hannibal_ is a repulsive, revolting book. I am not a squeamish reader; in fact, I enjoy horror--even of the terribly graphic sort. I don't object to books that disturb me. However, I object to the glorification of evil and the attempts to justify (and get the audience to cheer on) monstrous and perverse behavior. I object to whole rationale that people who are victimized have the right to victimize others._Hannibal_ is as disappointing as it is distasteful. If there was a way to assign it a negative number of stars, I would have."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had nearly given up on Harris' return to the crime-horror genre; I'm glad I did not. What superb imagination and craftsmanship! Not since Hemmingway has someone written so ingeniously and so convincingly. &quot;Hannibal&quot; will certainly be made into a film, just as the highly unlikely and hugely successful, &quot;Silence...&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal, by Thomas Harris, is a good read. Harris includes some fascinating and educating information about the city of Florence, which is one of the main reasons why I personally like the book. The plot of Hannibal is stable and well thought out, but is not as fast-paced as two other novels by Thomas Harris, The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. In Hannibal, Hannibal Lecter, a mad man who plays a part in both The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, is living relatively peacefully by himself in Florence, Italy. The story's plot begins to thicken when two different people, with two different motives, enter into a quest to find him, each wanting to get to Hannibal ahead of the other. The main character of this novel would have to be Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but Clarice Starling and Mason Verger come in as close seconds. Dr. Lecter is portrayed throughout most of this book as a highly intelligent man who is just very particular in his needs and doesn't seem to be bothered by stepping on, or killing, those unfortunate people who happen to be in his way. The ending to this book took me by surprise because it was entirely different than I had guessed it would be, however, it is consistant with Hannibal's character. Hannibal Lecter constantly does things that people normally don't do, like eat human livers and/or brains, so the ending, which confused me at first, actually does makes sense. After reading this book, I would love to travel to Florence. Before reading Hannibal, I didn't know much about the city of Florence, but now, after learning something about Florence's interesting history, I think that it would be a great place to visit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For those nights when the weather keeps you in, when a fire and a good book sound like the best way to spend the evening....use this book to start the fire and then go find a good book to read!! If you do decide to work your way through this one don't finish it....this book has a few pretty intriguing story lines but doesn't deliver. It almost seems as if there were two authors, Harris seems to have started the book, whoever finished it should be just that....finished!! I finished it out of morbid curiosity and then gave the book the burial it deserved....the garbage. Too bad I don't have a fireplace...it would have made great kindling!!! I give it negative five stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book, put simply, is my favourite book of all time. It is a roller-coaster of psychological suspense and then some. It covers so many topics that it defies description. It is a stroke of literary genius. I would recommend this to anyone, period. Elegent, compelling, original.

The ending would have been more interesting if she had to weigh her inner feelings with how she felt about Hannibal and how to incorporate her thoughts into doing what was right.

I can't deny that parts of it were nice and thrilling but every thrilling scene in the book was cut short very quickly making me stop and think about what really went on. I was expecting the book to take me on vivid dream and help me construct more detailed scenes in my imagination when it came to the thrilling parts, but it only did so in uninteresting parts explaining things in staggering details that are truly unimportant and uninteresting to the kind of reader who would read such book! Who cares about the rooms in Lectare's mind or whatever that was!!The ending is a great disappointment. When I finished the book I really got confused about what he meant, accusing myself of not understanding the ending, but when I read the reviews here I discovered that I didn't miss anything! Bottom line is, I'm really disappointed. Every good novel has a rewarding conclusion that emits a joyful sensation into the reader's mind. I was expecting so with this one, but got REALLY DISAPPOINTED!If you want to read something nice, don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Nearly everyone has expressed how dissapointed they were in this effort by Thomas Harris, and I would be merely echoing their sentiments if I were to talk about feelings of betrayal and unforgivable (and inexplicable) changes in characters. I think there is a group consensus about the way Mr. Harris chose to close this novel. It seems lazy...Which brings me to what I am really upset about. Though there is exquisite detail about Florence, animal husbandry, art and many other varied topics, and the pace is fairly quick, and the action exciting - his style of writing leaves a lot to be desired. It is a serious departure from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. What concerns me most is his bizarre shifts in point of view. In one instant, he writes as an omniscient narrator. In the next instant, Harris writes &quot;We see...&quot; as if the reader has entered the novel as a character. This is very distracting. Especially since this happens sporadically, and for no reason. It reads, in these sections (most deal with Lecter), like a screenplay - as if he were leaving a lot of the details up to a director. I can't help but think that this is no accident.&quot;Hannibal&quot; reads like a first draft. Where was the editor? Was this a lazy effort, written only to rake in the dollars from selling the rights for a screen adaptation? Perhaps Ridley Scott will do a better job than Harris himself. This may be the one case where they change the ending of the book for the movie (which I have heard *is* the case) and the movie benefits from it.One can only hope, for Sir Anthony's sake. Jodie was smart to stay away. Kudos to her for having taste."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i was in england on an educational tour when i bought this. it was worth buying it because it gave me something to do on the 15 hour flight home. the book itself is alright. the details are nice, but i agree aren't totally necessary. the ending was terrible and made no sense. i commend Jodie Foster on not taking this role, because the movie is going to be terrible, and the ending reeeeeeeally irritated me. even thought the ending is no good, the rest of the book makes it worth a read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Three quarters of the book was enjoyable. The interactions among the cast of characters and their single minded pursuit of Hannibal were quite fascinating and believeable. The most disappointing aspect of this book was the unbelievable and extremely disturbing resolution to the story. Surprise endings can be good, but they need to fit the picture drawn within the book. This ultimately missed the mark and jumped to an ending that just didn't seem possible based on what we knew of the characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was my first, and last, Hannibal Lecter book. I heard great reviews about the other two books, Silence of the Lambs, and Red Dragon, so I decided to give this book a try. I found nothing special about this book. The only interesting part of this book is learning about the character Dr. Lecter, and his unique ways. Besides that, everything else is average. There are many parts of the book that I mis-understood and found highly dubious, such as the ending. Thomas Harris should've explained and clarified Clarice Starling's actions, but instead he expects the reader to assume the reasons for the events happening.This book is also dull and tiresome the first 250 pages. It's not as thrilling and page-turning as the critics say. Many of the characters are irrelevant to the main plot, and are only there to build up tension towards the ending (Krendler, Barney, Pazzi). I also found parts of the book predictable, even though the ending was ambiguous.A reader that has read the two previous books, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, may enjoy this book more than I did. But if you haven't read either of those books, I don't recommend reading this one either."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The author had an opportunity to take his character...Hannibal...from his previous SOTLs and write perhaps the novel of the decade. Instead he daudled in the inner-workings of the mind of the killer and lost the plot almost entirely. This book was certainly not up to his previous efforts."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While Mr. Harris has a great ability to bring to mind very graphic images, often without fully describing those images, it's not enough to write a great book. My expectations were far too high after reading SOTL. The beginning of this latest book was excellent - it captured my interest immediately. The rest of the story went along fairly but began to bog down. My biggest complaint was the end. It seemed as if Mr. Harris had written enough and said to himslf, &quot;Okay, time to end this one.&quot; The ending is just too far-fetched for for me. The characters seemed way out of place in their roles. I don't wish to give away the ending of the book, but I'll say that it was not worthy of the rest of the story. I was extremely disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Major problems with HANNIBAL. I've read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS many, many times, and I'm wondering how Harris and his editors could deviate so far from the &quot;truth&quot; as SOTL knows it.In the 13th (coincidence??) chapter of HANNIBAL, Clarice refers to the floater she fingerprinted in West Virginia (SOTL). She says, &quot;...when we did that floater in West Virginia. What am I saying, 'floater.' She was a person named Fredricka Bimmel...&quot;WHAT??? That floater was NOT NAMED FREDRICKA BIMMEL! The W.V. floater was Kimberly of the glitter-painted fingernails; Fredricka Bimmel was the FIRST victim, the only one weighted, the one Jame Gumb coveted, the one whose house Starling visited in Ohio and whose darts made Starling realize what Jame Gumb was really up to.How could Harris have such poor command of his material, and how could any editor worth his salt allow such a glaring error to remain in print? Am I the ONLY one who notices such things?Anyway, like I said, this was in the 13th chapter (the book has over 100), and it was all downhill from there. I am sorely disappointed.I think I'll go curl up with a Diet Dr. Pepper and SOTL and sulk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read SOTL and was looking forward to reading the next installment. Hannibal is slow, self-gratifying, and the ending is completely ridiculous. If they decide to make a movie of this, I hope they hire a very good screenwriter with a new red pen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People who were expecting another serial-killer Hannibal episode like Cornwell regularly spews forth another Scarpetta are going to be disappointed.Harris takes a radical left-turn (&quot;left&quot; chosen consciously - may right-wingers beware) away from conventional &quot;thrillers&quot; to serve up a banquet of black comedy about American culture at the dawn of the new millenium.The book is a horrifying, shocking, chilling portrait of a tabloid culture gone nuts and a society armed to the teeth (pun intended). A political satire of a society ruled by its worst, most voyeuristic instincts and dragged down to the lowest common denominator by mindless bureaucrats, dimwitted opportunistic politicians and the &quot;damp floor of the Internet&quot;.Harris opposes Hannibal - that ultimate in elitist bad-guys - to the riffraff of contemporary villainy and discovers that, as villains go, Hannibal is something of a noble savage.I'm totally seduced (and hope not to be abandoned as well). Encore! Encore!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What starts out as an exciting hunt for a serial killer on the loose ultimately degenerates to James Bond fantasy. Lecter goes from being a really, really ugly human to something akin to SuperHero. Of course, he never runs out of money, or out of luck. He is stronger than almost everyone he meets. He kills people cleanly and neatly in the middle of a crowded street. Why not strap him to a metal plate that is being cut in half by a laser? You know he'll get out of that one. No, no, no! Strap him to a big log that's being cut at a lumber mill. Wait a minute, how about having him blast off into space to hook up with his evil genetics experiments... Obviously, Thomas Harris enjoys doing his research in Buenos Aires and Florence more than rural Ohio and Louisiana. What the heck, who says a serial killer can't be chic?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a big disappointment. When I heard this book was due out I couldn't wait. Now having read it i'm trying to forget it completely. Not only were most of the situations contrived and unrealistic, but to make a mockery of Clarice Starling is a sin in itself. Shock ending, not nearly as shocking as the boredom that leads up to it. It's almost predictable. Harris wrote this book for Hollywood and it shows. The ruination of such great characters is unforgiving, but someone out there likes it ... I've already returned my copy due to pure disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is simply awful. I have read many of the reviews on here, and fail to understand how anyone can promote this book as a great read. The Florentine descriptions were somewhat informative (roll over Baedeker) but felt more plodding than necessary for the book. I read one reviewer on here warn that your &quot;dreams and nightmares will never be the same&quot; . . . puhlease! The fate of the victims in the novel seemed as horrific as Wiley Coyote being hit in the noggin' by an Acme safe, cartoon writing at its ???best??? The ending was perhaps the greatest disappointment. I don't expect an ending that is necessarily neat and tidy, but the outlandish denoument of this book is beyond comprehension, and certainly outside of the characterization Thomas' originally created in Clarice. He makes clear at the very end that the &quot;hypnosis&quot; and drugs no longer played a part in the transformation (regression) of Clarice, so she apparently was deemed to be acting, at that point, of her own free will? (Not to mention, I was always of the understanding that a person under hypnosis will not do anything which they would find repugnant while in a waking state . . . ) So, was Clarice a monster just waiting to hatch??? Thoughts to ponder? I think not; enough time was wasted on this drivel already. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have been reading random samples of everyone's reviews and it seems to me that many people's expectations were not met. Personally, I fully enjoyed the book and absolutely loved the ending. The way the story ended satisfied what I wondered throughout Silence of the Lambs and even while reading Hannibal. I try not to have expectations about a sequel because expectations are most surely built up and broken down.I have now read all three novels involving Lecter and without question, Hannibal is my favorite. Like the title suggest, the book is about Hannibal, not Lecter or Starling or even Verger, but Hannibal - the person he is, how he thinks. It revealed the personal side of Lecter, a side which we never saw before in previous works of Harris'.Harris has a wonderful gift of words - truly I am in the crowd that enjoys his elegant words and descriptions of places, things and people. As for the book itself, one has to wonder who really is the monster in this book? Hannibal? Mason?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So many years after &quot;Silence&quot;, maybe I expected too much. But I feel that in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Thomas Harris doesn't stay true to the characters he created. First he kills off John Brigham, then Jack Crawford. Then, as if that weren't enough, Clarice's entire personality gets a remolding. Granted, some mind-altering drugs were involved, but still...the denouement was extremely hard to swallow (pun intended). I found it a cheap, sexually-oriented ploy worthy only of Fred Chilton, not Clarice Starling. We are supposed to LIKE Hannibal now? Like he's just a misunderstood guy with continental tastes, and the rest of us poor plebes couldn't possibly understand? The &quot;gore&quot; that is so hyped is of the variety that just gives me the rolling-eyed, &quot;oh, right!&quot; rather than the creepy, skin-crawly, heart pounding, horrified sensation that the even more violent &quot;Silence&quot; gave me. And Barney seemed a noble character in &quot;Silence&quot;, now he's just a con artist and a thief? Tsk! The descriptions of Florence are exquisite, but don't make up for a facile story. Conclusion: a long-anticipated, but terribly disappointing book. Clarice, we thought we knew ye!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoyed reading it, was swept up in the story early. The parts in Italy were very good. Somewhere in the last third, the story started to go awry. I don't know what the ending was supposed to portray...Clarice Starling was completely out of character. All in all, the book was entertaining, but alas, a little disappointing. I am not looking forward to a movie, afterall."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was an odyssey! I have to say I loved it. I read it in about a day and 1/2. Exquisite in it's craftsmanship, dark, confusing, seductive, twisted...just the way I like 'em! I *do* feel like the ending was a tad disconnected, but it was too much fun for me not to like it. But, all in all, I haven't so thoroughly enjoyed a thriller since Silence of the Lambs itself! Oh, and as a side note, I loved the lecture on Dante's Inferno. Gotta love that Dante."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know what took Thomas Harris so long to write this book. He had to bribe Danielle Steele to finish the last three chapters!What a goofy book. Someone, please tell Mr Harris that he has no future as a romance novelist. And Hannibal as a movie? Well, only if you can get Fabio to play Lector, Charo as Starling and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie playing Margot.Yes, folks, a comedy!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Hannibal I was convined someone else wrote it. I think Mr. Harris needed money and time was running out. He paid someone else to slap this together before deadline. It is that bad. The plot was pathetic. I was bored to start with but hoped it would get better. It got worse! The Barney and sister thing was ridiulous. Tom Harris may have suffered from writers block. I could have come up with a better plot."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr. Harris has managed to foist upon his readers a work that, while taking place in what must be a parallel universe, manages to have no, absolutely no, characters with any redeeming qualities. His characters are distinguished only by their monstronsity and the degree of their veniality. I suppose this sort of thing appeals to those who enjoy cheap horror films but I feel cheated out of the price that I paid. A shame, I enjoyed &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is without a doubt the BEST book that I have ever read. I read the first 99 chapters non stop but then put it down for about two weeksbecause I didn't want it to end. I thought maybe I wouldn't finish it and wait for the film.I just couldn't wait anymore and I washappy that I didn't because it left me with a smile knowing that there has to be more to come. Please don't wait another seven years I couldn't stand it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I expected something dark, gritty and maybe a little gory. What happened was a lot of &quot;brainless&quot; violence, a strange story and an ending that is too screwed up for words.I'd say pass..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I tought that Hannibal was a thriller and a great book to read. Plenty of gore and it kept me on the edge of my seat the hole time I was reading it!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A horrible, unbelievable ending to a grotesque story. I wish I hadn't read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If, a year ago, you or I had submitted a manuscript such as &quot;Hannibal&quot; to Delacorte Press/Random House, we'd probably gotten a reply from one of their editors suggesting we'd seek professional help. But, hey, this book is by Harris... slice'em, dice'em, savor'em Harris. He probably spent his royalty checks sampling European deli counters and growing both his pt&eacute; repertoire and his waist line. And that's OK... that's the book publishing business. If Hannibal doesn't meet expectations, and it didn't meet mine, then perhaps we ought to analyze our expectations. What on earth are we thinking Harris would do for us?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book kept me very involved and interested. It didn't contain as much gore as Silence of the Lambs. I was very pleased also that it didn't scare me so much I couldn't sleep! The ending was a little unbelievable but if a sequel is in the works, it will be a humdinger! The ending was certainly a surprise!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had waited with baited breath for the sequel of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Hannibal. After I read it, all I felt was an intense amount of disappointment. What happened? The book had a alot of promise, but that promise went unfulfilled when the book became very sappy and the ending felt contrived and hard to stomach. Great potential, that somehow got lost in the shuffle to get the book on the market."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't put it down! This book is so suspenseful I stayed up all night reading. I can definitely see this being made into a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A waste of your time. The central characters are reduced to caricatures. Might make a good low budget slasher script if converted to a screenplay. Antagonists are laughable parodies. Starling's character is reduced to a wan empty husk. Lecter as Lothario, I don't think so. Suspension of disbelief is virtually impossible. Spend your money on a nice bottle of Chianti to put you in the mood, and then reread SOTL or revisit it on video."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sequels have always seemed in poor taste to me. Until HANNIBAL. Harris has given readers what they wanted. They wanted to know more about Hannibal and he tells them. Maybe he shows them a little too much, maybe he throws a bit too much caution to the wind, but all in all, if one reads it for Hannibal, the writer comes through. Even though, I don't agree that the childhood trama would likely explain the mind of a monster like Dr. Lecter, (there should be a genetic factor), it serves to show a little of what he and Starling have in common: both are orphans. Dr. Lecter is fascinating as a brilliant psychiatrist. It is his genius in psychiatry, his crystal clear insight that thrills me and especially the way he used drugs (professionally) in order to control and actually teach Starling to deal with her father's death. And, in his connection with her, Hannibal heals himself. So, how does one become infatuated with a cannibalistic killer? Acquaint one's self with Hannibal. First, read RED DRAGON, then SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Top it off with HANNIBAL. If one reads it for Hannibal allowing Starling to take a backseat, HANNIBAL will come off like the finishing touch dessert at a four-star restaurant. No? Then, try slopping some hogs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris usually gives us a fast paced, rollercoaster ride through the dark side of the human mind. This story is rough in spots and doesn't flow as well as The Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. However, if you are familiar with the characters from the movie or the book you will not be disappointed. It's alarming, creepy and keeps you turning the pages well into the night."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As I read through the many customer reviews of the novel, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, I am struck by the overall disapointment in the author himself, Thomas Harris. It would not be easy to top &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; (the novel, NOT the film!) and Harris falls short of that little masterpiece with his latest entry. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book. I also tend toward disapointment toward not dwelling more on Dr. Hannibal Lecter himself and not the repulsive Mason Verger. Maybe, Mr. Harris, you could write a prequel involving Dr. Lecter's many &quot;adventures&quot; before being locked in the dungeon asylum in Baltimore. I still recommend this book to anyone interested in evil and it's many domains."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The last 40-50 pages ruined this book. While 'Hannibal' did not have the magic of the previous two books, it was entertaining...until the ending. Harris destroyed two wonderful characters by having them become something they are not. I was so furious after reading the ending that I threw the book across the room."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I started reading 'Hannibal', I couldnt put it down. When I had read to the middle, I began proclaiming that it was the best book I had read so far. Then the ending came and left me thoroughly dissapointed. The build up of the intertwining lives of Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling, Mason Verger, his sister and all the other characters, though well developed, did'nt deserve to be so abruptly cut short as they had been in the totally unexpected and ridiculous ending that they recieved. It was very apparent that Mr. Harris did alot of research and took great pains to make this book as realistic and believable as possible. Then it seems he simply got tired of it and wanted to get it over with. Bottom line: You will absolutley love this book if you read it and stop at the last chapter and leave the rest to your imagination."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At long last....this? While I must admit to near incoherence the next day at work (possibly due to staying up waaaay past my self-appointed bed time again and again in the course of one evening), I must also admit to confess the bitter disappointment that accompanied the hurried and somewhat lackluster ending. You can do MUCH better, Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, so it's the weakest of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, but it's still a mesmerizing read...never dull, often shocking. The gore factor is high and disturbing, but a guilty pleasure nonetheless. Unless you're prepared for a nightmare or two, not the book you'd want to read at bedtime."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I still am awe struck. Thomas Harris out does himself. This is by far the hands down best book of this genre I have ever read. You can toss in all those statements: bold twists, tremendously exciting, electric plot, almost painful suspense, etc., and you don't even come close to how wonderful 'Hannibal' is. The book is like great...Chinese food, after thirty minutes you've gone from totally satiated to hungry for more. While Thomas Harris 'tied up' the 'ends' of his 'Hannibal the Cannibal' books, he magically opened up new avenues for future writings on these too-fabulous characters. Please, Thomas Harris, let there be more!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While it's true Clarice was short changed, Hannibal was filled out. This was his book. The title is Hannibal, not Clarice. His was always the more interesting story. Any guy who eats the \\"free range rude\\" is alright with me. Yes, Harris turned Hannibal from one of the most repulsive characters in literature into almost a hero. More power to him. It takes some skill to take the honors away from the one character, a good, honest FBI agent and a woman at that and hand them over to a cannibal. The story is scary as [heck] too."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While it doesn't live up to Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a very good novel for those of us who like reading about demented serial killers. In fact, one could argue that Hannibal would work better as a stand-alone piece than the third installment behind RD and SOL. Mr. Harris, another commercially successful Mississippi born writer, raised the bar impossibly high with his first two efforts. Anything less than brilliant and starkly terrifying, alas, Hannibal is neither, would be a disappointment. Not only was it merely very good, versus great, real Lector fans, like me, will object to the direction he takes as a highly cultured fugitive after all these years as a psychopathic cannibal. Despite the negative reviews, I enjoyed Hannibal and would recommend it to readers of this genre."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While there is little doubt that Harris succumbs to the dark side of commercialism in this third incarnation of Dr. Hannibal Lechter, it is nonetheless a seductive and riveting read. Written by a less accomplished author, the material would be merely disgusting - Harris, however, succeeds in painting an engrossing canvas with his gore, creating images that are repulsive yet strangely irresistable. I found my self not wanting to turn the pages, but unable to put the book down. Part of this is due in part to Harris' imagination in creating horror so unique, so bizarre, and so totally over the top that it cannot be ignored. The imagery of being eaten alive by wild pigs, for example, is so vividly portrayed that the scene continues to haunt nearly a year after I've read the book. This is not a believable story, nor a literary achievement, and it is certainly not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. But if you've got the stomach, and enjoy a well-written work of raw horror, forget the critics and give this demented tale of \\"Ms. Manners does cannibalism\\" a ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Truely Dr Hannibal Lecter is one of the greatest of all 'villains' (or should that read 'heroes'?). A man of learning, culture, and exquisite taste, who also happens to be a killer who enjoys whetting his palate on sumptuous delicacies culled from parts of his victim's anatomies. Most readers will already be familiar with the character from the film versions of Harris's novels. In Hannibal, Harris draws us deeper into the life of Lecter. No longer incarcerated, it is fascinating to see how the doctor uses his freedom. What is more, we also gain insights into his mental life, his past, and his fixation with 'earnest' FBI Agent Clarice Starling.The plot runs thick and fast. Harris writes intelligently and subtley, creating a (perversly?) captivating web of horror and intrigue. His characterisations are excellent, there is humour, pathos, and mystery. All the great things about this book are absent in the film, which makes you wonder why the film-makers bothered at all. Perhaps the question remains after all: is the ending of the book plausible in terms of Starling's character? I'll reserve judgement until I've read Silence of the Lambs. Either way, the ending will suprise and delight(?) readers who enjoy ambiguities and strange, but not entirely unpleasant, tastes in the mouth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"more graphic than the movie - not for light reading, but a great fast read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the best books in publication. Harris keeps you flipping pages in utter suspence. I could not put it down. It is a very nice compliment to Silence of the Lambs. If you have not seen the movie, please read this book. You will not be displeased."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Moving away from his usual \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" formula for novel writing, as Harris used in both the SOTL and Red Dragon novels, \\"Hannibal\\" is something much different. I will not dispute that Harris was probably saying \\"I dare you to make a movie out of this\\" when he wrote it, as it's gruesomely violent elements would have been more than a little questionable if represented on screen exactly the way they played in the book, but that's what makes this book interesting; The fact that someone can go and see the movie's adaptation, then come back and read a very different story in the novel. It's refreshing to see an author who isn't afraid to stray away from the 'righteous hero pulling through in the end and conquering evil' formula. The ending may be unexpected, and frankly wrong in some people's eyes, but in the end it is only the author who can say how the characters would act. \\"Hannibal\\" is ambitious and intriguing, though vile and disturbing at times. But, who could expect less from a book named after a mass serial killer/cannibal?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"On one hand I'm DELIGHTED that hypocritical moralists(are there any other kind?),ever careful to be seen as decent individuals, while taking pains to mask their petty evils-jealousy, greed, selifshness(common to all),squeal in outrage of a book so comfterable with man's repressed dark side. On the other hand the book fails because Harris wants to tell a story, and thumb his nose at people who eat up(so to speak)[junk] like World's Bloodiest Car Chases, and even-especially-his books. Had the social commentary been weaved more gracefully through the narritive line, I wouldn't have a problem.Unfortunately this conflict of goals is never adequately resolved, and we're left with something that reads like the lost first draft of an aborted Fellini movie.Props for it's irreverent wit, and intelligence, though. Even if it doesn't satisfy the public's moral sense(inadvertantly falling short of Aristotle's principles for story telling as epoused in his Poetics), it manages to be both entertaining, and informative, feeding us fascinating tibits of historical trivia enlightening us even as it slams us for loving it.Actual rating: 3.5It's an aquired taste, and definitely not for everyone. Puritans stay away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really loved this book because it focuses more the person behind the monster- you see Dr. Lecter as a human being, his regrets, the things that please him. The business with Mason Verger is simply a storyline, around a novel to better aquaint us with the good Doctor. The ending is sort of a surprise, but it does leave us with a sense of closure. While people who enjoyed &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; for their fast-paced excitement might find it dull, I think that most anyone else who reads it will enjoy it. This book is not about Lecter the Madman and Cannibal, but about Hannibal. The title says it all. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's no wonder why everyone who was involved in the movie Silence of the Lambs is passing this on (Jonathan Demme, Ted Tally, Tak Fujimoto, and even Jodie Foster). Let's face it. This book stinks!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sorry, but I side with the nay-sayers on this one.It starts off so promising, with Starling's fall from grace, the inroduction of a villian as evil as the Bad Doctor himself, and a really strong plot strand set in Florence.But then it devolves into voyeurism, camp melodrama, and Jacobean silliness that ultimately crash lands on an ending so preposterous that no amount of psychobabble could justify it. If Harris was ultimately trying to marginalize the characters he established with such clarity and vigor in the first two books, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in &quot;Hannibal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so anxious to read Hannibal prior, but now... This has to be the most disappointing experience in my life. Ok, overstatement. Nevertheless, I would rather have not spent my money on this book. Paperback, yes... I'd rather read instructions on how to use a chia pet. We're all critics, aren't we?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I realize this is fiction, but even so the story is unbelievable - and unbelievably awful in content. I found myself grimacing through much of it - not a pleasant way to spend an afternoon reading. Red Dragon and Silence were fine reads. This is horrible."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment! I, along with so many others, anxiously waited for this book (pre-ordered on Amazon.com, of course). What a waste! I am no stranger to thrillers, but the gory detail was so intense it was difficult to slog through. The worst part was the ending; the Clarice Starling we respected from the first book never would have done what she was written into at the end of this book. Not only an absolute waste of the reader's time and money, but an insult to the quality of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is trying to shock us with \\"Hannibal\\". It's clearly his mission. But by the end of the story it numbs us so much that the effect is lost. The story is suspenseful from beginning to end; it's a good read and was very hard to put down. Harris sets us up so well, though, it's almost impossible not to feel let down by the final plot turn.The story is vividly told and gripping. I felt as if I was in Italy; the description was so rich I could clearly picture each scene. This detail makes the story compelling and gives it the patina of authenticity. I really felt Harris - and, by extension, Lecter - was an expert Italian scholar. This reassurance unravels as the book moves forward, however. With elegant bravado Lecter bluffs his way into a hospital and steals a very esoteric medicine chest, but what he is able to do with these drug combinations seemed implausible. It planted a seed of doubt and made the whole book less real.Clarrice is ostensibly the hero, but she isn't. Lecter is clearly the hero, really the anti-hero as hero, which is nothing new. The story has no moral value or message. Who's the good guy? Do we care? Do we really empathize with any of these characters? Perhaps Harris doesn't mean for us to do so, which is shown in Clarrice's fall from her middle-class values at the end of the story. Is this meant to shock us? It just left me shaking my head in disbelief.This book has an unabashed pretentious quality about it. It revels in it! It sweeps the reader up in its tide for quite a while. I will never feel quite the same way about sweetbreads, I suppose, and I enjoyed the book. Nevertheless, I think I would have enjoyed it more had it not tried so hard to top itself and, of course, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While very excited about reading the next in the saga of Hannibal Lecter, I was somewhat skeptical of how good the book could truly be, knowing how poor sequels can sometimes be. I was wrong. This book was excellent. It takes you deep inside the mind of Dr. Lecter, at one point it had me looking over my shoulder in fright. The only disappointment is the ending. It leaves readers somewhat confused, asking themselves why. Otherwise it is a pleasure to read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I originally stumbled across Red Dragon in 1982 when I moved to St. Charles, MO about 1 mile from Highway 94 as described in Harris's original novel with Lector. The book was mesmerizing. Silence of the Lambs, though not as taut, still provided a good read. Hannibal was a fast but less than satisfying read. The characters were shallow, the story not believable, and the ending .... give me a break."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a truly excellent book. It sustains a feeling of uncertainty throughout the whole book and you don't know what's going to happen next. It is almost impossible to put it down due to the suspense created. A great read which you'll really enjoy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is so bad it makes me never want to read anything ever again. The writing is at the level of an only mildly witty third grader, the plot is clunky, to say the least, the jokes unfunny, the horror un-horrendous, and the end feeling is one of distance, complacency. If Harris's taste for olla podria really had kicked in, we might have a cultural curio on our hands. Instead what we have is a mean, insulting, biggoted, racist, homophobic book that might as well have been written by a computer. Word is that Harris has been writing HANNIBAL for the last ten years. Hey, come on, Tommy, more like TEN DAYS! The best thing about this book is the acknowledgements page, which reads like Nancy Drew on acid. Next time, Tommy Harris, maybe you can write your own book, do your own research, your own cooking. Oh, and the second best thing about this book is that, at least for now, it won't be made into a movie. But then again, if it is, the movie will be infinitely better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After building Hannibal Lecter to such a mythic enigma in Silence, how could Harris possibly follow suit? Perhaps the long intermission between the appearance of that book and that of Hannibal indicates Harris' struggle with this question. He certainly didn't use the time to improve his writing style, which in it's current deevolution consists of cramming Ian Fleming-esque cataloguings of empty cultural tidbits into chapters which are hacked into public-friendly small pieces, while self-explicating much of the information he lavishes for an audience too lazy to open a dictionary.As for plot, even if the average reader succeeds in not anticipating the direction of the story, he won't be surprised, let alone satisfied, at his discovery. What's left, then? Oh, yes. Back to character. Bringing Hannibal the Cannibal back down from the lofty heights of inscrutable and indestructable monster to the realm of ultimately vulnerable (and perhaps even sympathetic) antihero? A daring idea, and the premise of the novel. Unfortunately, not even Harris can pull it off. Lecter is revealed to us in the light of contemporary pop-psychology, where every problem can be traced back to a single traumatic event. He is just another victim of his past, though one who has developed some remarkable adaptations to deal with that past. Clarice Starling, for all her indomitable will, is hamstrung by a run-of-the-mill Electra complex, forever at the mercy of a succession of men. The last of which is Lecter, and this is probably the most shocking aspect of the book. What does Harris mean, having Starling come so far only to leave her subverted indefinitely to the will of a predator? Does he think this ending will satisfy Hannibal Lecter's rabidly adoring public, perhaps even translate into a Beauty-and-the-Beast romance?While Harris again proves he can build exciting scenes with the best, the methodical, lean, plot-driven story of Silence is replaced in Hannibal with a mean, hollow, tunnel-visioned, and doomed attempt at character development. No wonder Jonathan Demme didn't want to touch it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe I waited so many years for this half-assed lamely plotted book. I reject its existence and revert my Mind Palace to Clarice Starling's graduation from the FBI Academy. I end the story there, as if &quot;Hannibal&quot; never existed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not going to wreck the plot for others, but I now have strong suspicions that Harris may have ransomed his soul to write =Silence of the Lambs=. This book is THAT ridiculous. The ending alone is reason enough to save your money and buy something worthwhile, like the Star Wars novelization.Seriously...I cannot believe that Harris actually wrote this and expected it to be taken as the legitimate sequel to =Red Dragon= and =Silence of the Lambs=. It's nearly as gory in spots as =American Psycho,= features perhaps the most ludicrous &quot;romantic&quot; couple of the decade, and has an ending so stupefyingly bad as to leave me shaking my head.I can't go on. I just can't. My one hope is that five months from now Harris will publish the *real* sequel, the way that Coca-Cola withdrew New Coke in favor of the real thing. What a waste of time and paper!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe I waited 10 years for this crap. T. Harris should have is liver eaten with some fava beans and a bottle of warm genaric beer. A waste of time. Reread Silence or Red Dragon, both much, much better. Supposedly T. Harris got 9 million for the film rights. He is stealing money. If a movie is made that sticks to the storyline of this book, it will not make a dime. I would much rather see The Red Dragon remade into a movie that is faithful to the book. Too bad J. Demme did not do this one too. Micheal Mann's Manhunter(Red Dragon) was just an OK cop movie. I am not surprised that J. Demme dropped out directing the Silence sequel. A long wait for almost nothing!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Is there a cooler villain in all of literature than cannibalistic Psychiatrist Hannibal Lector? In my humble opinion, no. After scene-stealing turns in Author Thomas Harris' previous two books (Red Dragon & The Silence of the Lambs), the good Doctor takes center stage in his own book, Hannibal.To get the comparison out of the way, Hannibal the book blows Hannibal the movie away. I purposely put off reading Hannibal until after I saw the movie (Tough to do, considering I was on line at the bookstore before they opened the day the book was released!); I thought I'd enjoy the movie more that way, and I'm glad I waited now, because if I had seen the movie AFTER reading the book, I would have hated it. The movie is like the Reader's Digest version of the book. They both follow the same plot, but the rich tapestry Harris weaves with his prose just can't be captured on film. (Plus, the film cops out at the end, opting for a more sequel-friendly finale.)In Hannibal, we find our murderous gourmet abroad in Florence, Italy, living the good life. Soon he's the center of a worldwide hunt that involves a disgraced Italian Cop, a hideously disfigured former victim and his pumped-up sister, and Hannibal's former nemesis, F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling. When Starling is put on the F.B.I.'s hit list, Hannibal puts a daring plan into action that can only end in violence. And a VERY special dinner......As in the previous two Hannibal Lecter books, and his excellent first book, Black Sunday, Harris is a masterful wordsmith; His prose is absolutely elegant, even when describing acts of incredibly grotesque violence, of which this book has no shortage. (I consider myself pretty jaded, and I must say that I was VERY disturbed by a lot of what I read in this book. I treasure any book that can bring out such a strong reaction in me.)His characters, from Hannibal and Clarice right on down to the most minute supporting player, are all vividly rendered and three-dimensional. Aside from the straight-arrow Clarice, who is actually the most bland character in the book, there's really no one but Hannibal to root for. The book is populated by unrepentant scumbags like the faceless pedophile Mason Verger and the shifty Paul Krendler, so seeing the way Hannibal draws them all into his web and serves them their just desserts is quite entertaining, and more than a little cathartic. The book's ending is miles apart from the movie's, and I'm still haunted by the last line. Hannibal is an amazing read, and is probably one of the top ten books I've ever read. Bon Appetit, Dr. Lecter!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I've been a fan of this series since Red Dragon, and was excited to read this novel. But it seemed like little effort was made to stay true to the characters. Clarice's character seems to be acting younger than when she was a student, and at the end of this book I thought she was a joke. I'm still angry that I spent so much money buying the hardcover version when it was first published."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Many readers hated this book, Stephen King felt it was the best of the series, my opinion comes closer to King's. This story is less sensational than Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Those are great books each but they essentially tell the same story--unique FBI agent needs Hannibal Lecter's iside info to catch a serial killer on the loose before he kills again. The purpose of this story is to let us into Hannibal's mind--literally. Harris is able to make Lecter's flawless memory, super-developed sense of smell, and his love of cooking both fascinating and chilling. The ending (changed for the movie) is much better in the book. It offends many people but, after Lecter's escape at the end of Silence, this ending takes his success to the ultimate degree."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First, let me say that Harris' descriptions of Italy are top-notch. I would not be surprised if tourism in that country picked up a hundred fold due to the impact of this book. Second, this book starts more powerfully than any thriller I have ever read. I feel so sorry for Starling--and so angry at the selfish tabloids and the racial situation in this country and the presence of sexism, etc. Third, Lechter is again seductive in this book, but scarier this time: he is brilliant and quite, totally mad. And the pigs--oh, what a great device! The only problem with this book is the disappointingly contrived last fifty or so pages, in which both Lechter and Starling act completely out of character. No, he would not try to seduce her. No, she would not try to save herself by exposing her body to him. The Lechter that Harris showed us in 2.75 books might not actually KILL Starling, perhaps, but if she escaped death it would be through a cynical, though noble, GESTURE on his part as he did in the previous work. Since she DID save his life earlier and now he has her life in his hands, he would allow her to escape with a warning: &quot;Don't try to follow me, and I won't follow you.&quot; That is the extent of their relationship, you see: mutual trust and a spirit of fair competition. Not romance. No, no, no."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How does one reinvent the wheel? How does one create, a la Praxiteles, a character as realistic and engaging as Hannibal without becoming a victim of the audience's expectations? Indeed, how much does the reading public own of a franchise and how much control does the author have a right to exert before betraying widely held expectations?These are questions that will no doubt be debated as long as stories are still published and HANNIBAL will often be brought up as both point and counterpoint during these arguments.In the case of HANNIBAL, the reading public is forced to make a choice: Would they prefer to let the chips fall where they may and be grateful for Thomas Harris's latest (and last, it appears) Lecter novel or do they legitimately have certain proprietary rights? Harris is a pragmatic enough individual, I would guess, to not give a damn what the readers think, as long as they continue buying his books. The story's been told and it is as good as cast in stone.If the reader rightfully expects that Harris's narrative gifts have not been atrophied in the ten-year hiatus since SILENCE, then they will not be disappointed. The Florentine historical asides are welcome and provide a tight elliptical sense of justice that befalls Pazzi.The pacing will not disappoint the reader, either, unless they're accustomed to 60,000 word Mac Bolan slam bang shoot-em-ups. Since Harris is such an immensely talented writer, even the straight action sequences (I'm thinking primarily of the Drumgo bust gone bad) are better written and structured than many written by those who specialize in it.It will also surprise the reader that they will find themselves rooting for the captive Lecter and hoping that Starling will rescue him from the pigs. This is largely because the true villain in HANNIBAL, Mason Verger, is a creation borne of true literary genius. This is a character, a pedophile, who reduces underprivileged children to tears with a few malicious comments then drinks their tears in a martini glass. Such iniquity we cannot picture Dr. Lecter indulging in.If one expects to find answers regarding Hannibal's provenence as a serial killer and cannibal, then, once again, this story will not disappoint. One finds themself completely absorbed in the flashback scenes in which Hannibal Lecter's sister is killed and cannibalized (backstory that's completely ignored in the movie, unfortunately). Far from robbing Lecter of his mystique, this serves to enrich his character. Not providing a logical psychological explanation for Lecter's unique protocol would appear to be a dodge.But if the reader expects that Lecter will continue killing as he did in the good old days, with Starling once again helplessly wondering to where he'd escaped, then the reader will run up against a wall. This is the bone of contention.The now-infamous dinner scene, portrayed with a fair amount of fidelity in the movie, gives us some elegant but cheap laughs and the weirdness only escalates in the closing chapter in Buenos Aires, when Agent Starling's subjugation is complete. One feels that Harris felt himself a victim of his own creations and sought to change them as radically as possible and thereby avoiding the onus of writing another Lecter novel. It was a tragic and anticlimactic end to one of the best female detectives in modern commercial fiction. No wonder Jodi Foster, on this basis alone, wanted nothing to do with the sequel. She, too, as with countless other readers, took a proprietary interest in Agent Starling.HANNIBAL ends with possibly the best closing line in this decade but it is not nearly enough to counter balance what could've been an even better book than SILENCE."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has been one of my favorite authors since &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; which ranks among my favorite novels of all time. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was just as compelling, if slightly less vivid. &quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't really live up to either of them, largely because it's an out-and-out sequel (instead of a loose continuation, as &quot;Silence&quot; was). The story has plenty of exciting moments and gory deaths, but they all seem to be there to distract us from the fact that nothing much really happens in the course of the novel. What's missing is the ticking-clock tension of the first two, in which the protagonists have to accomplish something by the end to save lives; it would have been a bit hollow to do this a third time, maybe, but the different bent Harris takes in simply playing out events without any real anticipated climax or continuing tension doesn't work as well as repeating the format would have. Essentially, the story concerns a disfigured victim of Lecter, himself a psychopath, trying to capture Lecter in order to torture him to death; Clarice Starling is working to apprehend Lecter before this happens. The fact that Hannibal is the only victim here deflates a lot of potential tension; whatever the events are we *know* that he will escape, just because it's already been built so deeply into his character.Also, as the title might indicate, we get a more probing look into the inner workings of Hannibal Lecter, with a surprisingly simple explanation of his behavior. We also get a few hints that he is not nearly as controlled or sure of himself as he appears, and that he might be slowly disintegrating, but this is never really followed up. The ending, though not nearly as bad as some have said (and in fact pretty perverse and surreal, a truly Lecter-esque metaphor), doesn't gel with the characters as we've seen them; the Starling we know would never act like this, even after going through therapy. Minor characters, also, get much more print than usual for Harris; this slows the story down considerably at times and makes the entire point a bit fuzzy (it's easy to see why Stephen King loved this so much; he's been doing that for years). Altogether, the inconsistent tone and pace and wildly varying plotline make for an unsatisfying sequel that plays out with a surprising lack of tension. It is undeniably well-written, and has some good moments, but too much of that air of contrivance where you can feel the writer writing as you read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, let me say that if it were possible, I would have given this book no stars. Maybe I was influenced by the Silence of the Lambs movie,but I just can't believe that the characters in this book would do the things they did. I can understand Starling having some sympathy for Dr. Lecter, however, what she did at the end of the book was absolutely out of character for her in my opinion."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having finally gotten a chance to read this book after borrowing it from a friend, I really must say 'Hannibal' was kind of a letdown. I was particularly disappointed in the development (or regression) of the Starling character. Strong and boasting an impressive moral compass during previous exploits, she seems more like a robot in this book. Harris also seems to have gone to great lengths to soften the title character and I often had to remind myself that this guy is a serial killer who likes to eat his victims. One thing I did like was the juxtaposition of villains, as Hannibal can hardly be referred to as the biggest monster of the book. I guess it sets the stage for another sequel, but do we really want it? I don't know."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Absolutely as suspensefull as the other three with a twist. Get through the Italian portion and you have got it made. From there your imagination is taken on a world wind tour of the FBI, and the characters associated with them. You practically get an overview of the first three novels. At times it seems a bit wordy if you know what I mean, but if you stick with it to the end, you will not be dissapointed. THUMBS UP! TIM"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"We would have been better off if Thomas Harris had never written this book. He has taken two exceptional characters and completely ruined them. I guess Harris just ran our of ideas for this one. If you liked &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of The Lambs&quot;, do yourself a favor and don't read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is back and kicking! I consumed the book in one night. The narrative is impressive, and the plot exuberating. Harris proved himself once again. The twist at the end is magnificent.To all the fans of Dr. Lecter, this is a must!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes, the boook is meticulously researched and has Harris' patented dense style of storytelling all through it. Yes, it makes you want to turn page after page in a rush to see what happens next, all the while feeling just a little bit smarter as you make your way through it. Yes, the story moves once you get past the first 50 pages or so, and has some fairly graphic spots. Yes, the gang is all here...but what the heck are they doing!Without revealing anything about the book that would spoil it for anyone out there, let me just say that while these characters looked, sounded and walked like the characters we've all come to know from Harris' books (and the faithful-enough movies &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Manhunter&quot;), the ending spoils the whole, wickedly delightful journey for me. Hundreds of pages of powerhouse storytelling culminate in a dissapointing and totally untrue-to-form ending for all involved, and had I not been a fan of the characters anyway, I would have felt it was total money wasted. It is for this very reason - and not so much the gore of it all - that Jodie Foster doesn't want to do the movie as it stands: the character ends up untrue to what we've been led to believe she was capable of all along.I got the sense that Harris felt as if he: a) was tired of the characters anyway b) didn't want to have to go through the pressure of doing ANOTHER book after this one with these characters c) was rushed (even though it took 10 years to see this one come through the gates) d) was tired of the character Hannibal.I recommend it for fans of the characters/movies, since your curiosity won't let you NOT get it, but beware: it's a great investment of time and energy with little payoff in the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you are a fan of THe Silence of the Lambs, This book is for you. There are a few slow spots and some unessisary rubbish thrown in there, but it is well worth it for the ending. You're either going to love it or hate it, and I loved it"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You can't expect a book like this to please everyone. Harris broke the conventions of the genre novel. Ambiguous in the best sense of the word and, at the core, viciously gripping.Plus, this novel, to use the words of one critic, is not only about Hannibal, it IS Hannibal. The genius behind this novel is that its voice is Lecter himself. At the least it's the voice of insanity. It's the voice of murder. It's the voice of internal decay. It's the voice of perversity. Only on a few occasions, such as the last paragraph, does Harris appear to bring his own apocalyptic view.Different from the author's previous works, but it stands on its own as a visionary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished this book and must say it was a huge disappointment. I have read several serial killer works, both fiction and non-fiction. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is the best fictional serial killer novel ever written. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Mr. Harris abandons the sharp, crisp writing style of his two earlier serial killer books. I found myself reading along hoping the book would get better, but it did not. Hannibal Lecter is the scariest killer ever conceived because of his amazing attributes of strength and intelligence. Instead of writing a truly scary book, Mr. Harris sunk to a meandering story with a ludicrous ending. He totally missed the essence of Clarisse Starling and forgot completely about Jack Crawford. His plot 'twists' were so predictable throughout, that the ending seemed so contrived because the author realized the book was mundane at best. The convenience of Lecter's escape in Italy and then the parking lot scene combine to show how terrible the storywriting really was in this book. After 11 years, Mr. Harris could have really presented an outstanding book. Instead, he presents a book that should be on the 10 Worst List. It is no wonder no one wants to reprise their roles from the previous movie. He has turned the heroes into inconsequential human shells. The very thought of Clarisse Starling's development in the last few chapters is the truly disgusting aspect of the book. Not worth the read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tom, you should have kept Lecter in jail. While he was incarcerated, he was far more creepy and threatening. Once he escapes, he becomes omnipotent, and thus, far less interesting. During the course of the book, we learn that Hannibal Lecter can: read people's minds, hypnotize animals, kill anyone at anytime anywhere in the most complex way with absolutley no forethought, outwit the entire world, flasify any document no matter how complex, speak 18 languages, whip up gourmet meals made of brains, and convince Agent Starling that she's his wife. The lead-in to the last few chapters was great, and is totally ruined by the ending which seems like it was written as an afterthought. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, this book will piss you off! There's a reason why Jody Foster refused to play Clarice in the movie adaptation of Hannibal! Trust me on this one..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Thomas Harris tries to give us the seven-years-later account of all our old favorites from &quot;Silence of The Lambs&quot;. Dr Lecter, Clarice, and of Course Jack Crawford, but time has not been kind to our heroes, and Starling Seems to have made some enemies. Additionally, a surviving Lecter victim has sworn revenge. Perhaps through it all the Lecter Case can be the solution to her problems. The plot is solid, and strong. However, writer Thomas Harris suffers from several things:1. He rambles. I mean the guy goes into all this stuff that really isn't important to the book, trying to sound more intelligent than the hack he is with all this baloney about &quot;memory palaces&quot;, and Dante.2. Present Tense. Past Tense. Active Voice. Descriptive Voice. Harris can't seem to decide, and as a result tends to lecture the reader too much.3. &quot;A book lacking complete sentences&quot;. Using short stupid phrases to describe action scenes gets old REAL fast, unless you're writing a movie script. Which perchance is the only reason this book was written, conveniently aging all the characters since the last movie.This book is a sequel. That's why it sold. Period. If Harris stuck to plot we'd all be happier. The base plot of this book is great, but he just tries to add too much, and it falls apart."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has done a startling thing; he has written a novel that is about it's characters.In so many books and movies these days, it is too easy to see the hand of it's creator manipulating events. It is too easy to discount the events as arbitrary to the characters. It is too easy to pull a \\"surprise ending\\" out of a hat for a momentary thrill, when, by doing so, the creator of the story renders all brain work irrelevant, and the \\"surprise ending\\" defeats it's own purpose.Not so here. Harris is one of those rare writers who is able to let his characters be who they are. Consider: Mason Verger wants Hannibal Lecter tortured and killed. Clarice Starling wants to be a good cop. Paul Krendler wants a seat in Congress. Inspector Pazzi of the Italian Questura wants respect and a decent life. Hannibal Lecter wants to live in the lap of luxury, occasionally eating those who offend him. And Margot Verger wants a child. Sounds simple, doesn't it? It is. And yet by turning these characters loose on each other, they tell a story that is part Gothic horror, part investigative crime, and part psychological chess, in which some characters get what they want, some don't, and some get eaten.A note on the character of Hannibal Lecter: it is a tribute to Harris' writing that he can provide bits of Lecter's past and still not demystify him, that he can give the monster a soul and make us like him while not making a single excuse for the horrible things he does. In fact, it is the lack of apology that makes Lecter likeable. Unlike many people, he has found his place in the world, and if the rest of the world doesn't like his position, he is still not willing to give it up. There is a part in all of us that is able to feel a kind of mean glee, and Hannibal Lecter, more than any character, embodies that part of humanity.Much has been made of the validity of the ending of this book. I believe it fits with the story, and that's all that really matters. Harris simply sat back and let Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling decide things between themselves, and if the solution they came up with is not entirely acceptable to us, well, solutions between people that are not us rarely are acceptable.Clarice and Hannibal, I wish you well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Rarely have I been so disappointed in a book. While Harris has considerable writing skill, this book seemed to be more about his ego than the characters he had developed earlier. It was a &quot;hey, I can speak Italian,&quot; and &quot;hey, I know about fine wines&quot; name-dropping kind of book. The finale was unlikely, unbelievable, and entirely unsatisfactory. Harris rode his reputation to the bank and delivered a shallow effort to his readers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dear Thomas,I have followed with interest the course of your fans' public rebuke.In reading Hannibal, it was apparent to me that Hollywood figures large in your value system.

I only hope that people won't try this at home. So don't try this out! I read the book and I also saw the movie and there a lot of similarities. I wouldn't have the courage to see the movie in the dark, the book was already scary. In short on of the best books I read in English. Thomas Harris has done it again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i was not too satisfied with this one. i think they should have left well enough alone with the last novel,The Silence of the Lambs. one Hannibal is enough. a little boring and out landish in parts, especially the brain part."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is difficult for me to understand the reason for success of this book and excellent reviews it has received (someone has to keep selling, so reviews are the way, too..) I just finished reading it and went out to see if there are people out there who dislike it like me. In my opinion, the book follows a very cheap and primitive violence/shock line - like the worst of American horror movies, i.e. lot of cruelty, made-up perversities and ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT, nor a main idea. Well, this world probably needs washed masses, since believing in what's presented by Mr. Harris really requires no brain whatsoever. By the way, inventing shocking actions (like eating s.o.'s brain) takes very little imagination, almost anybody can come up with something perverse like this. On the other side, to create a purpose for such a behavior, to give it a reason so that reader can believe it is much much harder. So, for me personally, it's not a matter of &quot;having stomach&quot;, I can handle it easily. What irritates me is that there is nothing, really nothing behind the violence depicted throughout the book. And I have not even asked about technicalities, like whether this or that would be possible... It's a sad fact of this world that authors like Harris make millions by writing such trash. I hate to give him another opportunity to make even more money, but here is my suggestion for his new book: it will be about a man who can read hexidecimal(you know, computer code), speaks 48 languages including dead Loothwinian and who makes (by hypnosis) innocent kids kill people and eats them both (this is his own method of climaxing..). The good guy will be a former president of U.S. who gets angry when he is thrown out of the White House due to his custom of ... (insert what shocks you the most) in public places and tries to kill this lunatic PhD man to earn back the fame and the Oval Office.VPB"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the top two worst books I've ever read; its as though the author's aim was to concoct the most abnormally psychotic events that would totally gross out the reader and add an unbelievable ending.

It is easily Thomas Harris' best piece of writing and it is fresh and exciting. The adrenalin pumps through your veins as you turn each page anticipating what is about to happen.

Maybe it hasn't been success, but something's spoiled Mr. Harris, who now wants us to understand Hannibal's inner child. Mushy as an antebellum romance and with Clarice Starling merely a cipher, this book is redeemed mainly by its early sections. Set in Florence, they are alive in a way which contrasts sharply with the cringingly predictible rest of the book. harris's new face expression: &quot;bleed out.&quot; Whenever someone dies, he uses the phrase, resulting in the marriage of slopped editing with disappointing writing and a mystery more tantalizing than the novel's.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris seems more interested in giving geographical and historical lessons in his latest book than any real story developments. Having thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;, I was anxious to read &quot;Hannibal&quot; but came away feeling very disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit, as many readers of this book were, I was a bit disappointed with the second tale of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. Far too much time is spent on lesser, newer characters, and the subplots are just not that interesting. But the ending--WHOA! You can't possibly predict it. It's bold and outrageous. You have to read it over to make sure you really indeed read what you read. It's an easy and mostly satisfying read with a terrific ending. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story moves slowly but does keep the reader interrested. After all it isabout Hannibal or is it? It has extensive information regarding the characters from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and goes into depth Hannibal's background. Harris hinged on almost over informing the reader. I think as areader that we don't need to be lead down the path so to speak when it comesto seeing the story as a whole as intensly as he provided for us. It was at times tideous.But Harris was able to hold us through the book and I have to say that the ending was totally unexpected. Almost to the point that it was not a real ending but an illusion of a madman.I still have difficulty with the ending. No closure and a sequal may not be viable but Harris being Harris I would not be surprised to see one.I would be interrested to see how he would pull it off."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can certainly understand the length of time Harris took to produce this sequel. Obviously the section on Italy took time to research correctly, and his integration of the inner-workings of the FBI and the Justice Department also required in-depth research as well. The question is, why the ending? I am a psychiatrist by training, and, after finishing the book, for the first time, I had to use my training to understand why an author would try to fit his characters into such a preposterous, unstatisfying conclusion. I still don't understand. This novel was a complete let-down. I would not recommend this work to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The film version of Thomas Harris' novel &quot;Hannibal&quot; opens today and so it seems somewhat appropriate to reread the novel and take a stand on the book as a whole and its controversial conclusion in particular. I had heard the Harris would never write anything until he could believe it, which is a useful bit of authorial insight to have while reading the novel. Hannibal Lecter first appeared before &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; as a minor but pivotal character in &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; which suggests that while the good doctor would be around that did not necessarily hold true for Clarice Starling or Jack Crawford. But the conclusion of &quot;Silence&quot; made it clear that there was a significant bond between Clarice and Lecter, such that neither would be able to let the other go. Wisely, Harris does not force the premise. Lecter is keeping in touch and Clarice is trying to track him down, but it has been seven years and nothing is really happening. However, what neither knows is that there is a third party who wants to take advantage of this tenuous connection in the form of the living corpse, Mason Verger. It is these behind the scenes machinations that threaten Clarice's place in the world, even though they are someone dubious actions taken by rather melodramatic characters. Certainly no one in their wildest dreams could have predicted the ride on which Harris takes his characters. Lecter is the title character, but once again the key transformation in the novel belongs to Clarice Starling.&quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; was an exotic figure in &quot;Silence&quot; because he was incarcerated, and with Buffalo Bill out skinning his humps and Dr. Chilton being an insufferable ass, there were better people to fear and hate in the book. The various effronteries that caused Lecter to kill and fillet his victims are not always quite clear in &quot;Silence,&quot; but Harris provides ample justification for Mason Verger's drug-induced self-mutilation way back when. Lecter leaves Mason alive, not just because his punishment is to live with what he has become, but also because otherwise there is no story. As Lecter's only living victim, Mason has a claim on revenge and as one of the filthy rich he has the means to create his own revenge fantasy fit for inclusion in Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot; by having Lecter eaten alive by giant pigs. But for the reader the true villain of the piece is Deputy Assistant Inspector General Paul Krendler, who might be helping Mason track down Lecter but who also take too much pleasure in ruining Starling's career. Krendler is more than Chilton's evil twin because his actions threaten Starling and everything she hold dear, so it is not surprising that he becomes the most particular target of Lecter's final act of insanely inspired appropriate action in the novel.Although it is not as clear in the film version as in the novel, there is a love triangle dynamic at work in &quot;Silence&quot; between Clarice, Lecter and Crawford. But this is more than the heroine caught between the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other, because for each man the conflicting loves of a father for a daughter and a man for a woman are both at play. The emotions between all three are strong even if they are not precisely quantifiable. However, while Lecter is free to roam it is Crawford who is effectively removed from the picture by a heart attack. The problem is that one of the key ironies is that Lecter is more fascinating in captivity. In &quot;Silence&quot; it was his whispering to Meggs all night long and the photo of what he did to the nurse that provide the undercurrent of horror to his conversations with Clarice. In &quot;Hannibal&quot; he does the same thing to some degree only with Mason's sister Margot. The sense of restrained power is gone and in its place we have a Lecter who simply sends his mind elsewhere as he bids his time. Meanwhile, Starling is left in even worst shape as one she is slowly but surely stripped of all support. Her vulnerability is part of a complex ploy to lure Lecter to her side, but it also echoes the climax of &quot;Silence,&quot; where it is Clarice alone who has to deal with Jame Gumb. However, this time she is painfully aware going in that she is all alone on this one, with no clear idea of what to do if and when she rescues Lecter. However, that choice is forever taken from her.At the end of &quot;Hannibal&quot; what we have is not an ultimate meeting of the minds between Clarice and Lecter but rather a perverse role reversal. Through the circumstances of her attempted rescue of Lecter from Mason's plot, Clarice essentially becomes his captive and then his ultimate act of creation. From this vantage point we look back on Clarice's life and see that her psychological struggle has indeed been a search for a father figure and not for a lover. Being freed from the psychological trauma of her anger over his death--as a trained F.B.I. agent she knows that he got himself killed by being stupid--might not make her a suitable lover, but Lecter is clearly more interested in a consort. The objections by those who see the pair of them living out the rest of their lives as a happy couple misses the mark, and projecting a worst case scenario onto the novel's ending is just plain wrong. Under girding this all seems to me to be a desire by Harris to put the characters to rest. There is certainly not as much promise of another story to be told as there was at the end of &quot;Silence.&quot;Starling always proved herself capable of playing by Lecter's rules, but the idea that she could surprise him seems insufficient to suggest while she becomes so important to him. After all, on one level is she is simply the first woman he has seen in eight years. Ironically, in trying to explain Lecter, the author seriously undercuts the character. We find out the &quot;why&quot; behind Hannibal the Cannibal, but in justifying this grand creation Harris takes away a large measure of the mystery and the fear. Explaining Lecter takes away from our fascination. Naming his childhood trauma might create some sort of equity between Lecter and Starling, but in the final analysis the idea that they should or even could be equals is what many readers have been rejecting. By the end of &quot;Hannibal,&quot; Starling has become an empty vessel into which Lecter pours his essence. If this is a perverse love story it is &quot;Pygmalion&quot; with a touch of &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein.&quot; Starling does not live happily ever after with Lecter. By the end of this novel she no longer exists."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the book. Of the three, Hannibal is my favorite. Why? Because in the book we are finally told the reason for Hannibal's predatory facet and the reason is plauseable. Hannibal graduates from being just a one-sided psychotic killer to a dramatically complex monster who can charm and horrify in the same instant. Harris fleshes out Starling's character too--she is now older and more jaded than when we saw her last. The FBI has not been kind to her and her 15 minutes of fame from Jame Gumb is long gone. She relies on her wits and her inner strength to survive a bureau that eats its own.The controversial ending will cause many readers some heartburn, but you have to look deeply into Starling's character to understand it. Starling has been fighting her father's memory, fighting her poor Southern upbringing, fighting for respect and for her life in a job that is so deeply entrenched as &quot;men's work.&quot; And the battle is never won. In the end, Hannibal offers Starling the peace of forgetting, the peace of never fighting ever again. It is an allogorical finale. Starling can wake up if she wants to, but when we leave her at the opera house in those final pages, she is sound asleep. But she is smiling as she sleeps."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read \\"Hannibal\\" after it was first released several years ago, and I approached the book with considerable anticipation, having read and thoroughly enjoyed both previous Harris novels featuring the Hannibal Lector character. There is no question that Harris has improved his skills as a writer although, in the thriller genre, even \\"early\\" Harris is hard to beat.\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" was surely a great novel, and I still have vivid memories of burying myself into some on its most delicious passages while commuting home from graduate school on a SEPTA train back in the \`80's. As I recall, that book struck me not only with its ingenious turns of plot, which were abundant, but with its gorgeous use of language---Harris has an uncanny flare for building suspense through his precise attention to detail and ability to dispassionately portray any situation, however grisly or chaotic the moment may be.\\"Hannibal\\" was a long time coming, and it arguably lacks some of the sleek novelty of its predecessors (it is a long book). On the other hand, it is brilliantly written, and reading Harris' careful prose remains a true joy. In addition, for those people for whom the book's ending appears to have become the focal point for particular criticism, I would humbly submit that, amid this age of comfortably moral Hollywood-endings, Harris' obviously very considered decision to fate his protagonists as he did was a much braver (and, in my opinion, ultimately much more satisfying) choice, and I for one applaud his willingness to follow his characters' path all the way to its dark and fantastic end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hesitate to even call this book a thriller - though it is certainly thrilling - since that word implies a sort of disposable, entertaining-at-the-cost-of-literary-vigor style. To me, \\"Hannibal\\" is a work of art, albeit one that leaves me breathless every time I read even a few pages at a sitting. Harris has a spare yet forceful way of writing that reminds me of watching an olympic athlete at his/her peak: every move is efficient and seemingly effortless, but at the same time you can't help but see and feel the raw power under it all. As with most masterpieces, no review can convince you of how good (or bad) the work is, and I gather from looking at other reviews that not everyone agrees with me about this book. But you should at least *check* the first few pages of Hannibal, because if it's your kind of writing, you'll realize that to miss this book would be something close to a full-fledged tragedy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is something so sinister and unfamiliar to most people with Hannibal Lector - you love him or you hate and fear him. I don't see any gray area there. It's the truly elegant, noblisse oblige gestures and actions on Hannibal's part that lured me in with Silence. I wanted to know who Hannibal really is - out in the open, away from prison and free to make a life of his choosing knowing it may be the last chance he has to live in the world. The descriptions of Florence are exquisite and moving - having been there myself more than once, I thank Mr. Harris for paying homage to this great city and I found no more fitting place to re-enter Hannibal Lector's life. I won't comment on the emotional, sociological, or ethical issues behind some of the characters' choices in this book other than to say in many ways the ending fit very well indeed. Clarice was looking for mate, a partner that knew her, understood her in ways she could not do for herself. While it's dark and scary and based on inherently evil acts I felt the love between Hannibal and Clarice was also based on mutual respect, admiration and humor. How could the story end any differently and remain true to these two characters?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was not really about serial killers and horror, it was about two severly damaged individuals, Starling and Lecter, who seek comfort, soul searching and some mental healing through each other. It's really a psycho-analytical book where the reader along with the main characters discover and open the doors of supressed painful childhood memories that have formed their adult minds. This book was lauded and praised as \\"extremely scary\\", but I just felt horribly sad for Lecter. Not one page scared me. The god-awful thing that happened to his little sister just made me cry. For those who've read the literature on how serial killers are \\"made' this kind of childhood trauma is not surprising, yet so horribly sad, and often starts the mental process of control, revenge and \\"cold bloodedness\\" that is the hallmark of these killers. Of note is that Lecter kills only in revenge or those that he thinks should die. Mason tortured small children so he was killed. Lecter is trying to revenge the real monsters that killed and ate his little sister. It's well written, but nothing amazing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris follows up his Hannibal Lecter trilogy with a disappointing last effort. Having just finished the book, let me share some of my thoughts with you about it: This book is fairly well told until the disastrous ending. For those of you who haven't read it, I won't spoil the ending for you, but the thing that made me most mad was that Clarice just deserted Ardelia without explanation or anything. They were portrayed as best friends in The Silence of the Lambs, but I suppose Thomas Harris thought their relationship wasn't strong enough to survive a serial killer who appeals to Clarice. Now, on the issues of Hannibal Lecter's motives for killing: It really didn't bother me that much that Mr. Harris explained why Hannibal killed, but I think that he only did a half-way job of explaining it, which left me in a state of confusion. Maybe Mr. Harris would've done better if he wrote another book about a serial killer on the loose (besides Hannibal Lecter), which he is famously exceptional at. For those of you who had seen the movie before reading the book, I think that the movie somewhat does the book justice, but in reality there wasn't much for the movie to do justice for. My final piece of advice is this-if you want Clarice and Hannibal to remain to you as they were portrayed so brilliantly in The Silence of the Lambs, then do not read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although the setting of this book was much more appealing than either Silence or Red Dragon, it cant compete on all other counts. Even Rome and its museums cant save this book from mediocrity.The best thing about Harris' previous books were the absolutely loathsome villans, Dolarhyde and Lecter. Here I get the feeling that we are supposed to hope that Lecter will eventually prevail. A bit much to ask considering the man is a psychotic cannibal!! Mason Verger is the best character in the book and Gary Oldman played him perfectly in the film. In fact this entire book seems to have been written solely for the big screen. Man eating pigs may make great cinema but they are totally out of place here. And poor Barney, reduced to selling Lecter memorabilia! Im with Jodie on this one. One of the most anticipated books in years, its just plain disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed by this book, maybe because my expectations were too high, but it certainly is no comparison to Silence of the Lambs. This book was way over the top it was borderline disgusting. While I was reading the first few pages in this book, I was thinking to myself what kind of person could have wrote such a book. I found myself disliking every character in this book, and had great difficulties finishing the gruesome story. If you liked the first 2 books by Thomas Harris skip Hannibal, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Most of the people who do not like \\"Hannibal\\" will starttheir reviews saying they are big fans of SOTL and\\"Red Dragon\\" and then comes a big \\"but......\\".Well, but nothing.You cannot compare those books to \\"Hannibal\\" beyond thein the most trival of ways - some characters are common.They surely don't have to have the same motivations aftera space of ten years?In many ways this is a story about the progreesivedisillusionment of Starling and her final realization ofher true nature. It is about her finding happiness.\\"Hannibal\\" is a way more ambitious book than SOTL andultimately more satisfying too. It is nice to see an authorprepared to let evil win out in the end and have virtue to beso completely vanquished.That makes the ending exquisite - to take a character and havethem end up happy and contented in a life of ( from any rationalstandpoint ), monstrous depravity.And all this stuff about \\"feminist icon\\"? Hmm. Why can't shestill be a feminist icon? Finally emerging as an equal partner?I think all this \\"feminist icon\\" nonsense came from the factthat in SOTL, there were no intruding male characters ( exceptCrawford and he was too old for her ) amd she got to figure itall out and shoot the bad guy.Now Dr Lecter has shown her her true nature and she is not underany hypnotic or chemical influences, she can be an \\"icon\\" again,fully in control, doing whatever she wants, confident and smart.But just \\"playing for the other side\\"."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was probably the best of Harris' books. It was very intense with a great ending. I can not believe the people that are writing some of the negative comments about this book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed with the ending! Agent Starling eating brains? Come on. Mr. Harris made her into a nut case at the end. She's portrayed as strong and independent through The Silence of the Lambs and most of Hannibal and then-Wham! It was so unbelievable. From her rescue in the barn to the opera at the end, the book kind of went off onto another plane."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the plot of Hannibal proved both searing and intriguing, the writing was script-like in nature and, thus devoid of feeling. Climactic scenes and tense moments were left empty without the exploration of the human mind and heart. Though much of the writing was masterful, there was no depth or probing into the characters. Quite a disappointment. Buy this one only if you're mind thirsts for the answers to the questions left from SOTL. I can think of no other reason to spend the money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book has its own life, not knowing what will happen next. Truely a masterpiece. The part I liked about the book was its ending, how Clarice Starling and Dr. Lecter come together. Starling's character perfectly fits her character from The Silence of the Lambs. I loved the book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Certainly the ending of this book was a great disappointment but not because the writing was poor or the ball was dropped with the plot. Those attributes are coincidental. The real disturbing element in this book was that evil triumphs over good. And I mean -- real evil. The descriptions of death and cannibalism border on the pornographic particularly when the main character is given elegance and grace to a level that approaches attractiveness. I wonder when the next serial killer will emulate what he or she learns from this book about eating people. Don't read this abomination on a full stomach and don't be taken in (as I was) by a fascination for the macabre. The plot is predictable and there is little mystery here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was a dissappointment to go through this gripping book forcing myself to put it down now and then only to find out the ending justs dies and sets you up for a sequel you probably won't want to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris should have stopped at Silence of the Lambs. This book was a major disappointment to me. No real suspense, no real excitement. Disappointing ending. They will make a movie and at least the movie writers will be able to clean it up, show some good Florence scenes and make it a fun show. They sure will throw out a lot of the book and just use the name. One star is too much."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can not believe the ending.The book was well written,but the ending was unbelievable.Would not recommend."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is utter trash, a huge disappointment, and borders on psycho-pornography. Harris must of had a screw loose when he penned this poor excuse for a book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The final chapter of this book contains what I think is Harris' best writing in the book. Reading it, I felt as though I was seeing through a delirium, spacey, feverish, in clouded fragments.In the chapter, we learn about the culmination of Hannibal and Clarice Starling's relationship, why they're drawn to each other and how their mutual psychological scars can only be healed this way. (I don't want to give anything away.)After reading that last chapter, I realized the whole rest of the book was a mess. To get there, Harris needed to fill several hundred pages and so we get a meandering narrative where we see what Starling's been up to, what Lecter's been up to complete with some psychobabble about his past, and we meet some really bad guys that we hope will meet a horrible end, and then they do, and BOOM we have the last chapter which is not about anything that came before.On its own, the last chapter really is wonderful, except for the soup tureen.I think Harris might have made himself a sequel in Barney (not the purple one)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone who says they saw this ending comming is full of it.This is the work of a master story teller. Dr. Lecter is terrible, exquisite, learned, madd and pitiable all at once. While the relationships between Clarice Starling and her father, and Dr. Lecter and his sister are a bit overdone; it is the sheer terror of Hannibal himself that moves the story along. The author is able to switch from third to second person, from present to past tense without interrupting the flow of the text. The book isn't going to give meaning to your life or change the world. If that is what you are looking for, read something else. This is just a helluva good read and it WILL send a shiver or two down your spine - which is exactly what a book of this sort is meant to do. Plain fun to read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is no point is trying to criticise the ethics of Thomas Harris' books or the industry they support. However, &quot;Hannibal&quot; despite some good descriptive writing, is not even well-plotted. &quot;Dr Fell&quot; gets a jealously-guarded position without anyone checking his references or bona-fides. Hannibal Lecter, hunted by every police force, has access to unlimited money - hidden exactly how and where? A good question for accountants. Mischa's &quot;milk-teeth&quot; are found, but not the jaw-bone they would have come from - a much more visible object. There are no such things as &quot;Australian quarters&quot;. How does the gypsy girl get into Australia without a visa? Etc. Etc.If you want a good &quot;Beauty and the Beast story&quot; with knife-edge tension, ultimately resolved, between a captive beauty and an inhuman, man-eating beast, try Hal Colebatch's long novella &quot;Telepath's Dance&quot; in Larry Niven's &quot;Choosing Names: The Man-Kzin Wars VIII (Baen Books).

Where is the thrill of the hunt from \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"? Particularly annoying is Krendler, Starling's enemy in the Department of Justice. He is a total caricature, a figure too simplistic to be believable. There is almost no reference to Will Graham, who I hoped would make a return, as he is the most interesting character in the series besides Lecter. The ending is totally ludicrous; All in all, I'd recommend rereading \\"Dragon\\" and \\"Silence\\", and leaving this one on the shelves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I tremendously enjoyed this novel, even in spite of the shocking ending.

It simply anticipates the film version. In &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and, in particular, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, we were presented with a killer (Lecter) who is compelling not so much as a primary player per se, but rather by virtue of his charismatic malevolence, even in absentia. Now, though, having been given the limelight and the opportunity to show the reader just what exactly he's made of, Lecter--and Harris--fails (miserably) to deliver the goods. He (the good doctor) comes off as something of a lovable rogue, a rather easygoing fellow who happens to have a penchant for human flesh. He is anything BUT monstrous (indeed, it seems that Harris anticipated this response going in, whereupon he created the bastard son of Freddie Krueger and Jason Voorhees [sic], Mason &quot;Mr. Hackflesch&quot; Verger). Special Agent Clarice Starling, formerly stalwart, unflinching in her discrimination between Right and Wrong, and vulnerable without being victimized, also undergoes a metamorphosis of being that is nothing if not incomprehensible, and by tale's end we find (much to our distaste--pun intended--though not surprise) that the Special Agent and her (former) Nemesis are really two sides of the same coin, a synthesis which both upsets and compromises the tension that made the first two &quot;Lecter Tales&quot; so compelling. In the end, then, the reader is left unfulfilled, (deeply) dissatisfied by the story's &quot;surprise&quot; (but is it, really?) ending, and wishing that Hannibal Lecter had lived up to his promise not to call on Special Agent Starling at the close of &quot;Lambs&quot;; unfortunately, though, Hollywood knows--if nothing else--how to milk a good story dry, and who could possibly find fault with Harris for doing little (very little) more than feeding the Machine?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If stars were awarded for grossness then &quot;Hannibal&quot; would be a five star winner. With the prominent role of pigs in the &quot;story&quot;, the book would have been better titled &quot;Silence of the Hams&quot;. No plot, cartoon characters and the only thrill in this &quot;thriller&quot; for me was getting to the end... and these are the good points. If you insist on reading this trash wait til it's out in paperback and pick it up at your neighborhood used book store for half price. Even then you'll still feel cheated. No question that we will be seeing a movie soon but I hope that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster don't demean themselves by having anything to do with this nonsense. Note to Mr Harris: You could have mailed this one in. If this is the best that you can do then 15 years may not be long enough to wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found Hannibal and Red Dragon side by side at the bookstore. Red Dragon would not turn me loose and I read it all in one day. Hannibal is but a bare shadow of its predecessor and deserves nothing better than the discount table.I was expecting at least a decent Blues Clues hunt for the good doctor. I can hardly find words to describe this book. Lecter cast as a sympathetic character? Living a quiet life in historic Florence? Found out a third of the way through the book, not by the shining defenders of truth and justice but by some half-wit keystone Italian cop on the take? Are we really supposed to believe that this clod is going to take Hannibal down?The author spends a quarter of the book setting up the Pazzi affair complete with back story, gypsies, and endless detail, and for what? The conclusion is forgone. What a waste.Where is the terror? The pigs? When I was 13, I watched pigs rip up a calf. It was more interesting that frightening. Real terror is visceral, instinctive (wolves, snakes, rats etc.) A huffy Porky Pig does not move me.Who do we side with? The Cannibal? There is no one worth rooting for in this book. No emotional involvement at all. Every single wretched character could die and the world would be better off. Ugh!I can only pray that this novel never sees film. That truly would be a horror. I am not suprised that Foster would have nothing to do with it. Hopkins should know better.A final word. Why does Harris have such a lip fetish? It was unusual in Red Dragon, redundant with Mason. Perhaps Harris just likes writing the word &quot;fricative&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Some books are so well-written, the characters and storyline so compelling, that follow-ups should never be written. Sadly, Hannibal falls into this category. I'm puzzled why the book is called Hannibal, as Lecter is in this story so infrequently (until the climax). Even Starling is relegated to a minor supporting role for most of the book. Other monsters take the stage, and while the premise of one psychotic plotting to destroy another is interesting in theory, on the printed page, at least in this case, it doesn't work. And the too-obvious digs at federal bureaucracy are weakly reminiscent of a Grisham novel.The biggest distraction for me was the constant shift in tense (nearly as distracting as the over-use of description throughout). Practically every chapter that involved Hannibal shifted from the past to the present tense. In fact, this book throughout read more like a screenplay (complete with stage direction) than a novel. Highly irritating. There is also a huge discrepancy involving Clarice's mother that I can't understand an editor not catching.In this book we also get some insight into why Hannibal is the way he is. Personally, I preferred the mystery of not knowing why Hannibal is such an abomination to mankind. But the worst offense is what Harris does to the Starling character. For me it was completely unbelievable.There were parts that I enjoyed. I liked that once again I found myself feeling empathy for Hannibal (due, I'm sure, in no small part to remembering Anthony Hopkins' phenomenal performance in the movie of Silence of the Lambs), that the line between good and evil is often smudged, and that I had again this perverse wish for Hannibal and Starling to somehow be friends. But overall? I don't think this was a book even Hannibal Lecter could sink his teeth into!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...and then you bite into the clove. The book is a fine read, really, but the ending leaves you wondering what all the fuss was about. Harris introduces several new characters, all of which are mirrors of characters in Lambs, which eventually are eaten by Lecter. All is going strong for the first 90 chapters (don't be alarmed - each chapter is only two- to three-pages in length) and then just fizzled. Were we rushing to make a deadline, Harris? In short, it starts out strong, has a good flavor, and just when you know you're going to enjoy it to the last byte, you bite into the clove! Read this book, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is slow, the people we know from the previous book are a bit out of character from the previous story, and 1/2 way through the book your still waiting to be unerved! What can you expect when the movie rights are bought before the book was written. Someone's laughing all the way to the bank. Borrow this from someone if you must read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the reviews and thought it must be fabulous. I love a good scare. Stephen King read it, gave it a good review. How could it be a loser. Please. Totally disappointing. Ending was unbelievable. Somehow didn't understand why Barney gave Margot the rape kit and don't care enough now that I've completed the book to go back and re-read that chapter. Terribly disappointing ending. Had it figured out pretty soon after the final scene at the farm. I spent the entire day reading it on Saturday, finished 3 am. I should have done housework and gone to bed early. OH, as for needing a nightlight to be able to overcome the terror. Gee... If this book is considered scarey, then Godzilla movies must be terrifying...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I understand that good reviews help sell books and that poor reviews don't. Well this review may never see the light of day, but I feel compeled to try and dissuade others from spending their money foolishly. The ending of Hannibal was, without question, the most ridiculous and silly climax I have ever read. For two thirds of this book I was hooked. A well thought out plot with a seemingly devastating conclusion had me wondering how it was going to work out. Past the two thirds point and through the ending this potential winner disappointed tremendously. I can understand why Jodie Foster passed on reprising her Clarice Starling role in the film version.I'm sorry that my first customer review is a negative one. Mr. Harris is a fine writer, (Silence of the Lambs was one of the few books which actually frightened me while reading it) but he comes up way off base with this one. If I didn't know better I would feel that Mr. Harris was trying to bring the saga of Lecter and Starling to an end, not because it was time, but moreso because he suddenly grew tired of them both. Well, if that was his plan, it worked for me. I only hope that I can look past this silly, silly ending when his next book is published."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"No doubt Jodie Foster passed on the role when she got to the end of the book and it described Clarice's hairdo as a &quot;platinum helmut.&quot; What drug was Harris on when he wrote the ending? No way can you change a belief and value system by dangling a few baubles and a plate of foie gras under their nose as Harris implies in the book. This one was a real yawn."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I knew it would be bad and I would be thoroughly disgusted with myself for bothering to look, but I couldn't resist. Everything I'd heard about how bad it was *made* me want to read it, just so I could see for myself how bad it really was.I won't bother to give away the ending, but suffice it to say that if it were mentioned here, you might feel the need to read it yourself just to see for yourself that he really had the audacity. I think Harris' secret plot here was to thoroughly disgust the reader with the characters so that he never has to write them again. After all, he's a made man now, no need to visit with ghosts of the past, especially if nobody wants to see or hear or read them ever again after this ten-car-pile-up of a travesty."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...but still good of its kind. Thomas Harris is very good at what he does, but I was a bit surprised that he so obviously wrote this novel as a screenplay in so many parts. There are lazy, lazy descriptions that could have been taken straight from a film script, and of course Hannibal was snatched up and is being made. In this third entry we get more of Hannibal Lecter. We even get a background on him, which I don't mind but which has caused some major disappointment from fans. I think that Harris fudged the timeline a bit though. Silence of the Lambs appeared in 1988, the film in 1991. In Hannibal, we learn that Lecter has been free for 7 years, yet everything points to the film taking palce in 1999 or 2000. He has also made Lecter almost superhuman in terms of intelligence and other ability. And Clarice Starling, who disappears for long periods in this overlong novel, seems like a tired creation, as if Harris became sick of her personality, which was never well developed to begin with. And no mention of Will Graham of Red Dragon, he being perhaps the authority on Lecter? Well, it will be interesting to see how the film presents the ending, which is really a bit far out. Hopefully though, this is the last of the Hannibal Lecter books. Until Harris is offered another 75 billions dollars for a novel and the rights."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lector's obsessiveness over food, wine, furnishings, flowers and Italian culture transformed the serial killer of the previous novels into someone sounding an awful lot like TV's Frasier Crane. I became weak with laughter as I imagined Hannibal speaking in Frasier's voice. I also determined that the character of Hannibal himself could be reduced to a simple equation:Dr. Frasier Crane + Martha Stewart = Dr. Hannibal Lector."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read several of these reviews and am sitting here in shock at some of the comments.

I read it in 3 days because I couldn't put it down... I HAD to know what happened to Dr. Lecter and Clarice . . . My favorite part of the whole book was the ending.. TOTALLY unexpected.. The book leaves you breathless but definately satifised . . . If you are thinking about buying this book... THINK NO MORE! It's a definate BUY!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' Hannibal is one of the best books I have read lately. I also am amazed by the horribly negative reviews this book has gotten. I read Hannibal first, and then its predecessors, Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs. I found that Hannibal held itself on a much higher plane than the first two books. The first book contained parts that seemed to be included simply for their shock factor. While the second book had less random macabre, it still held no comparison to the Olympus of all books, Hannibal. Albeit, I am not very fond of the way Thomas Harris ended his masterpiece. In the way Thomas Harris ends the book, he doesn't allow a fourth sequel to be written. I mean its possible, anything is possible, but the ending leaves a very awkward entrance into any form of a fourth book. In conclusion, Hannibal is a wonderfully brutal book, leading up to, in my opinion, the end of the Hannibal Lecter series.-&quot; Garden variety manic depressive. Tedious...Very tedious. &quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...Starling and HL are so ludicrously different from their former incarnations they might as well be totally new characters, and the writing is so bad it's actually in bad ENGLISH, with the &quot;author&quot; often using non-sentences to set up &quot;scenes&quot; like a screenplay. You forgot the VERBS, Tom! How appropriate that Shlockmeister Stephen King gave &quot;Hannibal&quot; such a glorious write-up in the NY Times Book Review. Only somebody who can't figure out why Jodie Foster took a powder on the film sequel should read this book. Smart girl, that Jodie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have not yet read Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but I do plan to in the near future, hoping they end better than this one! It started out as a terrific book, with thrills, suspense, and twists. I wish I could tell you what happens at the end just so you won't read the book. It just doesn't make sense and is not realistic. Everyone is hoping for the book to end one way, but......"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did something when I finished this book that I haven't done in about 15 or 20 years. I threw it away. I disliked and disapproved of it so much, that I wasn't even willing to recycle it by taking it down to a used book store. I just threw it out.I give &quot;Hannibal&quot; 1 BLACK HOLE, because that's where every feeling of goodness and decency ends up by the end of it. I believe this book causes harm. I believe it enough to speak out against a BOOK of all things.I loathe censorship, at least by government, church and / or the people. Self-censorship is another matter. I don't think this book needed writing. As far as I'm concerned all it did was cater to the increasing bloodthirstiness in the world and unfortunately, added to it. This isn't ancient Rome. I thought we had outgrown \\"Bread and Circuses\\". Perhaps we haven't come as far as we might wish.I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. Yes, they are all dark and they are all frightening. I had nightmares after I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I told myself that it was OK because these books are mostly well written, and most of the bad guys get caught or die. I never thought that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was going to be a walk in the park, but something seems to have happened to this author since he wrote the first three books.Psychological thrillers tend to show that there is darkness in everyone. OK, I understand that. It's basically true and if something in a book strikes a chord within me then I believe that it shows that I have some work to do. OK, fine. But Thomas Harris seems to have forgotten that in most of us, there is also good.If I had had any idea of how it would end, I never would have read it. As it was, I almost put it down several times without finishing it. I regret wasting my time. I'm very glad that we didn't pay full price for it, although we still spend too much.I believe that this is an extremely ugly story with little redeeming value. It is well written (technically) but something inside of me has been hurt by reading it. I'll get over it, but the harm wasn't necessary.I will not read anything else by this author. I won't go see the movie. There is already too much darkness in the world. More did not need to be created."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not bad, but hardly what I expected. I expected the glorious Clarice Starling in a duell to the death with the even more glorious Hannibal Lecter. I didn't get that, am I sorry? No! I also expected an independent book, great writing like the first 2. Did I get it? No! Ok, the writing is great but it dosen't become a real book. If Harris gave this to me a year or two after the &quot;lambs&quot; I would have praised it for its huge potential. But there it stops, beeing a sketch for a great book. Why did it take ten years to write this? I am not really disappointed, Starlings fall from grace is convincing and Lecter was always too unique to be only the enemy. In the Red Dragon there is a moment where a blind girl is able to touch a tiger because it is sedated. Lecter is that tiger, so 'beautiful', so dangerous, so beyond others, you want to run and still you want to be close to him. With all its flaws, this is a good book, enchanting writing by a man with a truly sick imagination, and I mean that as a compliment. Too sad it never became what it could have been."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One of the most psychologically disturbing books I've ever read. This was one of only two books that kept me under the covers at night, sleeping with the lights on.In the first few pages I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book at all, but within minutes I was overjoyed that I continued with it.Harris captures the darkest side of humanity with this book and it's not all from the person you would suspect. This book goes a long way towards showing that there is too much evil in the world to let it set itself down on the shoulders of just one man.I know I'll read this one again, something I don't often do. Don't purchase this if you're weak of heart or stomach. But if you want to be tuned in and tuned up until the very last page it's a must buy!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My honest opinion on this book is that it was too lengthy on the subject of Italy. Middle chapters devoted to this section were wasted and time that should clearly have been spent on Clarice, wasn't. Another disappointment was the ending. I suggest sticking with &quot; The Silence...&quot; as the last book in the series."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One would have to go to extreme lengths to find someone who has not heard of, read, or simply seen the movie of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but it might just be worth it. As exquisite as the &quot;Lambs&quot; film was, its success as a movie somewhat oveshadowed the quality of the book. For example, I was fortunate enough to have had the book recommended to me before the theatrical release, so I had a completely opened mind to the story and characters. Now, every time I think 'Lecter' I think Anthony Hopkins. Not always a bad thing, but simply watching &quot;Manhunter&quot; allows us to see a completely different Lecter (Lecktor). Brian Cox showed us that Lector could be as quiet and reflective as Hopkins merely suggested. Since Demme's film was released, Hollywood has been awaiting the sure-fire box-office smash that would be a sequel. It was not forthcoming. In fact Harris has made Hollywood wait for him, a commendable acheivement that we all wish Michael Chrichton could have tried.So here it is, &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The name says it all really. The working title &quot;The Morbidity of the Soul&quot; is simply the better, but it's not quite so cinematic, &quot;Hannibal&quot; has that three syllable iambic that simply oozes Hollywood (cue &quot;Titanic&quot; reference). So has the 11 year wait simply been an elongated perfection of a future screenplay? Well, it has to be said that it does seem that way.Mason Verger is pure cinema. Harris' wonderful descriptions make for a undeniably strong mental image, while the character is pure Harris - torturous, and unrelenting. But what about the star of the show, not Starling who has been merely relegated to a characterised plot device. Lecter is the victim of his own fame. Harris has had to concentrate more on him, because out of the film of &quot;Lambs&quot;, Lecter was the only character with any real bite (apologies). The unnecessary exposition of Lecter's past rings of the backstory that Hollywood thrives for, and has the unpleasant side effect of dissecting, and dissipating the Lecter mythos. It's a shame.However, what can be said about &quot;Hannibal&quot; is while the plot seems manufactured , and destined for another Hollywood outing, this is a book of the highest calibre. It may not have the spikiness of &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, or the luridness of &quot;Lambs&quot;, but it is still an outstanding piece of literature.Harris' technique is one of meticulate research, astoundingly vivid characterisation, and impeccable plot construction. He and his namesake Robert Harris (of &quot;Fatherland&quot;, and &quot;Enigma&quot;) stand high above many other contemporary authors, and will undoubtedly be remembered by future generations as masters of their craft"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was smashing! It's the most comprehensive history I've read on Hannibal and his campaign to defeat the Romans. The book starts with the early history of the two ancient superpowers, Rome and Carthage, and details how and why they inevitably came to confrontation and conflict. The author's coverage of Hannibal's boyhood is quite magnificent. And, of course, Hannibal's subsequent rise, early success, and eventual defeat were absolutely brilliant! I can't wait to read Harris' next book, which is rumored to about Attila the Hun."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book although I am glad I read it. I anxiously awaited it. I did not like what went on in the ending chapters. I know The Silence of the Lambs dealt with horrific occurences but this one surpassed my tolerence. It actually made me queasy although I definately will go see the movie. Go figure. I can't comment on any specifics as to not ruin the book for others."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed Red Dragon &amp; Silence of the Lambs, which stand as classics of the genre. This one starts off about how and where you'd expect, with Hannibal on the run and Clarisse in some career difficulty. The book reads well, with plot twists and character development in the B+ range. HOWEVER: BEWARE OF THE ENDING. Shockingly out of character, jarringly out of context, it could enrage you as it did yours truly. The last 20 or so pages made me ask myself: &quot;For *THIS* I spent money !?!!!?&quot; Caveat Emptor, folks, this one turns into a huge dog."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' third novel featuring Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter once again relegates him to the role of supporting character. However, sating the reader's appetites for the charming anti-hero of these novels, Harris has wisely made him the focus of the FBI investigators.Clarice Starling is back as the central investigator, but rather than a student investigator, she is a trained field operative whose career has been subject to the whims of the higher ups in the government. Also returning are Jack Crawford and Paul Kandler as two of Starling's bosses.Add to the plot the character of Mason Vergers, Lecter's sixth victim, and the only one to survive, whose taste for vengeance compells him to issue an enormous bounty for Dr. Lecter - alive or dead.HANNIBAL is a great adventure. I read it through in one 16 hour sweep. While on some levels it lacks the psychological intensity of the former novels, it does focus on Lecter's background, his relationship with his sister, and his need for family. It continues to develop Starling's psychological profile, including her relationship with her father and with Ardelia Mapp, another FBI agent.Several times throughout the novel, Harris satirizes the American taste for breaking news, and often has the arrival of the media timed with the arrival of FBI on a crime scene. He also allows the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal to play in the background and sets HANNIBAL in a specific time and place.Rumors abound that the movie rights were sold for $10 million - the top price ever paid for a novel. With Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster bigger names and stars now than when SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was filmed, the price tag for this movie will reach halfway to $100 million dollars before a foot of film is shot. But it will be made into a film, and we will eagerly await its scrumptious film release."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Red Dragon, there is no reason to believe that Harris' next book will not follow suit. You MUST read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs first though!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The thing that stands out the most for me after reading this abomination is the obvious contempt, no, LOATHING Thomas Harris has for his readers. I believe he was so sickened by the 'fan mail' he has received for the Hannibal Lecter character that he decided to write a novel that would make his contempt so palpable that even the densest reader would detect it.And so we get crowds of tourists moved to lust at the sight of torture implements...Gratuitous slurs at gun show attendees...A little waspish slap at the people who tried to impeach WJC...And so on.The last two may give a clue as to the deeper roots of Harris' hatred : He has developed what I call Stephen King Syndrome. Remember the early King stories, in which he, the erstwhile struggling teacher/writer showed his knowledge of, and sympathy for, the struggles of lower middle class folks? Only to be replaced a few years down the road(circa IT, another bad book) by a man who slipped little remarks into the text to let us know how familiar he was with celebrities and their lifestyle, and an attitude towards 'poor folks' that slid first into pity, then contempt, then outright jeering. Thomas Harris is no doubt a very wealthy man now, and he probably moves in social circle where the members pride themselves on how much more &quot;enlightened&quot; they are than average Americans.It's rubbed off on him....Read the great Red Dragon, and his sensitive portrayals of even minor characters, who were rarely affluent. Notice Harris'; grasp of an overlooked prejudice (Since only white racism against &quot;people of color&quot; counts, y'know) : Contempt for poor whites, and the concomitant feelings of inferiority, strivings, and dislike of the wealthy people born poor (Will Graham, Clarice Starling) have. Then notice the little slams on the minor characters in Hannibal (eg the gun show attendees).It's as if everything Middle America admires-character, mores, politics, EVERYTHING-has become so anathema to Harris, he has to write a 500+ page novel in which all Good is shown to be nothing but sublimated Evil (a decades' old cliche) and in which no character is worthy of respect. Just to let us know how contemptible we, and everybody but Thomas Harris, truly are.The book itself reads like it was read into a dictaphone and printed without revision. How could the man who wrote such splendid, smooth, even at times beautiful prose as we read in Red Dragon and SOTL write so poorly as he did in Hannibal? More contempt for the &quot;ignorant readers who won't notice a difference&quot;? I don't know which is worse, the banal nature of the majority of the book's prose, or the straining-for-effect pretentious drivel as he strives for profundity (eg, the passages in HL's mind (the memory palace) , or the very last chapter of the book re : HL's and CS's relationship.)I agree with the reviewer who said that Harris has fallen in love with HL. He has created a character with certain superiorities of mind-and because he created him, TH now thinks those qualities are HIS. Another reason to despise the &quot;lesser beings&quot; out there in the real world! And Harris' attempts to-what, make the reader SYMPATHIZE with HL!?!-are grotesque : Spoiled rich brat brought up to regard everybody else as there to serve him loses his family in WWII . This causes an existential crisis , he loses all belief in God-and then goes out and inflicts the same pain of loss on others, but without the excuse of trying to avoid starvation, as the killers of his sister could claim. Nice ripoff of the Chikatilo story, but otherwise forced and trite.One thing about Hannibal that was handled well : The descent of Clarice Starling into psychopathology. It is foreshadowed well by two earlier passages that reveal her growing alienation : when she looks at the overweight nurse she is interviewing and realizes she's grown tired of a lack of &quot;stylishness&quot; around her, and when the sight of a man butchered like a deer almost makes her giggle. HL didn't have to do too much with the drugs and hypnosis to bring CS to his (and TH's ) state of mind : contempt for others as lesser things. It was already there in embryo. She sublimated it into a drive to protect, while HL preys...But the way childhood trauma-sudden death of loved ones- had warped them both in a similar manner is there before the drug-induced breakdown , and rebuilding into a sociopath.All that was good in RD and SOTL-the prose, the apparent insider's knowledge about FBI procedures, the sensitive handling of characters-is absent from Hannibal. Sadly, I hope Harris never writes another novel. And I wish I could cleanse my mind of Hannibal : It retroactively taints two fine novels that should have remained without a sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It has been seven years since Hannibal Lecter has escaped from custody. Clarice Starling has never forgotten the cold chill that runs down her back every time she thinks of the doctor. He haunts her dreams and seems to be with her every where she goes. Clarice has still been able to go on living her life to the fullest and preforming her job to the best to her ability working for the F.B.I. Hannibal has also been going about his business of enjoying the fruits of life (no pun intended) living in the art capital of the world in Florence, Italy. However, lately intruders have been medaling in Dr. Lecters life caused him to decide to come out of retirement. Chief Inspector Ranaldo Potsi of the Florence Police Department has become interested in the reward on Dr. Lecter's head and so has been trying to capture him himself. Another man finding much interest in Dr. Lecter is a former victim of his and the only one to survive, Mason Verger. Verger wants to capture Lecter but not for the reward. He wants to capture him to make him suffer as he made Mason once have to endure.In a strange turn of events Clarice gets caught up in the whole mix of trying to find Lecter again for the second time in her life. It has now become a race to catch Dr. Lecter before he escapes once again or worse catches one of his followers. Inspecter Potsi is too close for Lecter's comfort and he is silenced with his bowels inside out hanging around in the Florence square. Lecter then sees that it is time to return home to the states. On arrival he is ameadiatly on the stalk of his most interested F.B.I. friend Clarice. Verger has also been aware of the doctors depature and follows him with interest. While playing a game of cat and mouse with Starling, Lecter is caught by Mason's henchmen and takken back to his mansion. Lecter is placed in a pit surronded by flesh eating pigs. As the feeding frenzy is about to commence, none other than Clarice Starling comes to the aid of Hannibal Lecter. Mason Verger is highly upset, but in aturn of events he is tossed into the pit and forced to be torn apart by the blood thirst hogs.The two main characters are finaly together for their first encounter in over seven years. The reaction is more astonishing to the readers eyes and was probably the last ending any reader would have thought of. Instead of Clarice arresting Lecter and reaching the pinical of her career, or Hannibal making a midnight snack of the agent the two embrace in a romantic kiss. The end to this novel is that Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter fall in Love. It is a known fact that this ending was the downfall to this very suspensfull thriller and a wonderfull trilogy. In my view any logical ending would have made more sense then a respectable F.B.I. agent falling in love with a doctor/canibal. I believe that Thomas Harris depressed his whole audience with this ending and one can only hope that in his future novels he never makes such a foley ever again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I applaud Thomas Harris for taking the characters places we don't expect and in many instances, don't like. 'Hannibal' is extremely well written and takes you on a journey through the minds of absolute monsters and leaves you feeling something less than contemptuousness toward them partly, because Harris delves into the reasons behind the madness. The true talent of an author is exhibited when he can make you feel a multitude of emotions for a character that are completely contradictory and it leaves you wanting more.I think people dislike the ending because it doesn't fit into their &quot;movie&quot; image of the characters. Harris further develops his old characters by making them multi-dimensional and he shows us how they became the persons they are now. Thereby, the path that Clarice and Dr. Lecter take are very believable. I don't particularly like the path that Clarice and Dr. Lecter take, but that's what makes this book so wonderful! If you appreciate your mind being challenged and enjoy the unexpected, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As an active status member of the Horror Writer's Association, I am not a virgin when it comes to reading or writing horror. However, when one is in the presence of the Grandmaster of Gore, one becomes sufficiently humbled. Nobody does it better than Thomas Harris. In this third outing of Dr. Lecter, the reader is treated to terrors to roll over on the tongue--a book that will sink its teeth--into you! You may never &quot;eat Italian&quot; again. (At least not anything with a red sauce). Stop whatever you're doing, and buy this book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is a pleasure to be allowed to revisit our favorite hero and heroine in this exquisitely brilliant story. And make no mistake, both Lector and Starling share the role of hero. We are honored to be admitted into the rooms of Lector's memory palace and revel in his genius as he outwits his pursuers and doles out his unique, yet strangely satisfying brand of justice. The fact that Starling is instrumental in his final escape, after which he in turn rescues her from her own torment, is a delicious course in the gourmet meal that is this book"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved Red Dragon (the best I think), loved Silence of the Lambs and was prepared to love Hannibal. It pains me greatly that I cannot say I did. I expected Clarice to be a much bigger part of the story and the ending is too surreal to even be believed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only thing scary about this book is the fact that some people have given it more than one star. Not only was there no action or suspense, the characters were flat and unemotional. Who really felt bad about the demise of any of them? And the ending ... HUH? Harris builds some terrific characters in his earlier books only to wind them up like this? It makes no sense. Better luck next time (in the year 2010 probably)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I still had those hopes and felt a bit giddy as I started the book and actually liked it. But I thought the character development of everyone but Lecter and Mason was pathetic. Even Starling was not given enough attention. Everyone just seemed to get skipped over so more creepy, whacked out stuff could be divulged about Lecter and Mason. And the ending! What the heck happened? It's like Harris just decided to end the book um ..........let's see...........um..........this way, yeah! I felt like I should check myself into the sanitarium after I finished this book. I could only shake my head in total confusion. And trust me, the eventual movie with this ending will disappoint all but the truly mentally ill."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What's all the complaining about? If you want a warm, fuzzy read don't read Thomas Harris. If you want to go on a warped journey, you're in the right place. My only complaint is that I waited 10 years for this book and finished it in 4 days. I wish I would have drawn out the pleasure. Those people harping on the ending, re-read the book, it fits. I hope they don't make a movie of this book just because there was way to much happening to fit into 2 hours."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My review deals only with the decision of the narrator of the unabridged audio to speak the lines of the character Mason, the man with no lips, as if he himself had no lips. So what you get is a lot of incomprehensible drivel, as the letters b, f, m, p, v, w, and maybe others, are lost. This was a very flawed reading, for that reason."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, this book may be a victim of over-hype. On its merits, however, this book is still one of the worst disappointments I've ever had. The stage was set for a great sequel. Clarice Starling hunting Hannibal Lector, a monsterous villian. Maybe assisted by Will Graham or Jack Crawford. . . Nope. . didnt happen. . Instead we get a cast of characters that are more evil and sadistic than Lector, and what's worse is, they are unlikable and unsympathetic. The book is gross, and Harris seems determined to shock the reader with his prose. Not because it fit into the sotryline, but because he wanted a reaction from the reader. Additionally, if anyone has any other reaction than total disbelief at the ending, they should have their head examined.. like Paul Krendler."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"To follow Silence of the Lambs is a literary task that few if any writers would want to tackle, and under the circumstances Harris produced a worthy sequel. If Harris had written a more believable ending, the book would have been deemed boring or predictable. I do think Harris lost touch with the character of Starling but his portrayal of Dr. Lecter was immaculate. In particular the middle section of the book presents the chilling and evil genius of Lecter coupled with a medieval twist that left me begging but unable to put the book down. The conclusion was absolutely ridiculous and never would have happened, but I didn't mind because the book was such a joy to read. I think the story of Dr. Lecter is over. To ask Harris to write another book as original and excellent as Silence of the Lambs both underestimates the brilliance of the book and demands too much from a single a author. Hannibal shines in literary quality but lacks plot development. For this reason it makes a better book than movie. I hope Harris doesn't further diffuse the character of Dr. Lecter with any more love stories, and either writes a another book along the lines of Red Dragon or creates an enirely new character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am so disappointed by the direction that this story went. The book disgusted me and showed very little of the skill and craftmenship that Harris had in the past 2 Lecter novels. I hope that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins stay miles away from this one. This book is not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a bummer!! I awaited this book for ten years. Red Dragon is by far Harris' best book but Silence was good too. That's why this book was such a disappointment. If Harris had become a hack, putting out a book a year, I could understand the loss of quality. But it took him ten years to write this. I found the characters and the plot unbelieveable. But the worst offense was the complete negation of Clarice Starling's character that had been so carefully crafted by Harris. The ending was about as realistic as Hannibal being awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Though not finished the Author has you at the edge of your seat. By taking you back to parts of the first book, I find myself going back and forth between the first and second book. I find myself going all over the world with the main character. I almost want to root for Dr. Lector. This story has everthing from action to horror and is done in a very believable way!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was disappointed with this book not because it didn't meet expectations, but because there was such a major fall-down in the style. Harris' past books have been characterized by both enormous restraint in graphic detail and consistency of character; this book had neither. At the end, he completely discards everything about Clarice Starling's character that he has carefully developed over two books just to pair her (absurdly) with Dr. Lecter. The graphic details in the book, while not approaching the level of say Stephen King, were disappointing because Harris had shown himself in the past so willing to leave these things up to the imagination of the reader. I had the feeling the whole time that the book was written to be transformed into a screenplay, and not as novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Here's a guy who's written four books in 25 years, made millions and now has the freedom to do whatever comes into his head. He takes some of his style from Dickens' Bleak House (not, alas, the contents); adds a dash of Stephen King (no wonder King loves this), and wanders on with whatever comes into his head.But ... It entertains. Harris is an entertainer, a smart one. He invented Hannibal Lecter, Johnathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins made Demme into one of the world's most marketable commodities villain and now Harris is free to indulge himself and write what he wants. Good for you, Tom, you've made yourself into an institution and the joke's on the buying public.By the way, the ending wasn't that bad. It fit with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Funny. Dark. Over-the-top. Extravagant. Unpredictable. Messy. Brilliant. If you don't like Dennis Miller and are annoyed by his smarty-pants allusions and pop-culture references, you'll probably miss much of the intelligent fun in this book. Yes, the tense and point of view shift without warning. Yes, there's gore. But there's also some damn fine writing -- and a lesson to be learned from the public's hunger for this book and all its gore, and then the backlash against it. We've all helped create a world that makes Dr. Lecter, though revolting, all too possible. What if this is the novel we deserve?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For those wanting a recap of Harris' Silence, I understand your disappointment. Rather that re-live the first novel, the characters have evolved into their more dark and cynical counterparts. The line between good and evil that seemed so bright within Silence has become blurry. No longer is Dr. Lecter so easily hated. He has a&quot;taste,&quot; (pun intended?) that rivals most, a love of fine things declared by the obvious and unlikeable villan Krendal to be &quot;artsy-fartsy.&quot; It is almost with an obvious sensation of being punched in the stomach that the reader discovers Hannibal is still the consciousless murderer that he ever was. The reader feels dirty because of the desire to like, or at very least admire him. This change makes the story more interesting to me, as the prototypical serial-killer has now become such a common place event. Rather that give Hannibal his old, now less shocking persona back, Harris has deepened it and made it more complex, so as to maintain his mythical quality. Hannibal is no longer simply &quot;the Cannibal,&quot; but also &quot;Lecter the Protector.&quot;Starling herself has also undergone a change. She is no longer the &quot;star&quot; of the FBI, nor is she as optimistic and green as she once was. She now has become a killer, and this goes to further blur the line between good and evil.Even Crawford, the wise seeming sage of the former novel, has changed. He has eroded into a shell of what he once was, now a sad and pitiful character.As for the ending, I must admit is was very troubling to me. I believe, however, that therein lies its beauty. There is a sense of impending doom overshadowing all of the lovely things, giving it a dreamscape style. You feel as if you are drugged with Starling.Also, at times I felt as if the novel intended to poke fun at those who made such a big deal of the connection between Starling and Lecter in Silence... As I remember it, there was even a time when Anthony Hopkins stated he would not appear in a sequal because of the heroic qualitites the audience attributed to Lecter. &quot;Hannibal&quot; seems to draw upon the darkness that we as a human race must have within us if we are able to make a cannibalistic serial-killer into a hero.Aside from the rich characterization, the visual attributes of the scenes are wonderful, almost poetic. One really sees the literary quality of this novel, putting it above most of the action-suspense genra.In closing, I must admit that although it troubled me greatly at times, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel. Though I was expecting Silence Pt. 2, I got a novel which was equally great, but essentially different. (Please excuse my spelling... I ws in a hurry when I wrote this!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was looking forward to meeting Clarice and Hannibal again. Nobody in this book seemed real. I believe Harris was merely writing for gruesome shock value. Don't bother making the movie. Even Anthony Hopkins couldn't save this script. A former Harris fan."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where will it go from here? Maybe the next book will be titled &quot;Clarice Wakes Up.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris takes us to an unknow workld where the forbidden becomes exquisite, where the mistery becomes morbid. If you are ready to explore a different world, this is the perfect book. It's written with sophistication and even with an upgraded taste for the macabre."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished Hannibal and now I see why people are trashing it. It's just too dark for most people. I was mystified by the bad reviews on this site while I was reading the book. Hannibal is scary, intense, exciting and unpredictable in a way most thriller writers can never match. Granted it's not as good as Red Dragon but compared to the competition it stands alone. When I reached the end my first reaction was resistance. I was disturbed in a way that made me uncomfortable and angry. Thats when I realized what all the bad reviews were about. Hannibal suggests things about the human personality that are truly frightening to think about. The question as to whether or not it could happen in &quot;real life&quot; is basically uninteresting. It happens in the book and it is essentially justified within those confines. I recomend this book as a top shelf thriller that you won't be able to put down. When you reach the end and become angry and uncomfortable, remember that this book accomplished it's basic goal better than most of its kind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unfortunately, for the readers who have waited years for a second look at the infamous Dr. Lecter, there is only a glimpse in 'HANNIBAL'. The book is well written and keeps your interest, but not with the flare of its predecessor. What was good in 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', is now evil, and what was evil, is so still."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very disappointing sequal to The Silence of the Lambs. Paper cutout characters. No suspense. A totally ridiculous ending. Don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"bascially I like the book but the ending was so bizarre, I am still wondering what the point is. oh well, I guess if it was predictable, there would be a ton of people complaining about that...still, i never saw it coming. i'd recommend it...not overly gross. seems like a book that would come from a recluse, albiet intellectual."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ugh. I won't spoil it for everyone but if this book ended by aliens came down and sucked Hannibal Lecter up to their spaceship for mating rituals, THAT would have been a move believable ending. Hannibal? No, Horribal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So the book is a little sloppy. So the story did not end the way a formula detective story would. When you cook with a diabolically insane cannibal, don't expect a familiar recipe. The ingredients in this concoction are seldom found at the local supermarket. Try it. You may acquire a taste for something other than ffffava beans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment. I loved Harris' earlier books and was very much looking forward to this one. I read half the book and couldn't make myself keep picking it up.Harris had two fascinating characters to work with and blew it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book and can't wait until they make the movie. When's the next book come out?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have never been so insulted! Harris must think his readers are idiots if he dares to end this book the way he did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I respect the way that Mr. Harris handled this book. I would never have expected to root for Hannibal Lector, but I found myself doing so. When you get past all the gore, you'll learn what makes Hannibal &quot;tick&quot; and suddenly you are on his side. You'll discover a relationship between Hannibal and Clarice that is both spellbinding and compassionate. The ending that was perfect! It could not have ended any other way. Thank you Mr. Harris for &quot;closure&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was HORRIBLE! I can't believe I wasted my time reading it - a whole day...poof! Is this the same man who wrote Red Dragon? Nothing in this book was remotely scarey or spine tingling or even edgy. The villain was just gross and unbelievable, the hero - I guess Clarice and Hannibal share that dubious title? - well, what can I say about those two? She came across as not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. And he. Oh my. I never thought I'd say Hannibal Lecter was dull and uninteresting, but he was. Boring is my verdict. I certainly hope Mr. Harris got paid bigtime for this one, because I believe he's just lost a bunch of fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Somehow,Harris doesn't really make the book that gross out, but there a certian way that he writes that makes me want to continue and i get really stressed out and my mind starts wandering..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I actually threw the book away when I was finished"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read, reviewed and ranked 42 novels this year. Hannibal ranks #1 at this point, just ahead of Winslow's California Fire and Life; Lehane's Prayers for Rain, and Hodge's Wild Horses. Not having seen the movie version of The Silence of the Lambs, I only had expectations based on reading Harris' previous works. Though I found Lambs superior in its tone's chilling effect upon me, I also found the artistry of Harris' writing in Hannibal to be superior to that found in TSOL. His voice and shifting point of view are magnificently unique in this novel. When I finished Hannibal, I sat still in my easy chair, staring off into the distance, as stunned as I ever remember being at a novel's ending. My beloved asked me if there would be a sequel. I couldn't answer the question then and I can't answer it now. This was a good read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Incredibly dissapointed. I loved the book Silence of the Lambs. Remember when they hired another writer to do a sequel for Gone With the Wind - this had the same feel - that someone else was tinkering with my favorite charachters. Clarice is a totally different person in this book, and the back story on Hannibal was not only LAME but it ruined him for me. Why give away the goods - Hannibal is much better as an enigma.Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone - especially Jodi Foster!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's actually kinda funny. If I'm anywhere NEAR the end of a book, I usually finish it - so it was odd to me that the book sat on my shelf, unfinished, for over two days with only around 30 pages to go, and I had no real desire to finish it.I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT ALONE!That a book with the potential that this one had - before even being written! - ended the way it did is beyond pathetic. I tend to feel guilty for not liking a book - I try to like everything. But not Hannibal. I'm just not sure what Mr. Harris was thinking. Some have said it was &quot;bravery&quot; and &quot;guts&quot; that he dsiplyed by ending this book the way he did. I'll call it laziness."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was wonderful. I finished it in two days. I couldn't put it down, although I suggest anyone wanting to read it have a strong stomach. The descriptions used by Mr. Harris were vivid yet restrained. I never knew where Mr. Harris would take me next. The probing into the mind of Dr. Lecter was unique and gave us a glimpse into the mind of one of the most frightening and unpredictable literary monsters of the decade. I wouldn't wait for the movie. In order to make a movie of this book, much would have to be edited."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris continues to showcase the smarts and exhaustive research he used to such good effect in the previous 2 books on Hannibal Lector. Dr. Lector, for all his unusual &quot;tastes&quot;, has always been frightening because he is so utterly believable. But the new villain Harris has created is so grotesque as to be unbelievable, a sinister, predictably gross cartoon character not worthy of Harris's talents or time. Clarice Starling's efficient intelligence shines through as it did in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but her character's transformation by the end of this novel was both disappointing and disturbing. The reader is left feeling vaguely cheated, and more than a little mystified. This is not the Clarice Starling we once rooted for- this woman is someone we don't know. Once the action moves to Italy, be prepared to stay up to the wee hours- till it's over."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading all three of Harris' novels containing Lecter I must say this was the most disappointing. In Silence of the Lambs he created a strong female role for Starling and completely ruined her in Hannibal. I agree with many of the other reviewers that it was an interesting book and the ending was a complete surprise, but I don't think that it was consistant with the characters Harris originally created. Both Hannibal and Starling lost something, and Crawford was another disappointment. I would only recommend this book to those who haven't read the two prior novels (Red Dragon and Silence...). It stands alone on its own merits just fine. For those expecting to revisit favorite characters, re-read one of Harris' previous two novels."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished Hannibal last evening. A very good read. If you think about the ending, and then think about Clarice and Hannibal, I'm not sure if it could have ended any other way than the way in which it did. The subplot to SOTL is the budding &quot;relationship&quot; between the two, why not take it one step farther, which Harris does. Harris shows true guts here, to go against the &quot;typical&quot; ending which would have Clarice and the FBI capturing, or most likely killing, Hannibal. Here was something much better to read, and much better to contemplate &quot;Can evil be worthy of love?&quot; I look forward to seeing the movie, stupid scene on the plane, and all. A very, very, good read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is what we have all been waiting for! It's what we secretly wanted all along. We all knew it was there. In Silence of the Lambs, it was obvious that there was a certain tension between Clarice and the good doctor. Secretly, we all wanted to delve more closely into that subject. &quot;Hannibal&quot; also gets deep into the recesses of Dr. Lecter's mind. We get a chance to see how he thinks; how he reasons; how he feels, if it can be called that. We get to see Dr. Lecter not in a prison setting but as a distinguished, tasteful man of the world, in his own personal niche. We get to see how Dr. Lecter, unconstrained, unbound, truly LIVES."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This came from the same guy who wrote &quot;Red Dragon?&quot; It seems like Mr. Harris took writing lessons from the Stephen King School of character development, because they were ridiculous. All of the antagonists (Krendlar, Verger) were just soooo nasty, and we had to be reminded of it constantly with an awkward example that seemed to be jammed into the chapter. I mean it isn't enough that Verger is disturbed and deformed, but he finds it important to let us know that he likes to torment children. E gads! Now that's nasty! And Krendlar uses the &quot;C&quot; word. Now that's really nasty!The other problem is that all of Lecter's victims are &quot;bad guys.&quot; So Lecter is now a hero. Either a hunter who's bagging underweight game out of season (how politically un PC) or kidnappers on his trail. What a selective serial killer. Especially when he leaves hospital employees only knocked out. Give me a break.I didn't mind the end, though.I think I'll read Red Dragon again and remember how scary a book can be."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having anticipated another chapter in the Lector story for years, and having re-read SOtL and Red Dragon, I was thrilled to see &quot;Hannibal&quot; on the bookstands. I was ready to be equally thrilled by the book. Wrong! Parts of the book were masterfully written, but the last chapter was disappointment writ large. In the name of character development, Dr. Lecter was raised to the level of superman. Krendler was a cartoon, as were most of the other characters. I don't need a happy ending, but I do need one that is plausible and fits the sense of the story. Wrong again! Compared to the previous two books in the series, this is tabloid journalism."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit that after the almost 13 year wait between Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal (Silence of the Lambs was published in 1986 remember?) I was greatly anticipating the sequel.I have read almost all the reviews associtated with this book and while I feel that there were some major problems with character developement and plot, I must admit that I was not all that dissapointed. Why some of you may ask? Well for one reason, I knew Mr. Harris was going to hard pressed to top Silence of the Lambs, which in my opinion was one of the best written thrillers of the past 30 years, and number two the film adapation of the book did win an Oscar. I know that has little to do with how good the book is, but when the film wins an Oscar us readers do tend to expect more out of any sequel be it book or movie.Mr. Harris did spend alot of time revealing the motivations behind Lecter's sadistic tendencies, and while it did tend to remove some of the mystique from the character I feel this is something that he did need to do. Lecter was written as a flesh and blood human being remember? And there is always something that makes a human being turn bad (and no I am not going to get into a debate over nature versus nuture here). I had a hard time believing that Lecter was evil just for the sake of being evil, which is how is was protrayed in the first two books, and in this book Harris does paint a rather convincing picture of what exactly it was that made Lecter turn against society and become a monster.My main problem with this book was the Clarice Starling character, in the Silence of the Lambs, she was portrayed as a strong, resourceful and inituitive woman a worthy heir to Will Graham the hero of Harris' first book Red Dragon, in this book however she is reduced to less than that, now I know that seven years in any govenment agency (esp. the FBI) is enough to suck the life out of anyone, but I had a hard time believing that Clarice would let that happen to herself. By the end of the book I was looking for her to be the good balancing out all of the evil that permeated the novel, and of course it turns out she wasn't. We tend to like our heroes in fiction clear cut and honest and with this novel I can honestly say that did not happen.The book tended to read more like a morality play than a thriller and that is not really why I read Mr. Harris' previous books.While I did have a problem with the way the characters where protrayed in the book, I do think it was very well written and did move along at a relatively nice pace, which is all I really ask for in a Thomas Harris novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is no suspense, just insipid characters and vivid gory descriptions that somehow don't even arouse horror--they're simply too unbelievable. What a shame the character development didn't continue after such a brilliant start(s)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very much expecting this novel to be a suspenseful thriller...but the more I read, the less credible it became. From Hannibal to Starling, the characters were so grotesquely unrealistic that I kept wondering how this got published.The ending left me incredulous...simply because it was so farfetched not even my vivid imagination could conjure how a serial killer would act like a male character in the worst romance novel.Let's label this one FANTASY. And HOPE it is NEVER made into a movie -- at least not the novel version."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was engrossed in the first three quarters of the book. It was wellwritten as you would expect from Harris. However, the credibilitythat was carefully built around Hannibal and especially Starling was destroyed in the end. I wondered if he ran out of time and just turned something in to meet the minimal requirments of his publisher after putting the book down for the last time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What an ending! Before I read the book, I was aware that there is a twist at the end. That was the only reason that I endured the slow pace and boring side plots. As I was nearing the end, I thought, &quot;No, this could not be the ending, the twist is coming up.&quot; I was totally disappointed. That IS the ending. If you are looking for &quot;and they live happily everafter&quot; kind of ending, read Beauty and the Beast."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one book that is very tough to put down. I read it in three sittings. Not for people who are easily grossed-out; the things described are sometimes very difficult to stand. You will sympathize with Hannibal before the book is through. That is the scariest thing!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Character development: Clarice Starling - Good further development up until she ran off on her own. No matter how badly the bureau had treated her, I just didn't buy her blowing it all away, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Jeffison45's review is right on the money. \\"The perfectionist Lecter couldn't be satisfied with the Stepford Wife version of Clarice Starling we're left with at the end.\\" I definitely wasn't.Lecter - He's not such a bad guy, just terribly misunderstood, looking for a replacement for the only one who ever understood him, Mischa. Yeah, right. How many holocaust victims went through much, much worse and didn't turn out to be sociopaths? Memory palace was cool but a throw away vehicle to showcase Harris's descriptive capabilities.Barney - I think I would've moved a whole lot sooner.Margot - I felt no empathy with her. Sure she was complex, extraordinary, but in the end I didn't care what she did. Part of what made Silence of the Lambs so good was that even the throw away characters meant something to the reader. In Hannibal, they didn't.Mason - Excellent bad guy however a little whiny. What started him off? If he was fabulously rich enough to hire people who would do absolutely anything for him and if he hated life so much then why didn't he just hire someone to kill him as he lay hooked up to his machines?Mason henchmen - I agree with the reader from Chicago, IL: why would anyone want to work for Verger anyway?Jack Crawford - thrown away completelyArdelia Mapp - thrown away completelyItalian cop - who cares?!?Plot: I didn't read Red Dragon but I did read Silence of the Lambs. Obviously he wasn't out to create another suspense thriller because there was no suspense. So the question is, what did Harris create? A horror novel about modern monsters, perhaps. The whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts, it's just a bunch of parts woven together with Lecter as the common thread. Believable or not, I did think the ending was cool brains - er - I mean, cool beans...Style: Yup, I had to read till the end in almost one sitting, so Harris still held my attention. But through the Florence scenes, I kept reading because I was still waiting for the good stuff to begin. The exquisite phrases all seemed to belong to someone else, as attributed to at the end.Summary: I believe Mr. Harris may be suffering from the same deficiency as Stephen King: a severe lack of a good editor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is, I truly hope, a joke. The pressure from Hollywood must have been tremendous for a sequel to The Silence of The Lambs. However, I'm insulted and quite peeved that Thomas Harris took his frustrutions out on his fans. We're the ones shelling out too much money for a book that was obviously written out of spite. Hollywood will still get their movie, albeit with a different (and most assuredly BETTER) ending. While I share Thomas Harris' feelings about &quot;sequels&quot;, I wish that Hollywood would have been the target of his inside joke, and not the fans. Shame on you, Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"That's how much I hated this book. The majority of the book paled in comparison to Silence of the Lambs, but the ending was just absurd. It actually made me angry it was so bad. If I thought it would work, I would go to a hypnotist to get all recollection of this book removed from my head. In short, if you loved Silence of the Lambs, for god's sake DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewer that Hannibal is a tangled mess of pretentious garbage.

You would think that after waiting years Mr. Harris would have come up with a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Up until about the last 5 chapters, I was lovong this book. Man, it was better than Silence. And then all of a sudden...it was like Harris was hit overthe head with an idiot stick and his editor just squashed together some jackass ideas and slapped a cover on it! I bet the sequel to Gone with the Wind is better than this load of trash!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Reading &quot;Hannibal&quot; I felt the same sensation I did watching the new Star Wars. Harris concentrates too much on details and forgets to tell an interesting story. We get a load of useless facts and trivia about Lecter and other peripheral characters. What we don't get is the engaging exchange between the Cannibal and Clarice that was present in the previous book. Director Demme claims he doesn't want to film &quot;Hannibal&quot; because it's too violent. I think it's just too thin."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot tell you what a disappointment this book is. Thomas Harris has created a violent, sadistic novel with no concrete lines distinguishing good from evil. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for any of these characters, or are we supposed to celebrate the ultimate snuff novel and its creative methods of murder ? If this is what is scintillating to the people of America, we are in a lot of trouble.Please know that I am disappointed that this book is as lousy as it is. I've read all of Thomas Harris' other novels and found them well-written and enjoyable.It's too bad he had to write this one.I felt dirty reading it, and I may never think of Florence, Italy - my favorite city in the world - in the same way again. If you have to read this book, order it through the Internet, and at least pay a low price for it. And pray to God that Hollywood will not make this novel into a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, I have to say, when I first finsihed reading this book, I wasn't quite sure WHAT I thought. And actually, I'm still not sure. I think the story started out living up to its expectations, but then it lost my interest somewhere for a while. It didn't take long for it to pick back up again, and then I read straight through to the end. Well, the ending left me a little baffled. I certainly didn't see it coming. All I can say is that &quot;Hannibal&quot; left a strange taste in my mouth. It seems people either LOVED or HATED it. I think they are both strong words, way too strong to describe how I feel, but I will say this. . .I can't wait to see what they'll do with the movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Enough said by other Amazon reviewers. Just wanted to make sure other people save time and $."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I sat down with GREAT anticipation to read this book and was pretty much enthralled until the end..I mean, come on! What kind of lame and obviously rushed ending was that? I was really disappointed with the ending. What started out as a must read turned out to be the same old run-of-the mill book"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished Hannibal and truly hope that Mr. Harris does not leave his readers hanging. I could not put the book down, although I found it to be very disturbing. I also read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (also saw the movie). I really believe one should see &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; prior to reading Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster will follow you through Hannibal, giving you a real sense of the characters in the book. I had just returned from a trip to Europe before purchasing the book and found the references to Italy exciting. I found myself reflecting on the culture and beauty of Italy, but also being jerked back into the horror of the unfolding story. I find myself drawn to Dr. Lecter and feel some sympathy for his early childhood horror, although it sickens me.Mr. Harris, please continue......."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Whereas &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; gave me that comfortably, but not too, full feeling, Harris' latest leaves me hungry. Pass the Chianti!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"All I can say is this book was a bitter disappointment. The villian (no, not Lecter but Mason Verger) was straight out of a DC comic book, our heroin Clarice Starling (which the average American equates with Jody Foster, whether they want to or not) turns out to be a total flake. And, poor Jack Crawford is dismissed with quite the whimper. After about chapter 65, I actually grew weary with Hannibal Lecter and really didn't care what was on his mind anymore. When I put this book down, I sat for a minute wondering what was Harris thinking. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I suggest you don't either."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In a nutshell, if you read Silence of the Lambs and wondered afterwards about things in the book - is there a god; if so why does god let awful things happen; can we truly heal our emotional wounds; is every human life equally sacred and if not, how are some more than others - you will like &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Stop here and buy the book or keep reading...I read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and thought they were good and very good, respectively. Both developed well-rounded characters, especially Starling and Lecter. Clarice Starling was, I thought (I'm a guy, so take this with a bit of salt) one of the best- developed female characters I've ever read. She wasn't just a skirt with a gun and she makes no stupid choices. Lecter went from being a very well developed but rather one-sided pure evil force to being someone one could have a short but interesting conversation with. Both characters THINK. How often do we see this? Not often enough (IMHO). In this, the final (?) book, Thomas Harris has chosen to take the high road - light on the formulaic thriller plot twists or ending. True to form, people do get hurt and die and are sometimes eaten. The audience (again) sympathizes with both Lecter and Starling. BUT THEN Mr. Harris takes the world apart, literally, by focusing on where the characters came from and are going to, rather than simple chase-kill-chase-kill-capture. It doesn't surprise me many people don't like the book. When it does &quot;go popular&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is so over the top it is almost funny - for example, Mason Verger, a Lecter Victim from pre-Red Dragon days, is pathetically one-dimensional. It is when we spend time with Starling, most of the Italian cast members and Lecter that the book is best, and the ending is so appropriate. I was impressed that Mr. Harris would &quot;de-Hollywoodize&quot; the story in favor of aesthetics. Too bad Hollywood will never make &quot;Hannibal&quot; into the movie it deserves to be.If your idea of great thriller fiction is &quot;Eyes of Prey&quot; or other such like, you'll hate this book. If you liked SOTL and have a taste for aesthetics over formula, you'll like the book.It wasn't perfect, but it was well worth the price of the hardcover. Mr. Harris, if you read this, thank you very much."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My main problem with the story is that the characters here bear little resemblance to the characters in the previous book in the beginning, and become even more strange as the book progresses. The ending is just bizarre. Had I not read The Silence of the Lambs, I may have enjoyed this book for what it is, a simple, though grotesque, description of one psychopath and the people he's contacted. However, in the framework of the previous book, this story becomes stupid, contrived, and disappointing. Anyone who'd read the Silence of the Lambs will probably feel the need to read this book; just be prepared for disappointment, and the urge to say &quot;WHAT??&quot; at the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In contrast to &quot;Silence..&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; which kept me breathless, I found this sequel very thought provoking and find myself having trouble with the fact that I like Hannibal Lecter. The conclusion left me pondering the horrors of our world and people in it and smiling at a seemingly unlikely conclusion to a relationship. I recommend the book - either purchased or from your local library. The experience is worth the trip through the pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I admit the major portion of this book was engaging and extremely well written. I felt the last three or four chapters were thrown together and felt very cheated in the ending of this book. If you have not read it yet, my advice is to pick another book and save your memories of Hannibal and Clarice. I wish now I had not read it and I agree with the others who say if this is the way the screen-play ends, the movie should never be made and I will be very surprised if Sir Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster either one sign on."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Initially, this is pretty scary stuff, but the ending is a complete cop-out and very dissappointing. There were so many ways to go that would have been better. There's no way that Starling and Lechter could come to this end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a serious letdown! This book read like a parody of Harris' earlier work. I expected the last page to read &quot;Gotcha - the joke's on you!&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like Michael Crichton, Harris has let the screen potential of his amazing (overall) chronicle overshadow where this story should have gone. And this, the third Lechter installment, suffers mightily. Like he's more worried about how the movie will turn out rather than does the story, very simply, work. In this case, Harris' asking for me to suspend my disbelief is just too great a request, and he simply does not deliver. With Lechter, the story doesn't need the inclusion of another monster (Mason Verger). It needs more cat and mouse between Starling and Lechter, more of the claustrophobia that makes silence (the book, hated the movie) what it was. Needs more &quot;Hannibal&quot; and less (a lot less) contrivance. And the ending...please.....trying to hard to make a movie, Mr.Harris. Write a novel instead."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of the books &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of The Lambs,&quot; as well as the movie version of &quot;Silence,&quot; I eagerly anticipated the arrival of &quot;Hannibal.&quot;Now that I've finished, I can say I came away from the experience with mixed emotions. The book, taken as a whole, was a disappointment for me. I did enjoy many sections of &quot;Hannibal,&quot; but as I reached the climax I began to regard the characters and situations incredulously. The ending I found to be completely unbelievable. I suspect the ending of the book will be one of the biggest points of debates among readers. It's impossible to say whether or not the situations described in the ending are to be taken literally, or if they are in fact something else entirely. Thomas Harris is a talented writer, and I suspect that what happens to the characters at the conclusion of the book may not necessarily reflect the reality of the rest of the book.It also seems to me that someone like Dr. Lecter would view pop psychology as nonsense, yet Harris explains away Hannibal Lecter (and Clarice Starling) in that type of context."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Terrible ending. Although I enjoyed Krendler's ultimate fate, Lecter and Starling's ending was unbelievable and a total disappointment. Starling would never! Also, throughout the book, I thought Harris showed too much of Dr. Lecter's human weakness (childhood trauma, etc.) --taking away from Hannibal the Cannibal's creepy mystique."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After having read the previous reviews, I was surprised by how much people either loved or hated this book. For me &quot;fun&quot; sums it right up. I loved The Silence of the Lambs and this was a well-thought, sometimes disgusting, enjoyable time. Give it a break, and don't expect the best writing ever, it is Hannibal Lector for crying out loud! And what an ending! That was worth it for me and I've been thinking about it since I put it down. I even re-read it to make sure I got it right. Did she really do that? Then it seems believable and disgustingly enough, exactly what this reader wanted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris a genius, gutsy, bonechilling, gutwrenching writer...if you only read one book this year, read this, you won't be sorry. Loved the ending, never would have guessed the writer would do it. What nerve, what wonderment of mind, what a reward for followers of Clarice and Hannibal. Speaking of which, where is the sequal to Hannibal? Had to read and stop, read and stop, did not want the story to end. Harris, we salute you!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the Dutch translation and I was very impressed and at the same time terrified by having two apparant contrary concepts: horror and respect so closely related.Good and bad can be seperated and judged very easily if they don't occur at the same time. In this book that border isn't that clear at all. That border meanders and makes the book extremely interesting, because my own reality is being questioned. I love it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is called &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Surely everybody expected the book to be an insight into the realm of Dr. Lecter. And isnt that exactly what we got? A vivid look into his mind, and an understanding of his dimensions, and explanation to what he seeks. A truly terrifying and absolutly fascinating invitation in to the imagination of a monster. This memorypalace is a place where innovation, beauty, nightmares and absolute terror goes hand in hand. Its roofs harbours more than just good and evil. It is frightening and wonderfull at the same time. It is the single most incredible description of a genious mind that i have ever read. Who cares about the rest?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story was chopped into painfull small chapters averaging less than 7 pages that wander."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read Black Sunday, Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs, I was very psyched to read this novel. Unfortunately, the feeling soon passed as I got further into the novel. Weak character development and a meandering plot transformed this into a novel that is revolting rather than terrifying. The ending is the worst of all. Unbelievable and saddening at the same time. Ugh, I don't believe I've been as disappointed in a novel in a very long time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love Thomas Harris's series. I also loved this book, until the end. I felt the book was too gory, even more so than his other books. Don't get me wrong, I love a certain element of gore but this was ridiculous and wasn't warrented. I was extremly dissapointed with the ending and felt that Harris had ruined terrific characters. Read it for what it is, a sequel to Silence. The first one is always the best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Frankly I found the audio cassette version fairly impossible to listen to and stopped. One's time could be definitely better spent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...but I can't agree with them. If you are looking for simple, single-level reading, Hannibal is not for you. But if you are looking for really good writing (yeah, you will get gore too for your money ;) this book is the best thing I have read in years, and I am &quot;an omnivorous reader&quot;. Harris describes his characters without judging them. They are monsters, or they are angels. Or both. Harris seems to think he is not to judge them. And that makes the book so good. I wish my English were better you I could truly say how much I loved Hannibal. I am Spanish, sorry. But I can tell you, the book will get top marks when I write my piece about mistery books this month."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Worth a read for fans, but wait for the paperback or get it at the library. Clarice is a wimp, and for that matter, so is Dr Lecter - he's not really evil, just had a bad experience with his sister (Typical '90s - there's an excuse for everything). Not in the same league as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, hard to believe Thomas Harris wrote this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've got to say that this book isnt for everyone, because of the shocking ending. Half the fans will love it, half despise it. But I think you have to really admire that amount of risk-taking in an author. And holy cow, what a stunner he's come up with! I felt punched in the stomach after finishing.I also have to add that he's really done it again with the secondary villain, Mason Verger. This guy really gives you the chills -- I guess Harris thinks up as loathesome a character as possible so you feel less bad about rooting for Hannibal.there's also a priceless scene with Hannibal on an airplane, riding economy class with the tourists. It's wonderful.I doubt they'll ever make the movie of this (its just too extreme) - but if they do, I hope they don't change a thing. . ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is not a book that did much for me. I loved Silence of the Lambs. It kept me on the edge of my seat. This book, however, just left me wondering what the author was thinking once I reached the end! I had high expectations, but they were quickly deflated. Although there were some aspects of the book that I liked, its conclusion really just cancelled those out for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book! I peeked at the ending when first getting starting and rolled my eyes, but now I'm glad he ended it the way he did. Beautifully written and disgusting all at the same time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I usually use reading as a sleeping-aid, but this book kept me intrested until I just was too tired to keep reading. This book only got four stars because I was disappointed with the ending. Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling seem to get out of character toward the end. It is still worth picking up. Harris is great at putting disturbing images in your head."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the entire book over the course of this afternoon. It was fun, and had one truly great moment in my opinion. But the rest seemed like the plot of a comic book. Not a well-written comic, but a cheesy Preacher rip-off. Harris created great characters like Clarice and Hannibal in the last book and ruined them in this one. It seemed like he was writing the book as if it was a movie, yet if they made a movie from this book, I don't think anyone would watch it, even if Hopkins, Foster, and Demme were involved."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"the actual writing was hard to digest but the plot was good and tasty to follow. i loved reading about clarice and her emerging personality especially since i didn't have to hear Jodie Foster's annoying accent. The ending was completely unexpected and i believe i'm still in denial. During the ending, I would read a page and start screaming,&quot;No way! No way!&quot; I can't wait for the movie because i know they won't keep the ending. definitely worth the time to read at least once."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris' other books featuring Lecter, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, were pretty good reads. Hannibal, however, is as poorly crafted a book as I've read in a while. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I am not eager to read his next book, which will appear sometime in 2008, no doubt."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow! I am still reeling 3 days after finishing this book! This has got to be considered brilliant if for no other reason than the empathy you come to feel with Lecter, his childhood explained. My God! Harris forces you to UNDERSTAND Lecter's motives and rationale for cannibalism; not as uncivilized brutality, but as terrible pain filtered through a brilliant mind. The most substantial book of this decade."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Read this book to find out just how NOT to write a book. Nothing in this book was original, interesting, scarry... This is a truley terrible read. It is time for harris to pull away from his writing pen and begin finding another way to make some money. Unfortunetly, people will buy this book because of his previous works, which were only good because at the time, everyone wanted to be an expert in murder cases he so obviously fails to write well about...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If I could, I'd give this book no stars in the ranking. I definately do not recommend reading this book. Hopefully the movie will be better. It can't be worse. I loved Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs. The respective movies were also very entertaining. I could not wait to get my hands on the latest novel, Hannibal. Thanks to the strength of the first two novels and Hannibal's character, this book was captivating. That is, until the ending. I had a hard time finishing the book. The ending diverged so much from the story and from the characters Harris spent so much time developing. Nonetheless, I held out hope for an exciting ending. What a let down!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; carried the torch of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; high and bright. It was a great continuation of the saga of evil. Hannibal Lector is the metaphor for the elite percentage of the population that controls all the wealth and feeds off the rest of us like a killer whale through a school of herring. Clarice is the seduced or corrupted &quot;average&quot; with a gift who buys into the glitter after defeat at the hands of the mediocre. Paced just right with the off balancing twist of too many bad guys. There are no innocents in this story only various degrees of corruption. All in all paced well, told well and somewhere between Anne Rice and Patricia Cornwell in believability. I loved it and was lost in the descriptions and diversions."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; carried the torch of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; high and bright.

The truth is, those of us who are transgender or gay are most often the victims of horrible crimes, not their purpetrators. In the last year alone, that has included 6 transgender victims, at least one so badly beaten and stabbed family members were barely able to identify the remains.By perpetuating the stereotypes of us as evil, depraved villains, Harris only makes our oppressions and our lives that much more difficult. By ignoring it, readers and reviewers encourage other authors to do the same."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's too photographic; too screenplay. Even when we are invited by Harris to visit Dr. Lechter's mind, all you find is foyers, Giotto frescoes and Phidias bronze statues adorning a thousand rooms and miles of corridors. I guess Harris killed two birds with one shot: The book and a screenplay. The axiom here is paper can hold anything. The movie might be worthwhile. fernado"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading Hannibal today, and I am very dissapointed. After reading and watching Silence of the Lambs, I expected that Hannibal would be a very enjoyable book. I was certainly wrong. First, the deaths of characters from the original books ruined the story in itself. It would have been a much better book if the ending had been different. If Harris write another sequel, it better start out with Clarice waking up, and saying the words &quot;Wow, It was all a dream&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The sensationalism competed to strongly with the plot.

Unfortunately, this is not how I would describe Hannibal. I couldn't wait to be done with this book so I could read something else!

I did enjoy the ending--but it could not make up for the other 200 pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After more than 9 years waiting to find out what happened to the horrible Hannibal Lecter, I was put off and disappointed with the writing which is so obviously the basis for a screenplay (description of the entrance scenes into Hannibal's rooms is all stage direction and direction for painters and lighting folks!I have not gotten past the first 150 pages and find it hard to drive myself forward. Unfortunately having peeked at disappointing ending in others comments, I am not sure I would want to continue.He'll be lucky to get a maximum caliber actor like Anthony Hopkins to reprise the role!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really can't believe I was roped in by the hype. It seems as though Hollywood was calling the shots on this movie as opposed to an accomplished writer!The beginning was slow boring.

Hannibal was more grossing than engrossing, but still I ate it up quicker than a certain bad boy's brains got consumed. Margo is a particularly vivid character. Cast Demi Moore in the movie. The aforementioned Jack Nicholson could have a lot of fun with Mason."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a tremendous disappointment. The intelligence of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs is no where to be found in this tepid, stupid, gory for no reason sequel. Life's too short to waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I didn't think the hype could be true. I &quot;discovered&quot; Thomas Harris before &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and found his books frighteningly real and incredibly readable. When I read in a magazine that he was finally coming out with a new book and that it featured &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal,&quot; I was prepared to be completely, cynically disappointed.I read &quot;Hannibal&quot; in one sitting-- not sleeping until far, far into the night because I simply couldn't put the book down. I was mesmerized, horrified, fascinated, angry, sad, and, weirdly, sympathetic.Don't let anyone tell you what happens-- BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First off, I'd like to say that I was a little disappointed by it, after reading the brilliant Silence of the Lambs, I expected another masterpiece, which Hannibal isn't, but instead we get this book that draws us into this world of Dr. Lector, and doesn't let us go. I cannot express in words how I felt about the ending, except that I found it incredibly scary for it to happen, and that it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was also skeptical about reading this book after reading the synopsis. Avoid any prejudgement, read this for what it is: a real horror novel like the ones Clive Barker used to write."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a completely unworthy sequel, and I can't imagine seeing it come to film. Which, in the end, is a good thing. Harris seems fixated on being as repulsive as possible, and frankly, there's very little value to a work of literature when all it can boast is SHOCK value. Terrible, and disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a huge fan of Harris, I ran to the nearest bookstore last Tuesday morning... I could have walked... and had breakfast along the way... 1. The plot feels forced, like Harris was writing off other people's suggestions. 2. Characters such as Barney, Clarice, and Dr. Lecter seem to have changed in personality in ways that don't fit their character... but have to, to fit the book. 3. The ending is silly. 4. Parts of the major plot are silly. 5. Too much detail in areas that don't matter and not enough in places that would have been interesting.As a book on it's own it's OK. As a book by Thomas Harris and a follow-up to Silence of the Lambs -- Dissapointing. Read Red Dragon.With all of that I still read it in a few hours."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Hannibal&quot; last night, and while I must admit I'm still a little foggy on the ending, over all it was an ok time. &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Episode 1&quot; (the film)both had 1 major road block: hype. Did Star Wars live up to ALL the hype? Not in my opinion. Was &quot;Hannibal&quot; the greatest book sequal of all time? Hardly. But you could certainly find worse out there this summer."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People read (or saw) SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and came to associate Hannibal Lecter with the embodiemnt of evil. For Harris to turn him to the book's central focus and something of a sympathetic character is fine; a very interesting twist. However, the rest of the characters here are boring and one-dimensional. Mason Verger? Please! His huge revenge plot is almost laughable. The scenes in Italy read like a phone book. Overall, a waste of $25.00. James Ellroy once wrote that he wanted to be as good a writer as Harris. If this is Harris' new standard, Ellroy will have no problem."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A huge fan of The Silence of the Lambs, I anticpated the next installment. Harris is an excellent writer and I was up late at night reading Hannibal. However, the ending had much to be desired and I was very disappointed. I'll stick to Silence of the Lambs, a truely five star thriller and Harris's best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A poorly written, (passages are actually repeated word for word) underimagined and subpar effort. Like much of modern cinema, this novel substitutes excess for inspiration. And, I'm sure this was written with 'screenplay' in mind. I was very, very disappointed. Save your bucks for the film, which , and I don't say this often, has to be better than the book. Instead read: Dan Simmons or Robert McCammon for an adventure, horror, fantasy ride that never dips."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with the readers who said that the first 400 of so pages were good. Yes, the descriptions of food and sights in Florence did tend to get a little tedious, but I felt it revealed something of Hannibal's character. However, the ending was very condescending and &quot;out-of-character.&quot; I actually reread the last few chapters trying to figure out what I had &quot;missed&quot;-- did Clarice perhaps have the same &quot;surgery&quot; as Krendler? What exactly happened between them? I did not like the ending, and almost felt rushed through the ending. What happened to the warrior that Hannibal respected so much?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read....second only to the one I haven't read yet. Given that Mr. Harris had a decade to cook up this mess, he should be ashamed of himself. It took Joyce a decade to write &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&quot;. It took Harris that long to write an incoherant book with incomplete sentences, thoughts, and an ending that makes no sense at all!!! Where on earth is the editor who let this stuff pass??? And did Stephen King read the same book I did? Kathy Bates should make Harris rewrite this mess. After forcing myself to read &quot;Hannibal&quot;, I was the one in Misery!!! Save your money and save a tree."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was a great horror-fiction book. The end was a little to be desired, I mean Lecter and Starling that is gross. Harris did great on the overall plot though Hannibal does not even come close to matching The Silence of the Lambs. Overall Hannibal was good but nowhere near great."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk! What a sad waste of an audience's attention; and a poor ending to interesting characters. The story line was so rediculous as to actually have succeeded in making me angry! Heaven forbid this should be made into a movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was one of the most bizarre and exciting books I've read lately. The ending was unexpected and, therefore, delicious. I even enjoyed what one reader referred to as the &quot;Florentine travelogue section&quot;; as I may never get to visit Florence, I found it interesting. Maybe most readers wanted Mr. Harris to rehash &quot;Silence&quot; and have all the characters do the predictable. Too bad. It's a good story and I for one give it two thumbs up. My friend, Mary, gave this to me as a birthday present. I've thanked her a million times!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris attempts Wolfe-esque description of Florence, Dante, and Renaissance art... and falls completely flat. And I wasn't aware that Hannibal was the evil version of superman: faster than a speeding bullet, able to kill massive quantities of highly-trained professionals in a single swoop. Nor was I aware that Hannibal was the genetic recombination of James Bond and Dante. THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY REDICULOUS AND WORTHLESS. Pull $20 our of your wallet and burn it... at least that way you will get your money's worth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not wait to read this book and now I wish I hadn't. It was a bad book. It is as simple as that - one bad book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'd like to give it minus stars, but I don't have a choice it seems. I too looked forward to this book and put everything down to begin reading it. I started it on a cross country plane trip -- not too bad. The middle was in the hotel the next night -- boring and pretty stupid. The end was the next night and I forced myself to stay awake to finish it -- I didn't believe it could end on such a disappointing note. And I wasn't wrong! It was worse! It was stupid and gratuitous. Harris was disrespectful of not only his readers who have been awaiting this sequel, but to Clarice and even Hannibal. They both deserved better than this foolish ending. I hope Harris doesn't plan another sequel -- and pray that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins stay far far away from this bomb and embarrasment. I warned readers of the book I saw on the plane home not to waste their time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Had Hannibal stayed in Florence, we might have had another Harris masterpiece. All of the elements - the hint of genious, the dark impulses, the refined taste - were there. Suspense - would Clarice solve the case? Would Hannibal outsmart his foes? - was there. And Harris was on top of his game describing the history of Florence, the characters' motivation, and inviting us into this world.But god help us - once Hannibal showed up on these shores, the book tood a dive. Hannibal is reduced to a star-crossed lover, taking risks that no half-wit (let alone a genious) would take. He spends half the book setting up a meal for Clarice... the results of which are not only revolting, they are inexplicable. How can you reconcile the Starling from this book with the Starling from Silence of the Lambs?It appears that Harris would have us believe that like the moths from Jame Gumb's dungeon, Starling has grown wings and evolved. Instead, it appears that Harris has chosen to go for a cheap stunt - and we're left wondering what might have happened had we been treated to a real evolution. What a shame."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First, a word of warning. If you haven't read (and loved) The Silence of the Lambs, don't go near this one. If you have, prepare yourself for a roller coaster ride, consisting of (upward slope) a police procedural a la Ed McBain, then (first downslide) a Poe-esque vignette of Gothic revenge in the spirit of &quot;The Casque of Amontillado&quot;, followed by a James Bond thriller (both uphill and down) with Hannibal Lecter as Bond and Clarice Starling as The Bond Girl, and finally a Lewis Carrollian finish at a Mad Tea party that will leave you wondering if you should have been reading this with a hashish pipe at hand. (Answer: No. All hallucinogens have been supplied by the author.) The bottom line is this: It's never boring. Confusing, perhaps, but never boring. And I actually like the ending, though I suspect I'm in the minority here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Almost immediately I was captivated...feeling at once familiar with the charachter of Clarice and the machinations of her job with the FBI. The story is captivating as the author takes you through a maze of enticing and revolting developments especially in the character of Mason. Lecter's time in Florence was particularly interesting and enjoyable...one almost delights completely in his intelligent treacherous trickery not to mentions the aesthetic description of art, music and especially food! Harris delights in whetting one's palate simultaneously for pleasure and horror."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a huge fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I felt guilty for hating this sequal as much as I do. I was sadly relieved that I was not alone in my disappointment. I'll try not to repeat the other reviewers' complaints except to stress how utterly stupid the ending was. The rest of the book was okay, tolerable, but definitely not up to the author's previous work. I hope that when the movie is made, Hollywood had the good sense to change the insulting and ridiculous ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not sure Thomas Harris even wrote this book--the ending destroyed a so-so book.It was his characters I loved the best so I was appalled at what he did... Harris made Hannibal look misunderstood when he introduced Mason--not to mention his sibling.I can't believe he ended this book like this--it's a betrayal of the readers as well as Starling and Hannibal .I loved the interplay between them in &quot;silence&quot;--now it's reduced to a soap opera.Thank God for Barney--at least he remained true to his heart.It wasn't worth a ten year wait and if they make it into a movie, my advice is to change the ending cause this dog will not hunt!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was excellent, except for in some parts when some lines read like a play and the fact that Clarice Starling seemed a little to &quot;brute-ish&quot; and not as quiet and &quot;nice&quot; as she was in the original. I felt the ending was a nice shock, the scenes were good and vivid (yes, and quite sickening), and the characters were drawn nicely. Excellent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Oh the disappointment! The total-sell out! How could he! It's tripe! It's one-dimensional! Non-existant plot! Woof!Now, let's take this step by step.Hannibal is a good book. Flawed, but well-written and exciting. And being positive and constructive people, we will start by talking about everything that Harris did right.Pun unintended, the characters are all rich and tasty. Mason Verger makes for an delicious villain - his wrath is believable, as is his vigorous quest for revenge. It would have been very easy for Harris to turn him into some Khan-like Shakespear-quoting devil manifistation, yet he veers away from it, much like he veered away from it in the creation of Lecter himself. The Verger scenes are all gnash-your-teeth in apprehension, particularly the &quot;Kitty Cat&quot; sub-plot which, in my opinion, is an excellent example of using two pages of dialog to create a character who is truly sinister without going over the top.Clarice and Lecter are both handled deftly, and the story, right up until the end of the book is defintely a collar-grabber.Is the ending problematic? Yes it is. Is the book ridicolous or one-dimensional? Absoloutely not. I believe that many of us have confused the character that Jody Foster played in the film with the character that Harris created in his novels, and yet the two are different in many ways.While the argument about Clarice's last few scenes in the book will, I'm sure, continue for a while (they will, no doubt, be absent in the film adapatation), let's first give the devil his due. Harris is not an idiot, and &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not a WWF event, where characters can go from pure good to pure evil within one commercial break. Does it all make sense? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't, but let's try to keep in mind the fact that underneath our bickering lies a well-thought-out piece of fiction. It might not be perfect, but it is certainly worth a read. I wish I could say the same about some of the so called &quot;reviews&quot;, above.Speaking of which, has anyone noticed a vague resemblence between the majority of the opions above and a pack of hungry animals, sensing the kill? I'm sure that an outsider, looking at Mason's instruments of revenge would have had a hard time telling them apart; after reading this page, I felt much the same."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i thought it was just wonderful. lecter is up to his old tricks and even a few new curves were thrown in. a definate read for those who enjoy this type of book"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the book again and read the reader reviews, and there seems to be great controversy about Clarisse's character. The ending is still disturbing and hard to take, but readers who think Clarisse is a cardboard cutout at the end should reread those chapters again. It throws Lecter's villainy into higher relief, shows Clarisse can still match wits with Lecter, and sets up some very interesting possiblities for a sequel, if there is one. I agree, though, that it will be tough to bring this to the screen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What starts out as a hauntingly eerie flashback to the personal drama of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, ends with the biggest disappointment in literary history. Most of us who came to the wonderfully drawn characters of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter as a result of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, were expecting more of the psychological thriller from the original story. Instead, Clarice is left out in the cold (for a good 300 pages) while Lecter meanders through a silly, violent scheme by a former patient to capture and slaughter him as an act of revenge. What should have concluded with more of Lecter's attempts to draw Clarice out of her self-imposed nightmares, ends with a silly, drug-induced romance. This book is a nightmare for those of us who expected a psychological thriller in which Clarice Starling, through Hannibal Lecter's continued torments, became the strong heroine she was destined to become in full maturity. Thomas Harris has wasted ten years of his life for this hopeless drivel?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I haven't read silence of the lambs so I have no basis for comparison. I was entertained by hannibal just I would be curious about looking at a car accident to see if I see anything interesting---but then if you do see something, you wish you didn't. Harris is an incredible writer but the story goes a little overboard. Some of the killings seem like Harris tried to come up with the most disgusting concepts and place it in the story. I am not easily grossed out. I am a doctor by profession an I generally can tolerate gross things but Hannibal had some hardcore parts. Otherwise, the book is interesting. I think the movie will be good. I would not recommend this book to people who are easily grossed out though!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I first started reading Hannibal I read reviews and I talked to friends, all of which said that the book betrayed Clarice Starling's character. I would totally have to disagree. If you read this book carefully you can see why the ending happened the way it happened. I think that it is a rather bizarre ending, but I think that Thomas Harris was very creative with the ending and when I got to it, I wasn't as shocked or surprised as people said I'd be.I think that Thomas Harris was very bold in writing the ending as he did. I commend him and would recommend this book to anyone who has a strong stomach (It is a bit gory)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Seven years after Hannibal Lecter escaped police custody in Memphis, he is living in Italy under the guise of a quiet yet elegant scholarly professor. After a drug raid gone bad, Agent Clarice Starling is suspended from the FBI, and the only one of Dr Lector's victims to survive-Mason Verger, is planning the ultimate revenge against him.This book is written in a very creative prose, but is not for the weak hearted. The violent scenes are described in graphic detail along with various unsavory characters. Harris Thomas's pacing is excellent in that he keeps the reader guessing up until the final chapter. This novel also gives the reader more insight than before into the background of Hannibal Lector and how he came to be.Like many of those that have reviewed this book, I was disappointed with the ending and how the author chose to treat Clarice Starling's character in the end. But for fans of the suspense and horror genre, this book is still a winner."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the sequel to the hit book The Silence of the Lambs. This long awaited book, by author Thomas Harris, brings back Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector in another thriller. When we last left off, Lector was on the loose. Now, an ex-victim, Mason Verger, is hunting him down. This sick, twisted man seeks Clarice Starling's expertise to get his revenge against Lector. I felt that this was a well-written book, but did not live up to it's expectations. I thought that his previous books, Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs were better. A surprising ending does make things interesting, but I felt it took away from the story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book was great, amazing, and fabulous, but jeeeeezzzz, you look at the reviews and they tell this book is horrifyingly scary, then you read it and say &quot;Well, that was a good book, but it wasn't scary&quot;. Maybe I just don't get scared from books, but I'll tell you one thing, if this was a movie, I'd see it right away. You see, you feel more suspense in a movie when you see the setting and the characters. Look what happened with &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It won best picture. But, don't get me wrong, you should really read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of Thomas Harris' previous books, I was excited to read his newest offering. I was very disappointed with this book, because it seemed like he was forced to write it. He introduces new characters in every chapter, but as a reader you never quite care for them. We know that they will eventually be Hannibal's victims. I was most disappointed with the ending and understand why Jodie Foster would not want to do the sequel. It is against her character and it seems that Harris didn't know how to end the book. It was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must wonder what this book would seem like without having seen Silence of the lambs as a movie. The first chapter unfolds like a movie script, and images of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster fill the places of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling as the story progresses. So be it.I am not about to spoil your reading experience by revealing crucial plot details, but can (and will) say that this is a masterpiece of modern suspense writing. The gripping plot, the wonderfully elaborate characters, and the chance to look inside Hannibal Lecter's twisted genius mind are treats not to be missed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is one of those books that you read in a mere few days at most, a thrilling, rollar-coaster ride of a book that keeps you guessing and on the edge--and may scare you a bit. Hannibal Lector is an intriguing character, at the same time heroic and repulsive, just and vengeful, polite and disgusting. Harris allows the reader to peer through Lector's eyes and as the world sees him. The book even has an amazing ability through its characters to entice readers to perhaps privately reveal a side of the &quot;raw&quot; self that exists in all of us, even if only for a few pages. I read this book in two days and could not put it down. The ending is a fantastic climax to a crescendo book! Harris has done it again. I hope that the Lector saga continues!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed with Harris' latest. I don't like what Harris did with Clarice's character. And when I didn't think it could get any worse, I got to the ending. I can see why Jodie Foster didn't want anything to do with the movie!! I felt like I was reading a screenplay, this novel was &quot;too Hollywood&quot; for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this book because I had read Black Sunday and wanted to experience the same feeling of suspence. No comparisons. Story apart, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is just poorly written. This book is simply terrible. Harris has no sense of pause or suspense; most chapters cut off at the wrong time. In addition, the dialogues are extremely poor, and the characters are shallow as shallow is the book. I love to read, so long as the material is readable. My advice? Do not waste your precious time and money to buy and read Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It drags on and on, with a hard-to-believe ending.Violence is used as a substitute for plot, and at times is so far out, that it's like watching professional wrestling.Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found it dragged in places. I thought most of the characters fascinating but sickening. I was a bit disappaointed in &quot;Barney&quot; and didn't like what happened to Clarice Starling at the end. I'd would like to see a prequel to all the books that deal with Hannibal that tells how he was origially caught."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited, along with all of Harris' other fans, for his next book to be published. I was excited, as I am sure the others were, when I heard it would be a follow-up to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. When I finally was able to start reading this long awaited tome, I was delighted that it followed the pattern of the previous book. As I got farther along in the book it started to become disjointed. The explanation of Lecter's condition seems to be an afterthought and was not explored beyond a few paragraphs. In his previous works the disclosure of the life of Francis Dollarhyde and Jame Gumb were highlights of the books. Lecter's previous life seemed to be a throwaway.... An &quot;oh, by the way, this is why he eats his victims&quot;. The final chapters were disappointing and seem to have been written with a movie script in mind. Most of the book was enjoyable but the ending was a BIG letdown."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found the bizarre violence to be an attempt by Harris to outdo his previous novels. He may have suceeded but it is not nearly as good as Red Dragon. The ending is disappointing and totally out of character for Clarice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like Cyrano de Bergerac, Hannibal Lecter will never lose his panache. Witty, suave, and preternaturally cool, the omnipotent Lecter evades his would-be captors at all turns and proves that a razor-sharp brain and sang froid are more than a match for weapons, ravening maws, and vengeful demons. He sees all, he remembers everything, he is stronger than an ox, his taste in truffles and wine is impeccable. (With all that going for him, whatever possessed him to go into psychiatry?) He starts to look vulnerable at times, but he upholds our faith in him and survives his tribulations dignity intact. The most important key to his survival is his capture and conversion of Clarice Starling. Having planted the seeds of love in Silence of the Lambs, he woos her delicately from afar, and contrives a conclusion that assures his safety for the rest of his life. We know that the FBI, underfunded and mismanaged by Washington boors as it is, will never manage to lay hands on him. He is far too clever to be captured by mere Italian cops. No, there are only two people in the world who could possibly run him down. One is Starling. The other, of course, is the nasty perverted billionaire Mason Verger. (Have you ever read The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair? What a foul industry meat packing is!) Mason can capture Lecter because he, too, has a mind that can manipulate a network of other people into carrying out his wishes. His money helps, but the real secret of his success is his ability, polished by therapy with Lecter, to talk people into doing his will. Lecter escapes because he has cultivated Starling. He survives by making her his own. In the process of tracking Lecter, she learns about taste, guided by his purchasing habits and inadvertently preparing herself to become his partner. When the malodorous Sardinians seize him, she dashes to his rescue; how could she not, after the lovely birthday present he had just given her? She frees him, but loses herself in the process. But who can complain about such an ending? Unlikely, yes, but isn't it what we wished could happen at the End of Silence of the Lambs? How tragic it was, that the relationship between Starling and Lecter was doomed to be a love that dare not speak its name. How satisfying that Clarice has finally found a man who can keep her in the fashion to which she clearly wanted to become accustomed, and can serve up her enemies in beurre noisette to boot. The 1990s have been the decade of the serial killer. It is only fitting that 1999 conclude with a fairy tale featuring a handsome prince in the guise of a murderer and cannibal who has more taste and dignity than anyone and, unlike Superman, does not have to relinquish his power to possess the woman he loves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book started off with good intentions with the drug bust and Ms. Starling being in the picture. I got totally confused ( and still do not understand ) what the storyline in Italy had to do with the rest of the book. The ending got better when we got back to the Starling and Hannibal interactions. The ending was an interesting twist that I don't think most readers were expecting. Overall, my long wait for Hannibal, and the time it took to get throught it, was a waste of time. I'll cross my fingers that maybe the movie will be better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's really only 2 1/2 stars. Felt like the entire book was written as a screenplay, knowing it would have to be adapted in to a movie. Also, felt it tried too hard to reference contemporary news/events (various mentions right out of the headlines) - - it was too obvious and only served to bring me back to reality versus allowing me to get deeper into the story. Ending, without giving away, seemed way out of character for all involved - - sorry Thomas, still a big fan of Red Dragon and Silence, but this one wasn't nearly as strong."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' latest book, Hannibal, comes across as less a novel than a piece of classical art. The journey he takes the reader on is funny, frightening and unique to his own style of storytelling. As a fan of all Harris' material, from Black Sunday through Silence of the lambs, I feel I can definitely say that this is his strongest work. Hannibal has been called 'one of the most sadistic books ever written' by Time Magazine but nothing could be further from the truth. This is a sweeping saga that ties up all the loose ends from his previous FBI thrillers (Silence &amp; Red Dragon) and provides a conclusion that is better than anyone could have hoped. Although the ending is horrifying it is also beautifully poetic, the calm way in which Harris describes scenes of the blackest horror only adds to the atmosphere. I cannot ever remember reading a book where I felt queasy and yes, even frightened to turn the page because of what I thought was coming. I won't spoil any plot details, it suffices to say that this novel is a sweeping, breathtaking masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I applaud Harris for resisting the temptation to rewrite Silence of the Lambs. The ending worked for me, in an appropriately creepy way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the first two books and about halfway through &quot;Hannibal&quot; I considered the various ways this book could end. Unfortunately, my very favorite ending seemed way too daring. I admit it... I sold this author short and didn't think he could do it. Well to my delight, he not only did it, he did it deliciously well. Many thanks for the best read in a long time!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great Book! Thomas Harris spins a tale of horror like no other write. The book is so descriptive that it feels like your can see, touch, and smell every thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Personally, I feel that this was the worst book of the Lector series. It is not that it is not well written. Like all of Harris' books, it is written in a simple but compelling style that keeps you going until the end. The problem is with the ending, which doesn't really make sense in the context of the book. I won't spoil it here, but what I will say is that I had heard the ending was \\"controversial\\". I expected it to be controversial just because of goriness or violence or whatever--now that I've read it, I think it was \\"controversial\\" because it just really didn't make sense in terms of character development. It seemed like Harris was just trying to get in a twist ending. Who knows. Interesting read though--you have to read it if you are into the Lector books, just know that it is not perfect."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Red Dragon is my favorite out of the Hannibal Lector series. I got through the that and Silence of the Lambs in a day or so each. When it came to Hannibal, I found myself not as edge-of-my-seat until the last few chapters. But hell, the last few chapters were maybe the best in all of the series! I'll spare the details as I've seen many other reviewers say my exact complaints, but if this was any other author it would get five stars, but since I expected so much from Thomas Harris, this gets a four. Still a fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is a terrific writer. I am not generally a mystery lover, but this book holds my attention. I like Harris's style, and I appreciate the references to history and his use of Italian. A few chapters back I was getting a bit depressed because I thought the book lacked comic relief. Then, there is the flight Lecter takes from Paris to Detroit. It had me howling with laughter with the descriptions of the seats (a little more space than the African slave ships), the food (swill), the people, the kid trying to get a bite of his sandwich, the mother and the diaper, the recycled farts....Maybe it wasn't meant to be funny, but I found it so. Lecter is a sicko but at the same time one appreciates his incredible mental facility, his taste (no pun intended) for good living.If anybody can explain this, I would appreciate it. How is it that the flight from Paris to Detroit is heading eastward? Strange.I liked the first half, but the second half is way to creepy. OK, it's supposed to be creepy, but there is too much of the cannibalism thing which I don't find entertaining."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Here we are again with the brilliant genius Dr. Lecter in this one we see Clarice and Lecters love and relationship bloom and blossom into something more than just being friendly I loved the ending where Lecter and Clarice become lovers i liked the movie but enjoyed the book's ending much much more"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Firstly, let me state that anyone that has enjoyed Silence of The Lambs and Red Dragon, novel or film, should approach Hannibal with an open mind. The problem that many people who read Hannibal failed to realize that this is a totally different animal entirely. This is a horror and not a thriller; Really not departure from the series since the antagonists were not mere serial killers but beasts. The main antagonist in Hannibal, Mason Verger, is easily far more repulsive, in apperance in personality, then in any previous Lecter book. Verger was violently maimed by Lecter years prior and he's desperate for revenge. His choice for punishment ? Having the good doctor eaten alive by boars. As Mason plans his revenge, the book explores Clarice and her loss of faith in the FBI and Lecter being persued by a corrupt Italian police Inspector who's life ends as one of Lecter's brilliant artworks.The title of the book is Hannibal for a reason. For the first time, Hannibal is truly let loose. If you love the character, this yarn will not dissappoint. We finally get the inside dope on how Lecter thinks, an elaborate memory palace which he constructed to remember everything he consumes and recollects and not without it's ugly side. Even the doctor has memories he rather forget. Of course, less is more. Lecter, in person, does not consume the novel but what Thomas Harris does is make his influence felt throughout the book. Nobody is ever the same after an intimate encounter with Lecter and a sea of destruction and avarice follows him. Clarice Starling is definetly the most promient example of being too close to the doctor. Years of killing and contempt from her superiors has isolated Starling into a miserable life without meaning and her only solace is thinking about Lecter.I know most hate the ending and I won't spoil it for you but if you simply apply logic, it all makes sense. Ever since Starling was introduced, her motivations have always been about finding happiness in her miserable life and she finally got the ending she deserved. The same can be said for Lecter as well. Darkly operatic and haunting, Hannibal is the appropriate ending to Thomas Harris's brilliant saga."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read this book about 15 times. It's one of my favorite books of all time. If you are an audiobook fan, get this book on unabridged audiobook. The narrator brings out the rich colorful narrative and well written dialog of the story and characters that Thomas Harris creates."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. It is not for the faint of heart but most already nkwo that. The details are wonderful and parts of the book just jump off the page. The ending was the only thign that one might have issues with because it is not open ended, but speicific."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a good read but not 5 star quality like RED DRAGON or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. This said, the book is worth your while to read.What's missing from this book is the broken glass terrorism of the earlier books. Clarice is now a 'Jack Ryan' clone, able to leap over tall buildings with a single bound. Hannibal is a poodle, not a wild wolf."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is back and he brings back with him all vicious darkness that Thomas Harris has created in this series. Still playing a good game of hide and seek, we join him a few years later running from the people that want him dead or in the loony bin. He manages to stay away from them but not for long sad to say. Hannibal is now meeting some old friends of his that he must take care of, the first of which may help him deal with the death of his beloved sister that was murdered when he was just a child. It seems that Hannibal can not stay out of trouble where ever he goes. One thing that Hannibal can't help but want is Clarice Starling, an FBI agent who came to him for help to capture the Buffalo Bill Killer in Silence of the Lambs. She fascinates him because he can't understand her like most people he meets, and he also see's his dead sister in her. She does the most unexpected things toward him and can be one of the most entertaining subjects he interacts with.The book Hannibal will make any room seem dark once you begin to read its story. It is a brain teaser just trying to understand Hannibal and his criminal mind. The question that will always pop up in the story, is Dr. Hannibal Lector truly doing these deeds with good intentions or with none at all? It is up to the reader to decide which one fits their own views of him. The thing I like most about this book is Hannibal himself. He is such a terrifying criminal that I don't want to imagine him being real. The thing I don't like about this book is the unexpected ending you receive, it is such a surprise!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was anxious to read this, the follow up to the truly creepy Silence of the Lambs. Harris does not, in my opinion, deliver the goods that many probably expected. The first book had Lecter deal more with psychological elements than this, which deals more with Lecter's victim. There should have been scenes between the two of them, that's what I was waiting for, but... The book does move fast but then Harris screws up at the end. I won't spoil it, but it's corny as hell. Instead of Hannibal the Cannibal, the next book should be called Hannibal:Cannibal and Lover. Hollywood should have read the novel before wasting time and energy on a bidding war for this at (few)times gruesome, yet overly uninteresting book. If it took Harris seven years to write this, that's sad. Note to Harris: We, along with Hollywood, can wait much longer for your next installment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must say, considering the circumstances, this is the most utterly disappointing novel of the decade. Harris wrote one of the most interesting suspense novels ever with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; which was turned into an equally compelling movie. He has worked on &quot;Hannibal&quot; for 11 years and this is what he has come up with? &quot;Hannibal&quot; starts off as an average book and ends up terrible. By the end, Harris ruins everything he has built up. Even Lecter, one of the most evil villains of our time, ends up degraded beyond repair, as he is given a history and morals. He is best suited as a minot character; his presence wears thin as he is in the spotlight. Need I mention how ludicrous the plot is? I pray that Harris brings his next novel out much faster and that he sticks to what he does best, creating a compelling serial killer and having Lecter help track him down. This will be a bestseller, but Harris may not be so fortunate next time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not as good as Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. Starts out slow but then gets exciting. More violent than the previous books. Surprise twisted ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tom, Tom, Tom, you've been grotesque before, but there was always something stimulating about the resolution of your tales. Not this time. We liked and rooted for the tortured Jack Crawford in &quot;The Red Dragon,&quot; and we loved and cheered on the vulnerable Clarice Starling in &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; But there is nothing to like in this book. It's almost as if you decided to write something so throughly grotestque and depressing that Hollywood wouldn't dare touch your book. Hannibal Lecter was only interesting because he inspired the best from Jack and Clarice in their effort to outsmart him. Watching Lecter gobble up his adversaries is about as exciting as watching fishing - no matter how beautiful the setting and how exquisitely you describe the taste of the bait, it's still fishing. I am a huge fan of your other books, but this one fails so miserably, I was compelled to write."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment. This could easily have been one of those books written as a tie in product after the movie's been produced. The psychological suspense and terror of Harris' previous books have been replaced with gore. The mysteries to be solved have been replaced by a prolonged chase. Fully a third of the book is spent on a character who is undeveloped and uninteresting. His only purpose seems to be to provide a cinematically shocking demise. Hannibal, who had tremendous power as an archtype, is analyzed and defanged. In dealing with Clarice, Harris' miscogeny finally comes full blown. Regarding Foster and Hopkins reprising their roles, their talent would be wasted. Resurrect the case from &quot;Scream.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a big fan of Harris, I bought this the first day it came out. It kept me interested, though it also kept me confused, with the jumping between continents. I was looking for the solidarity of writing that he gave us in &quot;Silence&quot;. My first impression upon finishing was that he had secretly finished this a year after the movie to &quot;Silence&quot; came out and kept it, because it felt rushed. Clarice isn't really developed, Crawford is thrown away, etc..It seems like he tries to shock us on every page, and it doesn't work. For me, &quot;Silence&quot; worked because it was a quiet book. This book practically screams at you. The writing is different, a different style that seems to work here, though the narrator pops in and out and makes it rather annoying since we don't know who it is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS back in the late 80's, I waited with eagerness for the film to come out. It was a bit like Christmas arriving for a six year old.That wait was nothing compared to the long seasons anticipating the SILENCE sequel. But here it is, over a decade later, and I realized while reading it how much I still cared about these characters even after all this time.One of the nice features of HANNIBAL is that is doesn't have to waste alot of time introducing the main characters. We already know them and Harris knows that those who liked SILENCE have re-read it or skimmed through it a few times in the last decade. Dr. Lecter was interesting enough the first couple of times around so that it's no gamble to give him center stage. I admire Harris for not doing what some writers would have done in his situation, which would have been to either stoically ignore the public begging for more Lecter or cash in and throw cheap meat to starving dogs. Instead, he let the stew simmer for ten years and served up cuisine worthy of even Lecter's urbane palate.And all those nightmarishes images and gothic passages don't hurt either.It's a great book and the blurb on the jacket could easily have read, &quot;Hannibal - 'nuff said&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many fans of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and especially its masterful reincarnation on screen, I have been eagerly awaiting this next installment in the saga of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. So I was in a mood to be wowed by this book, and the opening does not disappoint. There is a particularly fine scene, very early in the novel, where Starling receives a letter from Lecter. As my mind read the letter in Anthony Hopkins' inimitable cadences, I was hooked. To be sure, there were some weak points in the plot, and some of the characters were somewhat unbelievable, but carried along by the powerful draw of Lecter and Starling, I gamely cast aside any doubts and forged ahead.And then, the book comes to a ludicrous ending that will make the reader scream louder in agony than any of the characters brutally murdered in this tale. Don't worry, no spoilers here. But the ending is so unsatisfying, so untrue to what we have come to learn about Lecter and our heroine, that it completely and utterly ruins the book. The ending diminishes everything that comes before it (even, I fear, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, though I hardly thought that possible) and left me feeling as if had lost a dear friend. Starling is so poorly treated by the finale that I suspect (or, shall I say, hope) that Jodie Foster will never reprise her role in anything approaching a close adaptation of this book. Disappointed does not even come close to describing the disullisionment brought on by the conclusion. I can hardly believe Harris took so many years to compose this disastrous sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm one of those people who dislike surprises, so when I had the opportunity to read the Salon Magazine's synopsis of Hannibal I decided to read it.I was amused by the little PS that it wasn't a parody, because that was what the synopsis felt like. I was skeptical about the novel going into it. I expected not to like it because it seemed so silly.I was wrong.This book is rich in detail and its complex works are really impossible to capture in a synopsis. One can write about the actions of the characters, but what is really excellent is the development of the characters' psyche. To get into their brains and find out what makes them tick. What drives them. This book peers into the workings of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and explores the circumstances of what made him the way he is.Fascinating.The book is filled with delicious irony as our favorite monster is presented as a refined, respected gentleman. The hero of the tale. He rescues the damsel in distress, an ousted-from-the-FBI Clarice Starling. The bad guys are the ones who want to capture the intellectual Lecter and bring down the idealistic Starling. The complex relationships that the characters share with each other makes the book delightfully rich, a definite pageturner.Yes, the Salon Magazine synopsis is accurate, but it doesn't capture Harris' excellent writing and the depths that it explores. I recommend it to anyone, with the warning that it is far more brutal than The Silence of the Lambs or The Red Dragon. Far more maddening. But it was still a joy to read and an excellent dive into the madman's mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With his three previous novels, Harris had impressed me with his intelligent and genuinely scary stories. This one, however, disappointed me greatly. I won't give away the ending, but I have to say it was completely unbelievable, disappointing, and--I thought--insulting to readers who have been following some of these characters since Red Dragon. Maybe, it wasn't possible to out do Silence of the Lambs and remain plausible. Then why bother? The book starts and develops well, but fans of intelligent plotting and character development will feel cheated by the time they finish the book. I was also put off by Harris's playing with second person passages, which were too cute for a thriller. I regret the money I spent on this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I felt that I was obliged to write a review about a book that I anticipated a lot from. I just finished reading it yesterday. I must say that the plot was so flowing, it went by fast and it took me a very short time to finish the book. It started from the top level, declined a bit, and then went up again till the end, where the biggest Fall Down ocurred unfortunately. Clarice Starling had been my favorite character throughout Silence of the Lambs and hannibal though the ending was a disappontment. I admired her personality, how solemn she was, quiet, self respectful and calmn. I even wished if she was part of Red Dragon, that's how much I liked her. I felt that she was somehow close to me in personality. But the book didn't do her good. it was so unfair to her and a real betrayal was waiting for her at the end. I don't want to give the ending away, but I feel that I must say something about it, so if you are planning on reading the book anytime soon, stop reading my review from this point and on. I'm not going to say, don't buy the book, it is not worth it, because that is not true at all. the book was very fascinating to me up to a certain piont, and again I mean the ending in here. the first thing is, the description about Italy, and the Capponi Library was so touching, it opened a big picture in front of my sight that made the imagination of the place anything but hard. But I still felt that it consumed a big portion of the book while Mr Harris could have used it to bring out an interaction between Clarice and Lecter instead, the sort of thing that made Silence of the Lambs unforgettable. Clarice, the main character in Silence of the lambs, was forgotten for many chapters in Hannibal, until it grew really boring to me and I started flipping pages just to see if she was going to reappear anytime soon. but through that time, I still admired her personality and felt that she was the same brave Clarice we knew before. I had this solid feeling up until the attack at Mason Verger property, this attack was also admired, because it showed her courage. But after that, the disoppointment found its way into myself. I couldn't help saying out loud :What Is The Matter With Her????? she was shot by a tranquilizer, that doesn't mean that she should lose her reason, her sense, her principles! that doesn't mean that Clarice should be gone forever!! I still can't believe what happened, this twisted, and rather distorted ending, flipped my admiration to her by 180 degrees, I didn't hate her, But I didn't like what she did either. How could a brave FBI agent become associated with a criminal- which by the way I do respect a little for his beautiful taste- that she had been longing to capture? And one more thing that wasn't clear for me: she was supposed to get kicked out of the bureau after the drug incident at the fish market, but she didn't, then a Made Up ad in a newspaper was used to get her out of the bureau, my question is: couldn't they have used the first charge to dispose her instead of the second that was so not making sense to us?? Not that I'm saying that the first charge was true, but at least she didn't deny shooting the woman, eventhough she was right at doing it. I can write forever about my disappointment with the book, but I still can't give it less than four starts, because I did enjoy it, and I would have given it five stars should Clarice not have turned out to a totally different person and disappointed me , bringing to your attention again that she is still my favorite character in all the books that I have ever read. One thing to hope is that the movie will bring Clarice back into where she belongs, and reload my respect and admiration to her. I'm hoping so because I didn't see the movie yet and heard that the ending was altered, something that I thank God for."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having just rewatched SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and desperately needing some low-brow entertainment, I bought HANNIBAL. Although Harris can be compelling in parts, he allows minor characters to take up loads of space with their banal babbling, while Starling's major nemeses are two-dimensional caricatures. I guess the goal is to make us feel 'alright' with their gruesome ends -we become participatory in their deaths- but they are so ludicrous that they are not particularly interesting (Krendler, Verger, etc). Basically, everyone in the the book is crazy as hell, which sort of takes away from Lecter's monstrosity, making him less interesting. Starling's boring Elektra complex compounds the dullness. Mind-numbing lists of Lecter's effete purchases give the novel a feel of bland inertia. Then some icky guy dies an icky death, and it hardly seems notable.Grammatical errors and typos abound. Apparently Dell editors are either cowards or clueless. Either way they should be fired. Harris' style at the beginning of each chapter is particularly annoying: each introductory being short, hapless fragments in the style of a screenplay. Incomplete sentences simply denote bad writing. He tries to engage the reader as the observer (&quot;Now we are walking up the steps where blah blah blah&quot;) but it all falls flat and the tense gets all screwed up. The narrative is disrupted with such attempts at flair, and the scenes are subsequently poorly constructed. I got the feeling like he was writing this novel in order to make a bundle of the movie, and the fluidity of the prose suffered as a consequence. This makes the flow of the narrative very tedious.The conclusion of the book elevates Starling and Lecter to a mythic inhumanity. It is so melodramatic that you feel as if you have lost all touch with the characters. Harris adores his creations too much, and it kills the story in the end. I give this book two stars because I'm not one of the die-hard fans who has had his hopes and dreams crushed by this silly book; plus the movie managed to be even dumber."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For the most part, this is a very compelling and well-written book. Unfortunately, what could have been a classic is spoiled by an utterly unbelievable and disappointing ending. I came away from the climax feeling cheated and disgusted. What a miserable end to a great trilogy!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has reached a climax with this breathtaking sequel to&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. If you thought it couldn't get any better than Dr Lecter and &quot;Clariiissse&quot; when you first met them....THINK AGAIN!!Robert Harris presents Dr Lecter as a learned and scholarly figure with an afficianados taste for the arts, culture and cuisine. The shocking contrast with his true nature is the counterpoint of the maze through which Starling must tiptoe.This one is a must and coincidentally provides yet another reason why you should read the book and flick the movie!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The entire book is good and keeps the reader on the edge. Some how towards the end the story looses its grip. I feel that another sequel is expected."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think people in general are accustomed to thinking of morality in &quot;purely good versus purely evil&quot; terms. Whether he intended to or not, Harris totally skewers this worldview. Dr. Lecter is a monster, yes, but he's a monster for a reason. And in Hannibal you'll find out what that reason is.&quot;Anger presents as lust, lupus presents as hives,&quot; said Dr. Lecter in Silence, and grief and horror present as murderous behavior. And can it be, at the end of Hannibal, that such a simple cure is possible for such a longtime affliction? Some of you might not think so. Perhaps even Harris was amazed at himself for writing such a thing. But as he said, sometimes you just have to let your characters go and do what they will, according to their own natures.Moral absolutists, people lacking imagination, and those of simple mind will not &quot;get&quot; or enjoy Hannibal. As for the rest of you, if you haven't already, I'd skip the movie and get the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I like twisted love stories. This book was that and much more. I loved the first movie and didn't like the book, so I was kind of wondering about reading Hannibal.When I did I was glad. It took me about 3 hours to read it in. The ending was great....The movie, however, has a different ending.... The producers didn't buy the rights to the book, they just used the namses of the characters. I would say if you liked the book, don't go to the movie, but you will have to see it for yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Set in Virginia, Thomas Harris's novel Hannibal is the story of a couple young detectives searching frantically for a cannibal that has been missing for eight years. One of the main characters, Dr. Lecter Hannibal, is a man who prefers to have people for a meal rather than to invite them over for dinner. He spent several years in a jail because of his crimes. He loved to draw and read. One of the other main characters, Clarice Starling, who is a detective, met Lecter in the jail where she went to question him on another murder. He felt somewhat connected to her. After several months, Dr. Lecter escaped. Dr. Lecter flees to Florence, I taly which saved him a lot of trouble. He changed his name and his identity. He had multiple surgeries to cover up his deformities. No one has spoke or seen him in eight years until he was finally discovered. It takes the men several weeks to locate and capture him. It doesn't take him long to escape again. In one scene, only one guy has revealed Dr. Lecter's identity. The man was working for the men who wanted to fed him to the pigs. Later Dr. Lecter killed him by hanging him out of a church window. I would recommend this book to mature readers because of the adult content. Otherwise to anyone who likes investigation and somewhat scary books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People expecting a followup in the same theme as Silence of the Lambs will, no doubt, be disappointed. But those who dare to stray beyond the limits of the familiar will be entranced by Thomas Harris's masterpiece of morbidity, mortality, and transformation. Lecter and Starling become so much more than cookie cutter hunter and prey in this novel which explores their inner workings with rare insight. The ethics of revenge and the oxymorons of our tainted culture are only two of the themes that run through this book, providing gourmet food for thought accented by impeccable presentation and the lush seasoning of Harris's stellar prose. A smorgasboard for the soul. And an ending that is, in every sense of the word, breathtaking. If you can put this book down during the final 50 pages, you have my grudging respect. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why I liked this book. This was an ation filled adventure about a Dr Hannible Lecter(He is an Cannible). He loves this women that he meats in silents of the lamb. And he thinks she is in love with him. But she really dosn't. He was in a mintal flacilty for crazy people but he had gotten out. He is really smart but he is an evil guy. So he runs away to a place (must read the book to find out were). And all of asoden this guy saw him on a online fbi web site. So he calls the number on the web page. Because you get money if they find him and he told him were he is and what he was doing. But Dr Lecter was tracing the call because he new that the guy would do that. Well Dr Lecter kills some guys and came to hont her to find out what happend to her read it.Other reasons why I liked this book. -Kept me on my tose. -Grose and action fillen. -Full of excitment. -Nervesment -Fast kept book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am always surprised when an author can make you root for the bad guy. Let's face it... Hannibal Lector has to be one of fiction's most heinous characters. BUT, somehow, we want Lector to survive another day. Imagine, if you will, the same attitude toward the late Jeffrey Dahmer. I don't think so! This book features one of Hannibal's surviving victims as a major character. The physically and mentally mutilated, Mason Verger. Even though he is a victim, Harris allows us to feel little pity for him. My only complaint was that Clarice seems to have been a little on the weak side. I would have liked a bit more of a power struggle for her. She seems too accepting of her fate in this book. I do recommend reading the book, even with it's few flaws. I'm curious as to whether Hollywood will have the guts to use Harris' ending or if they will have to change it totally, ala &quot;The Firm.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have waited for this book by what I thought was an amazingly thrilling but subtle writer for years. When I first read that there may be a sequel on the horizon, I would check with the various book stores on a continual basis as to its arrival. I almost did not order this book through Amazon.Com because I didn't think I could stand the wait for shipping. I have never been so utterly disappointed in my life!!! I have read all of Thomas Harris's prior literary efforts and I was always very impressed with the methods he would use to nail you to your seat, but never (even though the subject matter was inhumane at best) was it with child like discriptions of brutality. In a nut shell, I really think the author &quot;SOLD OUT&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the two books leading up to this one moved quickly and were page turners, I found that I had no problem putting this book down. The storyline seems scattered--as though the author felt it was &quot;time&quot; to write the sequel instead of writing it from his passion of needing to tell a story. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris definately had a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; with Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal has no suspense, is completely lacking in characters, and is basically a really bad story. If this actually does hit the big screen it will only be good if it is an entirely different story. I am amazed I actually finished the book, it was a complete disappointment!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book definitely had a &quot;first-draft&quot; quality. However, I really liked the ending. Honestly, what was he to do with her once they left the barn? Drop her off at home and say &quot;keep in touch&quot;? I read the &quot;Salon&quot; synopsis before starting the book and predicted that Harris would take what sounded like a ludicrous plot and manage to pull it off--because he can write. I wasn't disappointed. Harris enjoyed writing this; it shows."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris' exploration of Hannibal in this third sequel answers alot of questions about Lechter's past and his childhood, confirming that the monsters roaming this earth are made, not born. He masterfully creates a character more despicable than Dr. Lechter, and leaves you routing for Hannibal in the end. Clarice Starling, however, is not as fully developed as she was in The Silence of the Lambs, and the conclusion was disturbing, to say the least. Harris left himself the option of another book in the series, but I don't know if I'd want to read it. I thought the ending a bit of a rip-off.However, to the reader who is looking for all the gore and violent deaths of the first two novels, he will not be disappointed by this one. Not Harris' best work, but certainly not his worst, either."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Looked forward so much to this book, and was so disgusted by the ending. Clarise would never have done these things. I wish I had never read it!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many people, I bought this book the same day it was released and dove right in, thinking I could finish it in a couple of days. However it just did not maintain that kind of intensity. There was too much detail paid to Lector's likes/dislikes. The continuity of the story was difficult to follow at times. No one reading a thriller could be that interested in Italian history.On the plus side, it was horrifying in places, reminiscient of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. But it does not compare to Mr. Harris's two previous works. Perhaps another &quot;sequel&quot; is in the works to atone for the ending of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Let's hope it is not eight years away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. I've read criticisms about the ending's bizarre twist, but in the context of the novel, it fits. In the context of the characters, it fits -- and it's a brave move. Can't wait to see how they handle this in the upcoming film.... fava beans anyone?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read both &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and very much enjoyed them. This book I thought about putting down half-way through and once I finished it, I wished I had. The writing isn't bad, it is the story line. I found nothing redeeming about it. It wasn't enjoyable, didn't end well, and just left me with a sick feeling in my stomach."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal, like most Mr. Thomas' books are impossible to put down. I was horrified by Dr. Lecter, yet charmed by his character when it came to Clarice, his exquisite taste and wonderful revengeful tactics. I never thought it would be possible to hate a character more than Hannibal, but Mason fit that bill nicely. I hated the end! I loved the end! I was greatly disturbed by the end! Just the emotions a good novel should elicit in the reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a quick read. It has a great plot and new interesting characters. It however lacks the scientific details that made Silence of the Lambs a great story and novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You have to wonder about both the reading ability and literary knowledge of someone who was not impressed by this work. Steven King is pretty good, but Harris really writes circles around him. Harris also has done substantial amounts of research (I hope he didn't devote the past 10 years just to research; kind of absurd, really, just for a novel). His use of subtlety, commanding character portrayal, incredibly vivid descriptions, and powerful plot-forging make this book wonderful to read, whether or not you just want to get to the killing.It seems as if the only people that would not enjoy this book are those that just wanted action and gore. Yes, the end takes a risky chance with major character deviations, but hasn't that puzzled you and made you think about its plausibility and WHY Harris did this? The guy is incredibly intelligent, so you know it wasn't just because he couldn't think of anything or got lazy. Gimme a break, you &lt;=3 star people; perhaps you are just not pondering or philosophically inclined enough for this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although there were parts of the book that seemed to move pretty slowly, the insights into Hannibal's childhood, details and present ongoings of a previous victim, and the outstanding ending make this book a must read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The enormous number of responses to this book from almost every concievable viewpoint is the first tipoff (aside from the book itself) that this is an extraordinary work of fiction. Is it 'believable'? Is it 'plausible'? Of course not. It's a work of fiction. It's excessive, outrageous and transgressive; it's also very profound and deeply satisfying. I've read the other two, and it seems to me Harris achieves levels of complexity and depth in this one that he hadn't even begun to approach in the others. No longer is Clarice Starling the flawed Superwoman of Silence; nor is Lecter simply a fascinating psychopath. With this book, Harris transcends genre and character psychology and creates myth, without losing his impressive straightforward storytelling skills. However, if you're only reading this book for story, not only are you missing out on an awful lot, you're probably missing the point entirely -- which is my hopeful explanation for the extremely hostile reactions to certain elements of the plot and to the ending, which I thought was inevitable from the start, and prayed Harris wouldn't shy away from. My only complaint is the often undistinguished prose, although sections like the one on Hannibal's 'memory palace' and parts of the Florence chapters are beautifully carried off. With this book, Harris (who is from Mississippi) joins the pantheon of great contemporary Southern writers (Anne Rice, Donna Tartt, recent Poppy Z. Brite) who are working at a level of moral weight and philosophical inquiry that most contemporary Northeastern writers (Updike, Oates, Roth, etc.) can't approach, or won't. In all its weird, transcendent glory, Hannibal is a great modern novel, one that will be read for decades, if not centuries, to come."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you are looking to settle into a horror novel with an ending that satisfies most mass audience's expectations, think again. The theme of the novel is that entropy, death, comes to all and the ending is extremely unsettling as it should be. I believe Harris was trying to give that simple lesson and to remind everyone that there are evil elements in the world and that final stage of life is as cold as the eyes of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. If this movie makes it to the big screen, the ending would probably be reworked in the fashion of Hollywood to satisfy and give everyone a sense of security that they're grasping for. If there was one word that could sum up the entire novel, it would be disturbing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After almost 10 years since his last book, I sure expected alot more. More to the point, If an author is going to write about &quot;cops&quot; or law enforcement he should have one proof read it to see if cops really talk like that. He also needed better research, nobody referes to ATF as BATF, U.S. Marshals do not wear uniforms and unless you are a member of the FBI HRT team you do not carry a colt &quot;cocked and locked&quot; 45. After about three chapters of these inaccuracies and all the cop jargon one can handle I had to put the book down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book! In a world so concerned with making sure that all stories have clearly delineated &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil,&quot; it is so refreshing to find a book that operates above these limiting options. It seems to me that the point is not that Lecter is evil and Clarice is good, but rather that Lecter represents a force that stands outside our limited vision and notions of morality. Watching Clarice's (unfortunately too-quick and not-entirely-believable) transformation is thrilling precisely because we get to watch her emerge from the cocoon of her &quot;traditionally moral&quot; world and enter a world whose moral absolutes are not yet ours to understand (nor, for that matter, are they likely &quot;absolute&quot;). May her tastes (and her mentor's) continue to expand!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After years of anticipation, Harris offers the opportunity to journey into the mind of the notorious and infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter, clearly Harris' pride and joy. The novel is beautifully scripted and filled with many insights into the world that Lecter inhabits and his movements within. Dr. Lecter's rarified tastes extend beyond his cuisine into the realms of music, literature, art, and a supercharged Jaguar. The problem, in my opinion, is that it would seem that he is a force of nature, a manifestation of evil, rather a human being who moves through the novel as if in a lucid dream of Lecter's own design. Harris is undoubtedly proud of his creation who is stronger, smarter and more clever than anyone he has ever encountered. His invulnerability seems rather implausible and I often wished that there was a greater foil to him.If this were compared to a chess game, the opening was enticing which draws the reader into the plot, the mid-game had a decent amount of intrigue although certain parts seemed suspended in a tired loop, and the end-game is predictable and falls short of being compeling and even believable. It will certainly beg a third installment which I hope will reconcile the mistakes of this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While this book has been deemed a sequel by some, it isn't really- it features the same characters, but that's about it. It definitely was an interesting read, and Harris's prose is outstanding. There are wonderful descriptions of everything from Florence to a lobotomy. I was a bit disappointed with the ending of this book, I didn't feel it followed how the characters had been developed, but overall it is an excellent book and I would advise all Harris fans to read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"True, Red Dragon and SOTL were better written. But times have changed, and Hannibal is a fine indictment of our era. In Red Dragon, the good guys at the FBI worked hard and smart to defeat evil. Ditto for Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford in SOTL, although there we begin to note the corruption and dirty politics of Dr. Chilton and the FBI's Paul Krendler. Since SOTL, we've had Ruby Ridge and Waco, both explicitly mentioned in Hannibal, along with Vince Foster, Oklahoma City, TWA 800, and the rest of the Clinton presidency. Evil can triumph. The old, honorable men like Crawford are passing from the scene, and the FBI is dominated by Krendler and men like him who punish Starling precisely because she is strong and good. Given this background, which Harris builds very carefully, the ending is logical, the dinner with Krendler uproariously funny. Those who disliked the ending might try reading the book again with an eye to Harris's antigovernment message."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Gauging from other's critiques, I feel the way to most appreicate this book is to have not read the first (&quot;Red Dragon&quot;) and only seen the movie (&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;). I fell into this group, and found Harris' novel to be an exquisite contuation of the Hannibal Lecter story. Harris does a superb job of sensually describing Italy from an intelectual's viewpoint.A true mystery fan will find this novel climatic. Someone who appreciates the finer things in life will want more. Someone expecting a continuation of Harris' first Lecter novel may be disappointed - but truly this is a much better read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Red Dragon and TSOTL, and thought they were both excellent.I will also say that I was impressed with Harris' writing style. It's the little touches I like, and I thought this book had 'em. For example, when he says that it was in Paul Krendler's nature to &quot;both appreciate Clarice's leg and look for the hamstring.&quot;Cut the guy some slack, it's a decent read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not sure what benefit it is to read the 1541st of the reviews here, but I am sufficiently moved by this work to go ahead regardless.The silliest criticism is that Hannibal is irresponsible. True, it does not feature a Stirring Moral Principle. It is therefore not recommended bedtime reading for toddlers. The publisher was remiss in not clearly stating this fact on the cover.The most salient criticism is that it is sloppy. Certain narrative phrases are unnecessarily repeated. One might think the book to have been written in haste and then shipped out to meet an arbitrary publishing deadline. A work which celebrates in all things artifice, taste, and obsessive planning ought to have been crafted to exacting standards. It is not.Though loose in execution, Hannibal is ambitious in scope. Its ending, though failing to provide the Righteous Scouraging of Evil so missed by the moralists among our 1540 co-pundits, provides the appropriately shocking and thought-provoking conclusion to Harris's trilogy of transformations (Dollarhyde, Gumb, and Starling). Its ultimate transgressiveness is rigourous and apt. The complacent deserve to feel its bite."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I like the style of writing, but the pigs were a bit much along with a couple of unbelieveable characters. The ending is a stretch of imagination that plummets you to new depths in surrealism. An ending you do not want to believe. Classic Harris, a riveting and compelling read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I guess I'm still trying to figure out the ridiculous ending to the book. Maybe I just don't get how this would ever happen. The story line up till the end was somewhat believable and at points graphically gory and morose, but I think Harris has been reading too many long-winded Steven King novels. There are a couple of parts of the book that were intense and worth reading a couple times over, but too many pages in between them.Although, Harris' the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is still one of the best and most horrifying books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have just finshed Haniibal and i can honestly say that it is one of the best books i have ever read! I think it is almost as good as silence of the lambs. The way Harris has built the relationship between Leture and teh detective is really good but i feel that the ending lacks a bit of originality."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Those expecting Dr. Lecter to be brought to justice get what they expect--but not in a form they're comfortable with. Harris asks us, &quot;What is evil?&quot; and the answers he comes up with have already made lots of people uncomfortable. There have already been more than 1,500 reviews at this site--just buy the damned book and know that whether you love it or hate it you've been witness to a cultural phenomenon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"DR. LECTER RETURNS IN THIS LONG ANTICIPATED SEQUEL THAT OF COURSE ALL OF US WANT TO READ! I THOUGHT TAHT A SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL STORY WOULD BE A BAD IDEA, BUT HARRIS WRITES AN EXCELLENT STORY THAT GIVES YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO READ AND LEAVES YOU WITH AN ENDING THAT WILL LEAVE YOU THINKING FOR WEEKS AFTER. DON'T MISS THIS GREAT SEQUEL!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I gave this two stars because the first few hundred pages werean enjoyable read, although not nearly as well written or well plottedas SOTL. The ending was so disappointing that it effectively ruined the whole trilogy for me, and I will never be able to enjoy the first two books the same way again. I'm going to try as hard as I can to forget that this book ever existed. Some of the people who actually liked it told me to go back and rethink the book in light of the ending. What Harris does to Starling is even worse than what the FBI did. A profoundly sexist book (and I'm a man!) Also I like a good bottle of wine now and then and consider myself to be a cultured person and I found Harris's literary masturbation in Florence insufferable. I wish I could turn back time and unread this bloated waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I find it hilarious that many of the negative reviews of this book start off with thoughts like Hannibal &quot;wasn't what I expected!&quot; or &quot;Is this what I waited so long for???&quot; I understand that the structure and characters in Hannibal are different -- and as duly noted the ending is unusual -- but why does everyone want to re-read the same things over and over again?? This is a new story about evolving characters, told from a different viewpoint. I can guarantee you this: it will hold you riveted throughout. That being said, Hannibal is unevenly written and would benefit from the efforts of a talented author. I was also annoyed by the constantly shifting narrative voice (from 1st person to 3rd, etc.) but that very touch is used to great effect in the controversial ending. A last word about the ending: I finished this book about 4 days ago, and I find myself constantly thinking about the closing scenes and their potential meanings. How often can you say THAT about any book, be it a modern thriller or Shakespeare? I simply couldn't believe what I was reading and the direction the story was taking. When I finished, it was like waking from a very, VERY bad dream. This is the very atmosphere of that Harris was trying to create, and it is some of the best writing I've ever read in popular fiction. Ignore the reviews, pick up Hannibal with an open mind and be prepared for a different experience."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I clearly remember being &quot;spooked&quot; reading Silence of the Lambs back in 91 and looked forward to Harris'sequel with anticipation. What a let down! The first three quarters of the plot is well-paced and sets up the potential for a good finale. The final outcome, however, left me fuming with disbelief."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a long-time horror fan of Stephen King, having read everything he has written in addition to seeing tv and movie specials. I also enjoy Thomas Harris and many others. Hannibal is by far the most intriguing book I have ever read. I am not going to ruin the book by giving anything away, just suffice it to say that I could never have predicted the way it ends. The entire book was impossible to put down and was a fascinating read. I don't know how Thomas Harris will ever follow this one up!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Apart from the one, fatal flaw, the fusion and evolution of character and narrative in Hannibal is utterly, brilliantly, compelling. From the first sentence, there was never any question of reading it in anything other than a single sitting.But the ending !!I was left agape, stunned, at how a writer who could create such a truly horrifying, let absolutely believable explanation for Hannibal Lecter's madness - a reason so disturbing that my immediate response was to put the book down and try and engage in avoidance psycho-gymnastics - could be one and the same as the author of such an unbelievable ending.Whereas we get such a powerful insight into what possessed the bad doctor, the same cannot be said about the author. I just cannot imagine what vehicle Mr Harris suddenly hopped into to traverse the road of the final chapters; but it most certainly was not the one he had been steering for the rest of the journey. Every believable character motivation and truth that he had so far created, is ditched in favour of some wholly other set of dynamics and character traits.A device like this may work if it resonates with believability. Sadly, maddingly, it does not.Like Dr Lecter, I too ended up hoping for a reversal of time and new, different endings. How ironic, that in the very final pages, Hannibal even gives up on that quite believable desire."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this book while I was supposed to be studying for exams at school and found it very hard to put down. There is much truth in this story, even a man as great as Dr Hannibal Lector falls in the trap that we call 'women'. What chance do we have? That is my question to you all"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I do not disagree with the many people who believe that &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is the best book of the Hannibal trilogy, this new book seems to me to close the circle on the now familiar character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter perfectly. Harris knots precisely all of the strings, as Stephen King can do, but between three books instead of within one. The more thought i give to &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the better i like it.&quot;Hannibal&quot; is so much more elegantly written and tightly plotted than anything i have read lately. It has been years since i could not put a book aside before finishing it. This was the one.The years that Mr. Harris spent on this book were well worth the wait. His writing is more direct now; I was drawn into the world within the pages more deeply than with his other books. At the same time, his words and phrases are more subtle, shaded, shadowed by detail, his images more vivid; it all works brilliantly together to make this world rich and complete.The biographical information on Lecter was, of course, a plot device to make the monster more human, as he had to be for the book to end as it did. I found it fascinating. There had to be other monsters, another series of violent occurrences, to satisfy the thirst for justice, maybe..maybe vengeance. These are provided in abundance. Even the most bloodthirsty of us will surely be satisfied. At the same time, Harris had to assure the reader that Clarice, to whom we are so attached, perhaps because she is a sort of everywoman symbol of coming to terms with one's self and one's past, would be all right.As for the ending...I am still smiling. Harris concluded this story in the only proper, fitting, appropriate (take your choice :)) manner. I say no more, because i don't want to spoil the book for anyone.I give &quot;Hannibal&quot; 5 stars without reservation. Thank you, Thomas Harris !"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Let's face it...this novel is abominable. Lackluster plotting, half-baked characters, pathetic pacing, sophomoric narrative--this is a BAD novel. Harris' other novels were far better than this tripe. I only dread the upcoming hack-and-slash Hollywood film. Avoid this garbage; reread Harris' Red Dragon instead."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have mixed emotions about this book. The fact I couldn't put it down meant it must have had some sort of resonant effect on me. However, the ending left me feeling completely deflated. It was as if the tight storyline had been torn apart like a rope suddenly breaking at its weakest point. All that was left were frayed edges and limp threads. Oh yes, in Australia we do not have quarters, the nearest value currency being twenty cents. I found that particularly disappointing as I took all of the Florentine detail on face value."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I never but never read this type of book. My only delve into non-fiction is largely Dickens. I somehow read the coming attractions saw the movie Silence of the Lambs and marveled how I thought Lector quite charming in the film. With that in mind i purchased the book and let me say it was monies well worth spending. The gore and madness is written in such splendor, one hates to see it stop being described. The line where Hannibal is remembering his sister and says &quot;she is dead and digested&quot; made me absolutely sure he had done the deed himself--wrong and happily so. I felt the book carried you through wonderfully, made you never want to stop til completion (and my burnt dinner testified to that whim) and even made you cheer on Hannibal. How Harris turned a madman into a cultured and charming fellow just adds to the excitement. I must say that I think most who read this book will feel evil beings in the book got their just desserts (oops!). The ending might cause some consternation, but alas it does leave the door open for another book in another time. I loved this and for the violence, well a read of the usual daily fare in large cities (I am in New York), just might turn up more (albeit not as well written (sorry journalists). Cheers and hearty appetite Mr. Lector. Perhaps a guest shot on Martha Stewart awaits Hannibal ala brain saute with fresh okra and field daisies. See even the reviewer as gone mad!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not sure what I was expecting when I picked this book up, except for the attention to detail and evil men.I certainly got both, and more.The book was rather hard to get into, since, from my opinion, it seemed as though Thomas was trying to sell it to Hollywood and not his fans. However, getting into it, I was more and more taken, until the last 150 pages or so, where I was held, transfixed on my sofa, until I had devoured the bittersweet end.Others have written that they are dissappointed by two main things, the rationalization of Lecter, and the weird, breathless ending. First of all, rationalizing the serial killer is something Harris has done in all of his books, to where his emphasis is on the fact that someone can be a victim, but still be completely evil and completely deserving to die!Secondly, I am very impressed that Harris didn't go for the usual trilogy ending, which is usually an entire, complete denoument for the entire third work. This book, 'Hannibal', screams, at the top of it's mechanical voice, for a sequel, sequel, sequel! And the ending will stick in my mind for years to come.Perhaps Harris achieves his realistic madmen and women due to the ability to tie them into the evil things that he knows (and the truly honest among us know) are in the human heart and mind.My hat is off to you, Thomas. Toast yourself with the finest chateau you can imagine :)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a dissapointment. After reading Harris's brilliant sirst two works, I expected a work at least on par with Red Dragon. While the first half of the book is a worthy attempt at plot, in the second half we witness the total destruction of both characters. While not spoiling the ending, it will surely leave fans of the series screaming &quot;WHAT?&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recently become addicted to books on tape as a result of an extended commute time. However, what I have found is that when the author reads his own work, you can usually expect to be disappointed. And I was. Thomas Harris may be a great writer of fiction for all I know, but he is absolutely terrible as a narrator. His monotone dialogue almost put me to sleep at the wheel. He did not change the inflection in his voice to reflect when the different characters were speaking, which most professionals do. As such, I only made it through the first tape and then stuck it back in my collection for a possible later listening when I am comatose or brain dead and it might sound more interesting at that time. All books on tape should be read by professional actors, not the authors. The authors usually write great (which is why they get to audio tape), but they read rotten. I truly wish Hannibal was read by Jay O. Sanders, David Ogden Stiers, John Pankow, or someone who had experience doing this sort of thing. My advice would be maybe to get the book, but ABSOLUTELY DO NOT buy the audio tape. It is truly awful. I think I'll try to sell mine at auction. Unfortunately I probably will get only about 2 cents, which is about what it is worth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Admire Mr. Harris for trying a twist ending- clearly not at all what was expected by fans of his earlier work. Unfortunately, the twist requires us to erase everything we know about HL and Starling. Starling, whose poor Appalachian background has been, shall we say, rather heavily emphasized in previous novels, suddenly, thanks to some hypnotic drugs, develops wealthy-snobbish affectations. Mastermind HL collapses, thanks to a narcotic dart, into a sappy sad-sack.All this is the disappointing conclusion of a rather tedious (although airplane-readable) ride through a crime potboiler.Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am, a great fan of both Red Dragon and Silence of the lambs, but in Hannibal Harris leaves logic behind and writes about a Clarice Starling that seems unbelievable and somewhat ridiculous...wait til the ending. I couldn't put Silence down, I kept putting Hannibal down too many times."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs was such a perfectly creepy book that this one was bound to be disappointing. I don't know if Thomas Harris felt pressured to finish this or not, but the whole thing seems rushed. I cannot believe anyone would even attempt to make this gross out story into a movie. I was physically ill at the end, literally. The subtle complexities of Harris's other novels are sadly missing here, as if his sole intention this time was to be as grotesque as possible. Lots of the elements work superbly, like the revenge plot involving Mason and the whole sequence in Florence Italy, which is very well crafted, but the rest of the book falls a little short of expectations. Clarice and Hannibal have lost a lot of their depth here. I think maybe Harris could have delved a lot more skillfully into their histories. As a result, you will remember the gorey climax much more than anything else in the book, which is a real shame because the characters are authentic and believable, especially the continuation of the male nurse Barney and his interactions with Mason's butch sister Margot, a subplot I found by the way much more intriguing than the main one..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great book! The ending is a tad bit too unlikable, reminescent of Entrapment. I cannot wait to see the movie, since they change the ending. Don't read if you are faint at heart, but if you're interested in the FBI, canibalism, and/or memory palaces, this is your book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Most say this book was a major disapointment. However, I thought it was a great book. Although choppy and not connected at times, it leaves you wandering why and how the major characters and events have anything to do with each other. When you think that something is definitely going to happen, the event takes a turn and something completely unexpected occurs...especially the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris invited all of us who couldn't put down Silence to another Lecter story, but Hannibal isn't the bad guy this time. He is presented as charming, educated, and affluent. He is made out to be a victim. Harris wants you to like Hannibal, and after pages and pages of Lecter stroking you sort of can't help it. Herein lies the twisted irony of the work. Don't expect another Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. This one is out there, and definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A great book with a weak ending. The ending isn't even believable, and really leaves the series with a sour note (the outcome is too fairy-tail-ish). I did love the book, but I believe this to be more anticipation than a great read. After &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, this book is an unfortunate disappointment. Read this book, for sure, but don't get your hopes _too_ high."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book &quot;Hannibal&quot; would have been more aptly named &quot;The Compleat, Genteel Cannibal&quot;. While skillfully written, what disappointed me most is that the story contains NO heroes. But it's not merely the lack of a hero that makes this novel unique: the author makes it abundantly clear that HUMANITY can be divided into two categories: LAMBS and SWINE. The lambs are incorrigibly pathetic and helpless, and the swine are incorrigibly unholy and predatory. At the end of the novel, I found myself sympathic to no one (except the reader). Even the surviving victims of Hannibal were so corrupted by their lust for revenge (ie, emotionalism over intellect) that I could no longer sympathize with their victimization. I first placed my hopes in Clarice Starling, but it soon became obvious that while she was interested in pursuing Dr. Lecter, her concern was NOT with bringing him to justice. Hannibal's villainy is compared and contrasted with the villainy of those who seek revenge against him. But the other &quot;monsters&quot;' in the story are all &quot;babes in the woods&quot; compared to the suave, sophisticated and highly-cultured Hannibal... They hate Hannibal because he has tormented and mutilated them...but they cannot gather their wits sufficiently to satisfy their emotional need for justice against him. The author Thomas Harris loudly proclaims Hannibal to be &quot;Il Mostro Supremo&quot; by gracing Hannibal with THREE advantages: SUPREME intelligence and intuition, the ability to CULTIVATE SYMPATHY from those who should know better, and sheer &quot;good LUCK&quot; when the first two fail. In other words, the author Harris tries to make us sympathize and even &quot;admire&quot; the character of &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot;... After all, Hannibal only eats &quot;rude&quot; people. Which makes me wonder: would we sympathize, admire and respect Jeffery Dahmer... IF he had played the harpsichord, drunk fine wine, eaten white truffles, and evaded captivity by outsmarting authorities? (Perhaps Hannibal IS the ultimate POLITICIAN). It boggles my mind that an author could spend and entire DECADE thinking and writing about these characters... emersed within their possibilities...During the time he wrote Hannibal, WHAT was Harris thinking...? When Harris dedicated Part 3 &quot;To the New World...&quot;' what is it that he's trying to suggest about the future of the New Age? &quot;The Serpent devouring Humanity&quot; is an appropriate cover for this novel. It wouldn't surprise me at all if the devil himself knocked on Mr. Harris' door and handed him the completed manuscript for &quot;Hannibal&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Every time I put down one of Thomas Harris' novels I feel depressed that it has ended. This is the almost perfect end to a heart twisting story, if it is indeed the end. Harris may choose to continue the Lecter saga, with or without Clarice. A few tips when you pick up this book: (1) be prepared to go deeper into Lecter's mind than you had ever thought you would (2) Don't shy away from the inevitable, you'll actually wind up liking the monster by the end (3) If you put the book down and feel like you can't get enough Lecter..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A great read for a wet Sunday afternoon with a glass of wine and a log fire.Dr Lecter appears as a far more well-rounded personality in Hannibal than in Silence of the Lambs with Clarice Starling almost a side-line.The book reads smoothly without obvious shock tactics. This makes it al the more powerful. At times, many times, you go back a re-read a paragraph ... he did what!Will there be Lecter 3 or Son of Hannibal?I hope so.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I suppose I should have expected the sick images; I knew who the book was about. But what I didn't expect was the ridiculous departure in character by Clarice. Chalking it up to being drugged and hypnotized was weak. Her end was totally out of character and unbelievable. The only reason I didn't give the book only one star is that it fully kept my attention throughout. The suspense was good. But as I finished it, I almost regretted wasting my time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book takes a little more time to get into than Silence of the Lambs. It is still enjoyable, just give it time. The ending will certainly surprise you as it did me. Thomas Harris is an excellent author, read his others."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"He was seven years old to give continuity for a work that was a show, but he got lost completely, and gave a sad end for Hannibal Lecter and Clarisse Starling. &quot;the Bone Colector&quot; of Jeffery Deaver is very better following this same style."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book. I could not stop reading it, and this is coming from a college student who hates to read. It is just as good as the other Harris novels, with an ending I particularly enjoyed. If you want to be electrified by the details of a hunt for a brilliant serial killer. Read this book. Bravo Tommy!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This long-awaited (by me) book was very enjoyable.I especially liked reading the parts that took place in Florence, Italy, having recently visited that lovely city.I always appreciate a book from which I can learn, and this one was full of interesting historical (and other) tidbits. Furthermore, when I have to look up a word or two in the dictionary when reading a book, as I had to with this one, I consider it a bonus.I also admire Mr. Harris' attention to detail as he writes. He chooses to include information and explanation that only adds to the many layers of delight present in the story.The character development is very good. The plot is interesting. The only thing I had trouble with was the ending, which I won't give away here. Suffice to say that I didn't find Clarice Starling's location (3 years out from the main story) believable. Maybe I missed something, some change in her character, but I found it inconsistent with who she is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Promising beginning. Harris fleshes out Lecter's character (no pun intended) and gives the reader details about the thorns in Lecter's paws. As the book moves along, Harris slowly diminishes Starling and turns this formerly by-the-rules FBI agent into a renegade who gives up everything for her monster. Near the end of the book, Harris switches genres and begins to write fantasy..and poor fantasy at that because there appear to be no rules. The ending of this book is incredibly disappointing. One can find absolutely no basis for it anywhere in the tale of the relationship between Lecter and Starling. Lecter and Starling are totally unrecognizable characters as the book winds down. Harris has the talent and imagination to have written an ending worthy of his readers and of his two main characters...sadly, he chose to turn the strong and intelligent Starling into a simpering fool and to end a fairly interesting novel with a cheap trick."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was completely and utterly engrossing. I couldn't put it down. It was, without question in my mind, the best book of Harris' four. The ending is shocking. Hannibal Lecter is, once again, a fascinating character, as is new bad guy Mason Verger. This is one that does not disappoint, from beginning to end. Do yourself a buyer and read this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I understand that Jodi Foster turned down a mega bucks offer to play Clarice Starling again for the movie version of this book. What a smart lady!I had a really hard time getting through this trash unlike my daughter who was smart enough to just not finish it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't bother buying this book if you liked the other Thomas Harris books. It is not even remotely like his others. The creative juices must have dried up! It has a few moments of clarity, but was largely muddled and confused! The ending is the absolute worst I have ever read. It will need a lot of work to make it on the big screen!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A heinous crime of unspeakable horror has occurred. A monster of unconscionable depravity is on the loose! No, it's not Hannibal Lecter. I' m talking about Thomas Harris. Harris has committed real literary homicide by turning the Grandest Guignole in recent fiction into a wimp. Readers hoping to find the deliciously menacing Hannibal Lecter of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; will not recognize this latest incarnation who's about as threatening as the newest version of Darth Vader is in the summer's other highly anticipated &quot;sequel.&quot; Harris' trademark well-paced, suspense-laden primers in psychological horror have given way to &quot;Hannibal's&quot; lugubrious pacing, annoying protagonists and killer pigs. Without giving away too much of the &quot;plot,&quot; suffice to say that in the novel's most ludicrous scene, Lecter is terrorized on an airplane by a &quot;bratty&quot; kid. Scary stuff! Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Hannibal&quot; will not garner any awards should it be made into a movie. Surely, such distinguished actors as Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster will refuse to be a part of this debacle. Fortunately, that will leave the door open for the actor who would really be perfect to portray this new Lecter. However, I'm sure Leslie Nielson will be busy filming a real horror movie--&quot;Mr. Magoo 2.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book receives a 3 based on three stages: 1. The first third is well set-up. 2. The second third had me turning pages at a furious pace. 3. The final third was spine-tingling until a very surprising and complete letdown of an ending.The end is unbelievable and quite disappointing. I guess I feel I know Clarice Starling better than the author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a sick stupid souless piece of garbage. When I finished it I threw it in the garbage can. God help the fools who find anything redeeming in this evil, meaningless, trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was very difficult for me to put this book down. I would recommend it although be prepared for some rather sickening images having to do with pigs. I must admit I was disappointed in Clarice at the end of the book. I didn't expect that ending at all. It should be interesting to see how they transform this book into a movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is not a sequel to &quot;Silence,&quot; it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is outstanding, I picked it up and could not put it down. I read the 480+ pages in 5 days and was completely amazed with the descriptions, the characters, the thought. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think Harris was trying to go against everybodys expectations w/ the ending and hey I was really bored until the last 3 chapters. I don't know how the heck they are going to make a movie of this!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Which author wrote Hannibal and which wrote Silence? I am certain they cannot be same . After years of anticipation of the sequel to my favorite all time book, I am terribly disappointed. I found reading the last 3 chapters of Hannibal to be the equivalent of eating a spoiled lunch. After page turning for hours, I was really hungry, and it was really time for it; but it just didn't satisfy..in fact it made me sick. Not sick in the fantastic thriller way that I expected to be horrified either. Those of you looking to be satisfied even remotely for the same reasons you liked Silence should lower your expectations of this book. The gross and gory details are there yes, plot is there yes. Follow through to the end was not. It's like the author just stopped generating a realistic storyline, so he could run to press before the milennium. Sorry Mr. Harris, but I expected a more character consistent end to all of this, especially from Agent Starling. You had me hooked til the end. Great character development, but I guess technically that was done in Silence. Kudos for the gore, but the end was a bore."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although most of this book was good, I could not believe how gruesome this book was. While I am not squeemish by any means, I was riveted and sickened at the same time. I could not help but think that the author must have felt he had to &quot;top&quot; his last two bestsellers in the sadism department. I cannot imagine how Hollywood will be able to make a film anywhere true to the book and not get an NC-17 rating. Still, much of the book was excellent. The ending simply didn't gel with the image of Lecter and Starling that the author originally developed and created. Was he trying to be controversial?? Ya got me! price!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was captivated by the book and had a hard time putting it down. The plot was well-written and macabre in the author's usual understated fashion. I say go buy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow. I can't begin to describe the excitement I felt when I got my hands on this book. Years of waiting all leading up to...one amazing letdown.It's funny, the characters are so different from the previous story (previous two in Lecter's case). It seemed like Harris was writing for the movie characters- though he missed them too.While the scenes in Italy were memorable, the closure of every scene is disappointing. And the ending- I fail to see why Harris chose to go there.What I was left with was bunch of characters without I didn't like- including Starling. Each character was more disturbed that the others. And the mere existance of Mason Verger... if Lecter did all this to him, what was it so difficult to catch him in the first place (although I do like the idea of this huge pervert thinking he's pulling one over on the good doctor)The final thing I came away from this with was the idea that Lecter had some superpowers. He's always had tremendous strength and been able to &quot;read&quot; minds. Not it seems like he can control animals, try to turn back time and smell the contents of a building simply by walking in. And this is the villian!!!Although wait, I guess he wasn't the villian this time around."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Highly enjoyable. Not as good as &quot;Silence...&quot; but not the disaster most people would have you believe it is. Just falls apart at the end a bit. If anyone can explain the last 30 pages I would be greatful...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I may be in the minority it seems... I found it an excellent thought provoking read.It was not silence of the lambs.... it was a new dimension or peek at a perspective that was hidden from us before.How a man can have such wisdom ...style... grace...intelligence...and yet be so brutal is a question that is all too real yet at the same time ethereal.Hannibal is transformed given a new and higher plane of existance...no longer the superior villian ... he becomes the uninnocent victim. The dark hero is a mantel he wears well in contradiction of goodly evil.The ending was unexpected and I would have liked to see it a bit more developed... and also more time in Florence where he was truly in his element...but this is definitely a solid and entertaining read. Full of new dimensions of both the old and new characters... enjoy it !"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book offers the possibility of actually bettering the previous Lector novel. The plot is chilling and much more intense and psycological than its forbear, and gives the impression of being written by a more experienced, and frankly better, author. However, it is somewhat let down by a rather feeble plot, and in comparison the ending cannot stand up to Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In his previous novels, it was just horrific enough to keep you turning the pages to see what could possibly happen next, but this book just goes over the edge. You don't have the chance to use your imagination because it's all written out for you. After waiting so long for this book, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed, and a bit sick to my stomach. Mr. Harris gives out &quot;too much&quot; information this time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was probably the most awaited book sequel that I couldn't miss. However, it was also my biggest disapointment...re-read &quot;Silence&quot; for the thrill and skip this one altogether...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very disappointed. The Red Dragon was 100% better. The parts in Italy were just much to long and detailed. Hope the movie is more moving."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was very good until the last 50 pages. If the book would have ended with a climax at the Muskrat Farm, I would have been very satisfied. As it is, i was very disappointed in the ending...very dull."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It amazes me how totally divided readers' opinions are when it comes to HANNIBAL, but people just won't stop talking about it. Me, I think it is MAGNIFIQUE !!! PS. To all you loonies who say Harris practically wrote a screenplay, you must be out of your minds. This book will be almost impossible to film, Mamet or not."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although not as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is an incredibly thoughtful and interesting story. It is fast paced and unpredictable right down to the shocking yet believable ending. To all those who complain about the gore, what else would you expect from a novel about a cannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am very pleased with Harris' Hannibal. As the book is based on the desires of a human cannibal, Harris managed to take the most believable route. It can be taken for the obvious that a book about a cannibal is going to be bloody and gory, i don't understand why eveyone is so surprised. For once though, I do think the movie may be more satisfying than the book. So many times while i was reading i pictured this on the big screen and i got the chills. iIt was hard to get the full effect of the last chapter without seeing the phsical setting Harris had pictured. Overall i am impressed with both the plot and outcome of this book. Each time i read it i couldn't wait to come back for seconds!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr Harris, Jonathan Demme is right. Do yourself a favor and let him make the necessary changes if you want the film of this dissappointing book to be successful."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. There is much of it that I immensely enjoyed, especially the unraveling of new facets of Dr. Lector, and the inclusion of some wonderful old (Barney, Aurelia), and new (Margot) characters. However, I cannot fathom how Mr. Harris justifies the complete reversal of Clarice's personality. The fact the Clarice must be 'drugged' before she can make this total transformation, is proof enough for me that even Mr. Harris had his doubts about this cheap trick and sadly disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Newsweek magazine said that Jonathan Demme is not interested in doing the film version of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I read the review before the book and thought, &quot;Come on, how nasty can it be?&quot; Could it be that bad that Demme would think it's too violent. Short answer: Yes. Carnivorous and quite hungry pigs and creative dinner time surgery are just some of the fun awaiting you. If you've got a strong stomach and can believe a rather preposterous relationship succeeds, GO FOR IT. Otherwise, pick again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Hannibal in two days and couldn't set it down! Dr. Lecter keeps us intrigued and awesrtuck! He is one of the greatest characters in modern fiction and he leads this suspenseful thriller that definitely did not dissapoint!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is an excellent sequel to Silence of the Lambs. The location in Europe is the perfect place to enhance Dr Lector's senses of the supernatural. Quite a surprise ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why write a thousand word essay when a few simple words will suffice ? This book is self-indulgent drooling hardly worthy of a writer of Robert Harris' stature. Do yourself a BIG favor and avoid Hannibal. Read something just as riveting but not as stupid, like one of the fine new Stephen King books, or that towering Second World War novel, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. Or if you absolutely insist upon reading Harris, read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, not this sewage called Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I completely agree that the ending is ridiculous. It seems that Harris painted himself into a corner with the plot, and was forced to walk all over the place to get to an ending. However the first 400+ pages are well written and kept me reading. Could have been better, but all is not lost. I am skeptical that a film version COULD be made from the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Harris has elected to demystify Hannibal Lecter by completely changing his behavior and offering a childhood trauma to explain his psyche. It's quite disappointing and removes the fantastical horror of his previous books. However, it seems to be the fashionable thing to do because Starling also completely changes character, enabling a most predictable and entirely uncompelling ending. Other characters are poorly developed and make obviously foolish decisions which only serve the purpose of positioning them to be dispatched in a gory fashion. Darwinism, I suppose, but it makes for a tedious and uninteresting read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First, let's get this straight. HANNIBAL is NOT a romance. In a romance, you have a well-defined relationship between the man &amp; woman; they usually have to face troubles in the middle of the story; and then, by the end, they overcome those difficulties and become a couple that will live on in the reality of fiction. But the main key is that you have TWO WILLING PARTNERS in this relationship. That just ain't so in HANNIBAL. So trust me, dear readers, this is NOT in any way, shape, or form a romance.Second, for those of you who stated in your reviews that this book will terrify you, keep you up at night, make sleep difficult, etc., etc.--you must have been reading a different HANNIBAL than I did.To be scared, you must truly care about the characters being terrorized. Who CARES what happened to Pazzi, Carlo, Mason, or Paul? Tearing them apart, torturing them, eating them--NONE of that is terrifying if you don't care about the characters and what happens to them. All Harris succeeded in making me do was cringe. That's it. I definitely won't be losing any sleep over this story. I most certainly won't have nightmares.Third, one other person who read this book told me that he cheated &amp; read the ending w/about 100 pages left in the story. It made this person so MAD that he couldn't finish the story.I had to read HANNIBAL for myself to understand why he felt the way that he did. For those of you who loved those last 100 pages, I must go back to my original mantra--surely you must have read a different HANNIBAL than the one I did.The most ironic review among the readers here is the one who derisively said that Harris must have written this in 11 days (rather than years) and then couldn't figure out a way to *fix* his story, so he just gave it to the publishers earlier this year &amp; demanded that NOT a word be touched/edited. (It shows)Honesty is the best policy; don't throw your money away on the hardback of HANNIBAL. If you feel compelled to read this story, get it from your library, go to a UBS, borrow it from an enemy (a *true* friend won't loan you this), buy it @ 50% off (thus, allowing you to face yourself in the mirror in the morning), or wait for it in paperback.For those of you who loved HANNIBAL and think it's the absolute greatest story, I have to wonder if you read the same HANNIBAL that I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The plot was absurd, the characters (mostly) loathsome, the ending defied logic. And yet... I haven't been as engrossed by a work of fiction since &quot;The Stand&quot; (interesting that King raved about 'Hannibal' in the NY Times).The book moves speedily and twists its way from scene to scene, outrageous and over-the-top. Man-eating pigs and eels? A table-side lobotomy that provides sweetbreads for popular literature's oddest-ever dinner party? A one-eyed paralyzed madman friend of Idi Amin who directs much of what happens? The book is bizarre in the extreme, yet Harris pulls it off, more or less. He writes with elegance and a cool detachment that makes the horror that unfolds all the more visceral, and somewhat more plausible. He's a master of the &quot;telling detail&quot; and sets a scene with descriptive power that rivals that of PD James. Light is shed on the source of Lecter's lunacy, yet it does not diminish his darkly fiendish power. And the extended passage in Florence makes for suspenseful reading, indeed.Still, Newsweek reports that Harris won't let his editor touch a word. Too bad. Reading this almost-magnificent mess convinced me the author needed a disciplined hand to better justify the denouement, and excise the silliness that keeps this good read from being a great book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unfortunately, those before me have pretty much summed up all that is wrong with this thing, from cardboard characters, to rambling plot lines, to some seriously questionable editing. But enough about this book; now we have to fret about the film! What amazes me is that 'Hollywood' has already paid millions for the film rights, but I understand Mr. Demme has already passed on this impossible directing job. Let's just hope the actors who gave us such a sublime thriller in 'Silence' will take flight from whatever one could possibly conjure in trying to transfer this to celluloid. And by the way: have you noticed how most of the critics have bought this Emperor's 'new clothes'?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I never really understood all the acclaim that the film &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; received from critics, public, Oscars etc. I finally decided that it was all due to what I must admit was the only Oscar worthy aspect of the film, Anthony Hopkins performance as Hannibal Lecter. When I heard that Thomas Harris would once again visit the character of Dr. Lecter, I was curious to see how the doctor had been doing - or rather what Anthony Hopkins would be doing. After finishing &quot;Hannibal&quot;, my initial belief that &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was indeed due to Hopkins and nothing else. It is my hope that no one involved with that film has anything to do with the film of &quot;Hannibal&quot; that we all know will get made one way or the other. Jonathan Demme has already indicated a probable no because of the book being too violent. There is no plot-only sections to present either Harris' knowlege of food, Florence, weapons, disgusting torture ideas etc. The turns the book takes are either so predictable or vile. I came away from &quot;Silence&quot; with some respect/appreciation for Hannibal/Hopkins. With &quot;Hannibal&quot;, I got only regrets that I fell for the hype trap. This book was a waste of time, money, brains and possible good characters - if Harris had only put both his 11 years and limited writing skills to better use. Maybe this time he will make it twice as long between his next book - I'm praying that he will."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, I just finished the highly anticipated HANNIBAL, and I tell you, it's a lot like WHITE OLEANDER in that it desperately NEEDED an editor (the story is that Thomas Harris, the author, wouldn't allow an editor to work w/the story before it went to publication). He shifted back &amp; forth between present &amp; past tense so much that I wanted to reach through the pages &amp; slap him (Harris, not Hannibal). He also did a lot of shifting between first (we, I, me), second (you), and third (he, she, it, they) persons. Drove me batty and it took away from the story. This is a story that's crying for an editor; shame on Harris for believing he was above one.While HANNIBAL is not a pleasant story to read, I still think that Shirley Kennett's GRAY MATTER is more gruesome--and even better, it's a well-written story. In HANNIBAL, Harris almost tries to overdue it w/the gruesomeness--thus, it lost a lot of its effectiveness on me.But the main thing that drove me crazy was the ending. I hated it. Absolutely, positively HATED it.I cannot tell you WHY I hated it because then I'd be spoiling it for those who decide they'll read this story. Even *I* am not that cruel.Let me put it this way--if we are to TRULY BELIEVE in HANNIBAL's ending--then we have to realize that the characters in Thomas Harris's world are frauds.I wish Amazon allowed for ***spoiler*** areas so that I could explain what I mean by &quot;frauds.&quot; Unfortunately, w/out spoiling the story, you'll have to read it &amp; decide for yourself.IF they make this into a movie, this is ONE situation in which Hollywood SHOULD change the ending, otherwise I cannot see a single reason for revisting Hannibal's &amp; Clarice's worlds."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In his other books, Thomas Harris separates the good from the bad. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, we are shown only the dark side of the human spirit. Characters unable to move beyond their inner pain. Believing the only opiate is retribution. This book will take you to a different hell then &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; This hell is real."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just like a gourmet dinner, Harris has prepared a three course meal, saving the best for dessert. Hannibal, the book, is immensely satisfying because it ends the only way it should. A reading of the first two installments leads you to question exactly who is the monster here. Harris answers it beautifully in this very good read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm truly dissapointed with the change in Clarice Starling. It is not believable, and it leaves me unsatisfied, as thought the last hundred pages were written under pressure of a deadline, or the author just got tired of the subject."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I do have one criticism. The most chilling aspect of the first two novels is that they both felt entirely possible. In &quot;Hannibal,&quot; Harris stretches the bounds of plausibility more than a few times. This allowed me to distance myself a bit from the story which lessened the impact. Don't take that as a knock at the ending with which so many other reviewers seem to be troubled. The ending is completely unpredictable and yet, in Harris' own dark world-view, also completely logical. It will be interesting to see what Hollywood does with this material. I doubt the major studios would have the stomach for a faithful adaptation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For the first 80% of the book I kept asking myself why was I reading such trash. I think I perservered because I had Jodi Foster and Tony Hopkins well planted in my mind. The ending, however, is a true home run and makes it worth reading. I haven't laughed so hard in a very long time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I work for a major studio and reading this book was like reading one of the many BAD scripts we receive daily! It seemed Harris was writing a movie script instead of a novel. He made some things very sick and unnecessary. What did he do, make a bet with someone (for a dollar) that he could write the sickest and most unrealistic screenplay ever? If this were to become a movie, it should be direct-to-video with all &quot;B&quot; actors. I disliked the way Harris overemphasized references to Silence. To Mr. Harris, disappoint your fans, disappoint yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the latest installment in Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter saga in one 6-hour gulp and was both impressed and astonished. No, its suspense is not what one expects from &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; but it's subtler and better. I've already found myself rereading sections of the book over again, which I can't say I did with &quot;Lambs&quot;. Harris was clearly trying not to repeat himself, to deliver a book worthy of the characters and not a Hollywood rehash. I suspect Harris may have indeed intentionally written a novel that wouldn't work as a film (what happens to the novel's only movie director may be proof enough of his jaundiced view of the film industry), and the book is the better for it. The &quot;Florence&quot; section is nearly a novel within the novel, wonderfully atmospheric and spellbinding.The novel's structure leaves plenty of room for suspense, though, and one turns the pages as compulsively as one would any Harris book. I think some of the frustration readers are expressing has to do with the fact that Clarice and Dr. Lecter don't interact until the last pages of the novel. On the other hand, the entire book is set up to draw them together and the book's real conclusion (every bit as startling as the last moments of &quot;Red Dragon&quot;) is as unsettling as anything he's ever penned. Harris is having a little bit of fun at the expense of readers who think they know where the story should go, perhaps, but it's no less believable for that. I enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You took a complex and courageous female protagonist and reduced her to the kind of vacuous heroine normally found in supermarket romance novels. This was still a great read, and I appreciate the attempt to explore the dynamics of the intimacy between Lecter and Starling, but the outcome was very disappointing. Maybe you were shooting for &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; but this ending is more like depraved Danielle Steele.I, too, have been a fan of yours for over 20 years, and pre-ordered this book. I will not make the same mistake on your next one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Interesting to read the reviews because it gives me a new take on the book. Initially, I was excited and thought the beginning was funny and a bit gross - just what I wanted. Then the boring Italy component, chase scenes, etc were tedious. The ending was stupid. Then I read the other reader reviews and think, &quot;well, maybe they have something.&quot; I'll have to ponder it.You might be disappointed with this book if you're looking for a neat, clean horror story, but open your mind (so to speak) and see what bigger themes might be there. Interesting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you've read the other books by Thomas Harris, this one should be just the kind of weird and disgusting novel you can't put down, that you would expect from him. What a great read! The writing style is excellent and the suspense of how far this novel is really going to go will keep you up into the wee hours. Beware, this one isn't for the sensitive or weak stomached readers out there! People may hate the ending or just not accept where they are taken, but try to remember - these are Thomas Harris's characters. He created them and only he knows what they are capable of. The shocking Lecter has become a favorite among many, so should anyone be surprised at what he might do? Oh, and by the way, it's fiction - just a novel. So before anyone loses perspective, enjoy the book for what it is and the time you spent exploring it or leave it at the bookstore if you think cannibals, serial killers and man-eating pigs will offend. Obviously this book will not appeal to everyone! I almost hope Mr. Harris stops here, but if the story continues, I'll be first in line on the day it appears in the local bookstore!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting so long for the sequel, I must have built up to many expectations for Mr. Harris to ease... While being a great fan of his and of Hannibal, I was a bit disappointed by the sudden twist of Clarice; how could she? I still enjoyed the book thourghly from cover to cover but felt it was missing something. The psycological dwellings into the minds of Hannibal ans Starling were to few and far between. I would still recommend it to anyone intrested because the research and detail are impeccable and make it is as beleivable as possible. What I did not like were refrences to contemperary companies. It made it feel like paid advertising, after all haven't we heard enough of Starbucks and Nike already. I am still a great fan and do reccommend this book to all, it's just not as good as Red Dragon and Silence.Juan"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a devoted fan of the Hannibal Lecter series, I was ecstatic that the closing to the trilogy had finally arrived! My ecstasy soon changed to dismay however ..... the beginning scenes with Clarice were neither gripping nor compelling .... the middle scenes were well crafted however - Mason Verger is truly a fiend capable of unimaginable feats. But the ending of this saga was terrible and completely out of character and unbelievable to say the least. The result leaves the reader wondering why on earth he/she pre-ordered this book in the first place .... I would have waited another year for a much better ending to a terrific series .... this was very disappointing. Shame on you Thomas Harris - you know the rules: bad endings simply make bad books !!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I haven't even quite finished this novel and I am so disappointed. Besides the graphic grammatical errors and shifts from past to present tense (and the sudden intrusion of the &quot;You&quot; voice every couple chapters) he has Clarice Starling wondering if her black roommate will be mad because she shot a black woman who was trying to kill her. Wow, there's a man with a firm grasp of complex psychology. What would have been interesting was if there was some REASON she would feel that way. As it stands, it just makes her look like a fool. Which is how I felt spending money on this garbage."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Even if you are a fan, as I am, of Harris' previous two books, recognize that this is a NEW book. Time has passed since SOTL; characters evolve (sometimes not in ways we think they should or would -- life is like that). And they have done so absent our scrutiny and consent.Harris has written a flawed book (damn, a bit like life again). It has some characters that are the equivalent in irritation to Jar-Jar Binks. It has an ending that will polarize his fans.But, this book is the real deal. Read it in one sitting, at most two. Start early in the evening. If you can, have someone nearby who can help you decompress. This book is disturbing -- not necessarily because it is gruesome, though it surely is, but because, in its dark caves and cloisters, it is uncannily like life."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is an amazing novel. It is certainly not a typical thriller, nor a typical anything else, for that matter. It is an extraordinary look into, second, the brilliant-but-awesomely-warped mind of Hannibal Lecter, and, first, some of the lives he changed.Don't allow yourself to be put off by these 'one star' reviewers. This book is not a 'mess.' The characters are always at least interesting, and many of them are fascinating. One or two are even likable. They don't always behave in an obvious manner, but neither do they act 'out of character.'This book more than most &quot;thrillers&quot; requires of its readers imagination and intelligence. As the author says, &quot;This is not a reflective age.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think the reason why so many have trashed this book has primarily to do with the ending and what it represents. We are too unwilling to allow our strong heroine, Agent Starling, to become the weak minded misfit that Lector has reduced her to. This is extremely disappointing to all of us, but even that demise has a purpose, as does every event in this book. I anticipate another book waiting to vindicate Clarice, almost as this one has semi vindicated Hannibal. In reflection, this book was wonderfully written, articulate as well as frightening. For all the gore and violence that this trilogy has, the most frightening aspect is how well Hannibal Lector controls, deceives and kills with his genius for taking apart the human psyche. This is his most powerful weapon and his greatest strength. It is terrifying that this psychotic man knows us better than we know ourselves. We have no safeguard from the brilliant but sick mind of the engrossing doctor, not even poor Clarice. If you look at the book from that aspect, I think it will be more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After I finished Hannibal, in one sitting, I went back and reread Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Harris's first two Hannibal books have a more FBI suspense edge than his recent book. Hannibal is completely different, but totally wonderful in its own right. All the ticked off readers who have spewed nasty remarks were only expecting SOTL II. Harris has again surprised his readers and offered much more than was expected. Hannibal is a more indepth look at motives of both the FBI and those on the other side of the hunt.Yes, the writing style was different; but again, it worked to perfect effect. I did not find the change of tenses or style distracting; but rather a hint of what was to come.If you read Hannibal without the expectations some readers have apparently held,you will be blown away by the creativity. Also, notice Harris's notes on sources used for Hannibal's &quot;memory palace.&quot; I am currently reading one of these and found it to be very interesting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is hard to understand why so many have found the ending to be a disappointment. The ending was shocking and certainly unexpected, which in my opinion makes the book that much better. Wouldn't things get boring if every book ended the way we &quot;expected&quot; it to end? I am glad Mr. Harris chose to throw us a huge curve ball. Although the descriptions of Florence slow the story down at times, Hannibal is a great read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My feelings are mixed. At times I was disturbed and wondered what the point was. Then as Hannibal himself began to unfold, I began to see what the draw was between him and Starling. I fully expected her to save him and I figured he'd take her but I never guessed the ending !! And yet it was somehow correct ! I admit to being disappointed that it did not have the thrill of the first two reads. But I accept it for what it is and the role it plays in the story of Hannibal Lecter. My question is where do they go from here ? Or is it impossible to move forward now ?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book, I bought the audio version and listened to it all in one car trip. I thought it was an excellent book. It held my interest, and had a twist ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book just didn't inspire the same page-turning momentum that Red Dragon and, to a lesser degree, Silence of the Lambs, did. Is it possible that a character like Lecter can lose his ability to shock? Well, it happens here, as the Lecter that is referred to from prior books seems infinitely more fresh and awe-inspiring than the one we actually encounter in this story. It's a fine line between painting a portrait of a chillingly depraved mind and an overwraught cartoon of a fiend. This book tends towards the latter.Mason Verger was much more horrifying and interesting a character when mentioned in passing. Up close, he turns out to be an almost ludicrous caricature rather than some terrifying madman. A bad guy with a deadly eel for a pet? This is the comic villain of a James Bond film gone bad.To make matters worse, Harris uses a narrator that often addresses the reader directly, as if leading him on a tour of various settings. It fails miserably, succeeding only in constantly jarring me out of engagement with the story.Harris should have left Starling and Lecter alone after Silence of the Lambs. The curse of the sequel, with all the pitfalls it contains, has leapt up and snapped Harris by the throat."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like millions of others, I have been waiting for this novel for years. Nothing from my own imagination could have prepared me for what Mr. Harris delivered to the world. Yes, I thought it would neat for Will Graham, the man who caught Lector in the first place, to come out of retirement and collaborate with Starling to catch Dr. Lector. But that would be just a little too easy. I'm glad that Harris took the approach he did for this novel. That's why I read...that's why we all read for that matter. If you already know how the story goes, why read it at all. By taking a fresh approach, Harris has taken his characters to a new and unanticipated level. Excellent work, in my opinion, from one of my favorite authors. I can't wait to see how Dino pulls this one off on the screen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was truly a masterful work of fiction. Its sequel, Hannibal, was inevitably in the shadow of the masterpiece. Harris' task was huge. Did he succeed? Doubtful, perhaps. But if he writes another, providing an on-going tale, he just might."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I confess that I am a Connelly, DeMille, and Steiger fan first and foremost. I read a copy of Slience of the Lambs after I had seen the movie and wished that I had read it before seeing the movie. I liked it a whole lot and thought it was excellently written and plotted. Recently I bought about 10 books from Amazon, the best two were 'The Generals Daughter' by DeMille, 'Alien Rapture' by Steiger, Red Dragon by Harris, and'Blood Work' by Connelly. Towards the end of Harris' &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; it seemed over, but there was another 35 pages, so I read on with anticipation of the actual shocking ending. It was soft and weak and delivered in a quick and limp manner. Overall, I loved the book except for the ending. Then I bought &quot;Hannibal,&quot; and as I read I wondered: Who really wrote this book; Why is the plot so evasive; Who is the main character; and where is this story going? I did enjoy many pages that seemed to have a set-aside story or message, but still the plot was only average. Read the reviews on these other books first. If you just have to have a Harris book now, buy Red Dragon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Every act of fiction requires the reader to somewhat &quot;suspend their disbelief&quot; -- Harris asks the reader to abandon it completely. I found the plot to be simplistic and very unsatisfying. People in this book act as nowhere else on earth. The opening set-up, a bungled drug bust, attempts to eco the public reaction to recent bungled police actions and shootings, but in the end rings hollow, it just doesn't &quot;get it right.&quot; Starling is at the center of this. In the process she kills a drug-selling mother (who fires on her first), but also goes out of her way to save the woman's child. In real life would all in power in the FBI have so totally ostracized Starling, as Harris has his FBI? It requires no naivete to say: &quot;come-on, I don't think so.&quot; The position Harris places Starling in -- vital to the rest of the story -- just seems too forced, Harris asks too much of the reader. Hannibal &quot;the cannibal&quot; has now become the most brillant man ever to have lived. Harris tries to convince us of this by having the great and powerful Lector contemplate . . . everything. He considers physics -- his favorite movie is &quot;A brief history of time&quot; -- which is virtually un-sitthroughable. Hannibal loves the best cars, he tosses about (again and again) the names of various fine wines. He quotes from brillant books, and recites music. This occurs over and over and over again, until you are left screaming: &quot;okay, stop it! He's smart!&quot;There is little in the way of further psychological analysis of Starling, one of the underlying themes in the Silence of the Lambs. What there is is largely crammed into the final chapters, where little new is revealed.Others may disagree, but I felt that the movie Silence of the Lambs was better than the book. I hope the same occurs here, but I pity the poor fellows that have Mr. Harris' book to work with -- good luck!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read a lot of books in my time and I can say without hesitation that Hannibal likely ranks as one of the worst ever. Non-existant editing and totally ridiculous from start to finish. This is the only book in memory that I actually wanted to either throw out or burn! If you have not read anything by Thomas Harris forget this one and read Red Dragon or SOL. If you have read these but not Hannibal, trust me, avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, let me point out that I love Thomas Harris; I think he is a wonderful writer. Now, HANNIBAL is the third book in a series with RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS being the previous books. HANNIBAL takes place seven years after Hannibal asks Clarice Starling, &quot;have the lambs stopped screaming?&quot; Most people are probably going to venture out and see the movie, so I won't get bogged down in a long-winded review; just the basics. Hannibal has been enjoying his freedom and taken resident in his favorite place among places: Florence. Hannibal infiltrates Clarice's life one more time when she becomes the center of attention because of a botched sting operation, and her name is splattered throughout the papers as a &quot;DEATH ANGEL.&quot; Hannibal finds out and drops her a line, and we are off to the races in search of the infamous Hannibal the cannibal. Only this time there are a plethora of cooks trying to stir the soup: Mason, a multimillionaire, who has a vested interest in seeing Hannibal tortured, joins the hunt offering millions for his capture. A corrupt Italian policeman, and Clarice starling are all searching for Hannibal Lecter. The plot is excellent and the characters are vivid and tangible, but the books fails. It seems that Thomas Harris was more concerned with pleasing the movie industry rather than pleasing his loyal readers. The book reads like a screenplay in some parts, and in others it captures the beauty and emotion of the first two books in the series. In all it is a good read, but the satisfaction factor is close to zero. For those of you wondering why Jodie Foster turned down the role of Clarice ( she felt as if the character had been betrayed) when you come to the last couple of chapters in the book you will be enlightened. Come one, Mr. Harris, you can do better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A waste, a total waste of Hannibal Lecter and the writing ability of Thomas Harris. There are parts of the book that are on the edge of your seat good, but those are few and far between and overshaddowed with Harris' infatuation with gore. Between pigs eating people, dogs eating a human face and the finale, the book just leaves you sick. And regretting wasting the time to read this book. I rated this book a 1 but it should have been a zero, but the scale doesn't go that low so I'll have to make do. Thanx for your time: T"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is much better than Silence because it portrays Hannibal as a human rather than a monster. The memory palace idea was brilliant and the ending was fitting to end such an epic. I love how Harris added in the story of Barney and Margo, which although not being related reflected on the main narrative. Harris' strength is not stylistic it is in the story, which is why his books make good movies. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters for Hannibal didn't have the balls to write a script true to the book. Ridley Scott's directing was magnificent and the acting was good (but not like the original), but the story was lacking."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was riveting for the 1st 400 pages. I actually astounded myself (very busy working mother, 4-hour/day commute, very little personal time) by finishing it within 2 days. But that's because it was superbly written...up to the last 100 pages or so.Unfortunately, the &quot;suprise ending&quot; ruined the possibilty for my ever wanting to actually see the movie--and I am truly a fan of Anthony Hopkins. I found the grotesque dinner with the droll humor a real stretch--for the character &quot;Clarice,&quot; and for the reader's imagination.To Harris' credit; however, the really well-developed characters were the Vergers, Barney, the French inspector Piazzi (sp?). They were obviously penned with care and the rationale for their behaviors throughout the novel were consistent. The two main characters--Lecter and Clarice--lose their credibility at two important junctures, respectively: Lecter, when he triumphs over Mason (after all, he is only human); and Clarice, when she emerges from her grief as a totally different human being--devoid of her ethics, integrity and humanity (these attributes, after all, comprise her character).I'd say overall, it's a good book, with some wonderful psychological work (the Vergers), but it leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Even though years have passed under the bridge since Harris wrote Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs the author, as king of the macabre, has certainly lost none of his biting edge in his writing like fellow author Lawrence Sanders has (Deadly Sins Series of Thrillers).....On the contrary I think the edge now is sharper than one of Hannibal's knives ....I could say this book 'goes over the top' but then I would be accused of gross understatement. If Silence was Starlings' book then Hannibal definitely IS Lechters book.We see many more facets of Hannibal in this book, and, with the explanation as to events surrounding the sister Misha, is the Harris trying to eke out a feeling of sympathy and understanding for Hannibal from the reader?Clarice as well has some very significant development of her character in this book as we see her embrace her dark side.Can't say more here without giving it away but after you read the book you'll also be left with many many questions... I believe that Harris tries to get us to identify with Hannibal and that is absolutely mind blowing and an unbelieveable challenge to the author and his writing skills.I haven't seen the movie since I would tend to believe that many many scenes could NEVER be shown on the silver screen, and, it's easy to see why Jodie Foster didn't come back as Clarice since she would have to have a dark side in her in real life to be able to portray her character in Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It took Harris eight years for this riveting page-turner. Might I say it was well worth the wait. At times I couldn't put this book down for the intrigue. At times I couldn't turn my bedroom light off for the chill."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I only call this a sell-out because Harris got $10 million for it. Even so, the writing is lazy, haphazard, choppy and uneven. We lose Clarice Starling after the prologue as the book focuses on an Italian policeman, and then we're back to Starling after about 300 pages. Very odd. The character of Mason Verger is almost comical. Talk about over-the-top. As a result, not one person in this novel rings true. Other reviewers mentioned this before: evil lesbians, crooked FBI agents, the father-figure colleague...even Hannibal himself seems neutered. Maybe it's old age. He's lost his edge. The wrongest step Harris took was trying to explain Hannibal. It's like the recent &quot;Grinch&quot; movie. Why bother explaining? It just distracts people. He was fine the way he was. It would have been better if it was revealed that Hannibal killed and ate his own sister. But no -- like all truly wicked criminals, he had a bad childhood. Sacrilege. &quot;Memory palace?&quot; Give me a break. I grant it two stars solely for what is left of the character that once was Dr. Lecter, and the memories he invokes."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After both reading and watching Silence of the Lambs, I could not wait to read Hannibal. Although I did not get the book until now, I was not disappointed. The book was glued to my hand for three days as I devoured the writing.The main plot is this. It has been seven years since Hannibal Lecter escaped from maximum security prison, and he is living like a king in Florence. But an old patient of his, Mason Verger, has not fogotten what Lecter did to him and swears to get revenge. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse where only the strongest will survive.The book loses one star on two main points. One, I was not a big fan of the ending and find it slightly unbelievable. Two, I don't like how Lecter was reduced to facts in order to explain his actions. He was so much better as a mystery.Other than that, I highly recommend this book to anyone with a strong stomach. Harris comes up with some of the greatest metaphors I've ever heard, and the gruesome details only add to the suspense. This book is a chilling look at the dark side of humanity. Lecter does things that make you want to throw up, but you will still like him and still want him to win. You will scream at yourself because of this. You will be disgusted, and after the book is finished, you will absolutely love it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What an infuriating book to read. In the beginning of this book I found the characters hard to distinguish. Harris introduces too many fuzzy characters at once and leaves no clues for his readers to distinguish the important players from the extras. Having cleared that obstacle, one that stunted a few of my friends' endeavor, I moved on to Florence with Harris and Hannibal. It was in Italy that I again felt the rage building in my chest. I am not an unintelligent woman but I had much difficulty in following Hannibal around Italy and understanding the locations, scene setups and culture of the characters. Spare me the Italian lessons I wanted a clearer story to follow. And the ending!! What could be more horrifying than that! Tsk, tsk, tst, Mr Harris, I don't agree. Aside from these points that stung my eyes with the serverity of Carlo's cattle prod I can still manage to find some praise for Mr Harris. The atrophied monster, Mason Verger, is one of the finest madmen that I have had the shameful pleasure of encountering in quite a while. Overall I find this book incredibly hard to read however, between the Italian quotes and the descriptions of wine that I doubt I will ever have the pleasure to taste, there is an interesting glimpse into the eye of a madman. Please Mr Harris try to stick more to the flesh of your stories and leave out some of the garnish."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I very much enjoyed the book, but I did think that it went on and on and on to get to the jucier parts. At any rate, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read through a lot of the reviews, and I thought I'd write my own here. I found the book to be an amazing portrayal of the mastermind that Hannibal Lecter is - it's no wonder he became a psychiatrist in his life, he has an unbelievable power over the people that he comes into contact with.Witness Clarice Starling, who seems to have been left shattered after Hannibal delves into her psyche in Silence of the Lambs. His effect on her seems to have been profound, her character in this book seems a bit lost and totally unsure about what she had thought to be true her entire life. (which i attribute to Lecter's probing of her in Silence of the Lambs)Throughout the book, we watch as Lecter weaves his power over the people in his life, whether it be through a lifelong pursuit of revenge, money, glory, fascination etc.. As we go along, we see some of lecters own psyche -- why he became what he became, his thoughts and dreams, etc.. The result is that the psychological games he plays (for me anyway) become obvious and more disturbing than the cannibalism/killing.As for the ending, I think it is the best scene of the master at work - he used every psychiatric method at his disposal to achieve his end. None of the reviews I've read seem to have mentioned one particular method, which I won't mention, but if you pay attention you'll see it for yourself. It's all in the details, as a good book should be. All I will say is that I'm not as disappointed in Clarice as everyone else seems to be. If you're into the rather mindless murder/mystery books, this probably won't be a good book to read. If you're into diving deep into the psyche of a person and seeing the results, even in the smallest details of the book, this one will fascinate.I'm still fascinated. :)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although I beleive that Hannibal remains an intriguing and facinating character, the book seemed to crumble and come apart towards the end. The climax was obviously written with the silver screen in mind. Most of the book is convinsing and beleivable until you get towards the end. At this point you will begin to spiral into an unbeleivable and weird world that does not flow well with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...by the resolution of a thriller. The ending was the last thing I would ever have guessed. What Harris gets at is the complete &quot;giving up&quot; of a person who has exhausted all of her inner resources. Psychologically fascinating, and a seldom-used literary device. As with Red Dragon, Harris had me rooting for -- and even identifying with -- the horrifically twisted villian/hero. By doing so, he makes us examine the fragile roots of our own loyalties.Granted, this book is miles over the top, and his characters are sometimes cartoonish, but I think the macabre psychology underlying the story is a delight."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"just me, or was this written like a screenplay, with scenes blocked out and camera directions. i guess Harris saw as a forgone conclusion that this latest book would be turned into a movie. what a sellout..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anxiously awaiting the read, I dove back into the place where I thought I would never have the courage to return. Yet, quickly into Hannibal, I found myself turning pages without even having read them. One gets the true feeling that this is not a novel, but a Hollywood screenplay going for the big bucks of mainstream blood and guts with little or no imagination. It was painful to watch two such intricate characters become so predictible. Even I with little or no creativity, could figure out many of the plot lines in this &quot;L&quot;oser. Though I loved revisiting the beautiful Florence, and still found Lecter's mind to be interesting, the hypnotic, frightening edge is gone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris falls prey to the Grisham school of writing: compile 500 pages of build up and then just throw in an ending, knowing all the while that a screenplay writer will put more effort towards creating a palatable ending.As evidenced by this very disapointing work, Harris just took the money and ran. The only good news, paperbacks are cheap..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...Gone are the beautiful metaphors that littered his previous works... In the whole book of 'Hannibal' I found only one phrase that was worth noting...I will think very seriously before I read anything of his again...If I'd wanted to be grossed out by banal horror I'd have read a Stephen King. He has made that genre his own and has a particular genius for it. 'Hannible' was a pale, shadowy copy and nothing more. There were some great ideas there waiting to be developed but he chose to...go for the cheap thrill."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has done it again, showing that it really does get better than Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and proving that it was worth the 10 year wait. I would recommend this book to anybody that isn\`t weak or fearful of graphic content."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book had me as its captive audience on a trans-Atlantic plane flight. It is a downer from start to finish - nothing of the quality of the other Hannibal books. I wish I could have fallen asleep, or had the forethought to have a back-up to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot remember ever being so disappointed by a sequel. I enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence so much and this was just awful. I feel that Mr. Harris did not remain true to his characters, especially Clarice. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the third installment in Thomas Harris' retelling of The Beauty and The Beast. They are Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter. All of us who delighted in Red Dragon (1981) and The Silence of the Lambs (1988) have waited far too long for this book. This is it -- a scary and dazzling journey through the catacombs of a dark dream. Dr Hannibal Lecter is irresistible. A brilliant psychiatrist with interests in anthropology, linguistics, mathematics, music, and things medieval. A man of elegant tastes, he plays the clavier and is partial to Scarlatti and Bach's Goldberg Variations. A gourmet who likes tartufi bianchi , green Gironde oysters, Anatolian figs, Scottish red-legged partridges and pate de foie gras. Among wines he prefers Chateau Petrus bordeaux and Batard-Montrachet. He drives either a Bentley or a supercharged Jaguar. He lectures on Dante's Inferno and Judas Iscariot. When we meet him now, after an eleven-year hiatus, he is the translator and curator of the fabled Capponi Library in Florence, a job he won by \\" demonstrating to the Belle Arti Committee an extraordinary linguistic capability, sight-translating medieval Italian and Latin from the densest Gothic black-letter manuscripts.\\" He created the vacancy though , by removing the former curator, \\" a simple process requiring a few seconds' work on the old man and a modest outlay for two bags of cement -- but once the way was clear he won the job fairly.\\" He is, also, a cannibal. And a killer. Hannibal is witches' brew , brimming over with the asafoetida of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I was eager to see the movie, and was not disappointed. Consequently I read &quot;Hannibal&quot; with images of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in my mind. Mr Lechter is explored and his skills are clearly demonstrated. I diud not feel the same for Agent Starling, who seemed to lose her self-worth and my interest. Mr Harris seems to have lost interest in the characters that made him rich."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris wrote THIS? Oh God... this is a blatant romance and melodrama, served as a splatterpunk dish with a glass of gore. It does not approach the mastery of Red Dragon. It is not even as good as Silence of the Lambs - it is simply a bad novel. Eleven years of waiting for THIS?????"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is quite possibly what would be considered a disaster. There was never a single moment where I was enthralled enough to keep turning the pages. Of course, that's unfortunate, because it's set in a world where a monster like Hannibal Lecter runs free. The very earth should be shivering beneath his footfalls and it doesn't. Each page should be something of a continued suspension and I had no problems putting the book down to turn to something more important.I've always enjoyed the simplicity of style that Thomas Harris uses in his books. He never quite tells you exactly what goes on in his story and it leaves the reader groping for more and inclining their own minds to finish reduced scenes. This time, however, it was just irritating. I think if Dr. Lecter was a real man he would have been upset that his story was told in so much reduced form, as if nothing holds any meaning.The characters, which held up the story meekly, were as lame as a broken leg. Like many of Harris' novels surrounding Dr. Lecter, we find two villains. The more sinister, genius, cannibal and the mysterious criminals that are somehow connected to him in some way, as if his poisonous abilities have slipped out in the world to continue his dirty work in a rather poor fashion. Mason Verger is our second criminal. Half mad, half eaten, half dead. He is far from sinister. Though he has no obligations to the world and is under a delusional, religious, cleansing frenzy he is as weak as the respirator that gives him breath. Margot, his body building sister, is more malevolent and she turns out to be more brutal but she hardly gets enough page time, except for cracking nuts in her hand, to really get fearful of.Speaking of the Verger clan, Barney gets mixed up with them at one point and his entire stay in this book might as well have been the bumbling fool, in a scholar's clothing, who is just taking up space. He's obsessed with Dr. Lecter and yet he helps to bring him to a connived sense of justice in Mason's mind. Then he floats out of the book again only to appear later under the gun barrel of Ardelia, who is as useless as Crawford (simply acting as a removed security blanket for Starling), and then later when the novel ends.Getting to more substantial characters. Clarice Starling is 32 going on 33 years of age and she is much smarter, more efficient, but the same delicate little flower that she hides so well. She has also not climbed the ladder of judiciary action since we last saw her. Her humiliation attracts Dr. Lecter and in more ways than one. The novel's end is the most ridiculous thing I've probably ever read. It was as if, during the last forty pages, Harris had no idea how to conclude their little communication together so he gave into the carnal desires of lust and devotion and obsession. Clarice has never struck me as a woman who would annex her mind so easily, even if the mind is capable of creating an almost entirely new schema over a previous one. I feel I have already given too much away, if you're ever interested in reading this thing...though I suggest you do not.The one thing I liked about the continued character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is that we start to get his own background. Now that he is a free agent we get into his brain much more often and though it is a beautifully wicked place to be in it is also full of reasons, just like anyone would have, for the way he is. We even see him weak, screaming laments for his past. It sets up the next book, Hannibal Rising, rather nicely with the presentation of his sister Mischa. Though he is our typically creepy Dr. Lecter he suddenly has this sensitive side at the end that makes me, once again, question Harris' reasoning for giving into carnality instead of a more practiced, thought out approach.All in all the book is hardly worth reading unless, unfortunately, you would like to continue to the next book or at least complete your own developed concepts of the Lecter saga."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this book in one night...and slept with the lights on."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I suspect that many of us who so enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs on the big screen chose not to go to the movie sequel because of its 1) negative reviews, 2) emphasis on cannibalism, and 3) loss of Jodie Foster as the lead actress. Buying and reading the book was my alternative, and I recommend it very highly.I read this book at the same time that I was reading Nigel Nicholson's Executive Instinct, Managing the Human Animal in the Information Age; Kurt Eichenwald's The Informant (about routine corruption in the highest levels of corporate America) and several other books which I am reviewing. I mention this because in that context I do not find Hannibal to be about cannibalism, or find Starling to have converted to evil--instead what I see is one rennaissance man, so conflicted with the corruption in society at large that he chooses a very unconventional means of &quot;biting back&quot;. I see Starling as his soul mate, someone who was bullied and terribly abused by the government system she swore to serve loyally, who in the end chooses to join Hannibal in exile, having upheld the law (protected Hannibal from torture and murder) and taken physical and psychological revenge against the book's true antagonist, slime-ball opportunist Krendler.I found this book so compelling that I bought a second copy when my first was left behind on an airplane, and in the second reading I found even more detail supportive of the above perspective. Most of us will never be as talented as Hannibal, and most of us will never, thankfully, feel that our society is failing us so terribly that we must cast off the bounds of convention that maintain our stability and relative prosperity. Most of us would--in extremis--kill but not eat another human--and I hope that this leaves us with the question the author intended: which is the greater evil: murder for the sake of revenge, or calculated selective dining on targets that are--even by the standards of the conventional critics--among the lower beings that society has to offer up--Donnie Barber, for example, the butcher of deer, or the final course, Paul Krendler, who violated every oath he ever took?I hope the author pursues this theme, for mankind is confronting itself these days with terrible misbehavior, from trade in women and children to toxic dumping to the legal poisoning of our domestic water and food supplies. I would be most fascinated by how Hannibal might play if cast on a world stage, in the midst, say, of a G-8 or World Trade Organization Meeting.This is a seriously addictive story line by a very talented author, and it is very highly recommended for reading as a gentle means of provoking some of our deeper darker thoughts. This book does not condone nor encourage cannibalism--that is but a vehicle for helping us think outside the box. Superb!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I, like the rest of the world, waited in great anticipation for this sequel. I saw the movie first, was disappointed and was convinced that the story had merit and that there was an adaptation problem for the screen version. I ordered the book and read it in a day. This story that starts off so brillantly and with such a nice intricate plot structure ends up slowly nibbling itself away. You will end up with a stomach ache at the end instead a satisfied full feeling.There is a wonderful trilateral tension between Starling / (FBI), Mason and his henchmen and Hanniabal. At first the plot moves along very nicely, with these three elements intricately intertwined. Good developement with the new character Mason, a very satisfiying pace and some nice twists and turns. The symbolism and larger metaphors are easy to pick up yet not overbearing. Yet about 2/3's into the story it starts eating itself.Instead of focusing on the primary trilateral plotline, Harris degenrates the story by pulling up the sub-plots and supporting characters to carry the novel toward the latter end. Most troubling though is that Harris has misunderstood why people &quot;liked&quot; Hanniabal in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; People did not like the character, so much as they are fascinated and horrified by him at the same time. Much the same way people will stare with great intrest at a large insect that is squirming around in an aquarium. Harris has not understood this fact and it is what makes the ending so unbearably bad.One is truly under the impression that Harris must have been pushed by someone to complete this novel prematurely. Unfortunatly for his readers he gave in to a shock ending that simply will not digest or make any consistent sense in his readers' minds, given his previous development of these characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With the buzz surrounding the production of the 'Hannibal' movie and the sinister face of Sir Hopkins as Dr. Lecter peering out from the movie's poster (which I had to have and now looks spectacularly down at me from the wall of my room), I was itching to get my hands on the novel itself, but I knew I had to start from the beginning. The poster made me do it. I was hungry for Hannibal. I went out and purchased all three books, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Mind you, I had not seen Silence of the Lambs yet and such was the wonderful mystery of it all. It took me less than a couple of weeks to breeze through the first two books.Finally I felt deserving of 'Hannibal'. On the same night that I had finished Silence of the Lambs, (and having finished a book made me feel as if I had gone straight out and devoured it..simply delicious feeling that I revelled in..) I dived straight into the pages of 'Hannibal'.From the first chapter of this novel, the third volume of the Hannibal trilogy erupted right out of its pages and into your face. Clarice Starling's stakeout gone wrong and the bloodbath that ensued had me riveted to my chair and rooting for the gutsy gal. Mr. Harris is indeed gifted with the ability to paint startling images in our minds and he has done so with much gusto in just one chapter.And then the story kicked off, with Starling's suspension and the Crawford's inability to help out much. (It's a bit sad to see Crawford playing a very distant second fiddle to almost every character in this story. What happened to the Crawford we knew?)The story suddenly leaps to Florence, Italy, introducing Pazzi and the mysterious Dr. Fell. Rinaldo Pazzi, though scheming and greedy, still gained sympathy and empathy for, sadly, being human enough. Pazzi's deal with Mason Verger goes awry, but we all knew that they were playing on risky ground with Dr Fell aka Hannibal. The way he killed Giocco in the midst of a crowd, unexpectedly and swiftly, in itself drew attention to the fact that Thomas Harris was indeed delivering. I also thought that Dr. Lecter's mind trips into his memory palace was really cool and plausible. (one reviewer asked why mr. harris even bothered... well, to each his own tastes.. and isn't that what hannibal is about....individual taste.)Despite all the flak Hannibal has gotten from reviewers here, I believe that this novel still outshines most of the so-called horror-suspense-thriller novels of its time, and Harris deserves recognition for the risks he keeps taking. You can see that Harris' way of writing has changed over the years. His style in Red Dragon differs from Silence of the Lambs and now in Hannibal it has transcended even further.Dear Mr. Harris, thank you for Hannibal. Life wouldn't be the same without the acquaintance. I just hope the movie does justice to it..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although *Hannibal* is billed as the third part of a trilogy, the care with which Harris crafted *The Silence of the Lambs* is markedly absent from this book. This story is unmotivated and uninspiring - lacking both the edge and insight of the far superior *Lambs*.PLOT: The entire sequence in Italy says nothing - or at least nothing that couldn't have been said in some more meaningful way - and the rest of the story is neither new, nor engaging. Perhaps that's the reason Harris seems to spend far more time on graphic violence and sexual scenarios whose presence add nothing other than profanity-laden gore to this book.THEME: Since Harris uses *Hannibal* to consistently dismantle every moral and social victory won in *Lambs* I can only surmise that the theme ultimately boils down to a made-to-order clich&eacute; like: &quot;Eat your co-workers, drink expensive wine and be merry abroad for tomorrow we die.&quot;CHARACTER: Surveying the debris left behind by this disappointing book, it is clear the characters suffer the worst damage. Each takes particularly ugly hits (I've declared Clarice a federal disaster area) but of all the unfortunate character variations, Lecter wins the dubious distinction of being the most ludicrous. His transformation takes him from being a sort of social Scrooge to being St. Nick himself - complete with a satchel of presents for all the good little boys and girls.*Hannibal* should be scratched off reading lists everywhere and replaced by *Tears of Rage* - another book about an insidious crime, a bungled investigation, and an emerging hero. In *Tears of Rage* John Walsh confronts his readers with a reality far more frightening than Harris could ever create. Walsh's tears of rage will linger long after you lay his book aside."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone who has somehow convinced themselves that this is a brilliant novel need to get some rest and really expensive therapy, because Hannibal reeks. &quot;Stones From the River&quot; is a great novel. &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; is a great novel. Out of the approximately 1,300 novels released in the last month or so, EVERY LAST ONE of them is better than Hannibal. It has nothing one could remotely define as a plot. It glorifies depravity and mocks the greatness of its progenitor, Silence of the Lambs. Robert Harris should be ashamed to have his name on the cover of this sorry collection of incoherent paragraphs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok, everyone, back off! It is understandable that one would expect a sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to be appealing in the same way as it predessor. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a different novel. I disagree with the notion that the novel was written only as an attempt to cash in on the wealth of &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; What Harris has produced is captivating in its own right. While an argument can be made that there is no central character, it is also pretty clear that Hannibal Lecter controls the action. He almost seems to anticipate it. This is what is so chilling about the novel. The various sociopaths merely decorate a scheme that is entirely within Lecter's control. What makes the ending unique is the fact that every reader entertained thoughts about Starling and Lecter together but dismissed them as something that would never happen....surprise! It does happen! The way I see it, Harris had our expectations pegged and his ending is tailored to a tee."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Forget all the mixed reviews you've read in the media and the stupid spoilers you've seen on the internet. If you like horror fiction, you'll want to read this. Its probably too gross for those simply looking for a good book to read on the beach.

I havent come to any conclusions yet, exactly, but I certainly welcome your imput."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris sighted the ball, dropped it, and punted. This book is so poorly constructed it read like it was written in a week. Unlike his other books, Hannibal is totaly predicatible, totally overblown, and without any redeeming value whatsoever. This may be the low point of American publishing. Where was the editor? Where was the author. Thomas Harris had no desire to write, and this book shows how deep that antipathy went. He ought to have spent his time reviewing Italian hi-end consumer products for magazines."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am sure by the time you see this review you vill be very aware that something is terrible amiss with Mr. Harris. The pressure to produce must have been enormous. This was the most unsatisfactory ending I can remember ever reading. Poor Agent Starling!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm confused, was I reading the latest installment in the Hannibal Lector trilogy or a script from the Food Network. Even a devout foodie like me grew weary with the endless references to food, wine and Lector's &quot;distinctive copperplate hand&quot; There is a reason that editor's have jobs! What's more what has happened to our dear Dr. Lector; once the embodyment of evil he now seems like just another misunderstood dandy. Needless to say I was disappointed, this novel pales in comparison to Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon which I consider the finest of the three. Better luck with number four Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, what can I say? I bought it on the way home from work June 8 and finished it by eleven that night. I could do without the Florentine travelogue section, but by and large I felt replete. The prose has taken on a new looseness and sinuosity. The ending is a shocker with psychological infrastructure to legitimize it. It is genuinely, deliciously disturbing. Reading the bad reviews of this book make me aware of how we have changed since the 1970s, the decade from which I get my basic mindset -- there are a bunch of squeamish, political-correctness-shackled souls out there. This book may not be for them, but I am sent by it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow, what an awful book! I've read and re-read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; several times, and like many other reviewers here, I'm wondering whether the author of these two wonderful novels had anything to do with the disastrous &quot;Hannibal.&quot;To be fair, the first hundred or so pages would've been worth publishing as a novella or serialized story in, say, the New Yorker, but the rest of the book is pure trash. Hannibal and Clarice are ill-conceived caricatures of their former selves, and the childhood trauma explanation for Hannibal's perversions is truly silly. The over-the-top pornographic sadism only adds to the tawdriness, and reads like a hack writer's attempt at oneupmanship in the gross-out dimension.Obviously, Harris was pressured or otherwise felt the need to publish a third book in the trilogy, and I guess this is is revenge on his publishers, or on us. Someone should tear out the last four hundred or so pages and force him to eat them with some fava beans and a big Amarone.For God's sake don't waste a penny on this piece of junk!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Finished this book last night, and it was a real disappointment. If only one hadn't had to wait 11 years for the follow up to Silence. If Harris would have been pumping out a book every two years, one could forgive him this yawn-fest. Implausable and suspenseless. Sure, some exquisite gastro-intestinal touches. But I was hoping I'd be really doing some stomach-lurching and squirming reading this novel - as it was it was a real let down.As for Stephen King's review in the NYT Book Review (whose reviews are usually very kind to begin with): don't believe the hype. King's review is way too kind and he should know better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Absolutely horrible. I enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, but this is just Harris bringing the whole series to an end by killing off his characters. He didn't even do it well.A major disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris may perhaps be forgiven for falling in love with Hannibal Lecter, the character who made him a multi-millionaire. But the rest of us have no such excuse. Feeding someone his own brains is merely disgusting; it does not constitute true horror fiction. Harris falls into the trap of allowing his readers too much access to the mind of Hannibal Lecter, a narratological strategy that inevitably brings understanding and elicits a certain amount of sympathy for the &quot;good&quot; doctor. But such understanding and sympathy are totally misplaced here. Red Dragon remains harris' masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I finished &quot;Hannibal&quot; early this morning. It left me feeling like I'd been CHEATED! This book is a completely inadequate addition to the sometimes brilliant always extremely engrossing books Mr. Harris has written to date. It leaves me with the feeling that it was ghost-written at the behest of some publishing executive who was solely interested in book sales and movie rights.Now for my reasons. In &quot;The Red Dragon&quot;, Mr. Harris created a serial killer so rich in detail I was brought to tears when it was explained how this person became a monster. We are also introduced to Jack Crawford, Will Graham and the great Hannibal Lector. Mr. Harris continued his tour de force with &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; where we are introduced to Clarice Starling and Paul Krendler while the brilliant and courageous Will Graham is dismissed as being an alcoholic with a scarred face living in seclusion in Florida.Now to Hannibal. This time Crawford is the great character dumped on the scrap pile. After the brilliant start in her career, Harris expects us to believe that Krendler has cleverly orchestrated Clarice's career so that she's relegated minor assignments. On the other hand Krendler is so obviously a jerk, you'd think anyone with the brains of an amoeba could see what he's up to.All the &quot;career-threatening&quot; trouble Clarice has with the FBI could have handled easily by a second-year law student.The explanations of Hannibal's behavior are weak and unconvincing. Harris would have done a lot better to leave them out. Harris also expects us to believe that one of the most infamous criminals in history can hide while living in high-style. (Josef Mengele couldn't pull that off.)Of course Clarice finds him with ridiculous ease.I could go on here, but I'll finish now. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is little more than your basic off-the-shelf thriller. The kind of book you read on a flight ot Tokyo and leave on the seat for the next passenger.It is not worthy of Thomas Harris,not worth the seven year wait and definitely not worth the price. Wait for the paperback version you'll find at your local laundromat."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not surprised to find that Stephen King wrote a favorable review of HANNIBAL. It is likely that King, more than any other living writer, understands the position Thomas Harris found himself in after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. When you have written a book (or in King's case, more than one book) which has become a cultural icon, how do you follow it up? What do you offer as an encore? How do you avoid the Son of Tarzan, Daughter of Frankenstein plight? Fans who adored your previous effort will resist any attempt to mess with &quot;their&quot; characters.Both Harris and King chose to take the same approach. Over the top. Tongue in cheek. Throw the kitchen sink at the adoring masses and then giggle at their outrage.I gave Stephen King up over a decade ago because I got tired of arrogant self-indulgence drawn out over 700 pages. I found myself praying for an editor with the nerve to really edit the icon down to a tight 350 pages. And found myself irritated as well because, when King writes from the heart, no one does it better.In HANNIBAL, Harris even gives a clue as to what is going on when he writes about the floral arrangements. Too much becomes not enough. The only way to improve upon &quot;too much&quot; is to add more. That is precisely what he has done here. He created a villain so hideous that Hannibal pales in comparison. Harris slyly reverses the good and evil roles until readers find themselves uncomfortable and itchy. And -- like King -- when he is good, Harris is very, very good.Tom, why not try writing under another name? Get away from being &quot;Thomas Harris&quot; and just concentrate on being a good writer. Because you are one when you are not acting out. Thanks for the passages that I read and then re-read with delight. Thanks for describing the Florence that I love. Thanks for making me twitchy and uneasy. Thanks for a rich chocolate dessert with so much gooey icing that my teeth hurt afterward and I found myself wishing the baker had cut down on the sugar content. Have a good decade."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's funny, reading these online reviews -- the enraged one-star people and the amazed five-star people, battling it out for the spin on Hannibal.Even the critics are doing the same -- Stephen King gives a rave in the New York Times, while USA Today screams about the Columbine shootings and derides the book as trash.Outrage, amazement. Aren't the best works of art the ones that polarize the audience?Hannibal -- despite the rather hasty copyediting job that one reader pointed out -- is a stunning piece of horror fiction. It is not for those who read Patricia Corn-whatnot and Dean Koontz. It is not for the airplane paperback crowd.This is not meant to sound snobby. I read trash too. But this is not a literary suspense novel like Red Dragon, nor a breakneck pop thriller like Silence of the Lambs. It is a horrific and disturbing piece of work that's very well written.As for the ending (and shame on Salon for that pointless spoiler story that reads like a rough draft for Entertainment Weekly), I think of it as a brave and shocking twist. Harris begins the first chapter with punchy, bare, standard-issue action novel prose ... then, slowly, turns the novel into something very different, something very unexpected and ... horrifying."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"These books are really great to put your nerves on end and get you heart pumping with fear and foreboding."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One of my fondest wishes in life is to sit down for several hours with Thomas Harris and a bottle of excellent scotch and find out WHERE he got his mind, HOW HE KNOWS SO MUCH about the darkness and of humankind, and how he can write about it with such gentleness. I stumbled completely unawares on TSOTL in a convenience store as I was headed to a winter weekend camping alone on a Southern beach, began reading it as soon as I'd pitched my tent, was so terrified I barricaded myself with it in a toilet stall in the seashore campground's bathroom until I could sit no longer, ran through the dark to my tent, trying not to scream, and finished it with a hot-loaded .357 in my lap. And so it was with great curiosity and relish that I snatched up Hannibal as soon as it hit the shelf. As other reviewers note, it is not as uniformly excellent in craft and tone as TSOTL, but it is a masterful work, rich and dense and elegant. My only criticism is that there is another entire book missing, the book detailing the darkness and sexuality and maturation from lost girl to betrayed young woman to uncrowned virgin queen of Clarice Starling so that she is ready for the pairing portrayed in the book, a meet partner for Hannibal, mother, sister, destroyer. The day I finished Hannibal, I began calling that book into existence because it will be an enormous challenge to write. Who will accomplish it, I wonder..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very pleased with the book! I have read all the other Hannibal books. I love the way this one ended! By far one of the best reads I've had in a long time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When Thomas Harris created the infamous Hannibal Lector in Red Dragon he couldn't have known the influence that character would have on crime fiction for the next decade. By the time he came to write Hannibal, ten years after his previous book, The Silence of The Lambs, he must have felt some serious pressure. The fact that Hannibal is the book it is, when written under these circumstances, makes it all the more remarkable.To call it a crime novel is doing it a grave injustice and reading it as such will also leave the reader disappointed. This book sits closer to Stoker's Dracula or Shelly's Frankenstein than the serial killer fare of Michael Connelly. Treat this book more as gothic fairytale and you won't be disappointed.The greatest triumph of The Silence of The Lambs is, as iconic as the film version is, it scarecely registers as you read the book. You are taken into another world and any thought of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are gone. The same is true of Hannibal, and then some."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Loved this book!

As I said above, you won't believe how it all turns out. I enjoyed this series so much, but the ending still nags at me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Pretty much every view regarding this book has been presented; what more is there to say? I have a take on the book I haven't seen in the reviews I have had the opportunity to read. While reading Hannibal, a quote by Nietzshe came to mind (I've seen this quote used several times in books about criminal profiling, the career Clarice once aspired to): &quot;Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.&quot; To me, the driving force in the book was to show Clarice's slow transformation as everything around her, all she has worked for, was crushed. She spent hours in &quot;Hannibal's house&quot; trying to get inside the mind of the Doctor. If while hunting Hannibal she could think like a killer, what really separates her from the killer himself? I enjoyed this book very much, it was an exciting thrill ride that also prompted me to do some thinking. Plus the infamous ending stayed in my mind for weeks; after I finished the novel my mind raced around, and I could not get to sleep. What more could an author ask for than to have that effect? If you haven't already read Hannibal, give it a try... you just might like it. I can't wait for the movie!-Linsey, linsey.bluejade@eudoramail.com"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can be said about HANNIBAL that hasn't been said already? Hannibal Lecter has become an instantly identifiable icon, an image of madness and insanity that the public has lapped up in droves. His third appearance in fiction has as many detractors as rabid fans, arguing intensely over whether the book is true to what has happened previously, or whether it stains the memory of Lecter and his unusual relationship with FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Jodie Foster, Starling's physical manisfestation in the movie version of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, stated that she wouldn't reprise the role for HANNIBAL, seeing the novel as an insult to her perceptions of how Clarice would grow as a character.Clearly, HANNIBAL is many things to many people. But let's view it for what it is: a horrific thrill-ride through the consciousness of a demon. The only crime Thomas Harris commits is in delivering a product that people didn't expect.HANNIBAL puts the infamous serial killer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter into the centre spotlight, after consigning him to a supporting role in the previous novels, RED DRAGON and LAMBS. Enjoying his new-found freedom, he is slowly but relentlessly being pursued by Mason Verger; a survivor of Lecter's assaults, and an individual even creepier and unforgivable than Lecter is. Verger uses Starling as his pawn, reeling her along with the hope that Lecter will be unable to resist the bait.The true flaw in HANNIBAL is that Harris takes for granted that the reader will know and understand the unusual relationship Lecter and Starling share. It works as a sequel, but is unable to stand up as an achievement in its own right, unlike both DRAGON and LAMBS, pinacles of the serial killer genre. This lessens the impact somewhat, as does his subplot involving the Barney the orderly, and Verger's body-building sister. They are interesting characters, but aren't given enough character arc to fit in completely.But Harris redeems himself with his presentation of Lecter's life outside the prison cell. Lecter functions in the world quite well, attaining wealth and prestige through his not-inconsiderable intellect. The web that Harris draws around Lecter, disparate elements slowly converging to encircle and capture Hannibal, is a rivetting display of skillful plotting.Some have criticized the decision to reveal parts of Lecter's past, but these glimpses only heighten the mystique that surrounds him. Harris is far more generous in his background to Verger, a malevolent creature of such despicable proportions that he could star in a novel of his own. Harris follows his now-familiar technique of comparing monsters, displaying Verger in stark contrast to Lecter in the same manner as Francis Dollarhyde and Jame Gumb were presented in DRAGON and LAMBS, respectively.Starling is also presented in a memorable light. Far from being the idealistic young trainee of LAMBS, Starling is now a disgraced agent who is haunted by her past actions, both on the job and with Lecter. She is completely at odds with her world, finding herself used and controlled both by Verger and Lecter, as well as certain elements of the FBI. Her downfall, and eventual conclusion, adds a heart-breaking note to the chase.And the ending. Without spoiling the surprise, it is both unexpected, and fair to the characters, despite the uproar it caused. I believe it is Harris's attempt to wrest control of the characters back to his domain. Considering the immense pressures that were undoubtedly heaped upon Harris after the gigantic sucess of LAMBS (both as novel and film), a lesser artist would have merely given the public what they wanted. Harris does something more: he provides the audience with an ending that would silence those who make Lecter into a heroic figure. Never losing sight of the fact that Hannibal is a monster, Harris plays off of Lecter's legend, leaving the reader unnerved. It's the author's way of screaming, &quot;He's my character, not yours! Now, back off!&quot;And perhaps it's a blessing that HANNIBAL ends the way it does. Harris is far too talented a writer to be constrained into writing sequels. By laying Lecter to rest (in a manner of speaking), Harris can dive into new territories, surprising us in the same way that he caught us off guard with RED DRAGON. Hannibal may be silent, but let's hope Harris refuses to remain so."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a great book.There is one thing about great books: everyone can find something in them. Judging on the sample of reviews I had time to read, it is also the case with Hannibal.If you have not yet seen the movie, do not go. The movie is a sloppy job intended to scare. The book is much more of a discussion.If you have not read The Silence of the Lambs, do it. Do not skimp on time - you will enjoy Hannibal more if you savor the details of its language, the complexity of its characters and the subdued references to the Silence.Hannibal is a mature writing. Harris does not seem to be much interested any more in hunting the monster. He is rather amused with exploring his Frankenstein, poking from time to time beyond the surface, every time wary of the danger to slide into the abyss of Lecter's soul. That is probably why Lecter's personal story in this book is like the shaking of hand on a drawing that deserves to be spotless. Do not go deeper than you are allowed to... In Hannibal, Harris makes some tough decisions. Many changes happen to people and places, comparing to the times of the Silence. The changing preferences of the author are also easy to recognize. Original Dante comes to replace FBI slang. Quantico surroundings transform into the landscape of Florence. Psychology goes into philosophy. The world of technique disappears, history and art taking the free space. Just like cheese getting aged, wine getting mature, people getting seasoned.It might seem weird not to mention Clarice Starling. Yet this is exactly what makes the book so great - the story manages the author, not the way around. Harris wanted her to be in to star. Instead, she is inferior to the context, pulled out for use whenever needed. So are the other human characters. Because Hannibal addresses issues of superhuman nature, something we are not supposed to know, only to guess. So there is a lot of guessing there, complemented with facts from the surface. In the end it is still much more of a fairy tale, luring us all along with scenes changing from pain to beauty. There was not much beauty in the Silence, but there was quite some craving for it. Harris somehow did not hit the balance right, in the hindsight. Now he does.One of the few books that deserve to be on any shelf, Hannibal must be translated with care. I skimmed the German version and was disappointed. It may take years to get good interpretations - in other languages, in movies, in reviews. For now, you'd better read the original English text.Do you share Marcus Aurelius' belief that the future generations are not any better than the passed ones? Then start building your own memory palace. In the end, there was much more order in the past, as Lecter learned from some theorists. But does the past contain answers to some of our most desperate inquiries? A good analysis always leaves you with more unanswered questions than before.\\"We can only learn so much and live.\\"Read this book -- you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited with bated breath for this book to show up. I was ready to have my nerves tingle as with _The Silence of the Lambs_. And it did, for the first 3/4 of the book. And the last part of the book ruined the whole durn thing. I can't even go back and read _Silence..._ again because of it.I applaud Jodie Foster for her integrity in not repeating her role as Clarice because of what Harris did with her in this novel. I'm sorry I paid the cover price for it, it was such a disappointment. Shame on you, Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having loved \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", I anxiously anticipated this book, and I can't say I was entirely disappointed. However, I must say that anyone looking forward to a second \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" will be disheartened. This book has a pessimistic outlook, with few happy or hopeful moments. Heros, it seems, do not always meet our expectations, and can fall from grace, perhaps leading us to care less for them. Although I suppose the ending of this book could be construed as happy by some, it's not exactly uplifting, and would certainly be found disturbing by most people. However, anyone who chooses to read this book after reading \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" could certainly not be expecting a story of happiness and light.I actually found the content of this book more distressing than the previous two, not so much due to Lecter's activities, but rather those of Mason Verger. In an interesting turn, there arises a monster more heinous than even Dr. Lecter and Jame Gumb, and you find yourself fairly rooting for Lecter to avoid capture and exact punishment on someone even less appealing.I found very interesting the description of the palace of Hannibal Lecter's mind. It reminded me briefly of something I have read elsewhere, explaining how some people with photographic memories manage to retain so much of what they have seen. This book is written with a certain elegance, and Dr. Lecter's character's cultural refinements make for colourful images. It was also nice to see some of Lector's history, which may explain some of his deviant personality traits.The plot of this story definitely creates some unique imagery. Once scene in particular, near the end, left me hoping that a movie will be made based on this book, because I would be curious to see how special effects could be utilized to create a scenario I have certainly never envisioned before.If you are a fan of the horror genre, are not squeamish, and are curious as to what became of Dr. Lecter and Clarice, I recommended reading this book. This book, although shocking and disturbing at times, is definitely not predictable, and won't leave you yearning for a sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I will not upset the one or two people who haven't read this book but still want to by giving it away. Suffice that I understand entirely why the film ending is different, that I threw it out after finishing it and advised friends and acquaintances not to read it, and think Mr Harris needs help if he thinks this was an appropriate ending for a lead like Clarice Starling. If we want to see evil win we have only to look out the window; in fiction I prefer to have some hope left to me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Because I enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs, I really looked forward to Hannibal. And given the amount of time the author put into the tale, I truly expected something magnificent. In some ways, it is. Mr. Harris writes with clarity, with an eye for the minute detail and also beautiful imagery. However there is no consistency in the behavior of main character, Clarice Starling. Some of the things he had Clarice doing I would never have imagined her doing in a million years. Don't let me get started on the amount of gratuitous violence...I'd be here all day. Just suffice it to say this book is possibly the most gross piece of literature I've ever had the displeasure of reading. It seems the author wanted us to feel sympathy for the monster, Hannibal Lecter. I have no compassion for a man who eats his fellow man. I'm truly sorry I couldn't give this five stars. If I were grading it solely on the writer's ability to compose wonderful sentences, paragraphs, I'd indeed give it five stars. But a writer has a responsibility do much more than entertain. There is no human feeling in this book. If you like suspense and horror, I suggest you read a Dean Koontz book. He's an excellent writer of this sort of story, and he manages to write with compassion. The end of this tale is a travesty! I do not write spoilers. But see if you don't agree with me. I felt totally cheated with this sophomoric effort at riding off into the sunset and ,frankly, thought both the writer and Clarice Starling had lost their minds! No, I definitely don't recommend this read. And I'm not putting my name on this review because I don't want my close friends to know I read Hannibal!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's been seven years since Special Agent Clarice Starling visited Hannibal Lecter in the asylum inSilence of the Lambs. She's still with the FBI, although out of favor after a recent shoot-out. Wealthy recluse Mason Verger has been planning Hannibal's demise since he was under Lecter's psychiatric care. That association left Verger paralyzed and mutilated, with only thoughts of revenge to keep him alive. An Italian inspector has found Lecter living the good life in Florence, and is about to bring him to the diabolical Verger and back into Starling's life.I listened to Thomas Harris read the audio book; I thought it would be interesting to hear the author read his own words, but I was wrong. Harris' twanging drawl was distracting and unchanging; all the characters - men and women, Americans and Italians - sounded exactly alike, except for one - he did a fine job with Verger's unique vocal impairment.Clarice, Lecter, and Verger are all well-written, complex characters. Clarice is a workaholic and a loner, Lecter is a cunning and refined man of the world, and Verger is, without doubt, the most repellent villain I've come across in a long time. The book's ending is surprisingly different from the movie version and completes the Hannibal-Clarice story nicely. I liked the book very much (but not the reader, thus only 4 stars). The story is scary, disgusting, and packed with action. If you're a fan of the Hannibal Lecter books, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Hannibal, Thomas Harris found himself challenged to produce a thriller that was more shocking and frightening than his previous two works, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Rather than producing a truly frightening and terrifying sequel, however, Harris has served up a literary gross-out that isn't frightening, merely repugnant. There are no real chills or surprises in Hannibal, only distasteful scenes of mutilation, culinary lobotomies (the much talked-out ending of the book that Jodie Foster refused to duplicate on film), and evisceration. To make matters worse, Harris tries to make his book intellectually shocking by adding philosophical quips that are anti-white male, anti-Christian, anti-middle American, and even anti-heterosexual. The result is a verbal gross-out mixed with asinine, politically-correct sermonizing one expects from a Vermont college professor. The overarching message of the book is that it's okay to kill people who are sexist or lack cultural sophistocation. Harris may think that by repulsing people that he's succeeded in being delightfully shocking, but I say revulsion is no substitute for genuine thrills. Hannibal is a grotesque, insulting, and not particular scary book. A thoroughly disappointing end to the SOTL trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Normally, I treat the movie-adaptation of a book with extreme prejudice. If the author's work is indeed a peice of art all his own, what right does the director have to completely retool it to his liking (and often to the distaste of many others)? However, I saw Hannibal before I read this book (having caught the Thomas Harris fervor a bit late), and I was a bit shocked to learn that the ending of the movie was completely different from the book's ending. After reading the original ending, I realized why.The ending to Hannibal is left completely unexplained. Yes, Thomas Harris did explain the actions and even left us with an epilogue, but there is no method to this mad ending. *spoiler alert* Clarice completely turns her back on everything she has ever been taught, and runs away without a second thought. The whole time Clarice was sitting across from Lecter, I expected her to actually *think* about what she was doing and rationalize it in her mind. Unless those drugs had a permanent effect on her brain, there is no way I can swallow this disappointing ending. Even if that is the case, it's an uninspired end to a great trilogy.It's been said many times before, but stick to Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After typing my first review, I thought about my comments and went back and read the book again. Perhaps I read too quickly the first time, but reading it again I found little things that altered my opinion some. Lecter isn't the hero that I had first said, now that I have gone through the story again. Harris, I think does attempt to get the reader to sympathize with Lecter's childhood, but in the end remains the fiendish, diabolical genius he always was."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book has no redeeming qualities. It is grotesque, stomach-turning, and obscenely graphic. I liked &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; but Harris should have stopped there and spared us all the misery of Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While perhaps not as compact and streamlined as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; does provide many thrilling moments for the reader. It picks up where &quot;Silence&quot; left off, with Hannibal Lecter free and Clarice Starling still with the FBI. Seven years have passed, and Lecter, whose fondness for the finer things in life will play an important part later in the book, is living in Florence. Meanwhile, Starling's career in the FBI seems to be in jeopardy as she is made a scapegoat for a botched drug arrest. A new character, Lecter's sixth victim, Mason Verger, mutilated and strapped to a ventilator, plots an elaborate revenge on the doctor. In many aspects, the book is thrilling and the inevitable meeting of Lecter and Starling crackles with intensity. Lecter's deeds throughout the book are often overshadowed by the sadistic acts perportrated by Mason Verger in his quest for revenge. A little history behind Hannibal Lecter is also introduced, in an attempt to explain perhaps the method behind his madness. The book's only shortcoming would be that the character of Starling is not as vividly drawn or as strong as she was in &quot;Silence,&quot; and indeed seems to be only a shadow of her former self through most of the book. Also, the ending was not quite what I expected, having a great deal to do with some out of character behavior by Starling that is not explained to total satisfaction. All that aside, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is worth every minute spent reading, and Harris' restraint and delicate touch keep the book together, never allowing the violence to become too overwhelming. A high-minded psychological thriller that will be enjoyed by fans of the series. Newcomers should read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; first for the full effect."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris had a tough act to follow after 'Silence of the Lambs'. Did he manage it? Did he develop a good story? The answer to both is yes. It may have taken him a number of years to write, but the story 'Hannibal' is exquisitely crafted. The characters are well developed and plausible, the pace is just right, in fact everything is right to make the book hard to put down. One sails through the first four hundred pages, meeting good and bad characters, loving and hating them, learning facts one never knew about and dying to know what will happen next. And then the story builds to a climax. And the ending is revealed. And it doesn't make sense. Towards the end Thomas Harris looses plausibility and the story becomes ridiculous. Obviously one has to suspend disbelief when reading about a charcter such and Hannibal Lecter, but does one have to accept the ridiculous? To comment in detail would give away the end. But I will say that the book has an ending that it does not deserve. One is left feeling cheated. I cannot help wondering if someone other that the author actually wrote it, for a substantially brillant story is ruined by a very silly ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you found &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; disturbing, gruesome and horrifying, you haven't read anything yet. Steel yourself for this one. &quot;Hannibal&quot; has all the horror elements of its predecessor but this time dips even more deeply into the psyche of the good Dr. Lecter, which of course is not the most pleasant place to visit in the first place. We also discover that the valiant Clarice Starling has a darker side than previously shown, and the cruel and brutal forces which push her there create some of the more tense and anxiety-ridden sections of the book. The most fearsome horrors of the novel (and there are plenty) pale in comparison to the shock of the ending, which will probably cause fierce debates among Thomas Harris' readers and create more than a few problems when it's time for &quot;Hannibal&quot; to go to Hollywood. Well worth the read (I polished it off in one day, I couldn't help it) but be prepared."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is very strange. It is nothing like &quot;Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The ending is very strange. I wont give it away here. It also gives insights into Lecter's past. The tension of his other novels are absent from this one but what this book lacks in suspense it makes up for in wierdness. The only part I didn't like was when Harris talked for several pages about some painting or something. But this is a very good that horror fans should read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There was nothing that could prepare me for the ending of Thomas Harris's long-awaited Hannibal. As I was truly enjoying becoming re-acquainted with Clarice and Hannibal, even Barney and Ardelia Mapp, the ending was truly a shock. Yes, there are many monsters in this book, and it's difficult to discern who the good guys are, but this is a definite page turner. I won't give away any secrets for those who haven't read it; there are things that we would have been as happy not to know, but if you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs and feel that you know these characters, this is the book for you. You won't feel that way at the end. At least I didn't."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An excellent sequel to 'The Slience of the Lambs'. Thomas Harris made us wait 11 years for another Hanibal Lecter book, but it was worth the wait! Harris is the absolute master of the serial killer genre. This is one of the best books I read this summer, don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"no one who has read harris's other work will be disappointed. but don't count on getting a good night's sleep during the course of your reading. after digesting (indeed!) only 1/3 of the story yesterday (the first day of publication), i tossed and turned and walked my darkened apartment (relocking doors/windows over and over) all night. by the time i'm finished, i fear this tale of unparalleled revenge will dwell in my psyche for a very long time and that worries me. still, i will read on until the end. after a 12-year wait, what more could one ask for?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read it in one sitting, so it held my attention. The plot moves along and the details about Florence are interesting. But I do not like how it ends. The ending is unsatisfying and implausible."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found Hannibal not as sophisticated as The Silence of the Lambs. Lectar plays a very prominent role in this book. However, I found the some parts rather gruesome and unnecessary. Lectar was portrayed as an evil man even though he seemed to have found some comfort in Starling. Nevertheless, it was an interesting read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"More than being the projected future of Hannibal Lecter post-SOTL, this third entry in the trilogy may say more about how the author has applied the profits from his first two novels. European travel and fine wines. I found the Italian travelogue overlong, murky, and tiresome, and was nauseated by the endless descriptions of Hannibal's impeccable, pretentious tastes in literature, language, wine, art, etc., etc. Many of the characters were well-conceived, and the ending, plot and action sequences were fine, but I agree with those who say this novel was written with a film in mind. I won't go see it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought Thomas Harris's third in the Lecter series was a big dissapointment. The first two books drew heavily from real life case studies on serial killers and drew you in to the point that it was hard to put them down.In this, his third, I felt hes lost it a little bit. It features the confusing return of characters that only played a minor role in the other books such as Barney, the hospital orderly which was badly thought-out. Its like its become a serial killer soap opera with all your favourites coming back to play out increasingly cliched and cringe-worthy roles.Giving Lecter a motive and making his killings seem like just deserts for his victims was a cowardly &amp; I feel a little reactionary way to end this trilogy. What are we supposed to think, that if you abuse children then you should meet a grisly death at the hands of a serial killer?I don't regard this as my view point &amp; I was appalled at Harris trying to present this character as some kind of hero. It broke with the whole theme that he had carefully built up throughout the other books.The ending is so far-fetched (in terms of the world that Harris has created, even) that it seems like a dream sequence. I almost expected a white rabbit clutching a pocket-watch to pop up and inform them that they were late for the party.I enjoyed the book but it most definitely didn't satisfy the way the others did and I feel that maybe Harris wants to make some more hard-cash following the major success that was Silence of the Lambs. Who can blame him - but I, for one, won't be getting the next sequal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the glowing King review in the Times, I was expecting a harrowing and wonderful ride. Instead I was bored. Most of the characters were 2 dimensional caricatures -- cartoon villains. Lecter and Starling had a bit more depth, but the story around them was so weak that I felt sorry they were trapped in it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story line and detail kept me reading past my bedtime more than once. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. However, I had to backtrack several times to be sure that &quot;last meal&quot; was not some sort of hallucination or dream sequence. I can't say that I &quot;believed&quot; or agreed with much of the last chapters. However it WAS a different and gutsy ending, and I'm NOT sorry I bought the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although Hannibal is an interesting book, it seems Harris made a conscious effort to put forth a book that will be next to impossible to make into a movie. Harris should have used an editor on this one as his ramblings about Lecter's shopping are just too monotonous. Starling grows from the assertive, strong female lead to a weak doll, easily manipulated by Lecter. Women should be furious that Harris has turned her into a sap! I dare someone to make this movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris, THE true master of psychological suspense, once again delivers the impossible--a breathtaking page-turner filled with descriptions so intricate that one truly sees the locations and feels each emotion the author intends to elicit. As a longtime suspense reader often bored with trite, predictable endings, I was truly blown away. Even avid Harris readers will be haunted by the finale of this impeccably researched tome. Five stars does not begin to do this work credit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"OK, first the problems. The story is too cinematic. You see Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster enacting this; you see the eventual movies' cuts and edits, you hear the music. At times it seems a treatment for a screenplay. Also, the tempo is off. Some sections are not adequately developed while others (in Italy, for example) go on far too long. The cultural references are just plain tedious. That said, this book contains sections of masterly and memorable writing. The kind you want to highlight with yellow marker so you can easily refer to them later. Some chapters are nothing short of brilliant. And the authorial asides--and you never forget there's an author--are not intrustive, but trenchant. It is a literary thriller, more so than the earlier books, which might have been structurally sounder but less well written. The psychological war between Starling and Lecter remains as fascinating as always, and is taken in new directions, to deeper levels of obsession and malevolence. What is the attraction between these people? That's the question being probed. As well as their vulnerabilities. I'm not sure Harris pulls off his attempt to lodge a psychological explanation of Lecter. But it doesn't matter. Mason Verger, by the way, is a terrific addition: his character is repugnant and shocking but totally compelling, a malicous Elephant man. Sometimes you don't know who to root for. Unsettling to say the least. And not politically correct or predictable. Good."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Either you love it or you hate it. I loved it! Harris brings you into a macabre world that can only be imagined. The writing is suggestive with out being gory and I ate up(no pun intended ) every chapter. Yes, I was also disappointed at the ending- but only for a momemt. After much thought (I told you the book stays with you), it makes sense. Sense for a sequel. For those that have read the book, can't you just see them in action?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"... and what an illiterate piece over-hyped trash. To fans of Harris' previous novels (as I am), you'd be wise to skip this one. It's dull, inexplicably gruesome, poorly edited (there's a mistake on practically every page), and betrays us (and our beloved heroine) with a scene so outlandish and out-of-place at the very end that the book borders on the unforgivable. Eleven years for this? For shame, Mr. Harris... for shame."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wouldn't give away this book. Literally. I wouldn't want the receiver of my gift to think I would condone such a horrible display of literary talent. Gang members? Inplausible media reactions? Man hungry farm animals? Is this guy kidding? The same plot, different parchment. It was obvious that Harris rushed to get &quot;Hannibal&quot; published. I think maybe he should have stopped on &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; instead of trying to write a trilogy. Some moments of the book were dull and exhaustive. I skimmed atleast 2 entire chapters in the book and did not miss a single arm movement in the plot. Harris made it all to obvious that he was trying to &quot;shock&quot; the reader. Without sounding completely cruel and mean, I will end on this note. I want my money back!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged audio version of HANNIBAL, and have been haunted for 2 days now. The story was not so much a sequel, but an explanation of all you wondered and supsected about Hannibal since he was first introduced in THE RED DRAGON. You finally begin to understand what makes him tick, and by this understanding, you become frightened at how much you can respect and relate to this monster. Many friends have told me that they hated the conclusion/ending of this book, but I believe Thomas Harris had it just right. It absolutley had to result in the path he chose for Clarice and Hannibal.. We all had to see it coming, and frightening thought it was, it was perfect. I highly recommend the unabridged audio version to all who cannot wait to see the movie.. The narrator will send chills down your spine , and the supsense is unbelievable.. Good work Thomas.. I look forward to hearing what may come next...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to say that this novel definitely made in an impact on me. I am not generally a reader of horror or the macabre but I made an exception in this case because of the tie in with Silence of the Lambs. Because of my lack of experience in this particular genre I am a little leery of making a judgement but I have decided to do so in order to give a certain perspective to this work.Hannibal is without a doubt one of the most troubling pieces of fiction I have read in the last few years. The actions are bizarre and shocking throughout the novel. This is not a complaint. These are the types of things I would expect in a book of this type. My problem was not with the shock value and or the gore but rather with the character and plot development.I thought that the pacing of the book was suspect. There is no doubt that Mr. Harris has a wonderful gift of describing with an understated manner the most shocking of events. Unfortunately, it sometimes seemed as if events were manufactured in this novel for not other purpose than to showcase this verbosity.The characters did not seem to follow along patterns that would be consistent with their development but rather with the predetermined events Mr. Harris had devised for them. A classic example would be the ending in its entirety. Although shocking and in some ways satisfying I found the ending to be disappointing because it did not fit together with the other 90 percent of the book.I enjoyed reading this novel but could not help but feel a strong editor's hand would have aided it mightily."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris takes his time in a novel to get it write. Deep, dark, strange, his previous novels were &quot;all nighters&quot;, difficult to put down. On Hannibal, the money got to him. Pressure from editors and big money from movie producers. He has his price. The 1st half is absorbing. The 2nd half was a quick write. Logically not connected. Characters manipulated for a screen play versus a good novel. The money got impatient and Harris got sloppy and pleasing. The result, a unbelievable, illogical mess that could use a good rewrite before the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"enjoyed most of the book (+ 4 stars), until the last 40 pages (- 3 stars). i'll pass the book along, after i rip those pages out. otherwise, forget about it. i heard jodie won't play the part, now i understand why."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I simply don't understand why people don't love this book. I think this book got such low ratings was because Clarice Starling was everyone's likeable hero in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I wish you people would stop letting her suck you up, read Silence of the Lambs again, and look at how weird she actually was. And also if you didn't read Silence of the Lambs, there is no possible way you can understand Hannibal. I enjoyed Hannibal immensly. I liked it better than his previous book, it concludes the whole series with a beautifal ending. In Silence of the Lambs, especially in the movie, you get this huge impression that Dr. Lecter is a monster. A savage killing monster. Not true. You'll find out the more you read that Dr. Lecter isn't at all insane. He kills people but he's courteous and smart. Since Special Agent Starling was crazy ever since she was ten years old, I don't really find the ending very surprising at all! But actually more breath taking! I suggest you read all of his books, and come to understand them better, and find out how great of an author he really is. Thank you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just have to say that this book and especially the ending is just too good to be true.I had trouble sleeping after finishing this book, not because i couldnt handle the violence or the horrors, i was just so amazed that an ending could be this different and provocative.Lecter IS the hero."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As I read the book I was constantly plagued by the weak writing and unbelievable events that happened in the story. There were many occasions that I had to read and re-read sentences or whole paragraphs to decypher the words, there were several times when I was unsuccessful.It was only by sheer force of will that I was able to finish the book. Once I had swallowed my disbelief and realized how Harris was going to end this waste of time I had to force myself to keep reading. I now look back at those 15 minutes as 15 minutes that I will never get back. When I consider the other ways I could have spent that time I am saddened. I could have used that time to clean a cats litter box and encounter better literature.If you feel you truly MUST read about Hannibal make sure it's the one with the elephants and not the unbelievable wet literary noodle in this collection of words. (I can't bring myself to call it a novel.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was worth the wait, I've got the weekend off, to read it in, so I'll lock myself in friday night and won't come out until I'm done with it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Overall, this book was rather disappointing. The story has a very disjointed kind of feel to it. I suspect that the author wrote the middle section first and then tried to build the story around it. While the structure is lacking, the actual writing is pretty good. I agree with the other reviewer who said: \\"good storyteller; bad story.\\" I was also disappointed by the lame attempt to try and soften Hannibal's psychopathy by providing a \\"reason\\"--childhood trauma, of course. I thought this weakened the character instead of giving him depth (as, I suspect, was the intention). Despite these flaws, the writing was good enough to keep me reading. The ending, however, was utterly stupid. I won't spoil it but you'll see what I mean if you get there.I say \\"if\\" because I wouldn't recommend this book.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book didn't even come close to anything near my expectations. I saw the movie when it first came out and when taken independently, the movie was mediocre at best. When it's pointed out that this is remotely related to Silence of the Lambs, the movie was a complete waste of time. The book is completely different, at the end I was shaking my head in total disbelief. Not like \\"I can't believe it.\\" but more like \\"Completely implausible, yeah, right.\\"I didn't think the characters were fully rounded and there was no depth in Hannibal this time.Not worth your time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am unsure whether to give this book five stars or one star - something which has never happened to me before in my long history of reading! It is especially odd since I have recently reviewed both the splendid Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and given them both five star rave reviews without a single qualm.(SORRY - SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW)The case for 5 starsHannibal is written beautifully, with the stunning metaphors and descriptive language I came to love in the past two books in the trilogy. Thomas Harris writes with a unique style that is a pleasure to read. The story is full of twists and turns and the ending is the most unusual, shocking one ever written - but whether this is a good thing remains to be seen.Hannibal Lecter's character is developed and deepened, which I liked, and we are given insights into what has made him into such a monster. Not much is added to the character of Clarice, but most of her background was discussed in Silence of The Lambs. Instead for most of the book we empathise with her as she has been held back from promotion because of jealousy and sexism.The case for 1 starBy the end of the novel I felt completely depressed. Hannibal Lecter was the only character to come out on top. Although he was original and interesting I didn't want him to continue roaming free without any justice. Clarice Starling was stripped of all intelligence and power and became nothing but a brainwashed doll in an ending that was shocking and horrific. I could not understand how the author could bare to have Clarice sit down with Lecter and Krendler at the dinner table and take part in what followed. The reasons given; 'hypnosis' and 'drugs' were not explained satisfactorily.Other characters had also deteriorated. Jack Crawford had nothing left to live for and none of his dynamic, strong personality remained. Barney was unrecognisable from the 'nice' guy who was kind to Clarice and Hannibal in Silence of The Lambs, he had turned into a complete sleaze ball. The lovely Ardelia Mapp was left in despair.The characters that were added since the last book were corrupt and weird. Pazzi, the Italian police officer, seemed all right at first and then deteriorated into an unlikeable idiot before being despatched in a terrible way. Mason and Margot Verger were unbelievable. Mason was a paralysed paedophile missing most of his face / body, who got his jollies tormenting children and reminding his sister how she performed sex acts on him as a little girl. Margot was a lesbian weight lifter who had a burning desire for a child using Mason's sperm in order to receive her inheritance. (It's only when you write it down and read it over that you realise just how ridiculous it sounds).Yes, I know the ending has been mentioned in all the reviews before mine but I can't finish without mentioning it again. I found it frightening and horrible and not well explained.Overall, I'll give this novel 3 stars and try to forget it as quickly as I can. I always reread books I like but I don't think I ever want to see a copy of Hannibal again for as long I live, let alone read it.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think this 'book' can be considered the worst ever written. How does one explain this? Thomas Harris' previous novels are as good as the genre has to offer (particularly 'Silence of the Lambs'). But I am convinced that Harris was kidnapped while writing 'Hannibal'. Those who read the first two books cannot recognize the same author here. 'Hanibal' is vulgar and not just because of the content. Whereas 'Silence' had layers of suspense, there is none here. 'Silence' had some psychological and philosophical things to offer but 'Hannibal' doesn't pretend to do anything of the kind. The book is creepy instead of scary, nauseating instead of thrilling. No wonder most of the cast and crew of 'Silence' didn't want to be a part of 'Hannibal' as a movie. Just an awful, awful book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read *Hannibal* when it first came out--bought the hardcover ASAP, because Harris' other books had been so good and the characters of Lecter and Clarice were so fascinating. I'm writing this note about *Hannibal*, years after reading it, because I think it's noteworthy that *Hannibal* remains the worst book I've read in my whole life, and I've been an avid reader for 30 years. It's desperately gross and stupid, and an unforgiveable betrayal of both characters.Oh the irony! Ad nauseam, Harris noisily worships how subtle, artistic, and exquisitely sensitive Hannibal is, while his own storytelling demonstrates all the opposite traits.Hannibal Lecter had a bad childhood. Though he still murders without compunction, he's basically a prince (after all, the people he kills use poor grammar, so they deserve to die). He just needs a good woman to understand him. Right, that's believable. That's original. Of course, the good woman has to be turned into a sociopathic zombie to make this work, but hey, a hack's gotta do what a hack's gotta do. What HAPPENED to Thomas Harris? He used to be so good!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Throwing a book away, literally putting it in the trash along with the cat food cans and rotten tomatoes, is taboo. If a small but imperious voice in my head had not kept repeating &quot;you don't throw books away&quot;, that is where my copy of Hannibal would be. Buried in some gigantic rubbish heap, or at the most, shredded for pulp. It may still get there - selling it back to my favourite used book store would be contributing to the spread of garbage in the world. Most thrillers have some redeeming value in their versions of the modern-day fight between Good and Evil. Not this one. Rich faceless sadistic paralysed child-abusing animal-abusing ex-torturer pursues Hannibal the cannibal, aided and abetted by various sickos armed with experienced man-eating pigs. People end up gutted and brains get eaten. This is the kind of read that makes you feel dirty. I'm not proud of having finished it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris seems to say another &quot;Lecter book? No problem, I'll phone it in.&quot; If you're expecting a stellar end to a trilogy, then you'll be disappointed. Harris really takes what could have been great and just gets lost in the thought that no matter what he writes w/ Hannibal Lecter in it,that it will sell. Now I'm not slamming his ability because &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; are all great books and worth having in your collection. But this book left a lot to be desired and I'm surprised the publisher didn't at least say something about it. I would also like to add that I'm glad I borrowed this book because I would definitely have wanted my money back or an exchange. I only give this book one star because you have to enter at least one star."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal,&quot; the third installment in Thomas Harris's exploration of serial murder that began with &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is a great read. It never fails to entertain, never lacks richness in detail and intelligence, and always manages to provide more than one good scare. Not only does he convincingly continue the storyline that left off in &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs,&quot; he also brilliantly takes us into the mind of Hannibal Lecter. There is also a sense of elegant, gothic style here in the dialogue and settings. Harris keeps you gripped here. &quot;Hannibal&quot; goes down into the deep bowels of madness and perversion, Harris takes us through his dark world where evil and the perverted lurks in every corner. Frighteningly, you realize how real it all is. I don't understand how some people were turned off by the ending, I thought it was surprising and darkly amusing. I can't wait for the film adaptation being done by Ridley Scott, continuing the film series that began with &quot;Manhunter&quot; and continued with &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is intelligent, rich, darkly alluring, entertaining and yes, disturbing and scary. Great work by a great writer."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book got increasingly repulsive, both in terms of content and of style. Harris's skills have become a parody of themselves as he indulges in every kind of flowery speech. And there's not one likeable character here, especially poor Clarice Starling. The ending of the book is thoroughly disgusting and almost painful.Do not read this. Wait for the movie, as a lot of what happens, like the first time around, will be cut out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris did not write this book. If he did he had better hang it up. this was one of the worst I have ever read. the only reason I gave it one star is because you would not except a Zero."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" is a marked departure in style from the first two books in the Lecter trilogy. Unlike the previous two, this one focuses on Hannibal Lecter, and his relationship with Clarice Starling in particular. Once again, Harris attempts to provide some psychological depths to his characters. This time, unfortunately, he fails miserably.In trying to make Hannibal Lecter a sympathetic character, he shows a complete misunderstanding of the character traits which made him popular (at least to me). Hannibal Lecter was the ideal antihero. He was not sentimental, and you were NOT taken very far into his mind. This time around, Harris tries to gain our sympathy by taking us into his mind, giving him weaknesses, even attempting to explain his madness. Instead of the coldly rational Lecter we had before, who just happens to enjoy killing people, we now have a convoluted half-explanation for what made him what he is, and completely non-sensical ambitions, revolving around time somehow going backwards. Harris has succeeding only in diluting his character, and vastly diminishing his appeal. He is not a conventional hero, or an antihero, he is just a psychopath.What he has done to Clarice Starling is even worse. If by some chance you haven't read the indescribably stupid ending, I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that she, too, goes against all the previous characterization we have had, and there is no explanation for what made her change.In attempting to write lectures for a man whose intelligence is supposably 'immeasurable,' Harris also makes a grave mistake.All the other characters are given token reference. Crawford is irrelevant, and even the ones who are given space do nothing to advance the plot, nor are their own subplots compelling.In short, this book completely contradicts the characterization which has come before. None of the characters' actions make sense, and by the end of the book, I could find no one to root for. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading a few early luke warm reviews I was prepared for an anticlimactic sequel to Silence of the Lambs. With each page I became more and more engrossed with Harris's superbly crfated writing and his engaging tale of Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling. This is without question the best book that Thomas Harris has written. A great summer read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I almost didn't buy this book when I read some of the on-line reviews. I don't know what all the hoopla is about the &quot;goriness&quot;, &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;horror&quot; of this book. If anyone has read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; they are ready for &quot;Hannibal&quot;. As for being disappointed in the story, let me just say, I stayed up 'till 11:30 p.m. on a work night so I could read the last 120 pages. But, in all fairness, I can see why some are disheartened by the ending. Four words come to mind: &quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&quot;, when Sir Arthur killed off his much beloved character, there was a huge outcry (by the way, I am not revealing any secrets here), but remember, Hannibal and Clarice belong to Harris. The reason I only gave it four stars is because of the ending. Like a long anticipated meal at my favorite restaurant, Harris left me feeling just a little unsatisfied, as if I had savored the memory so long, that when the real thing was in front of me, it wasn't as good as I remembered. But Mr. Harris, thanks for once again delivering the goods, and now how about resurrecting Will Graham?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very excited to read this book, since I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs so much. The book starts out well, has some luls, but ultimately kept my attention in what would happen next. However, Harris must have given up at the end, writers block maybe? It was sick, twisted, and demented so much so it made me sick to my stomach. In Silence, the dementia was at least believable. In Hannibal, it went off the deep end and instantly turned all the books to garbage. I truly don't believe Foster and Hopkins will sink to the level Harris has given what was a fascinating story by making the movie. There's something to be said for &quot;quitting while you are ahead&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like so many of Thomas Harris' fans I eagerly awaited word of when his next book would be published. When I read that it would be a follow-up to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" I was excited. Finally it was published and I was able to read this long awaited tome, \\"Hannibal\\". What a disappointment! The writing is not on a par with Harris' previous books, there is no flow, as there was in \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Lambs\\". There are too many divergences into secondary characters, such as Pazzi and his family and so little regarding Lecter. Mason Verger's character and history is nicely done. The lives of Francis Dolarhyde and Jame Gumb, in his previous books, gave insight into why they were as they were and how society has a hand in creating its own monsters but Lecter's childhood trauma is treated as and afterthought. An \\"Oh, by the way, this is why he eats parts of his victims\\". The ending is the most disappointing thing I have ever read. I don't understand Harris' reasoning unless the word \\"screenplay\\" was in the back of his mind. It seems as if the book was written to fulfill a contract, with someone looking over his shoulder. I do hope Mr. Harris writes another book, sooner than ten years from now, and that it has nothing to do with Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. This book is a mistake."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm really tired of reading reviews defending this middle-finger of a novel. Sure, some scenes are well-crafted, Lecter's memory place is interesting, and the characters belong to Harris. But why does HANNIBAL seem to openly hate every reader/viewer who invested empathy in that most unlikely heroine, Clarice Starling? Reading this Grand Guinol cookbook, I felt that Harris sees us all as Annie Wilkes in MISERY. He went out of his way to ignore the realistic settings and motivations of his past novels out of, who knows, some private or perverse desire to not give us the &quot;obvious&quot; rematch of Clarice and Hannibal. Given how well-written and empathetic the first two novels were, of course we want some resolution! I could have taken something as improbable as Will Graham coming back (or perhaps more interesting, being in the Mason Verger vengeance role) than what we've been given. Thomas, couldn't you have given us a consistent trilogy and then run off to write your hallucinogenic art novel? I usually hate when filmmakers ignore a novelist's intentions, but I'm really hoping on this one occasion that, if this dreadful thing gets made, Demme and Co. gut all but the first chapter and start all over again...JODIE, ANTHONY, YOU'RE RICH ENOUGH!! DON'T DO IT!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Read this book in one sitting. Loved the ending and hope that this isn't the last we'll hear from Mr. Harris on Dr. Lector and Agent Starling... surely they will do more in their fictional lifetime. Well, Mr. Harris, share it with us please. Can't wait to see the movie.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting the sequel to Harris' Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, magic doesn't strike twice. Hannibal is a vile, disturbing sequel with gruesome plots of revenge at the heart of the plot. I also had trouble with the depiction of several characters, who were extremely over the top in their characterizations. Finally, without revealing the ending, it simply did not ring true in any way, shape or form. Clarice becomes unrecognizable, and thus unbelievable. Boo hiss to the author for letting us down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris should have quit with Silence Of The Lambs. Hannibal is very poorly done, the writing of substandard quality, the characters just not credible. Starling comes off as an incompetent nitwit, Lecter is not credible in any sense of the word, the plodding quality of the book is unbearable. The ending is just juvenile, in fact, the whole book seems like one that would cater to a juvenile audience. After reading 100 pages I skipped to the last chapter to end the agony, but it didn't."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, I'll jump in and be the first Thomas Harris fan to really enjoy his latest work. I do believe that the fact that there was such a lull between projects and the film version of &quot;silence of the Lambs&quot; contributed to the overall lukewarm critical response of Hannibal. His books have taken on almost mythic perportions in the eyes of readers and for those who's only exposure to Lector is the silver voiced Anthony Hopkins in the the movie, it's completely understandable that the new book has a certain &quot;gross out factor&quot;. Not to give any plots away, but does anyone remember the Garage scene in Red Dragon? Personally, I think that ranks right up there with some of the stuff in Hannibal. I for one aplaud Mr. Harris for not mellowing out his character for mass market movie adeptations; He even goes back to the old roots of Dr. lector when he referrs to him looking like a ferrett or an animal, even bringing back those freaky physical attributes that were lost in Lambs. As for Clarice, I was happy with the direction her character took insofar as it was *realistic* and all the more unerving. She didn't ride off into the sunset after the last book, but had to endure some heavy ordeals in this one. Finally, as for the ending of Hannibal, having read both the other books way too many times, I can honestly see the final chapter in a saga that started in the second chapter of Silence of the Lambs; the book I mean. Of course, this is all opinion. I for one was delighfully grossed out and happier for it. Thomas Harris definately hasn't lost that writing style that not only grabbs you out of your seat by your shirt collar, but shakes you around a bit as well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is a brilliant piece of writing that cannot simply be classified as a &quot;Thriller&quot;. This work is at once spellbinding, horrifying, beautiful, and infinitely cruel. The imagery evoked by Thomas Harris' masterful writing will remain in my memory palace for a very long time. Bravo Mr Harris, your ending was more than I could have hoped for."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is such an exquisite writer. Reading his work is like sampling fine wine at the ritziest place in town with the most elegant partner available: you know you're with someone who has a lot of class and style, but is restrained enough not to flaunt it.Anyone who can make this story seem elegant is a master. The plot is not so good, the descent of Lecter and Starling is frankly disturbing, and the fact that Lecter is not the most ghoulish character in the story is a cause for concern on the behalf of the author at times. Harris has outdone himself this time -- I don't consider myself extremely squeamish but I grimaced in disgust many times during this novel. While I enjoyed the prose for its lucid brilliance, the story left me queasy when finished. Read at your own risk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris can write, no doubt. The story meanders through the lives of an officially disgraced Starling and an escaped Lecter.Lecter's seemingly unended stream of funding and alternative identities keep him clear of the authorities. At the same time, FBI officials hatch a plan to disgrace Starling. And Lecter's only surviving victim coincidentally has a vast fortune at his disposal to attempt the capture of Hannibal.Lecter's feelings for Starling propel him to aid and assist her. All of the components inevitably end up in a vague, disappointing mish-mash of an ending.Tactically, Harris executes descriptions as well as anyone but Wolfe. Strategically, however, _Hannibal_ leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I noticed that a lot of people who didn't like this book disliked it because of the ending. I thought it was a complete surprise and hadn't seen coming. It was also very disturbing and I thought that the ending was the best part of the book. A lot of people have said that the ending betrayed the character of Clarice Starling. How so? She was under the influence of psychotic drugs for most of the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, where have we heard that before. Look at nearly every movie sequel and we have the same story. Not as good as the original.I agree with the other folks who gave this book a mid range review. While this is a fine read, there is something missing which was found in the original.The way in which Starling decides to aim the hunt for Lector is a good one, and well thought out by the author.As as with the original, there are not very many violent scenes depicted in the book. However, the ones which are, are told well and with some detail.But as for the ending, that really is quite bizarre. After reading 'SOTL's' and watching the movie, I really felt that one of the final scenes with Starling would not have happened. It did not seem in her behaviour to act in the way she did, (unless there were drugs involved ad I missed that part? ) But you end up hoping that what happens happens but also I think you can see it coming aswell.However, don't let me put you off, it is a fine read but not worthy of the same acclaim that was bestowed upon 'The Silence of the Lambs'."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"But I loved it! Have to wonder what kind of sick person is actually rooting for a monster such as Hannibal to fall in love and live happily ever after with the object of his obssession as he does in this book. However, due to the characterization of Mason Verger as an even bigger, sadistic, child molesting sicko it leaves the reader sympathetic to the plight of Hannibal. In this novel we are able to understand how Hannibal thinks and what events made him do the things he did. This journey into the depths of his mind allows the reader to sympathize with him or at the very least understand his actions. Clarice on the other hand, I'm not so sure about. I understand she was drugged but how could she go from solid citizen and law enforcer in one minute to brain eating cannibal in the next? All because she saw some lambs get slaughtered? Thank God she was never molested as a child - imagine the monster she would have become! Harris would have to have written 3 books about her."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I JUST FINISHED READING THE UNABRIDGED EDITION - SECOND TIME THROUGH....IT'S A WINNER....I'M GETTING TIRED OF SOME OF THE FICTION TODAY BY THESE AUTHORS WHO WRITE A SERIES OF BOOKS AS DICTATED BY THE PUBLISHER - IT MAY MAKE MONEY, BUT I'D LIKE TO READ SOME NEW GOOD WRITING. I JUST FINISHED A COULTER NOVEL AND FRANKLY-THE REPETITIOUS SAME STORY OVER &amp; OVER AGAIN IS BEGINNING TO GET BORING. WE NEED NEW WRITERS OF NEW ORIGINAL NOVELS...NOT SERIES........I'VE READ AT LEAST ONE THAT WASN'T - A TOURIST IN THE YUCATAN.

The rich descriptions of the characters' thoughts and the beautiful tapestry of locales was incredible! Violent and disturbing, yet beautiful and romantic, this book is my all-time favorite!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For those looking for a more straight forward story of good guys in pursuit of bad guys in the classic &quot;Dracula&quot; mold a la &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; look elsewhere. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a darker, more complex, morally ambigous work of terror employing a particularly nasty anti-hero. In that way it resembles one of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles, in that the traditional villian is now the hero, the one we are routing for(with great reservations, of course, but there is a more evil character in the book than Dr. Lector, thank heavens.)Whereas in the previous novel, Clarice Starling has to &quot;flirt&quot; with evil to save someone's life, here we get to see the repercussions of her dangerous communion with Dr. Lector.Much has been made of the &quot;shocking&quot; ending, but reading carefully it's well supported, if a little farfetched. I like to think of it as a fairy tale ending, as it seems Harris has some sort of warped love story in the back of his mind: And they lived happily ever after..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't put it down! I love the Lecter character and couldn't get enough of him. This is all about him, and it goes deep enough into his psyche to be rewarding. I loved the end although i hear many women do, and men tend to find it unbelievable! I loved it! A one day read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I went into this book expecting it to be horrible after reading all the bad reviews here. I was completely surprised that I was entirely entertained with this page-turner.I haven't read any other Harris, but have seen the Lambs movie (of course!). This book stays pretty true to the characters - especially Hannibal. I actually enjoyed that the book is sort of a showdown between Lecter and Verger with less emphasis on Starling.I enjoyed: Interesting writing style, great characterization, brought us back to all the previous locations and characters of the past - plus new places like Italy and Verger's abode, great twist at the end (entirely believable to me compared to what others are saying here), a great book overall.I disliked: To much detail when it came to describing Italy and art, unbelievable characters in a part where Lecter is in a plane and a child asks to eat his &quot;liverwurst&quot;!, the beginning adventure really doesn't tie into anything except for creating a conflict between the FBI and Starling - there could have been a better way.Final thought, I thought it was great, and read the last 100 pages straight through till the final &quot;dinner&quot; with Starlings boss! Will make an AWESOME movie if done right."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has done it again. He has taken readers deep into the mind of Dr. HannibL &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter, deeper than some people want to go. Right from the start when Clarice Starling fouled a drug raid, to the the end where Lecter cuts Krendler's skull cap off and cooks parts of his brian and Starling and Lecter eats them and makes jokes at Krendler's expense, is just a all-out shockfest. This is the first Thomas Harris book I have read and I am determined to pick up the other books (Red Dragon/Man Hunter to those that only know the movie version and The Silence Of The Lambs). I first got the book only to make my mother mad since she claimed that she didn't want me to read or see the movie. But after reading the book, I went out to the local movie store and rented Hannibal and loved it. This book I would recommend to anyone who loves horror, a little drama, and a all-out good read. Keep up the good work Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't read this book at night or you may want to leave a light on! Thomas Harris has written a third book about Dr. Hannibal Lecter and this one is the most intriguing. I found it hard to believe that there was someone creepier than Hannibal Lecter but Mason Verger is worse. Clarice Starling has more depth in this book and the plot twists around her and several new characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Title says it all...I'm not sure if I liked it. It started off great, then the parts in Italy got sort of boring and pointless. There were parts where Lecter just was not as chilling...I think his captivity in the prison made him a better character...I'll admit that I was turning pages wanting to know what happened the entire time. Then the ending...It just doesn't work...No...I liked the book...But the ending just ruined it...and the ending is arguably the most important part of a book...After the &quot;climax&quot;, Starling is not the same character she was in Silence and in the first 500 pages of Hannibal..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I was eager to read its sequel, and find out what happens to Clarisse and Hannibal. The book started off really well, and was just as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; But then, it moved into this really weird middle section that was kind of boring. It picked up again later, but the ending was improbable to say the least. It just didn't fit the realistic tone that &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; had. Also, the quality of the book was not as good. There were inconsistencies (such as Jack Crawford's age, and the name of one of Buffalo Bill's victims from the previous book). Another quality of the book I found irritating was the way the narrator periodically speaks to the reader, not as an objective, omniscent, well, narrator, but as a friend sharing juicy gossip. It was rather off-putting, and totally inconsistent with &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Over all, while the book did have some action, it wasn't a great book and was nowhere near the quality of &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the beginning this book was confusing, but after a couple of chapters it finally all falls into place. I think Clarice was cool. I liked that she was always so curius and determined. The way she thought about Dr. Hannibal Lecter was so different from everyone else. Dr. Lecter was crazy we all know that, but he has a certain love for Clarice; it's wierd. The detail was good though filled with really graphic mental pictures. I recommend this book to people who have a lot of time on their hands, because it's a book worth reading but it's long! I think Dr. Lecter was a smart man; he could disappear and reappear and nobody could catch him or ever have a clue. Maybe that's why Clarice is so amazed by him and so determined to find him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A friend had recommended that I should read this book, and I did. I must say, I absolutely love it. I've read 'Silence of the Lambs' and own the movie. The book brings out the beauty of Harris's writing. Page after page, was filled with vivid backgrounds of simple places with a haunting twist to turn this into a work of art. To be honest, I couldn't let go of the book. This isn't a book to let go; something to remember.. especially the last words of the book.This book gives me a whole different view of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and his evil ways, along with a whole different and new view of Clarice Starling.The book starts out as a bang and carefully lures you into the mind and world of Thomas Harris. (Please enjoy your stay.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm fortunate in that I haven't read the other two books in this series, so I'll be judging this book on it's merits alone. As far as I can tell the author precedes storytelling for constant fashion and artistic name-dropping. I can't imagine that happened in the other books. Also, I found it a little odd that in the end Hannibal turns in to some sort of demi-god. I suppose it's possible that a man of his intellect could fluently speak several languages, master the piano, have an impeccable sense of fashion, work as a successful surgeon and psychiatrist, have a thorough understanding of medieval italian literature, AND be a gourmet cook...wait, no, you really COULDN'T do all that. That aside, the fact that the main character--Starling--seems to go through this weird and abrupt change in book's conclusion made this book a little difficult for me to truly enjoy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I saw the movie and I read the book. I preferred the movie's ending because it kept the integrity of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling intact. I appreciated that. Something was lost in 'Hannibal'. Nothing seemed to hold together. It was too surreal; too vague."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I was reading this, I couldn't help but think that this book was hurried just to give the movie-going public a movie to see and the movie industry a box office winner.There were too many almost cheesy references to The Silence of the Lambs. Did nothing happen of any interest in the lives of the main characters in the seven years between Silence and Hannibal that the author could have described? Did the world forget about Hannibal Lecter in those seven years? Seems pretty hard to believe.The pigs were completely unnecessary to the story. The kidnappers, who were supposed to be the best in the world, were no better than the Three Stooges. It was also difficult to have any sympathy for many of the supporting characters given the fact they were, if not equally evil, then just plain bad people.I gave this book two stars because the book was a page turner.It just seemed as though the author was forced to produce. Unfortunately, he did only for the publishing and movie industry not for the reading public."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow. I saw the movie and then read the book... Maybe I did them in the wrong order but hey, what can you do? The movie was great, and the book was 100 times better. What a twist ending! Read it, read it, don't put it down!Have the lambs stopped screaming?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Admitedly, I could not put Hannibal down. This being said, I also must admit to throwing the book out when finished, I was so disgusted.Having read &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, Hannibal Lecter remained one of the most intriguing villians in modern fiction. Harris presented him in a way suiting the misunderstood Dr.Lecter, seemingly a sociopath, but really a human being with a very defined and rigid sense of right and wrong.The connection forged with Clarice Starling in &quot;Silence&quot; was a duel between equals, matching Hannibal's awesome intellect with Clarice's amazing compassion and analytical skill, even though she was beset by her own demons.This interaction was dissapointingly absent in Hannibal. The Clarice portrayed in &quot;Silence&quot; would never resort to what Starling resorts to in the abominable conclusion to this book.The storyline of Mason Verger was deeply disturbing, leaving the reader with no insight into the repulsive evil of this pedophile, but a welcome distraction from the ending of this book, nonetheless.I should have listened to my friends and passed...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So it seems all Dr. Lechter really needed all this time was alittle fun. I must say I was amazed at the ending. However, it has done more to make me think about this book and the psychology behind the characters than a traditional; ending would have. Unbelievable? Yes. Entertaining? Yes"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seemed that Thomas Harris was forced to write this book. There is none of the brilliance of his previous books. I can't believe Anthony Hopkins has aggreed to play Dr. Lector again. ...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At long last, Hannibal comes home again! Whether or not you agree with the concept of serial killer as human being, the text is rich in description that is enjoyed like a fine meal, sans fava beans. Thomas Harris does not disappoint with the long wait. The intricacy and detail he imports should be savored; a true delicacy for where the mind can take you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is just what it should be -- a very entertaining thriller. Yet there is such depth of character in these books, this is not your average paperback. The sick and twisted eating habits of Dr.Lecter just make the interaction between him and Agent Starling a little more interesting and complex. Dr. Lecter has some issues, but don't we all? He is a great &quot;antihero&quot; and I wish there was another book to read about him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am an avid crime/mystery reader and thought that since I enjoyed the movie Silence of the Lambs that I would enjoy this new book. This book could barely hold my attention! It read like a movie script - I am sure that the author thought he could save some time in doing both a novel and a screen play at the same time! What a disappointment - I now have no desire to see the movie as the book failed to &quot;capture&quot; me. Such a dissappointment!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After more than a decade's wait, and after surviving the inevitable hype surrounding it, HANNIBAL, the sequel to the excellent SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, proves to be somewhat of a let down. Although it's undeniably well written and a page turner as well, HANNIBAL is flat, and unsatisfying. After SILENCE, the motivations behind the actions of Special Agent Starling and Dr. Lecter don't seem to be true to the previous book and left me scratching my head. While I'm not saying don't read this book, don't go into it believing all the hype either."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Up to the scene where Dr. Lecter is about to become pig food, Hannibal is a very good read. After that, the book just completely degrades. The ending was so unbelievable that I was actually infuriated that I had invested time in reading the novel up to that point. The change in Starling is so over the top and utterly disappointing that it is almost unbearable. Most notably, we are given a valid explanation as to why she feels compelled to save Dr. Lecter- that she cannot tolerate the idea of ANY creature being tortured to death. However, we are expected to believe a complete turnaround in her character when she is at the dinner with Lecter and their &quot;guest&quot; Kendler, where she sits quiet and composed and actually exchanges witty barbs with the Dr. while their &quot;guest&quot; is slowly tortured. Yes, I realize that there are drugs/hypnosis involved, but in essence, Starling's character has been lobotomized like the unfortunate Kendler. And it just totally ruined the novel for me- the waste of such a great character.I hope they get the movie right...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had enjoyed Hannibal Lecter in Red Dragon and especially in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I found the new book enjoyable, up to a point, but the conclusion was a complete let down for me (I won't go into details so as not to spoil the suspense for you). The new villains are scary enough, but the new Hannibal Lecter, though ore fully developed seems to be too different from the Hannibal we met in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the past 2 books which I have read from Thomas Harris, he has always been able to capture my attention with his immaculate descriptions of characters and a most original and gripping storyline. However, after waiting almost a decade for Hannibal, the disappointment was made worse by the fact that Silence of the Lambs was so incredibly good. The plot was original, as opposed to Hannibal which built on overused psychopathic plots which 'twists' I could guess before I was even near to the actual protrayal in the book. Sadly, the character built up was weak, two-dimensional and was disappointingly unoriginal. The fact that Dr Lector was given a reason for his psychotic behavior did not take away the effect the book would have given to the readers only if the author had woven the facts less obviously into the tale. The flat protrayal of Lector's childhood was disappointing. However, the most appalling of all in the book was the finally &quot;unexpected&quot; ending. How could anyone think of the lame, unbelieveable epilogue provided. It was clearly out of touch with the rest of the book, and in contrary to the characters of both Lector and Starling as described in the Silence. It was such a great disappointment that I would not advise anyone else to read it, and if u have not tried Silence, but have already watched the movie, I would still recommend the book to be read as it was indeed Harris' best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After nearly a decade's wait, the sequel to Silence of the Lambs which many of us so eagerly anticipated has finally arrived - and what a resounding disappointment it is. The intriguing character of Dr. Lecter has been diminished and robbed of the mystery which made him so frightening by the very psychological quantifying he warned Clarice against in their first encounter. Both Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling have been rendered nearly unrecognizable in order to fit the contrivances of the plot (and what contrivances they are!). And as for the &quot;romance&quot; which blooms between them, ludicrous hardly begins to encompass it. It's hard to understand how a writer who demonstrated such piercing insight into abnormal minds could have failed to see that the thing which characterizes psychopaths is their inability to sustain anything approaching a normal relationship. So how do we get to Dr. Lecter dancing on balconies with Clarice, teaching her Italian, taking her to the opera etc. Not to mention the happy couple's rewarding sex life.Certainly the character of Clarice Starling as we have been given it, so level headed, so filled with integrity, so sane, would have run a mile in tight shoes before consenting to go frisking off into the sunset with everybody's favorite monster. The last part of the novel reads like a grotesque parody of a bodice-ripper, replete with sappy, wish-fulfillment details: the carefully chosen evening gown, the emerald jewelry, etc. I suppose we can anticipate Son of Hannibal in another ten years. Thomas Harris, what happened to you?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I finished HANNIBAL last night, and can recommend it ONLY to those who've followed the series from the beginning. Harris has a strikingly different agenda this time around: to take us inside Hannibal's mind, and the results are mixed. I was a little disappointed to have his creator pin a backstory on Hannibal that rationalizes this monster's sociopathy. (Hannibal himself would disapprove, and does so in SILENCE when someone tries to do it.)However, more often than not, the journeys into the mind of the madman and his &quot;memory palace&quot; are exhilarating... as are many of Harris' more baroque excursions. The book isn't plotted so much as ornamented, and that ornamentation is wonderful. Harris' earlier terse and morbidly funny prose is a little grander, a little more ambitious this time around, and it gives the book an apocalyptic feel: as if Harris is raising the bar on the thriller. If you go into the novel expecting this -- and understanding that there's no serial killer mystery to be unravelled, and very little forensic work performed -- you should enjoy it.But be forewarned that you'll need a stronger stomach than in RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. HANNIBAL surpasses them in on-stage violence... and dishes up a handful of concluding chapters that are among the most disturbing you'll ever read. Some fans will be angered by HANNIBAL's sublimely surreal ending... but I liked it. It's a fitting conclusion to the novel's strange ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I like a gory book for the sake of scariness; however, this book was just silly and gross. I was so disappointed. My advice - skip this, and read Red Dragon if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I very much enjoyed \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and so was very excited when I saw that \\"Hannibal\\" was being published.I read the book with mounting distaste, and once I finsished it, I felt almost ashamed that I hadn't had the integrity to put it down half read. I wondered if perhaps I should force myself to read an entire series of Christian Romance novels as penance.The violence was over the top, but I can handle that. What was more distressing was the fact that I got the impression that I was to be cheering on a sociopathic monster, simply because he's genius-level-intellegent, a good cook, doesn't molest children, and knows a lot about perfume, makeup and cutting a woman's hair. Lecter goes from being Evil Sociopath to Cannibal with a Heart, and the character of Clarice Starling is twisted beyond all recognition or sense. No wonder Jodi Foster refused to do the film, and no wonder the ending of the book was changed in the movie version.I'm wavering between giving this book five stars, because it is well written, and affected me so strongly on a number of levels, and one star, because it's so violent, cruel, and contains images I didn't need in my head. I'll compromise with two stars.This is a well written book, but very disturbing. In my opinion it ruins the characters Harrison spent time creating in his previous novels."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wanted to like this book. In fact, after I was done, I tried to convince myself I liked this book. And even after that, I tried to convince myself I must have missed something. Well, consider this review penance for even thinking those thoughts. The problem was that because I really enjoyed both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I thought I had to love the latest Hannibal Lecture opus.One of the criticisms of this book is that it is violent. Duh! This is a book about a serial killer. Not only a serial killer, but also \`the' serial killer of popular culture (don't read that as if he's going out and killing popular books and movies). I think if you are really worried about that then you know already this book isn't for you.The real problem with the book is that the story stinks! It is awful! The first part fools you into believing that time has passed and things have changed. While a bit depressing, this part of the book does have strength. Then, the introduction of the antagonist, Verger, really starts the ball spiraling in unhealthy direction. This disabled and sickly character just is disgusting and lacks enough depth or flatness to make him effective. But the true tragedy doesn't come to the end, when Lecter and Agent Starling end up in a bizarre, bizarre tandem. I'm trying not to give it away because it is different from the movie, but it is wrong.In the end, I think Harris wrote this book so people would stop asking when the next Hannibal Lecter book was coming out. I give him that rather than believing that a man who has written such good books before would actually sell out this big and obviously. This book is not worth the money. If you must read it, email me, or find a friend like me who has a copy. I'm pretty sure they'll want to get rid of it too. Don't buy this book; otherwise you'll spoil how good the first two were."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think Stephen King said it best when he described &quot;Hannibal&quot; not as a sequel to &quot;Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs,&quot; but as another part to a trilogy about abnormal psychology. So, I suggest that you read this great novel without thoughts of a contiuation to &quot;Lambs.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is stylish, hypnotic, classy, detailed and has touches of classic horror. Thomas Harris is a wonderful writer, with an exquisite eye to detail in his descriptions and thoughts, this adds a realism to the material that makes it scarier still. The characters are described with a clarity that never flounders and the dialogue is rich and convincing. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is also thrilling and fascinating. Harris never slows it down but keeps it flowing. It is also a gothic romance with images that stay in the imagination for a long time after you read the final chapter. I don't understand why some people flipped out over the ending, I thought it was devilishly entertaining and perversely romantic in the classic horror sense. What is a horror novel if it doesn't go to the limit? Books like William Peter Blatty's &quot;The Exorcist&quot; showed that what is scary is what seems more real, yet more extreme. I wish Harris would write more often instead of taking almost a decade to release a new novel. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is for those who like something with taste, intellectual horror if you will. Harris captures a true sense of evil and the dark corners of the world we live in. An exquisite read, the best suspense/horror novel in years. Exquisite."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' &quot;Hannibal&quot;- the third novel in his &quot;Hannibal Lector&quot; saga is, in my opinion, not a worthy follow up to &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. After finishing up the novel, it seems as though Harris wrote it to satisfy the public's hunger for more Lector, no for any other reason. Whereas &quot;Red Dragon&quot; focused on the split personality of Francis Dolarhyde, and &quot;Silence&quot; on the sexual dilemma plaguing Jame Gumb, &quot;Hannibal&quot; has no main focus. There really is no &quot;bad guy&quot; and no &quot;good guy&quot;, mainly because (in my opinion again) the majority of Harris' readers enjoy Lector and view him as a hero, not the cold blooded monster that he is, and it looks like that view has influeced Harris' writing here. Clarice Starling is reduced to a rogue FBI agent, and the newcomer, Mason Verger, is hunting Lector more than the authorities are. Lector is basically the one the reader roots for; there is no Will Graham or Clarice Starling like we've seen before. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, we see Agent Starling (the first time Harris uses a main character twice, besides Jack Crawford, Frederic Chilton, Barney the Orderly, and, of course, Lector) return to pursue Hannibal Lector after being blackballed by the FBI following a drug bust gone horribly wrong. Another focus is on the Doctor himself, who is living comfortably as a curator and chief intellect of Italian Renaissance literature. The third and final focus is on Verger, a deranged millionaire who was a former patient of Lector's, and is confined to the life of a thinking vegetable, unable to physically move, but sound mentally (all courtesy of the good Doctor). Only in the final half of the book do we see all three focuses meet, albiet poorly. I don't want to give the ending away, but it is about as outlandish as one could possibly imagine, especially when considering the endings of the previous two novels, which left the reader spellbound. &quot;Hannibal&quot; just left me feeling empty. As I mentioned before, it seems as though Harris wrote it to give the masses more Lector to read. I've heard that the movie has an entirely different ending, and while I'll look forward to it, I just can't see how Hollywood will salvage the mess told on the final pages of the novel. If you enjoy Hannibal Lector, I recommend reading &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot;, and for a sense of hollow completion, &quot;Hannibal&quot; will have to do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book starts off strong, like a fine bottle of Dr Lecter's best Chianti. As I closed the first chapter, I felt for sure I was in for a breath-taking ride. But as the pages peeled by, and I descended further into the mind of Hannibal and Starling - and their morally bankrupt support characters - the book became a progressively bigger disappointment. The last 50 pages left me annoyed that such great characters as Hannibal and Starling could be dealt with so ludicrously by their creator. My advice? Read the first chapter over and over again, and feed the rest to the pigs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the reviews from the Amazon fans, it seems clear that this book is not unanimous in the way it's rated. But, it certainly draws either extremely positive or extremely negative vibes, whatever way you look at it. I found the book incredibly entertaining, rivetting and difficult to close. Some readers may not have liked this follow up because of the switch in angles Thomas Harris takes...Hannibal and Clarice Starling are no longer the characters we once knew. They've evolved, changed, muted into new personas...after all, if the reader expected to see exactly the same story as Silence of the Lambs, would he want to go out and spend the money on reading something he's already seen before? Thomas Harris has understood the need to develop these cult characters. We take a ride into Hannibal's fantasties, the more positive aspects of his personality, and believe it or not, we feel a little closer to the psychopath once the book has drawn to an end! Clarice is no longer the hero of the story; she's almost relinquished to the supporting role of the book. She spends most of her time soul searching, and ends up finding her way with her enemy, Dr Lecter. Of all of the endings I could expect or dream up, the one Harris concludes on, literally blew my mind away. This is the most unexpected turn of the story anyone could possibly imagine! I don't know whether the movie will manage to recreate so dramatically the colorful scenarios, the intricate web of stories Harris writes in this book, but all movie goers need to read this book first before watching it on the big screen..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't waste your time. If you are looking for suspence, character integrity, and entertainment, you shouldn't look to Hannibal. The narratives are long winded, the characters are flat, and the plot unbelievable. I loved Harris' previous books, Hannibal left me feeling cheated, and well, just plain dirty."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Readers put away your pre-conceived notions on what you want the book to be, and come along for a fantastic ride! In my opinion, Harris has opened up whole new horizons for the further adventures of this dynamic duo. And a &quot;Danse of The Macabre&quot;, I'm sure it would be, not since the exploits of the doomed couple in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, has there been a team that could wreck havoc with society as a whole. Let Harris conduct this dark ride with Clarise and Lecter, enjoy the ride the story for what it is, entertainment. You have plucked down your hard earned bucks for the book (or picked it up at the library or perhaps borrowed it from a friend) never the less, you know your tastes. So just follow the weaving of a good wordsmith, the story Harris is sharing is only surpassed by the real stories in your local newspapers. I would like to read the rough draft of this tale, how many recipes were ruined before Lecter got it right? It is difficult to comprehend how Clarise is won over by the crafty Lecter, but that is what makes the story so compelling, just when you know where it is going, you get a little dip that ends up in a &quot;loop de doo&quot; and all you can do is hang on and go for it. This is the first time I've attempted to review a book, so I am reluctant to give away any of the plot or gore, so before you utter &quot;hogwash&quot;, remember &quot;Hannibal&quot; is just a character in a story but, don't try any of the escapes of the good Doctor in the privacy of your own home, after all he is a professional.

Silence of the Lambs was outstanding - and so was this one up to a point. That is always the problem with a sequel. It must live up to what it followed. Hannibal was a good read and wonderful book in of itself, as Mr HARRIS is more than capable of rendering to us. However, I was very disappointed by STARLING's character. She started out so strong in this, even more so by comparison over Silence of the Lambs. I was able to see how she evolved and matured. This caused me to not only be shocked by the ending, but also very disappointed. Furthermore, I found the end a bit unbelieveable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal takes off where SOTL leaves off. Clarice Starling is now looking for yet anther serial murderer and finds help from Dr. Hannibal Lecter. You must read it! I command you!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"like may readers, I had reservations about this book due to the bad reviews, how anyone can trash this book and call it rubish is beyond me. I found it to be a very suspensful and harrowing read which deeply disturbed me. This is what i bought the book for. All the readers who were disgusted and could not read it, what did you expect?? I am appalled to find that MR Harris has felt the need to appologise to his readers because of their comments. What right do do readers have to tell TH how the characters that HE! created would react in the circumstaces. I would like to thank TH for a brilliant book and only hope that he has not been disheartened by the critism to write a follow up book. (but I do wish he would write them quicker)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is undeniably one of the greatest writers of our time. Here he presents another stunning venture into the mind of evil that equals &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is original, gothic, artistic, elegant, and yes, frightening. But it's also really thrilling. I believe this is an excellent sequel to &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; because it expands the world of these characters. I also will never get tired of reading about Hannibal Lecter and his small, pointy teeth and long, snake-like tongue. Harris understands the nature of evil like William Peter Blatty with &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; seems all too realistic which gives a better effect. This is also a well-researched novel with lots of interesting situations, characters, and places. The gore and violence here are well-handled. No one will ever write serial killer novels like Harris! This is, the best novel of the year. WAIT, WHAT&quot;S THAT COMING THROUGH MY WINDOW? IT&quot;S HANNIBAL LECTER! AH! HELP!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris must have been committed to write this book, because he certainly didn't appear to want to do it. I haven't been so sincerely disappointed in a book in a very long time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The focus on Clarice Starling character was not portrayed enough. I didnt find her as the hero in this novel. The novel was written as if she was confused and ignorant to what was going on with Lector. I found some chapters to be irrelavant to the story line as well as some scenes being unrealistic. For example, the amount of time Lector had to have her father's casket lifted and clothes removed and return to the area. Also, the barn scene where clarice jumps in and saves the day without backup. One of the most interesting scenes is the way he touched base with her past and Childhood problems. Overall, it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was horrible...Horrible. The plot was exagerated and disgutsing, the characters were unbelievable. It was HUGE a letdown after reading Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although &quot;Hannibal&quot; draws you in with a sophisticated tone and a revisiting of characters held very dear to fans, it is, by far, one of the most nihilistic stories I have ever read. This novel has the moral center of a frog. Harris' message in &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; seemed to me to be this: That a healthy respect and understanding of evil is not only better than exploiting it, than containing it, but it is even better than fearing it. And that, in the end, despite our fear, it is worth getting near evil in order to stop it because, even if you don't stop it, by grappling with it, you may gain the self-realization necessary to stop it next time. But sadly, Harris has truly lost his way with &quot;Hannibal,&quot; and has, in my mind, completely turned his first message on its head. In &quot;Hannibal,&quot; Mr. Harris seems to be saying that killing people is not only not more evil than selling out someone's career, or selling out a murderer, it is also not even more evil than proportional revenge (which, anyone in law will tell you, is justice). I could have handled the almost cartoonish caricatures of good, agent Clarice Starling, and evil, murderer Hannibal Lecter, if a more appropriate ending had been forthcoming. I found this story entirely disgusting. And, in case anyone thinks I'm a bitter old nun or something, I'm a man the Starling character's age."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs was my all time favorite book. I thought Hannibal was a big yawn. I was so sorry to have wasted the money on a hardcover book. Chapters 86-94 were somewhat reminiscent of the suspense of Silence. In my opinion, the rest of the book was very boring, and the ending was simply silly. It felt like most of the book was a way for Harris to show off his knowledge of expensive things and arcane trivia. BORING!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After finishing the book, I thought about throwing it against the wall I was so mad. The ending seems thrown together at the last minute, which, considering the fact Harris took 10 years between books, is ridiculous. The action was not as violent as I had expected it to be, but is still pretty graphic. The details of Italian history were both entertaining and educational. Overall, not a horrible read but likely a disappointment to Harris fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Without a doubt, the action scenes in Florence were the best parts of the book. The BIGGEST FLAW in the plot was that the author never gave a reason why Clarice and the FBI KNEW that Hannibal Lecter was coming to the U.S. after he had to leave Florence! After all, he could have gone to Brazil, Asia, Europe other, etc. There was never a reason given for him to come to the U.S."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this book to the very end looking for a good plot, a hero I could relate to, or a victim I could pull for. How dissapointing! Did Mr. Harris think it was the gore and evil characters that made Silence of the Lambs a great story? I was totally insulted by the ending. I've never thrown away a book but I can't even give this one a place on my book shelves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found the novel gripping until the last 150 pages. I have never been so let down or disappointed by an ending before-it was really strange and did not fit with the theme of the book. I didn't even realize the book had finished until I read the next page &quot;acknowlegments&quot;. Wow, what a let down Thomas Harris-you're not worth all the hype!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's a shame that a man as obviously talented as Thomas Harris would waste his time writing a piece of filth like this. This is a corner of the soul that no one needs to view. His characters and dialogue are well drawn, but his subject matter is depraved, to say the least. There is nothing redeeming about this book. And there is certainly nothing entertaining. Don't waste your money. I threw my copy in the trash after about 60 pages. I doubt that any intelligent person would want to pollute their mind with this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First I suppose, this is a review...So, it is a book. (important plot theme here..) Whatever Harris was thinking of when he wrote this, it was apparently not to please those who thought it should go the way of SoTL. Rather curious about the reactions to &quot;poor&quot; Starling..Am I the only one who noticed the abrupt kiss-off Harris did to the most interesting of his characters..Will Graham? Harris finds law enforcement types very disposable..and uses them as he sees fit. And, this being a book about a &quot;super&quot; villian..so charming, so well bred..&quot;Quite sorry about this little habit I have of killing folks...Why I am actually quite the well bred Southern Gentleman&quot;Hello? He's a KILLER...period. Anyone who sypathizes with someone as loathsome a creature, obviously in control of his faculties, yet still MURDERS people..whomever crosses his rather large bad side..We should empathize with this creature? I shouldn't be amazed really, as a Law enforcement officer for 22 years, who has actually sat across from a few serial killers.. They all..for the most part have a story to tell, and can act quite normal, yes even &quot;charming&quot; Check Ann Rule and her first impressions of Ted Bundy..They don't ALL have dogs telling them what to do. And hey..every body with a horrid childhood doesn't kill and eat people either (big surprise) It is to Harris's credit that he can evoke such emotions..yet since we read fiction to escape, why, we are ready to embrace whatever concept that is presented..at least by nature.The book was interesting at times, Harris has a way with his word craft, much like Stephen King,Yet I find it appalling how many readers wanted &quot;hannible&quot; to act and speak like the actor..Anthony Hopkins. Why any one who is knighted, well even if he is a serial killer..can't be all bad, as long as we are on his Christmas List. Same for Foster/Starling. Poor Jody..ooops Starling, to have went nuts and discovered her sexual and cannibal hunger at the same times. (I imagined that annoying accent myself through this book, try though I did to ignore it)No doubt about it, a movie does place those characters in our minds..good in the case of William Peterson/Will Graham (excellent movie for most part, just my opinion) SoTL..well big names do detract from the story..and they apparently did very well at that here.The ending of this book..yes, it was terrible. But it kept in line with the love story and redemption of &quot;Sir Hannible&quot; And let me tell you..Did some of you ever buy it...Oh brother, yes fiction, yes escapism..but when you began to &quot;root&quot; for such a human monster..as portrayed in Harris's books...I have to wonder. He is a Killer..(remember?) of women..police officers (not a big sympathy issue there) ambulance drivers..disfgures nurses..all care givers, in the old Doctors way..Your sympathy gives me nightmares..It's a book, it had it's moments..but please... I didn't go into a depression after Aliens #3, also a crummy sequel..Red Dragon was a good read..as was SoTL..Both had boring parts, and you should have been ready for the &quot;sad story, it's not my fault ..like me?&quot; if you read, and I mean really read both. Those along with the toss off of the &quot;heros&quot; are pretty much Harris form.Try Michael Slade's Headhunter..actually the series is pretty good, along with anything featuring John Becker by David Wiltshe or John Sandford.The Eagles sang it best..&quot;Get over it&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Most everyone who liked this book summed up my feelings, except for the ending. I loved the ending and don't want to see anyone BUT Hopkins and Foster reprise their rolls. Hopkins is the PERFECT Hannibal Lecter...his blending of grace and madness...just perfect!! And Foster's Starling would be interesting to see...the strong but fragile woman turning to this \\"monster\\" for companionship! I just love it! But alas, I don't think the movie-going public is ready to actually \\"see\\" this ending. We're too immature to appreciate it's beauty. But I can dream...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed Hannibal, until the ending, which I found preposterous. The ending is nonsense, and ruined a great book.

While it kept my attention, I found it lacked in something. &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was rivotting, while this book grabs you from a more morbid perspective. I really found myself not liking anyone in this book, even Clarice. The ending, which I will not give away, was disturbing. I found myself angry at it and at the direction Thomas Hariis chose to take the characters. On the whole, I'm almost sorry I read it. But not quite. Like I said, it did appeal to hte morbid imagination."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris had me hearing things outside of my room late atnight while I was reading this book.

But I was dissapointed with several aspects of it, one of them was that Jack Crawford all but dissapears from the book. I think Mr. Harris could have found a different way to deal him.

This book ends in the absolute worst way imaginable. Without giving too much away to future readers, just imagine the material Harris has to work with. He has created an all-time anti-hero with terrific supporting characters. Only this time, Hannibal relies on a deus ex machina to get him out of a jam. I will leave out the specifics, but this &quot;miracle&quot; just isn't fair to the reader.In Silence, he escaped in such a clever way. Not this time. There is a huge political angle to the story that Harris completely ignores at the end. What a waste.Both the Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs were thriller/mysteries. Here was merely violence for the shock value. No thrill, no mystery, no tension. I am so disappointed in this book, that I will probably not see the movie if it follows this closely.

But only one will live long enough to savor the reward..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok, first of all, I loved Silence of the Lambs and thought that Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling were two of the most well developed and intriguing characters ever written. Hats of to Thomas Harris for that. When I found out that there was a third book in the Lecter series, I knew that I had to read it. Up until the last few chapters it is amazing! Hannibal Lecter has more depth to his character than ever. The scenes in Italy are so real and well developed. The character of Clarice has developed as well.Now for the complaining: The ending is horrible!! For those who don't want it given away, I will just say this, the ending goes completely against Hannibal and Clarice's characters. I felt so disgusted and cheated with the ending that I literally slammed the book down at that point. Clarice completely loses her integrity and morals. And Lecter, well, he morphs into something that just isn't Hannibal anymore. After reading the ending I wished I hadn't.... It was such a disappointment. Read the beginning of the book but once you get to chapter 98 or so close the book and save yourself from the torture."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I liked this as well as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; though for different reasons. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is broader in its locations &amp; has a wider range of well-developed characters, including some we've met before (it really is a good idea to read &quot;Silence ...&quot; first &amp; preferably &quot;Red Dragon&quot; before that). &quot;Hannibal&quot; grows from &quot;Silence ...&quot; Not just a repeat of that formula, it develops characters &amp; themes. Beyond the obvious characters, I especially liked the portrayals of Mason Verger &amp; his sister &amp; later Krendler. I love the ending &amp; wish very much that it hadn't been changed for the movie. It really weakened the movie, changing the outcome (&amp; the movies have otherwise been unusually good adaptations). What's great about the ending is that Harris makes a point we might not like at all &amp; might not want to hear but he's brave enough to make it anyway. It's certainly thought-provoking. I believe the reason for our interest in characters such as Dr. Lecter has much to do with what they tell us about ourselves. I'll leave it at that, not to spoil the ending ... which might be annoying but certainly isn't weak. This is well worth a read, even if you've seen the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris should have just written a screeplay, rather than try to make the story into a Novel. It's very poorly written. He put all his ideas down without any sense of grammar--makes for a very difficult read.

Hill's review with whom I agree, and I'd like to make the following remark: at the second chapter of this book we learn that Dr. Lecter had originally escaped to Brazil. Fine. Then he flies to Europe. Why? Why doesn't he stay in S. America, like many other wanted criminals? Instead he goes to Italy, i.e. a developed country of W. Europe, where an extradiction convention with the US applies and where there is a long tradition of succesful struggle against terrorism and organised crime! In other words, he did his best to be apprehended! And when he's is tracked down, he doesn't return to Brazil but right back to the US, where he's among the 10 most wanted convicted criminals! With the FBI and a tycoon after him! Do me a favour!Mr. Harris' stories used to be realistic and probable and this was one of the reasons of their popularity. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is neither. And I don't understand why Dr. Lecter's personality had to be &quot;explained&quot; - let alone the &quot;explanation&quot; itself...I hope that Mr. Harris will give up this &quot;cinema oriented&quot; work and return to his brilliant, breath-taking, original inspiration."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal starts out as a great novel; fast paced, bloody, and suspenseful. The first chapter made Hannibal seem very very promising. However, almost everything else after that, has gone to the pigs. I felt that the story lacked a great deal of character development. Very little was done with Starling, I felt she played a small role in the whole novel untill the ending. What was missing from Hannibal was the unsuspecting nature that Harris carries on in all his previous novels; Red Dragon kept me up very late into the night. Hannibal never really delivers any thrill, in fact the novel seems to just build up useless fact after fact for the &quot;grand&quot; finale; which isn't very grand. The characters all lose their personalities. Dr. Lecter didn't seem like Lecter anymore, and Clarice Starling, seemed like she walked in from a different story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Readers must by now be conscious that, in this novel, FBI agent Clarice Starling neither arrests nor kills the escaped murderer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter. With him, she turns her back on the world, joining him at table and in bed and in the varying glories of human artistic achievement. Naturally, such an outcome offended many, and the makers of the film-version accordingly chose to leave her a champion of justice and idealism. But no small part of Mr. Harris' book consists of quiet damnations of mankind. Criminals and police, bureaucrats of all sorts, the rich and the poor in their multitudes, present themselves in the unrecognized narrowness of their souls and in the despicable ignobility of their ambitions. Exceptions are few. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, it would be too much to say that Mr. Harris is a master at compelling the reader to feel what his characters feel. Horror, if one perceives it at all, derives from horrific images more than horrific feelings. Perhaps that is as well. To combine compelling horror with subtle emotion is to write not necessarily a bestseller but a masterpiece; and &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not a masterpiece. It ranks about equally with its motion picture incarnation, competent and interesting. It is thus unlike &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; where the film often surpassed the book. In the present novel an attempt is made to account for Lecter's extraordinary personality. Some of the generalities are meritorious, but the truth is that Lecter puts one in mind less of a war orphan who saw his sister eaten than of a Gail Wynand in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, an idealist who failed, or a &quot;Little Bill&quot; in the film &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, a moralist so revolted by what he has seen that he has in effect ceased to be a moralist at all. In &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; Mr. Harris remarks, with regard to Hannibal Lecter, somewhat to the effect that it was as if committing murder purged him of all lesser sins. This element, though less prominent in the sequel, remains, and, having created his &quot;memory palace&quot;, haven and heaven in one, Lecter teaches Starling how to start construction of her own, a palace where at will she can visit with her murdered father and others whom she has loved. It is remarkable that in neither mansion are rooms reserved for the torture of those who offend. But to what degree, Starling's salvation is due to, or dependent on, Lecter's ministration of medications is far from clear, and regrettably leaves open the possibility of another sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought that the begginning was extremely good. It was quick and full of action but then as you got more into the book it began to slow down and in some parts it was actually a bit boring. This was during the part where we were in Italy but Hannibal had not yet been 'discovered'. Once he had been re-introduced we were back to the disgusting but beautifully written Harris we saw in Silence. An amazing book, well written from then on. Never thought I would side with a cannibul, but after looking into the 'palace of his mind' I really began to admire Hannibal. Worth reading when you have time to spare and don't give up if the beggining is boring, it will pass and then end is too good to miss!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm surprised towards the generally favorable reaction &quot;Hannibal&quot; has received here. I enjoyed &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; but have found numerous problems with the (money-inspired) sequel.The unending violence which Harris throws at the reader quickly becomes numbing. Dr. Lecter could take America out to dinner, but leave the reader a disinterested specator.Also, his prose approaches the atrocious. For instance, on pg. 144: &quot;The expo opened to enormous, unexpected crowds; excitement leaped like a trout in the public trousers.&quot; Shirley Jackson would be turning in her grave after writing like this.Michael"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'd just bought the CD this past weekend and have been listening to it in the car to and from work... at the close of disk 1 Clarise has put herself in a potentially dangerous situation, a little suspenseful so I quickly pop out disk 1, put in disk 2 with some eager anticipation... only to find myself in the middle of the story of Turin Turumbar, BOOK 2 of the Silmarilion (I happen to also own the CD of the Silmarilion set also, so that's how I know... also a GREAT book by the way, highly recommended...). I guess this doesn't really qualify as a review but I was VERY surprised to see that of all of the reviews currently posted, none made reference to the audio CD's. I also wanted to put something out there to see whether others had experienced the same issue."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Superficially &quot;Hannibal,&quot; by Thomas Harris,is tensely disappointing. Thomas obviously has been persuaded by too many choppingmall-and-movie-F/X enthusiasts--personal perhaps, but definitely professional. Ironically, publishers seldom know what the &quot;reading public&quot; wants. And it's always bad when a writer succumbs to outside, monetary encouragement. When we, the pubic, read, it's very personal, and I for one do not want to be a victum to someone's past, not even a fictional character's. &quot;Hannibal&quot; reminds me of &quot;Alien 3.&quot; The anticipated point of the story is that after each encounter there are more survivors--for the eventual, ultamate extermination of the evil creature. I don't care about reality; I want to see what's best for me and mine. I want to read about hope, not resignation, chemically induced or otherwise. Like &quot;Alien 3,&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; leaves me with the bitter taste of Murphe's world, a taste I am tired of. I only want to know that there is hope, not that hope is limited. I want survivors. In short, bad job, bad saleout, Tom. However, years from now, I'm sure that countless students will earn their doctorate degrees from lengthy dissertations on &quot;Hannibal.&quot; For all its chopping mall and modern special effects leanings, it's purpose is obtuse at best. Good stuff for future scholars. Bad stuff for the extant author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"coming into this book i had high hopes. i previously read both red dragon and the silence of the lambs and enjoyed both. this book had a poor plot as though the author was just trying to make money rather than tell an interestimg story. the summary of this book makes it sound better than it is dont believe you will be intrigued if you think the summary sounds interesting. a good third of the book takes place in italy. this is where the author put all his heart and it was the crappiest part of the book. the only thing that kept me reading was a belief that the climax would leave me satisfied with the rest. the ending sucks dont waste your time or money. this book doesnt deserve to be associated with the silence of the lambs"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This long-swaited sequel to the masterful book and movie &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is even better than the original. His creation of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling has become a category all its own; this book moves way beyond the horror/suspense genre and into the realm of literature.Readers who love wording will savor this book. More than any popular author, Thomas Harris creates scenes and moods with an economy of words that is mesmerizing. There are passages in this book that are like poetry in their rhythym and cadence.You can predict what the book is about. Without giving anything away, I can say that the hunt for Hannibal Lecter continues. What you can't predict is the bizarre and surreal ending. You will emerge from the last 30 pages as if from a dream. It's a shame that we may have to wait another 10 years for a sequel.This is a masterpiece. BUY IT and keep it. People will still be reading this book 50 years from now."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An incredible book...what really did it for me was the ending. While many think it's too unrealistic, it was exactly what I was too scared to wish for from the very moment Clarice and Hannibal first met in Silence of the Lambs, fearing it might be too childish. It was perfect, in my opinion, and sends a refreshingly different message than most books..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Read this novel! If you don't enjoy it, seek treatment for rectally impacted cranium disorder, and then read it again. The unfavorable reviews that I have read all seem to be written by people who wanted to re-read &quot;The silence of the Lambs&quot; and have it be the same only different. Each novel, from &quot;Red Dragon&quot; on that concerns Lecter has been different, and better than the last. In Hannibal, the monster finally becomes a fully fleshed character with a past, with desires beyond plot-driven mischief, and -yes- weaknesses. Clarice, too, becomes a more fully developed character; but, perhaps not in the way those that hero-worship the Jody Foster version of her might wish. Forget the movies. Read this novel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not terribly suprised at the poor reviews of _Hannibal_- most readers seem to expect Harris to write just like he did 10 years ago. This book, however, is significantly different. Not that this is new for Harris- if you read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, you saw how Harris grew as an author and thinker between the two books, the former being a mostly a simple thriller, the latter being a well thought-out, fascinating character study with a brilliant plot overlay. Hannibal carries this arc farther; the plot moves more to the rear, while the character interaction comes even more to the front. Harris shows us much more of Hannibal's vibrant world of immediacy, and does it in an utterly spellbinding way, for those who are receptive. It seems, though, that Harris got lost in this world, and only provided us with enough plot to set up new interactions and possibilities. I didn't mind- I loved every minute of _Hannibal_, simply for the new ideas it presented, and the mood it created. If you have a bit of an intellectual bent, and don't neccessarily care if this book isn't &quot;Silence of the Lambs 2&quot;, you'll probably enjoy _Hannibal_. If you're looking for more a cops and killers mystery novel, it will dissappoint... or maybe expand your horizons a little. In the end, the choice is yours."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Left wanting more from The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal arrives complete with a quasi-fleshing out of Doctor Lecter. The reader descends into the depths of Harris' mind, and there finds an even more vile creature than Lecter, namely Mason Verger. Complete with the requisite scars from his prior meeting with the good doctor, Harris creates Verger as the perfect antagonist. This novel escapes from the pedestal of five stars only because we are left wanting to know more about Lecter. Harris has an exquisite talent for creating ambiance and his knowledge of Florence, Italy adds accurate detail to the reader familiar with this region. Enough said. Get thee to thine bookstore, before Dr Lecter appears again on the silver scrren."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i am an avid book reader, and have read more books than i can remember. i must say though, this is the first book that has ever challanged me to stay awake.....needless to say, i couldn't manage to get through it! i hope to goodness the movie is better, because &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was and will always be one of my favorite movies."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At the audiobook store, the clerk convinced me to rent the unabridged version of &quot;Hannibal&quot; instead of the abridged. Boy, was I fooled! Harris has the disease of all researchers: I must write and publish every little thing I learned while researching and writing this book. Way too long in places but that's not the worst of it. The ending abandoned the characterizations of Starling and Hannibal set forth from &quot;Silence.&quot; It's no wonder Jodie Foster does not want to play the part: I would not either and I don't blame her. If you still want to read this book, get the abridged tape. It'll save you some time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only thing I'm disappointed with is that I couldn't give this book a negative rating; this has got to be the WORST book I've ever read. Skip any superficial observation about the material - Harris was plainly writing a treatment for a screenplay, and fell prey to narcolepsy after the introduction. The reader should be so lucky - gone are little bonuses like internal dialog, character development or believable plot, and left in place is the most juvenile, amateurish parody of Harris' own writing.Read Red Dragon again, and steal a copy of the movie when it comes out on video cassette - don't waste any money encouraging this type of Hollywood-fueled minimal effort."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I still find it hard to believe this was written by the sameauthor as purportedly it was. The characters have not evolved... aucontraire, they are cardboard and boring. Hannibal Lecter gets a pastthat justifies his brilliant evil mind and automatically negates everything that he [T. Harris] painstakingly set up on &quot;Silence...&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.Never had I witnessed such a painful and degrading change in a loved Character as Clarice M Starling.An unbelievable disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I found the book to be very entertaining overall, I was not satisfied with the ending. It was a bit far fetched for Starling to end up as Lector's companion. The planned torture of Lector was a little lacking in imagination as well. I just didn't find that the book measured up to the complexity of Lector's charactor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In reading reviews of this wonderful book with a wonderful, poignant ending, I realized that I must write a second review of it. This book is a mirror of modern day humanity: Frustration with the social injustice going on, society's willingness to ignore injustice against anyone but straight, white, middle to upper class men! This frustration in Clarice's case leads to horrific, &quot;dangerously sane&quot; insanity!Clarice's Hannibal character is COMPLETELY true to her to her character in the BOOK Silence of the Lambs! Maybe her Hannibal character is not true to her MOVIE Silence of the Lambs character. I invite my fellow reviewers to read the actual book Silence of the Lambs, they'll see that Clarice's character from book to movie is completely different: Different motivations, different personalities, different experiences. The Clarice in the book was naive, idealistic, tough as nails, angry, and multi-faceted, unlike Jodie Foster's movie rendering as a one dimensional, savvy, down to earth woman who's going to make it to the top and never lose faith! Come on, my fellow reviewers! Life is NOT a bowl of cherries and Hannibal delivers that fact horrifically and poignantly. Life is not black and white, Dr. Lecter=Bad/Clarice=Good. Come on! If you want Bad v. Good go watch a cartoon! If you want a heart-warming, one dimensional lie that will leave you feeling superior go someplace else! If you want a deep three dimensional world of characters who, no matter how bad they are, you feel compassion for, because they are HUMAN, go get Hannibal now. I understand that this will make some people uncomfortable, but that's what makes Thomas Harris a master storyteller and humanist.For my fellow Hannibal reviewers: Please actually READ the book before you review it! Don't just listen to Girl Scout Jodie Foster or one of your friends who've heard of the ending and then decide to write a negative review because the ending doesn't make you feel superior enough, different enough, from these very human characters who do horrific things. Everyone who has actually read the book can tell that you haven't read it! Also, please READ The Silence of the Lambs, as opposed to watching the movie, before you say that Clarice's Hannibal character is &quot;not true&quot; to her Silence of the Lambs character, that's ignorant! Clarice's Hannibal character is not only true to her Silence of the Lambs character, but her actions in Hannibal are actually predictible, if you READ The Silence of the Lambs!For those who want a generic, horror, dime novel, for those who want to feel superior, for those who have no culture, for those who have no compassion, and for those who want inhuman, one-dimensional characters whose &quot;badness&quot; we can take because they're inhuman, plastic, and so different from &quot;us,&quot; like, it seems, most of the reviewers of this book, don't read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a disappointment. The author treated Starling's character badly. I kept slogging through it, hoping it would get better, but it did not. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book fizzles out at the end. None of the drama between Clarice (the FBI agent) and Hannibal that made &quot;Silence...&quot; famous.The ending does not live up to the hype which you need to read through 550 pages to get to. Skip the last chapter it is a waste of trees and ink.Grusome but fizzles at the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is dull and boring i mean what sort of book has 103 chapters i got up to 60 something and then quit, it was so repeditive it kept on going over the same issues it probably would have been a lot better if he would have ripped out about 50 chapters. No thank you sorry"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the closest I ever came to Thomas Harris before was at the box office to see Silence of the Lambs, I was stunned at how Harris' enchanting language- and plot-play kept me glued to the book during train rides, lunch hours and pre-bedtime activities (ahem!). The reader is in for a special treat: the rare opportunity to glance at a serial killer on both good and bad days. Who knew Lecter was both a monster and a romantic at heart and, shedding some revelations about herself, Starling seems more &quot;real&quot; to the reader than in Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This Book Is A Great Wind-Up for the series! And to think! It does and can happen! That's really hard for the Civilized World to fully take in. If you go into history or simply look into today's world, these things do happen. The book holds your attention in a very intense way. Only for the strong!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book a lot. But I was disappointed with several aspects of it, one of them was that Jack Crawford all but disappears from the book. I think Mr. Harris could have found a different way to deal him. After all, a little tension between he and Clarice was set up in Silence. Also, I noticed that Mr. Harris had Clarice going through the same motions she went through in Silence. Overall, I was entertained and couldn't wait to find out where it was going. And when I got there, I hated it at first but then realized it truly was the best ending for these characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I consider this book to be confusing. Too many new characters I can't relate with, maybe because I did not read Silence of the Lambs, I saw the movie. I have had to go back to re-read chapters because I am lost. The book has gore it's just not what I expected. I am very diappointed. I was expecting more. I would not recommend this read to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really was disappointed with this book. I found it lesssuspenseful and just more shocking than Silence of the Lambs. And theending was absolutely ludicrous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not put this book down... I didn't know about Red Dragon, but am reading it now. Hannibal was an attention grabber. In Lambs, I found myself (for some reason) rooting for Hannibal and also in part of Hannibal... but it twisted and turned into a very dark place and I was very surprised at the end... not what I expected. I wish Harris had written a book about Hannibals whole life, from child hood to when Graham caught him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of the original Silence of the Lambs I thought there would be a lot more to come. However I was dissapointed after reading Hannibal. While engrossing as the original it lacks what the first one had. Realism mainly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hadn't read a piece of fiction in several years. Because most novels are so weak. When I read that the third installment of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy was coming out this summer I got really excited. Since I had enjoyed both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs in my fiction reading days. After reading Hannibal I'm going back to fiction. I don't have time to waste on this c**p!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with most of the other comments. The first half is a little slow trying to get through all of the Italian history and language. It took forever to read these parts. But, the second half was great. I flew through the book. The suspense was great and I could picture everything in my mide so vividly. Only the ending was truly awful. Read it, you'll see."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a big disappointment. The Silence of the Lambs was not great art, but it was a good beach read. Hannibal is neither. The plot has predictable action-movie sequences, and the prose reads like a script treatment for a film. Honestly, I'm surprised Harris just didn't admit that he wrote this for the big Hollywood bucks, and stick in &quot;camera pans left,&quot; &quot;fade in to cheesy overhead shot of Rome, with tourists,&quot; etc. That would have been a lot more honest of him. Skip the book and wait for the Bruce Willis blockbuster. Also, I just read in the paper that this book is going be made into a film starring Jodie Foster and Sarah Michelle Gellar. So there you go. Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book. I can't believe that Harris actually had me sympathizing with this abhorrent character, Hannibal. But there I was. The subtleties that Harris includes from beginning to end were not lost on me. This book must be read slowly and purposefully or volumes will be missed. Take your time, cook up some brains and curl up next to a hot fire..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many of you, I bought it the first week it was out, rushed home with it, and like Dr. Lecter might do with a new acquaintance, I devoured it. Maybe I ate too fast, maybe I need to go back and eat it again, or maybe I just need to let it go. Did anyone but me think the Italian cop was worth saving just because of his decadence? Did anyone but me think the ending was over wrought and, well, contrived? Did Harris get tired of writing, or thinking? Good book? Hell yes. Anything more? No. Wonderful characters and characterization, MTV plot."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Big Disappointment. Unless a Mississippi native trains extensively with a phoneticist in acting class, he has no business reading this kind of writing. Sure, your Italian is passable, nothing out of the common way; but how can you disappoint us after the brilliance of Kathy Bates's reading Silence? You are a great writer, but not a good reader. All of the suspense is lost on your provincial, run-of-the-mill, southern accent. You should have asked John Lithgow, or Ed Bagley, Jr, or Ms. Bates again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I approached this book with an open mind but came away thoroughly disappointed. It started when the author used gratuitous sexual references for no point at all. I expected the bloodiness, and was intrigued by getting behind Clarice and Hannibal's thoughts, but basically, the plot never seized me like Red Dragon (which I read in one day) or Silence. There are many other ways this could have played out, but the ghastly gruesome ending made it seem like the author had no other plot in mind, so he tried to gross us all out. And Starling's sinking to such levels, I am sorry, was just not believable, not at all. Unfortunately, the author has left us the possibility of yet another sequel. I wish he had stopped after Silence if this is the best he could offer. Thoroughly disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must say after the horror of Red Dragon and of Silence, Hannibal left me wanting. Wanting that Hannibal that you love to hate. It had glimmers of the old Hannibal, killing in Florence, and killing the poacher, but it left me wanting to know the pre-Red Dragon Hannibal not the post Silence Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a great book to Read, I think it was better than &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I think its the the bestr books of the year. so far"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I only enjoyed Hannibal on the second read. After loving Silence of the Lambs and red Drago, I found the first reading quite disturbing. One imagines that Mr Harris is quite a troubled person. I basically had to skim through to miss out the truely horrible sections. Once I'd finished and knew there were no surprises,I was able to read it again, and although it still makes me squirm, it does display the genius of RD &amp; SOTL. I was completely blind-sided by the outcome! A couple of the characters were a little 2 dimensional. Krendler, like Dr Chilton in SOTL was too much of a bastard to be beleivable fully."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First half was very slow, wordy, strange words that were not explained. Not connected. Unrealistic. Not a silence of the lambs, not even close."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Enjoyable. The book didn't sweep me away necessarily but it did hold my interest. I'm looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading his previous books, I can say that I'm very disappointed. The shocking and gruesome parts of the book are not enough to keep the reader interested. After a while it gets boring and tiresome. The funky ending really sucks!!!. I'm glad that I took this book from my local library instead of wasting my money on this aberration. It is to be hoped that his next book will return faith to his followers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recently found a promotional bookmark put out by Delcorte press, advertising a few of their new releases. At the top is a small photo of the dust jacket of Thomas Harris' \\"Hannibal,\\" with the caption, \\"If you liked \`Silence of the Lambs,' you'll enjoy \`Hannibal.'\\" That's okay, as far as it goes, which isn't nearly far enough. Words such as \\"like\\" and \\"enjoy\\" are a little mild to apply to Harris' novels, particularly his latest. It's a little like saying, \\"If you like manic depression, you'll enjoy paranoid schizophrenia.\\" \\"Hannibal\\" is harrowing, chilling, sickening, disturbing and gut-wrenching. I would not use the word \\"enjoy\\" to describe how I felt reading it. Now, all these negative adjectives do not mean I didn't like the book. I loved it. It didn't make me feel good, but I loved in the way you can't help loving a piece of work so superbly crafted it totally sucks you into itself, makes you believe it and scares the hell out of you. Most of our old friends from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" are back. The action commences seven years after the conclusion of the previous novel. FBI agent Clarice Starling finds herself in hot water over a drug raid gone bad. Meanwhile, Dr. Lecter is having problems of his own. For many years he has lived in anonymity in Europe, but his identity has been discovered by one of his early victims (and one of the few who survived), Mason Verger, one of the most loathsome creatures I've ever encountered in a work of fiction. Verger, who had his face removed by Lecter some years previously, is the scion of a wealthy meat-packing family. Verger wants to get Hannibal himself, before the FBI does, and he has the money and the means to prepare his revenge against our hero. That's right, I said \\"hero.\\" Hannibal Lecter is the hero of this book. His nemesis, Verger, is so horrible, so rotten and contemptible that he makes Hannibal look noble by comparison, and there's never any question of who you're going to root for. Verger is a sadistic child-molester, fortunately confined to an iron lung as a result of Lecter's earlier \\"treatment.\\" And while Verger stands out, he isn't the only sicko on the scene. We also have the utterly repulsive Justice Department hatchet man Paul Krendler, an oily political climber who divides his time between secretly helping Verger track down Hannibal Lecter and trying to put the finishing touches on Starling's badly-damaged career. This is not your typical psycho killer thriller. There really are no good guys. Everyone has skeletons in their closets (sometimes literally). In fact, most of my sympathy goes to Hannibal Lecter. Sure, he's a cannibal and a monster, but he has his own brand of nobility and a strict moral code from which he never deviates. Harris instructs us, subtly and sometimes painfully, that virtue can lurk in the unlikeliest places. There isn't much blood in \\"Hannibal.\\" Harris doesn't have to rely on cheap special effects to achieve what he's going for. The gore is at a minimum, and what little there is is never gratuitous. The violence owes more to Shakespeare than to Stephen King. It always serves a purpose. But the real terrors in this book are the terrors of the human mind and spirit. Flat-out chop-em-up gore would be easier to handle, in some cases, than the disturbing insights into the human condition Harris serves up. Harris has a beautiful, haunting prose style which eerily transcends the genre in which he chooses to work. The only literary comparison that comes to my mind is John Fowles' \\"The Collector,\\" and Harris has him beat by a good country mile. And then, of course, there's the soap opera aspect. Fans of Thomas Harris have been following the adventures of Dr. Lecter and his friends and foes for many years now. We all want to know what finally happens to them. And if you aren't a Harris fan, I suggest that you become one. Read \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" before you read \\"Hannibal.\\" Much of the impact of \\"Hannibal\\" comes from the evolution of the old familiar characters. We get much further into Dr. Lecter's head than we've ever been before. It isn't a very pleasant place, but it's not as bad as you might think, and is infinitely fascinating territory. So, do we learn the final fates of \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\" and Clarice Starling? That would be telling, and I'm not about to do that. But I will say this: The last few chapters of the book left me completely stunned. While reading, I was sitting with my mouth literally hanging open, occasionally exclaiming aloud. And I'm pretty jaded. It takes a lot to do that to me. One small hint- after reading the last section of the book, you may never again feel at ease at an elegant dinner party... If you're looking for a light, pleasant summer read, go elsewhere. But if you feel up to a roller-coaster ride through the darkest, most dangerous parts of the human soul, strap yourself in. And don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this was the best book of the trilogy. A vivid, surreal, roller coaster ride, which I found compelling. It was thrilling and unpredictable to the very last page.Some of the elements I enjoyed most seem to be the very aspects that others detested. I found the historical, musical and literary references evocative and thought provoking, (many readers seemed to think they were snobbish and/or too intellectual). I enjoyed the excellent and detailed descriptions of Florence (which many readers seemed to find boring). I was also impressed by the author's extensive culinary knowledge.I thought the ending was perfect. I think I was subconsciously hoping for this ending all along, but never thought Harris would have the nerve to do it. I thought there was definite chemistry and an element of erotic tension between Starling and Lecter in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and that aspect is further explored in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. It worked for me. I also think that some who have reviewed the book seem to be reading elements into the ending that aren't necessarily there.The feelings about this book seem quite strong, in both directions. There aren't many &quot;medium&quot; reviews, most seem to have loved it or hated it. I would be fascinated to know if the discrepancy between those readers who loved it and those who hated it is gender based, and if so, what that signifies.I think there is a much deeper sub-text to this work that many readers seem to be missing entirely. That, and a sense of whimsy..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First off I will admit that I have not read Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs. I do plan on reading both novels though after reading this one since I enjoyed it so much. The reason I did read it is because I felt that The Silence of the Lambs is the best film of the 1990's and assumed that Hannibal would follow in its footsteps. Personally, I think The Silence of the Lambs (the movie) had a better plot than the book and therefore believe that the novel itself must be better too. Red Dragon, being the original, must be better too even though it lacks the character Clarice Starling. He didn't need to make an art in his killings though. The detail made me sick to my stomach. I feel horrible for actually feeling sorry for Hannibal at times. When they introduced his sister, Mischa, through a nightmare on the plane I actually felt like I understood why he grew up the way he did."},{"Title":"QUARANTINE AT ALEXANDER ABRAHAM'S (Road to Avonlea)","review":"Completely and utterly a book about mischief!!:) Sarah and Felix enter Mr. Abrahams home as the result of a dare and some taunting on the part of the other children, to see what has become of a friend of theres.

Read it!"},{"Title":"The past is myself (Classics of World War II. The secret war)","review":"A most poignant account of both the history of the epoch of which the author writes and the ramifications of cross socio-political cultures. Many who have had the privilege of reading this book were initially stimulated to do so as a result of the marvelous teleplay scripted for PBS entitled \\"Cristabel\\" and possibly came to the same conclusion as did I: there were literally millions of Germans who did not subscribe to the nazification of Germany; who fought private wars to undermine the nazi regime; and who, like so many of us when faced with a haplessness seeded by the lack of logic as to how their lives had been altered despite their efforts to preserve a measure of human dignity and honor, find themselves desperately close to falling into the abyss of submission.In 2009 mankind faces a similar dilemma: authoritarion government; mandated socio-cultural lifestyle; loss of self-directed control; and a feeling of haplessness to provide answers to the absence of logic while enduring a constant barrage of mediaspeak/marketing spin idealism.I have been asked on occasion why didn't the thousands of jews who disembarked the trains at the various death camps not just swarm their captors who were outnumberd at least 100-1; seize the weapons; and defend themselves from certain death?I always answer: \\" Fear of the unknown compromises hope, courage, and action; have you ever stood at the barrel end of an automatic weapon?\\"A great read...a must read for all of us who cherish not only life, but the pursuit of happiness in our lifetime and in our style."},{"Title":"The past is myself (Classics of World War II. The secret war)","review":"Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! This book has been already (in fact, in 1998, by the University of Nebraska) published in the US under the title \\"When I was a German\\". So be aware of the dishonest trap publishers and (silent) Amazon itself lay out for the reader. Greed gnaws at the heart of the system indeed!This fragment of autobio is a good choice for a seconf or third read about (mostly) wartime life in Germany under the Nazis. I say second or third because the English writer's German husband came from the upper-upper Hamburg class and belonged to some kind of resistance or anti-Nazi organization more or less connected to the 1944 plot organizers, and she therefore didn't move in the same circle as ordinary Germans, so from that point of view she is unrepresentative.This doesn't matter so much when speaking of crowded trains or the bombings, but it affects her political stance and therefore how she regarded the war. I guess an \\"intelligent\\" and \\"honest\\" Nazi (although there weren't such according to an ingenious and popular [?] joke she tells) might have experienced things differently.But all in all the book seems to be sincere, is well-written and reads very easily: it is (now) politically correct and fits nicely into our \\"Western, Christian tradition\\". Some passages I found outstanding; and the episode with the Balt SS officer is IMO a one-page masterpiece. It reminded me of a chapter of Dostoievski's \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\".So if you already know something about the history of the period, have read some other wartime bio written by a lower-class German civilian, and don't own the American version, buy the book. Overall, it's not memorable despite the passages mentioned above, but you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The past is myself (Classics of World War II.

This one concerns two families on different sides of religious and political disputes in England. Of course the son of one family and the daughter of the other are in love - kind of like Romeo and Juliet in England without the death at the end. There is action and romance, evil plotting and violence, and just when you think the bad guys are all black they do things that surprise you. Not only a good history lesson but a thumping good read. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The insect god (His The vinegar works)","review":"And there is no one stranger than Edward Gorey. The Insect God is dark dark dark, sick sick sick, and really fabuluous. Poor little Millicent Frastly dissappears into the oncoming dark without a trace. Oh pity the poor child with a weakness for cinnamon balls. Even the most ardent child-hater, which popular myth held Gorey to be, can not help but give a little shudder at the gristly fate of disgustingly sweet and beribboned Millicent. Wonderfully illustrated in Gorey's ominous stlye, the Insect God is a shadowy romp through the mind of one of Earth's strangest humorists. If you find you love the book, you might want to check out the song of the same text and title covered in an apropriately creepy manner by the Monks of Doom."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Juster unfortunately lapses into the very pedantry that he decries. This dulls the sharpness of the story. But a boy seeking his way might find this map very affirming that they aren't the only person who feels out of it at times, and it give some creative tips and perspectives for coping."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"There is so much acclaim here for this book I hardly need too say anything at all. It is fantastic! I first read an extract of it when I was in school. The Whether man's philosophy of &quot;Expect everything and then the unexpected never happens.&quot; Has always been one of my favourite phrases. Now, at 18, I read it for the first time (and the second) and the whole thing is like that! From the Lethargarians who, if they &quot;stopped to think or laugh would never get nothing done&quot;; to the Dodecahedron--a figure with twelve faces: one for smiling, one for crying etc... ; to the terrible demons: the Gross Exaggeration and the Threadbare Excuse.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster used the play-on-words to create some delightful humor in his book, The Phantom Tollbooth. Some of my favorite examples were the 'Whether Man,' Tock the Watchdog, and, of course, Milo's jail sentence of &quot;I am.&quot; Juster also brought some well-known idioms into his story, such as the Island of Conclusions, which you can only get to by jumping, the disappearance of Rhyme and Reason (who, in this story, are actual people), and the Point of View being a place rather than perception. Overall, this is a great book that had me laughing nearly the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I read it when I was 7 and enjoyed the magical story. I read it when I was 14 and was amazed by the nuances of the story I was too young to understand before. I read it when I turned 21, savoring the points of life truths and clever turns. I'm still reading it, although I lost the first two pages a decade ago.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This is a great book if you like humor mixed with adventure, life lessons, and a tad of fantasy. Don't worry about the life lesson part, it isn't like a school book, where they tell you what the lesson is. In this book, the places, people, and things are the lesson. The reason I picked this book is that in school, we read part of it, and I liked it, so I bought it. The places, such as the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), Digitoplis, Dictionoplis, and the Mountains of Ignorance amused me. I also enjoyed the characters; such as Tock, the Humbug, Rhyme and Reason, and the Which. I recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Milo, knowing what one does with a tollbooth set it up and drove up to it, the funny thing is he now was on a real road. Milo takes different roads to different places and in each he learns to notice the ordinary: numbers, letters, sounds, colors and pictures and he realises that they are in fact extrodinary.Milo gets to conduct color, to eat his words and to mine for numbers but all the time he is on a quest to bring back Rhyme and Reason the princesses of justice. In this odd land all is not well, nothing really has been well ever sense Rhyme and Reason were banished.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I think The Phantom Tollbooth is a very interesting book. What was so interesting about the story is that the characters have such a backwards way of living compared to reality. For example, in the imaginary realm that Milo enters through the tollbooth, the characters he meets only eat when they are full, and become more hungry as they eat!Milo and Tock meet a Mathemagician who owns a mine called the Number Mine. It's a very different kind of mining then you would think, they throw away the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds and mine for numbers. The numbers are currency and are worth more when they weigh more. The Mathemagician explains the purpose of his mine [\\"as valuable a jewel as you'll find anywhere.\\" He scooped up a great handful of stones and poured them into Milo's arms. They included all the numbers from one to nine, and even an assortment of zeros. \\"We dig them and polish them right here, and then we send them all over the world. Marvelous, aren't they?\\"] Milo drops one of the glittering numbers and it breaks in two. [\\"Oh, don't worry about that\\", said the Mathemagician. \\"We use the broken ones for fractions.\\"]My favorite part of the book is when Milo and Tock pass through the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason. Milo and Tock have to avoid the demons who are constantly trying to trick them to fall into their traps. They use manipulation and magic to try to trick them to complete impossible tasks such as digging a huge hole with a spoon, or confusing them by agreeing and disagreeing with everything they say. They become so confused that they forget why they were there.I would recommend this book to my friends as it is one of my favorite books. The author Norton Juster is really creative and imaginative. The story kept me interested until the last page. This book reminds me of a mixture between Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland.I hope you find my review useful, Chris"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I love this book!!! There is something about traveling with Milo that appeals to me at all ages, when I was a kid, and even now. It could be the clever ideas, witty dialogues, and interesting characters. But I think there's much more as well to make this book such a joy to read.Milo has come home from school and once again can't find anything to do. He's not interested as much and looks glumly around when he finds a package waiting in his room. Inside is a genuine tollbooth with signs and a couple coins for passage. With nothing better to do, he sets it up, gets in his car, and proceeds to go through.He doesn't just end up in his room though. He ends up in Expectations. There's some strange characters here to be sure. Especially in the doldrums, where he is stuck until a helpful watchdog named Tock helps him escape. Together they go to Dictionopolis where they meet the King and learn a bit about words. Also here, the humbug joins their journey. Their new mission, on behalf of the King, is to rescue Rhyme and Reason, two princesses who were banished by the King and his brother when they made a decision they didn't like.With the King's blessing, they set off only to go through a forest of sound, jump to the Island of Conclusions, and help many people along the way. They reach Digitopolis where the King's brother rules. Here the numbers are many and the problems confusing, but they manage to outsmart the King for his blessing to rescue the princesses as well.The only thing left is to scale the Mountains of Ignorance to get the princesses. But there are plenty of demons along the way to stop them. Is Milo up to the challenge?The characters in this are great. They all fit their parts well and while their names may be confusing to younger readers, what better way to introduce the dictionary as a learning tool. And to be sure, this book is also an excellent learning tool. Milo especially grows throughout the book and you find yourself satisfied with his courage, bravery, fortitude, intrepidness, and pluck.This book, because it is technically is a children's book, has many pictures. While they are a good way of getting a visual of the characters, I could help but hope for color. They seem to be of a pen and ink style with various types of black lines. However, Tock is absolutely adorable.Juster has a great writing style. He isn't afraid to challenge the younger crowd with his words and style. He is entirely clever and the book is written in the 3rd person. Such a wonderful book and an absolute treasure to the literary world.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Let's set aside the implausibility of the beginning for a moment. Forget that normally, a package would not simply appear in a child's room. This book was after all written in different times. This book is not about the beginning or why Milo was bored. The story is about the magical land Milo goes to. The situations are clever and so is the dialogue, and the plot points are quirky. There's some fun math trivia and thought-provoking riddles and statements in here that cause you to stop for a moment and think it over. Just forget about Milo's 'real world', this is a novel that is simply fun to read. Call it a guilty pleasure if you will, but it's a good book for kids AND adults."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"A few months ago, I was having a conversation with a friend. Somewhere along the way, something we were discussing reminded him of his favorite childhood book, \\"The Phantom Tollbooth.\\" He was astonished when he learned that I not only had not read the book, but had never heard of it. I am not sure how, among the hundreds of books I read to my sons over the years, I missed out on the wonders of \\"The Phantom Tollbooth.\\" He was deeply concerned about this gaping lacuna in my literary experience.The next time I saw my friend, he smiled and silently handed me a lovingly dog-eared copy of the book. I am so glad. Brilliantly illustrated with line drawings by the incomparable Jules Feiffer, Norton Juster's simple morality tale reads a Pilgrim's Progress for bored children everywhere. Milo, bored with everything in his life, is transported - in the style of C.S. Lewis' wardrobe - through a magic tollbooth to a land where adventures await him and a bevy of memorable characters populate his Herculean challenge of releasing the princesses, Rhyme and Reason from their imprisonment.When Milo returns to his bedroom, he has learned his lesson and is never again bored. Neither will you be when you read this magical tale.Juster's clever plays on words are fun. The story is engaging for children and poignant for adults. Anna Quindlen says is best when talking about his classic tale: \\"I read 'The Phantom Tollbooth' first when I was 10. I still have the book report I wrote, which began 'This is the best book ever.'\\"For the eternal child in all of us, this book is food for the soul.

The Phantom tollbooth is a terrific book were a boy named Milo who goes an adventure.Milo is not exactly an exciting boy. He sees the world in black and white. When one day he finds a cardboard tollbooth that takes him to a whole new world. Their Milo finds a watchdog named Tock who ticks and goes on an adventure to find rhyme and rime to restore a once great kingdom of words and one of numbers, but on the way they encounter a variety of interesting people and creatures.The Phantom Tollbooth is a one of kind of book, and I highly recommend it to everyone should read. I especially if you're ten or up and looking for an adventure I think I just set you up for a date."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read the Phantom Tollbooth when I was a kid and absolutely loved it. The strange characters who all seem to control something uncontrollable (sound, color, and so on) stayed with me for years afterwards, so that when I saw it on the bargain table in the book store I decided to pick it up again.It was only on re-reading it as an adult that the message of the book jumped out at me for the first time. Milo is a kid who doesn't think anything is interesting, and the lands beyond the Phantom Tollbooth teach him, bit by bit, how the world is full of fantastic things, and how knowledge is always worth pursuing. But finally seeing the metaphor behind such characters as the Awful Dinn or Canby (who is as brave as can be and as cowardly as can be) didn't make them any less entertaining. I suppose that's the exact test that a book has to pass to be fun for all ages- and this one is!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"One of only two books I've ever read more than once. Though it may seem childish to an adult, the message is touching at any age. The power of hope, possibility and friendship is sure to brighten anyone's day."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"\\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is an old, but interesting book. It all starts out when Milo, a boy who doesn't know what to do with himself -not just sometimes, always!- comes home from school to find a box with a cardboard tollbooth in it.When he drives through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, he finds himself in the Kingdom of Wisdom, a place where everything is a play on words! For example, Tock, the watchdog, actually has a watch on his chest! In their ultimate quest to find Rhyme and Reason, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug have many queer adventures.I would reccomend this book, but it is not one of my five top favorite. \\"The Phantom Tollboth\\" uses a lot of great descriptions, but yet, sometimes you might wish the book had a little more of something. This is definately not a book to miss, even though it's personally not my favorite one."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Have you ever had a day when you were just so bored? Well, that is every day for Milo, in Norton Justers great book called \\"Phantom Tollbooth\\".A very bored Milo comes home one day and finds a package in his room. In the package there is a Tollbooth which takes him on his journey from the city of Dictionopolis, to other cities such as, Reality, and Illusion, to finally, The Sea of Knowledge. Throughout his travels he meets many new friends, such as a dog named Tock who is half a clock.I liked this book because it has to do with life, reality, and fantasy. This is a great book for the whole family to read."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I think the story The Phantom Tollbooth was very creative. For example, people don't sell letters or words and it is impossible to play music that you can't hear. There aren't little people called Lethagarians either. I like how the book gives me new ideas. Another thing I liked about the book was that the author explained everything perfectly. I felt like it was real. When Milo, Tock and the Humbug meet Rhyme and Reason at the end, everyone became friends. It was a good ending. I hope I find another book as good as this one."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"As a young person making my way through the elementary school years, I encountered a plethora of wonderful, imaginative books. From Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" series to Cooper's \\"The Dark is Rising\\" sequence, I was lucky enough to never be in short of good literature. However, there was one book that I seemed to return to time and time again. One book that seemed the epitome of creativity and whit. One book that perfectly combined lovable characters with a wild, unpredictable story line. One book that, in time, would become my hands-down favorite in the young reader category.The first time I encountered Juster's \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" was through my mother's voice, my innocent youth making way for a lifetime of reading; my last encounter will likely be as I am in my rocking chair, with old age slowly creeping. I have no doubt this classic will be as enjoyable then as it has always been. Read this to your child and to yourself; it is truly a book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth is not like any other book I have ever read. It was different because the author made it seem like you are on the journey with Milo.Before the journey begins, Milo is bored and not excited about anything. The journey began because he was so bored. Through out the book, he learns lessons about life. The world of The Phantom Tollbooth is not like ours. In this world, numbers are mined and letters grow on trees. Milo is a smarter kid at the end of the book but that is all I will tell you about the end.The most interesting part was the subtraction stew. When you eat it you get hugrier then when you started. My favorite character is Alec. He was born in the air where his head will be when he grows up. So he grows down instead of up.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because there are so many details you do not want to stop reading. So if you like to read, then look for Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"When I was in fifth grade, my teacher lent her copy of The Phantom Tollbooth to me, correctly guessing that I would appreciate the book. I not only enjoyed it, but the book had a deep influence on my own sense of life. The Phantom Tollbooth is certainly reminiscent of Lewis Carroll and Roald Dahl but with a somewhat softer edge, lacking the mean-spiritedness that sometimes creeps into those other writers. Also, like the works of those other two writers, the Phantom Tollbooth is outfitted with distinct and lively illustrations (in this case, care of Jules Feiffer). Now, the wit is certainly more explicit with Juster than with Carroll. This is both a good thing and bad thing. It makes the book more accessible to young readers and teaches some powerful lessons about language and logic, thinking and communicating. However, I do feel that the book has not grown up with me as well as have the works of writers such as Carroll or Milne. The Phantom Tollbooth's wit is a little too transparent for me as an adult, but I still highly recommend it to any young readers who are thoughtful and curious."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

This package is not just any old box but this item holds parts to a magical tollbooth that takes Milo on the trip of his life. On this voyage Milo meets a watchdog named Tock, visits the great city of Dictionopilis, and is sent on a quest to rescue the great Rhyme and Reason, along with many challenges throughout his journey.As a twelve-year-old I loved this book. It was very exciting and in every chapter there was a new twist to the story line. I also think it is great how literal Norton Juster is. He thinks of an event, such as a spelling bee, and turns it into a character, like a bee that spells.

It subtly and beautifully teaches concepts about numbers and statistics, words and puns, as well as the value of finding one's own entertainment instead of relying on others to provide it for you.Your children will be entranced, and adults will be amused and fascinated.

The bad part was that some parts of the book was kind of boring and parts of it were really hard to understand. The rest of the book I liked because of the authors imagination it made the book interesting and made it seem magical. The book was also funny, when the author said Milo had his but on the tip of his tongue. On a scale from one to ten I would give the book an eight. Here is a short story.This book is about a boy who is board with life and doesn't know what to do with himself. One day he found a turnpike tollbooth in his room, he went into it and found himself in a magical world. In this world he met many people and creatures. He also made two good friends Tock and the Humbug, they came with Milo (the boy) to rescue princess Reason and Rhyme. They are two princesses that make everything good. The were sent to the castle in the air by king Azaz and the mathematician. The mathematician thought that numbers were best and king Azaz thought that words were best and like most brothers they had to fight about it so they asked Rhyme and Reason, which one was the best, they said that they were equal. The brothers didn't like that and that was why they sent them to the castle in the air.Milo, Tock, and the humbug went through many things rescuing the princesses and became good friends.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"After nasty families and school bullies, boredom is probably the predominant plague of children in Western society. The remedy for boredom: a voyage to a far-off world where things happen that don't usually happen. Begun by Alice in Wonderland, this theme of children's fantasies is continued here in The Phantom Tollbooth. Readable by both children and young teenagers, this adventure - comedy is about Milo, a young boy who discovers a tollbooth in his room one day. Traveling thru it, he enters a world that seems to have been concocted out of his classroom lessons. Milo encounters the warring cities of Digitopolis and Dictionopolis, the Doldrums which one never wants to get stuck in, and makes an accidental jump to the Island of Conclusions. Along the way he meets a wide variety of characters, such as Tock the dog, the Whetherman, and Rhyme and Reason.I read this book when I was 12, and it has remained one of my favorite books since then.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read this book as a child, and very happily reorded it when a memory of it surfaced. The plot is as excellent as I remembered it. A young boy named Milo finds the entire world to be completely uninteresting, and he's already bored, cyncial and jaded, despite the fact that he can't be more than 12 years old. Somebody gives him a way to explore, and he's off to a fantastic land of imagination in his little electric car. Once there, he finds that knowledge and thought have become personified. He encounters cities of words and numbers, a woman who guards and saves sounds, he literally jumps to Conclusions, takes a swim in the sea of knowledge. The main plot involves Milo and some assorted friends (my favorite is the watch-dog Tock, who has a real watch on him, but then I've always loved dogs) rescuing two princesses who are trapped in the Mountains of Ignorance. Milo must battle all of the demons that plauge goodness and knowledge to accomplish his goal. Along the way, he discovers that he and the world are much more interesting and exciting than he thought. Besides that, another little gem is hidden in here. Life is not just about learning and pursuing knowledge. There are many varities and experiences out there. Math, science, art, history and so on. The key is not just learning about them, but learning how to balance them so that they all work together to make us better people. Milo got the message in the end, and I hope that more follow in his footsteps. This book is written on a children's level, but the author never talks down to kids or patronizes them.

As an intellectual child, I really identified with Milo, the quiet boy who learned to come out of himself and explore a fun but challenging fantasy world. I loved the plays on words and the &quot;sassy&quot; attitude (can't think o a better word right now) of some of the characters. It was fun fun fun and intelligent too. All this, and the book still manages to impart quite a few good lessons.Several years ago I met Norton Juster at a book signing near Washington, DC, where I learned he was a student of architecture when he wrote this book. (The tour was to promote his new children's title that was related to architecture.) He seemed overwhelmed at the sight of so many fans. Even in the middle of the afternoon, a line had wrapped around the bookstore and down the sidewalk outside, and they ran out of Phantom Tollbooth books.The only flaw I noticed as an adult was that a middle section of the book dragged a little, although I never thought this as a kid. (I am 30 years old and female.)Even if you have the book, I also STRONGLY recommend the audiocassette version with Pat Carroll; she does such a great job reading the characters and bringing out their personalities, and the abridgement is so well done, that this is hands down the best audiobook I own.

A MUST read for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster's Phantom Tollbooth use of language was truly a delight. As an elementary school teacher it was refreshing to revisit this piece of literary genious. I am excited and motivated to incoporate this book into my entire year's curriculum.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Milo, Tock, the Humbug, Spelling Bee, and many other exciting characters bring a wonderful story to life in The Phantom Tollbooth. Norton Juster tells the tale of Milo, a boy who has plenty of time. He never appreciates anything, and takes everything for granted. But then one day, he finds a tollbooth in his bedroom, and decides to play what he thought was a game. He is taken into another world where everything he used to think of as boring suddenly becomes one giant mystery waiting to be discovered. He learns where words and numbers come from, the importance of sound and time, and comes face to face with the values of life. He sets on a journey to rescue the two princesses Rhyme and Reason, who are trapped in a castle in the air. He uses his mind and courage to succeed in this quest. But most important, he discovers that life is an adventure and not to take anything for granted."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"When I think of Milo and the Phantom Tollbooth, I instantly smile. As an adult it is still one of my favorite books, not because it stirs up memories of lovely childhood summers that could sometimes become &quot;boring&quot;, but because Juster plays with language and characters in such an entertaining way. Even the title is intriguing to me, hinting at the adventure waiting inside. This sits right next to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on my list of best children's stories."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Along the way he passes through the Doldrums, meets the man who makes all noises, and the orchestra who paints teh morning with their instruments. This book is so rich in color and wordplay that it is so engrossing to read. The way the author wrote it is so unuiqe and special. It is differnet from any other book I have read.

One day, a mysterious present is delivered that changes your whole life. The really wonderful book begins after about a chapter of introduction that I have summed up above. Little Milo ventures into a world of Doldrumms, Words and Numbers with little Rhyme or Reason. Though this book has a few sections that you can tell are the 'MAIN' parts of the story, all of the little, seemingly forgetable parts of the story are the ones that seem to stick with one for the longest amount of time.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My father read this book to me the first year it was published. I was nine and it has been on my bookshelf since. I can't tell you how many copies of this I have purchased for people.This is a great book to encourage thinking, not simply memorizing. Each page contains new language, new ideas, new ways to play with learning. It also happens to be a wonderful story. I may have been too young at nine to read it on my own, but certainly it is a great read-aloud for children nine or a bit younger. At nine, I didn't understand all the fancies, but like the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland, this book succeeds on many levels.The Phantom Tollbooth encourages a child's love for language. It paints wonderful pictures (with the help of Feiffer's charming line drawings). It is as perfect a thing as can be written.Oh, and if you're an adult without any children at home - buy the book for yourself. It will take you away from the Doldrums and into the Kingdom of Wisdom where your spirit can be renewed."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I cannot believe that I did not have the incredible enjoyment that I received from reading this book until I was sixty years old. My only consolation is that it is occasional finds like this book that help keep me young; what a tremendous treat! Normally I would not bother to review a book with so many glowing reviews (almost 300 as I write this), but in this case I guess that I probably suffer from the same compulsion as many of the other reviewers to share this wonderful find with as many other friends as possible who may have also somehow overlooked it. When the anniversary edition of THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH was published six years with an introduction by Maurice Sendak (WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE was one of my favorite books to read to my growing children), someone sent it to me and I put it in that large \\"to read \\"pile but somehow never got around to it. After all, after thirty five years what could the hurry be. A few days ago, I was looking for a quick fun read and picked it up; the rest is history, I couldn't put it down until I was finished. Perfect, including the great illustrations by Jules Feiffer. I start telling my wife all the great lines, but realized that it was so good that I didn't want to spoil it for her.This is the story of Milo, the boy bored with life whose worldview is suddenly changed forever when he visits the lands on the other side of the phantom tollbooth. He ends up traversing the foothills of confusion, the sea of knowledge, the mountains of ignorance and Dictionopolis ( a kingdom of words) and Digitopolis (a kingdom of numbers) as he searches for the sisters Rhyme and Reason. And seldom have we met a companion as delightful as TOCK, who is, of course, a literal \\"watch dog\\" in a world where words mean what they say.The word play is so wonderful and the characters so self explanatory (e.g. the Mathemagician or the Soundkeeper in the Silent Valley), that the profunditry and power of the insights contained in this simple tale can easily be overlooked. Hopefully, an illustration will help, as Milo, Tock and their friend The Humbug travel along, they unexpectedly find themselves in a strange place:\\"To be sure \\" said Canby, \\"you're on the Island of Conclusions. Make yourself at home. You're apt to be here for some time.\\"\\"But how did we get here?\\" asked Milo, who was still a bit puzzled by being there at all.\\"You jumped, of course\\" explained Canby. \\"That's the way most everyone gets here.\\"So don't jump to a conclusion that you have better things to do than read a children's book, since this book is for anyone who is young at heart; in fact, the longer that you have lived the more that you will recognize the power of its simple yet sophisticated truths. And even if you are not as totally capitivated as I was, the word play and just pure fun make it worthwhile. And it is a very fast read. Only one flaw that I spotted, which as a former math major I cannot resist including a comment. The author doesn't know the rules of math, one long equation does not sum to zero as claimed, so just accept this and continue with the story rather than let it distract you as it did me.Please read this book, unless you are too busy and too serious to have fun. No wonder it has become a classic, and good ideas should always be shared, especially when they are this enjoyable.I only hope that after you finish reading this book that you share my excitement and feel as compelled it to share it with others as I now do."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"OMG! What is there to say? I love this book so much. I cried when I reached the last page because I never wanted it to end. I love this book so much I have read it 5 times in the past year. Milo is a young boy who thinks everything is boring and worthless and pointless. One day a tollbooth appears in his room so he drives through it. After he drives through it he finds himself in a magical land. He soon befriends a watchdog (literally) named Tock. Milo and Tock venture through many lands like Dictionopolis and The Silent Valley. They meet tons of really odd yet cool creatures. And finally they save the princesses, Rhyme and Reason, and they resolve all conflict in the land. I don\`t wanna give away the exact end so I\`ll stop here by saying.......You NEED to read this book. It\`s one of those books that you\`ll want to pass down for generations. For some it might even change your lives. This book ventures into the true meanings of things and it gives you a whole new point of view. It doesn\`t matter how set in your ways you are. This book WILL change you. Whoever doesn\`t read this book is missing out on something really wonderful."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster is a classic! I read it for the first time when I was in fifth or sixth grade. I remember thinking it was amazing then, although I didn't get all of the inside jokes (Canby, jumping to Conclusions, etc.). I re-read the book every few years, enjoying it more and more each time. Now, as an adult, I understand all the jokes and the whole story just seems to get better over time. I teach elementary school and I always find time to read this book to my class. Children from all walks of life can relate to the story and its hero. What child has never been bored with life, with school, with everything? Milo is every child. We can only hope that every child is fortunate enough to take a journey such as Milo's through the Phantom Tollbooth."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to see so many reviews for this book. I had been under the impression (an impression I now see was thankfully false) that \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" had fallen into relative obscurity in the last 20 years or so. I'm basing this impression on the fact that you just don't hear anybody mention it anymore. Not librarians or booksellers or teachers or anybody. You don't read current criticism of the book. There aren't huge theses based on its plot or reasonings. And yet... It is a great story with great writing, a lovely (if sometimes overdone) plot, and a merry cast of characters. Accompanied by the delicate illustrations of one Jules Feiffer, the book deserves to be remembered for all time. Hopefully, it will be.We follow the adventures of Milo in this story. Milo is ennui incarnate. Nothing interests the boy and he has a very difficult time seeing the point in anything at all. One day Milo walks into his room with the plan of finding disinterest there and finds instead that he has been given a large present. It is, according to an accompanying note, one genuine turnpike toolbooth. After assembling the creation, Milo decides to play with it for a little while. He hops into his electric car (possibly the number one toy most desired by children reading this tale), plops some money into the toolbooth, and finds himself in a completely different, and oddly unnamed, new land. It is there that Milo meets and befriends a variety of different creatures and beings. Ultimately, the boy is sent on a journey to locate the princesses Rhyme and Reason from their imprisonment in the sky.But the brunt of the book, and the parts that most people remember, are the warlike words between the king of Dictionopolis and the Wizard of Digitopolis. In fact, all that I could remember about this book (years after reading it and moments before rereading it) was that the debate was the question of which was more important; words or numbers? Being an English major I'd probably throw my cap in with the former, but, as the princesses Rhyme and Reason make clear, the two are of equal value. The book's plot is not a particularly new one. Anybody familiar with any basic quest story, be it \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (to which this has many similarities), \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" or even \\"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\\" will recognize this book's form. What sets it apart from the rest is not only the world in which Milo finds himself abroad, but the character of Milo himself. Here is a boy with a serious deficiency. He is Maurice Sendak's \\"Pierre\\" and he simply does not care. By meeting the residents of a world of everything from words and numbers to colors and sounds, Milo comes to understand that the more one learns, the farther one can travel.Filled with sly puns and clever ideas the book is a real delight. The king of Dictionopolis is named Azaz. There is a boy who is only .58 of a person and who patiently explains that in his land every family has 2.58 children. He is simply that .58. Things like that. A lot of this books sails swimmingly over the heads of children, while a couple other moments sail swimmingly over the heads of most adults. It's worth it to pay attention to Juster's writing too. Though prone to silliness, the author is equally comfortable spouting text like, \\"Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn?...Or the quiet and calm just as a storm ends? Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven't the answer to a question you've been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause in a roomful of people when someone is just about to speak, or most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you're all alone in the whole house?\\" I love passages like this. Juster is the rare author that can make you laugh and then pause for thought within a scant two or three sentences.As I said at the beginning, in spite of all the good reviews this book has received, I still feel that, \\"The Phantom Toolbooth\\" is unappreciated in this day and age. Where's its movie? Its official fan club? Its annotated editions? Alas, I feel we'll have to wait until the novel receives the acclaim of which it is utterly and entirely deserving. Until it does, let's just sit back in a comfy chair and glow in the inviting warmth of a book that finally gives full attention to the inner lives of sounds, vowels, and computations."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read this book with my mom and we both loved it! This book has an interesting beginning, a strange middle and a suspenseful ending. The author put in lots of creative puns and amusing ways to use words. For example, Milo (the boy) thinks he going to meet a witch in the dungeon, but actually he meets a \\"Which\\" who chooses which words to say and which words not to say. I liked how numbers were gems and words were food. Personally, I believe that words are more valuable than numbers. I think the author just plain rocks!Ben (age 9)"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Since first published in 1961 Norton Juster's classic children's story has known many incarnations - hardcover reprints, paperback issues, audio cassette, stage play, and now an unabridged audio version read by the incomparable David Hyde Pierce.Few of us did not watch the popular television show Frasier, and those of us who wouldn't miss an episode were soon fans of Pierce who played Dr. Niles Crane. He was funny, touching, affecting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The same may be said of this narration. His voice so easily becomes that of a small boy as well as the voices of the many characters met on a fantastic adventure. Listen as young Milo discovers a strange tollbooth in his bedroom. Then, since the rather bored youngster has nothing better to do he gets into his toy car and drives through the booth.What does he find? An absolutely amazing place, Dictionopolis, chock full of words and inhabited by unusual characters from Tock, a watchdog, to Humbug, an insect.As youngsters accompany Milo on this journey they will not only discover the meaning of words but much to ponder, such as \\"The way you see things depends a great deal on where you look at them from, \\" Or, they might consider this: \\"'I never knew words could be so confusing,\\" Milo said to Tock as he bent down to scratch the dog's ear. 'Only when you use a lot to say a little,' answered Tock."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Milo is a sad, strange boy.

From jumping to the Island of Conclusions to saving Rhyme and Reason, to meeting a watchdog named Tock, to even meeting a dodecahedron and trying to find the highest number ever, Milo comes back a changed boy.This book that has many plays on words is by far my most favorite book.

But, if you like abstract journeys to imaginary places then,The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster is a great reading choice for you!The story begins with Milo, a ten-year-old boy who is extremely bored. He discovers a tollbooth in his room. He drives through it and explores unbelievable lands with strange characters. First, he visits the land of Expectations where he meets the Whether Man. From there, he travels to the Doldrums and meets Tock, who is a loyal watchdog. He then goes to Dictionopolis where he learns that the princesses, Rhyme and Reason, have been captured. From here, Milo begins a quest to free the princesses. On this quest Milo, Tock, and Humbug travel to many strange and dangerous lands where they learn important lessons about life, such as the importance of time and how to use words.Since I am a fan of realistic fiction, this book was not for me! I felt that The Phantom Tollbooth was boring because it was just a story of an unrealistic journey through an imaginary land. The events and lessons were too abstract for me. Even the characters were stale as bread. I was not impressed with Milo because he seemed so unsure of himself, and a bit wimpy. Tock was smart, wise and loyal, but he was also somewhat boring.

And why does the Soundkeeper suddenly decide she likes the Dreadful Dynn when there has been animosity for years between them.This is a book that will need parts explained to young readers.

It was a brown hardcover version that had previously belonged to the Cleveland Library, or so said the stamp on the inside front cover. I leafed through the book and was entranced by Jules Fieffer's illustrations, so I started reading and was hooked.I stayed in my room the rest of the day and late into the night, reading about the adventures of Milo, Tock, and the Humbug. At the tender age of ten, I didn't grasp all the nuance of the book, but at that point, it didn't matter. The central theme of the novel still came through: Life is a wonderful thing, and must be explored. I was a bit sad to finish the book, because I felt as though I had just been on an adventure with some dear friends and now it was over. Norton Juster had shown me so many wonderful things and opened my eyes in so many ways, I wanted to go back and live in his world.I went back to this book again and again over the years, and still do to this day.

Milo was a g boy in the Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster. He thought everything was boring until he found a tollbooth in his room along with a map, a book of rules, precautionary signs and some toll change. He enters a magic world. In his electric car, he drives through the tollbooth and ends up in an odd world, with places like Dictionopolis, the Sea of Knowledge and the Mountains of Ignorance. He meets a watchdog (that is, a dog with a clock on his body) named Tock. Together they journey through a world where different words hold special meaning. They meet creatures like the Spelling Bee and the Humbug, and are imprisoned with a which (not a witch) named Faintly Macabre. They fall into a ravine called Conclusions, reminding them to find details before coming to conclusions. They meet two sisters named Rhyme and Reason. After his adventures, Milo realizes that life is really not dull.This book is filled with humor, wit, and puns. Even as we enjoy the different adventures, we are given the opportunity to ponder about the importance of words and language in our lives in such books as The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupery, younger children my enjoy this story, but older children and even adults can appreciate it at a different level. Norton Juster is a master of language, much like Lewis Carroll, of Alice in Wonderland. The wonderful illustrations help envision the world of magic and creativity where we happily find ourselves.I highly recommend this book to anyone searching experience far from boring.

He encounters a symphony orchestra that \\"plays\\" the sunsets, a Whether Man (who cares more about whether there will be weather than what it will be), an Everpresent Wordsnatcher who lives far away from his homeland of Context, and he sets out on a a quest to restore the princesses of Rhyme and Reason back to the land. Needless to say, when Milo returns home, he has a healthy imgination and a joy to live life!When I read this book as a kid, I was running to my dad every other page so that I could read aloud the parts that made me laugh. It's extremely clever. Even now that I'm in college, this book cracks me up. A lot of it was over my head back in the days when I thought it was the funniest book ever.There's one reason why I think this book very important. Every kid lives with a sense of wonder, but at some point it melts away, usually before the kid is even smart enough to appreciate what they've lost. \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" gave me a huge appreciation of imagination. After I read this book in seventh grade, I remember wishing that I could be a kid forever. I believed that imagination was the most important thing in the world. You know, when you get older, you just don't think that way.Maybe we would if we reread \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" every so often."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I'm not sure why, but most of the kids in my class hated this book. I think that it is pretty good. I'm beginning to believe there is something wrong with my class-they liked The House of Dies Drear more than this book! (Ugh, I personally believe The House of Dies Drear is one of the worst books I have ever read) They also said that The Phantom Tollbooth was boring, but I think it is far from that! My main complaint about this book is that Milo didn't really show much of his personality throughout the story, only in the beginning and end. Basically, the character development was poor. But I guess that's okay, because this book wasn't intended to be very serious or well developed. It just wanted to be fun, and I think it was an enjoyable read.

Milo is a boy who finds no pleasure in his world, and when one day a magical tollbooth appears in his bedroom, he goes through simply because he has nothing else to do. On the other side he finds the vast land known as The Kingdom of Wisdom. On his travels he makes friends in the form of the watchdog Tock (quite literally watchdog, his middle section is an enormous alarm clock) and the beetle-like Hambug. He discovers the metropolises of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, and embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason. I could continue, but the fact that it would spoil the story forbids it. Juster provides us with fantastical explanations for the most everyday things, such as Chroma the great conductor of colors, and the awful nose maker DYNNE. The fantastical illustrations of Jules Feiffer add just the right touch and make the entire book much easier to understand. Juster's writing is simple and readable, although it would be best for a thoughtful reader.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"To me, this book felt like a collection of \\"plays-on-words\\" strung together by a quest plot.Milo travels through the Phantom Tollbooth to another world, where things are very unusual indeed. The lands have fallen to ruin since the departure of Rhyme and Reason. So, Milo (along with his new-found friends) spend the next chapters in an attempt to return Rhyme and Reason to the land.Parts of this book I thought were brilliant! Some of the ways in which Juster wove and rewove words and their meanings was utterly brilliant! I can't imagine even beginning to think of coming up with it all and piecing it all together, much less doing so in a such an effortless and flowing way.The downside to this: that's all most of the book is. So, for the middle of the book I found myself loosing interest, because there's not very much to go on for character development, and the plot is pretty one-dimensional. And, because I wasn't overly invested emotionally, I didn't feel the need to fully explore the various messages Juster might have been trying to convey. In fact, there were times I thought \\"that's fantastic! Genius the way he puts it!\\" And other times I thought, \\"Didn't the author just contradict what he said two pages ago?\\" And while I love what Juster was (I think) attempting to do, I did think that it might be difficult to explain how there's a village full of angry people because sound was taken from them. I like that Juster was trying to point out the good and the bad of sounds, but when there are Deaf people in the world who never have the chance to hear at all, I thought this could have been approached a little better (that's being incredibly picky, but I felt it ought to be mentioned).In all, I kept thinking this was more of an adult book than a kids book, because I don't know that many children will pick up on all the subtle humor and wit, but obviously this book - for that or another reason - identifies with several children over the years... I just can't figure out why, but it's nice that they do.I feel that for a collection of little scenes and plays on words and sayings, Juster did an excellent five star job. But, for a story with well developed characters and a complex plot, the book fell short for me. So, it almost felt like two different books, making the star rating a wee bit hard.All in all, if you're curious, read the first six chapters or so, I think that will give you a good idea of if you like the style and want to keep reading.

After assembling the phantom tollbooth, he enters a magical world where he and his companion Tock, a watch dog that says \\"tick,\\" end up on a quest to bring Rhyme and Reason back to the kingdom of Wisdom. The way things are in this world stuffed to the gills with wordplay, such a feat is easier said than done.

In fairness, the Doldrums, predictably, \\"are where nothing ever happens and nothing ever changes,\\" and the Spelling Bee spells. To share more might spoil the best of the book; plays on words.

Nothing seems worth the effort to him, until one day a mysterious package arrives containing the Phantom Tollbooth (and accessories!). He enters the Kingdom of Wisdom and begins a grand adventure of self-discovery.He escapes from the Doldrums (a most Dangerous place!) and makes it to Dictionopolis, the city from which all letters are grown and words are sold at market. There he learns the Power of Words and meets King Azaz the Unabridged, who sends him on a perilous quest. Together with his friends- Tock, the Watchdog who can only Tick, and the easily swayed, cantankerous Humbug, Milo is given the task of bringing the Princesses Rhyme and Reason back to the Kingdom, thus restoring order to the lands. First however, he must get the Mathmagician , Azaz's brother and Ruler of Digitopolis, to agree upon the quest!Long ago, these brothers quarreled over which was more powerful, words or numbers. Unhappy with the verdict of Rhyme and Reason ,\\"Words and numbers are of equal value, in the cloak of knowledge, one is warp and the other woof...\\" the stubborn Kings banished the Princesses to the Castle in the Air. Which was the last thing they ever agreed upon!They will meet many strange and wonderful characters on their Quest. Faintly Macabre the Which, Alec Bings who sees through things, the Soundkeeper and Chroma the Conductor of Color are just a few who can be found along this long road. They will pass through the strange cities of Illusions and Reality, and even jump to the isle of Conclusions which is easier to get to than it is to leave!Beyond the Mountains of Ignorance, through dangerous wilderness, guarded by strong and horrible creatures like the \\"Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs\\" wait Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason. Will Milo and his friends become the greatest Heroes in the Lands and rescue the wise Princesses? Even though they are certain to get plenty of help in their magical quest and learn many important things along the way, no one ever said it would be easy! One thing IS certain, Milo will never see things in quite the same way again!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My Thoughts ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Comparable to the timeless writings of Roald Dahl, Norton Juster spins a wonderful tale! Do you hear the words \\"I'm bored!\\" from your kids at least once a day? If so, this tale was written especially for them! An imaginative, eye-opening, humorous adventure which encourages children to learn, dream, and appreciate life in all it's splendor.His many amusing and unique characters are fascinating. This fantasy is rich with grandiose verbiage, plays on words, riddles, snippets of poetry, and puns of all sorts. It emphasizes a love of learning in an entertaining fashion and can lead to an string of questions when reading aloud as a bedtime story, so be prepared! The challenging nature of this book makes it unsuitable for most children younger than seven, but even older readers may have to keep a dictionary handy.This book is perhaps best introduced to kids when they are beginning to learn about metaphors, puns, similes, and idioms. Ten appears to be a popular age for Teachers to include this work on their reading list. I can say that it continues to appeal even at older ages, and have even known a few adults who have found the book late in life and loved it. The plot is not a complicated one, but the adventure is quite entertaining and the characters immediately likable.Juster's classic children's fantasy first appeared on shelves in 1961, and has since been performed on stages around the world and transferred to the medium of film. I have only experienced this as a written work, and my favorite copy of this educational fantasy has lovely little whimisical illustrations by Jules Feiffer that really help to flesh out the Wonderland-ish characters. There aren't very many illustrations, but that seems to make those few illustrations really special. At 272 pages, The Phantom Tollbooth is not an especially lengthy read, but certainly not digestable in a single night by young readers. The emphasis on the importance of learning and aware involvement with the world around us are lessons we can carry throughout our lives, and Juster makes it a grand journey! Even though I always preferred Words to Numbers myself, I love that this book illustrates that All forms of Knowledge are worthy of respect. A truly unique adventure, this classic piece of children's literature is a must have for bright booklovers."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

The story is about a boy who finds Life dull and unentertaining, until one day he recieves a mysterious tolbooth that brings him through numerous adventures and discovers many interesting things. The characters and their quirks and strange places Milo visits mirror our own emotions and realities. For example the land called Expectations, where people go before they go anywhere else, and how some people can't leave that place. Or the cities Illusion and Reality... Where it is so easy to see what isn't there then to see what really is. Even though this is considered a child's book, adults can still learn from the simple messages that are written in it. This book shines the light on ourselves and proves that what we once thought impossible, is in fact the opposite."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My older kids have all read the book and my 9-year-old wanted to do a book report on it based on her siblings reviews of it. Unfortunately, she was having trouble sounding out some of the words and it was taking longer than she'd hoped. She had gotten about 2/3 of the way through the book when we got the audio CDs and used them as a read-along. We have several copies of the book, so we all sat down and listened and read along with the book! It was perfect.The audio CDs are unabridged, so it was word for word with the paperback. The narration was great and she was able to hear the words she had struggled with (she listened to the entire thing just to be sure she understood everything she'd read up to that point). She finished the book with just enough time to write a book report (A-) and take the AR test, on which she got 100%. I'm very satisfied with our purchase."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"A very very good book. In the book, everything is basically literal. For example, the dog, shown on the front cover, named Tock, is a literal \\"watch dog\\". A very funny part is where the main characters, Milo and Tock, are in Dictionopolis and they meet the King of Dictionopolis' cabinet. When the Earl (from the Cabinet) said something was \\"as easy as falling off a log\\" he actually fell off a log himself. I think that if he had said \\"easy as pie\\", a pie would have splatted in his face. Ptbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb!!I think it's also very funny when all three, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug, who Milo and Tock met in Dictionopolis, \\"jumped to Conclusions\\", literally. They landed on the island named Conclusions, which was about a mile offshore. They had to swim all the way back through the Sea of Knowledge. This book made me laugh a lot.

Milo learns you should never say life has no meaning. This book is a wonderful book for all children, if able to understand. It has illustrations that help describe the book even more. This book may be harder for younger children, if they read it by them selves. If you read aloud and explain the harder words, then they will love the book. We recommend this book to adults and children. It is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a funny, entertaining, book that makes you think. You can't just skim through it or you won't get it. If this is a gift for a child who can't read you can read it aloud it is just as good.The book's about a boy who thinks everything is boring and unexciting. Then one day he finds a tollbooth in his room. He drives through it in his little car and starts a journey to Dictionapolis. Where he meets king Azaz and gets a mission to rescue to princesses who can fix the problem. He must travel to Digitapolis. He meets many strange characters. The main idea is that but he meets so many people I barley consider that the main idea.I recommend this book because it stretches your brain and you'll never look a anything the same way again."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"If you were a young boy who didn't know what to do with yourself how would your life be? Every time you were some where you wished to be some where else. Then when you are there you long to be back at the other place. Barton Juster explains here in this fantasy novel The Phantom Tollbooth, going through life like this everyday is a very difficult situation, not until you discover an unbelievable adventure.Milo is young boy who doesn't understand the importance of seeking knowledge. He is a lazy and ungrateful child who doesn't seem to be bothered about growing up being stupid. After walking home from school on a dull day, Milo discovers an enormous package in a corner of his room. He tries to think of where it could have come from. He can admit to himself that he has not been outstandingly good, and Christmas is no where near. He opens it, and discovers that it is a path to another world. Milo goes on an adventurous journey and meets hilarious characters such as \\"The Humbug\\" who change his personality. He comes to a town called Dictionopolis where words are the most important thing and play a serious role in life. Milo goes on to meet other funny characters full of humor, as he comes to unheard of places such as \\"The Valley of Sound\\" and many others. He is set out to go on a journey to capture Rhyme and Reason. He has to decide whether to be brave and accomplish the mission with two other friends he had made as he meets evil demons.The Phantom Tollbooth is an excellent book for readers who love fantasy novels. It explains how a boy's personality and point of view changes after he comes back from an adventurous journey of an unknown land. Especially, when he is back in his room and looks at the clock. By his amazement, has only been gone for an hour! It is also full of surprises and making decisions. In the beginning of the book it start out as something people go threw in their everyday life, but ends in another world of mind. I recommend this book to anyone who goes through the same situation. Also for anyone who wants to know how adventures can really change a child's character and point of view."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I've read it just about every year ever since. I've given multitudes away to children of friends, who, after these children had grown, remembered me as the one who gave them the best book they'd ever read.

For example, the characters are very strange, like the Whether (not weather) man, and the little guys that don't do anytyhing all day, whose names I foget. The Lethargics, I think they were called.

His journey through the tollbooth to lands beyond takes him though landscapes tailored to vivid imaginations. There is just enough mystery and suspense interspersed with humor and cleverly veiled educational topics to make this a &quot;Must-read&quot; for anyone. I just convinced my 49-year-old father, who hates to read, to try this one, and he's now read it twice! If you don't have it, get it, and if you haven't read it, don't wait another second! You're really missing out!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I read this for the first time when I was eleven or twelve, and it immediately became my favorite book. The whole experience of it is like no other. THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH is a masterpiece of original thought and brilliantly clever writing, and works equally well as an escape on a rainy day and as something for your brain to chew on when you're stuck in the Doldrums (a feeling our hero Milo knows all too well)."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Childrens books are still some of my favorite, due to my dreams to someday be WRITING childrens books, but they're not something I normally read. Lately I have been reading books from &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events.&quot; Hey...they may not be Dickens or Hugo, but they're so fun to read.Well, anyway, this is one of the first books I read that I really loved. I read it in fifth grade and I remember I was so proud of myself for reading a book that was a sixth grade reading level. I really enjoyed this book as a way to escape from the world around me. I must admit, my life is a very good one, and there are not many unfortunate things in it, but you still need to get away from it all, and I find this book can STILL do that for me, four or five years later. I just want to thank the author, Norton Juster, for a truly unbelievable and well-written novel that kids can escape to and adults can marvel at the beauty and overall simplicity that is The Phantom Tollbooth."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Cute, full of puns and anecdotes. I look forward to sharing it with my daughter, which I believe to be a much more fun way of reading the book as an adult (to share with a child) than as a stand alone. For young (elementary school age) children, easily a 5/5."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Overall, I thought The Phantom Tollbooth was a phenomenal piece of literature. I couldn't agree more with the fact that it won the Newberry Medal. There is text by Norton Juster and illustrations by Jules Feiffer. Its the perfect length, about 250 pages or so. The fictional novel read quickly, especially since it never got dull, with its fun characters and vivid descriptions. In the story, Milo is a young boy, still in grammer school, when he discovers a magical tollbooth, which appears suddenly in his room. His feelings, disposition, and outlook on life are presented quite humorously early in the story, and seem to fit right into the sequence of events that would soon follow. As Milo embarks on his magical journey, the circumstances, from the setting to the characters, are all so far from reality that they make the story all the more interesting, sort of like the icing on the cake. As the story progresses many of life's questions are answered like, &quot;Where does sound come from?&quot; &quot;How are words made?&quot; and the ever famous,&quot; Why is the sky blue?&quot;(The answers are all figments of the author's imagination, however.) Several &quot;what ifs&quot; are also answered. The story also has a great message or theme. I felt that the answers to your problems are in your hands.(Milo was bored so he let his imagination fly and fixed it.) The story's strongest element has to have been it's vivid descriptions and the element that was described the best was the setting. I had no trouble transferring myself from place to place as Milo advanced on his edge of your seat adventure. I pictured the setting quite vividly in my mind for the entire story. What I liked most, however, is that the story was imaginative. It encourages kids to use their imaginations and think creativly. It was easy to get into and enjoy and tough to put down. The only things I didn't like were the pictures(I like to picture the story in my mind in the way that I interpret it). I also didn't like the fact that there were so many characters. That could get confusing. But, again, overall I would recommend The Phantom Tollbooth as a great read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"For all of you who gave a review saying that this book was to hard and confusing to read and for those who said it was for children not teens you are wrong. I loved this book. It was great. As the book progresses the plot thickens. It is a perfect book for anyone, anytime. Trust me. I hope you will decide to buy it because it has a clever plot , witty characters, funny sayings, and lots of puns. Great for kids and adults. If you don't want to buy it at least go to the library and read it. It's worth it!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I was at a bookstore browsing through the children's section when I came upon this title, The Phantom Tollbooth. I had never heard of it before. I read the synopsis on the back, and I thought it was clever so I bought the book. A few chapters into it, I was very pleased with my decision.I can't believe I had no idea that this book even existed. I always complain that there aren't enough fantasy books out there about something OTHER than dragons, wizards, witches, hobbits, and the like. FINALLY I found a book with more originality.Even though this book is totally original, it's more like the two Alice In Wonderland books than any book I've ever seen. I loved the Alice books, so naturally I find myself loving The Phantom Tollbooth as well. The use of puns and satire is extremely witty throughout the whole text, forming such crazy creations as synonym buns and the Horrible Hopping Hindsight creature, that doesn't see where it's jumping to, only where it has jumped from. Living in the Mountains of Ignorance, it never decides where to go, it just decides when it wants to leave from where it is. Genius.I think the only downside to this book is that it peaks too early. It tends to drag in certain places after Milo finishes his meeting with the boy who walks on air. I believe this problem could easily be rectified if the visit to Digitopolis were switched with the visit to Dictionopolis. I love the Dictionopolis part.The illustrations add a lot to the book, even though a book like this doesn't really need illustration. I couldn't help thinking that some of the drawings looked a bit too scratchy, but that's just my own personal taste.Whatever minor downfalls The Phantom Tollbooth has, it remains clear that this is a 5-star book all the way. I recommend it to everybody, regardless of age. It's very interesting and very fun. And to think, I found this treasure just by browsing around in an airport bookstore."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster when I was in sixth grade. It's about a young boy who gets a tollbooth for a present and travels into a mysterious world with senseless acts that have no meaning and things that we would never do. In this world, they have major problems because the two princesses,(Rhyme and Reason) aren't there. The king argues and argues and ARGUES with other people and has conflicts so often because they are not there. It's just a total mess, so he sends Milo and his friends out to find the two. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It's just a one of a kind book with wacky characters and it's funny. It has the wierdest characters I've ever imagined. It has a bee who spells every important word people say, a living clock who doesn't really do anything, demons who disguise themselves as normal people and tell other people to do really wierd things that have no point. There is also a humbug who can get very annoying and won't stop arguing, and a sound doctor who collects sounds and sells them. Basically the book has a whole lot of just all out wierd characters. The only problem with the book is that it had such a predictable ending. I knew the ending after the first 100 pages. I still thought it was a very good book and would recommend it to almost anybody. Join the search!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This book is especially meaningful to those who find life a waste of time. Mr. Norton Juster deserves an applause straight from my heart. I read this book halfway in fifth grade, and it is the first book to entice me to walk into a library, and begin other journeys in the talented hands of hundreds of authors. This little boy is very similar to me, as well as many people, young and old, who find themselves bored with the world. A little boy who mysteriously finds a tollbooth in his room is swept into a journey full of fun and odd surprises: two conflicting royal brothers who fight about words and numbers, The Silent Valley where people protest their rights for the return of sound, a place where people grown down rather than up, and places understandably known as Illusions and Reality. In conclusion Milo finds understanding in King Azaz's words,&quot;...So many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible.&quot; This book will take you right on along with Milo, Tock, and the Humbug and show you what makes this book, and life altogether adventurous and beautiful. Although many stories such as Alice in Wonderland are very similar to The Phantom Tollbooth, nothing else has quenched my thirst. For that reason at 20 years old until I die it is and will be my favorite book...Thank you Mr. Norton Juster."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Milo finds everything in the world dull, boring, and pointless. Suddenly, he receives a tollbooth in the mail, and decides to drive through it using his miniature vehicle. Soon he finds himself in the Lands Beyond...a world where everyday things, such as words, numbers, time, etc. become a big adventure. Milo meets Tock, the &quot;watch dog&quot; and is sent on a quest to save &quot;Rhyme&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;. On the way, he learns how incredibly exciting life is.This is probably one of the strangest books I've read, yet one of the best. It is funny, imaginative and straight to the point- I personally hate to read a bunch of details and descriptions that I don't need to know. It's a cross between fantasy and humour. The setting is not specified; the story could take place anywhere where children go to school.I strongly recommend this book, especially to those who love to read humourous books. It is disappointing that there are no more books for children by the author, Norton Juster, although it might be interesting to read some of his other adult books."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember receiving this book as a gift from my grandmother when I was in third grade. Now I'm in ELEVENTH grade, and it is still my favorite book EVER...and it is a frequent read for me. Every time I read it, I seem to relate to one of the MANY different and well-developed characters: Milo, the boy who desperately looks for something to cure his terrible ennui; Tock, his faithful &quot;watchdog;&quot; the Humbug; the quarrelsome family of Azaz, the Mathemagician, Rhyme, and Reason; Alec; Chroma, the conducter of color; the Soundkeeper; and so many others.The Kingdom of Wisdom in this book takes things that we take for granted in our everyday lives and personifies them, as is the case with Rhyme and Reason, the Isle of Conclusions, and &quot;Point of View.&quot; It also provides slanted and comical views of many clich&eacute;s that we use. For example, when Milo and the others at the &quot;Word Banquet&quot; were forced to &quot;eat their words&quot; and the Demon that makes &quot;mountains out of molehills.&quot;It also offers contrasting points of view on sights and sounds. Alec, the boy who &quot;grows down,&quot; offers Milo many points of view on life by showing him two towns, Illusion and Reality. Illusion is a beautiful town...at first glance. In actuality, the town is invisible, but the people have not realized that. Another example are sounds. Dr. Dischord and the awful DYNNE find pleasure in horrid, loud sounds (like explosions and screams), while the peaceful Soundkeeper basks in the wonders of silence.Overall, this is a book I recommend to anyone, but especially those who are in their younger years and wish to explore the world, but still want to be entertained.Most of all, THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH offers many poignant quotes that really make one think, such as this one by Rhyme:&quot;And remember that many places you would like to see are just off the map and many things you want to know are just out of sight, but someday you'll reach them all, for what you learn today, for no reason at all, will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow.&quot;Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Phantom Tollbooth Written By Norton Juster Reviewed by AdamMilo is a kid with no opinion about anything. He never likes what he is doing, but sees no point in doing anything else. As he says, \\"It seems to me that almost everything is a waste of time. There's nothing for me to do, nowhere I'd care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing.&quot; One day he receives a strange package containing one genuine tollbooth, one set of instructions, and one road map. Expecting this to be just a dumb activity, Milo puts the tollbooth together and drives through it in a small electric car. He travels through a strange land to a city called Dictionopolis, on the way picking up the Watch dog Tock, who has a watch for a body. Once in Dictionopolis, Milo, Tock, and their newfound friend the watchdog and the Humbug are caught up in a quest to save the princesses Rhyme and Reason and restore order to the world. On the way he meets strange people like the Whether Man (&quot;for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be&quot;) and Alec Bings who sees the other side of things and is born in the air and grows down to the ground. Milo and his newfound friends Tock the watchdog and the Humbug are caught up in a quest to save the princesses Rhyme and Reason and restore order to the world.Norton Juster does a great job making The Phantom Tollbooth enjoyable and humorous. He combines clever puns and real pieces of literature and math to make an extremely interesting story.&quot; I read [The Phantom Tollbooth] first when I was 10. I still have the book report I wrote, which began 'This is the best book ever.'&quot; --Anna Quindlen, The New York Times&quot;A classic... Humorous, full of warmth and real invention.&quot; --The New YorkerI rate this book 10/10 stars."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I think it's easy to read a book and enjoy it, recommending it to all your friends and feeling slightly envious that they get to experience the joy of discovery you've already enjoyed. But could you call it your FAVORITE book? The absolute, be-all, end-all, definitive book that you like over anything else you've ever read? That's a lot of pressure. For me, it would be hard enough to select which ten books I would want to have with me on a desert island, but there's one book that would fall at the very top of the list, every time, without hesitation -- The Phantom Tollbooth.The Phantom Tollbooth is one of those books that is ageless and eternal, in that anyone, of any age, at any time, could enjoy this book and its clever play on words. Milo is his own everyman, struggling with that problem we've all experienced -- boredom. &quot;There's nothing to do,&quot; he says at the beginning of the book, and haven't we all been there, children or adults? It's easy to relate to Milo and the rest of the characters he meets along his journey through Wisdom (especially the ever-patient Tock and the ostensibly annoying Humbug), and even if the story begins to pass into the area of being too clever, it's hard not to smile when Milo encounters the Whether Man, meets the DYNNE, jumps to Conclusions, runs afoul of the Demons of Ignorance, or attempts to return the Princesses of Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason to the Kingdom of Wisdom. The allegory runs deep throughout the novel, and teaches as it entertains, but it never quite reaches the point where it becomes preachy. Mr. Juster knows exactly when to draw the line to present his readers with the choice of learning over ignorance, and leaves it to those readers to decide for themselves.This is one of those rare novels that possesses the magic to entertain and teach, and should be required reading for anyone who hasn't read it before. (And maybe even for those who haven't read it since they were children.) Read it, enjoy it, and share it with your friends ... it makes a wonderful story to read aloud."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

He began a journey that he would remember for the rest of his life. The journey was really interesting to me, because I enjoyed the play on words parts and the interesting people that Milo met, such as Dr. Dischord and how weird he was. The reason that I didn't give the book five stars is because when I read the book I got a little confused sometimes."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I love this book !"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This small book was written in 1961 and has become a classic. I had never heard of it however. Maybe that's because it was written for children. The lessons though, can be applied to adults, and, through the years, the book has received accolades from a large variety of people, both young and old.The story centers around a young boy named Milo who is bored with his life. One day, a phantom tollbooth appears in his room. When he goes through the turnstile, he enters another reality. He's suddenly thrust into an &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; existence as he travels through a new and foreign land. There's the world of words in &quot;Dictionopolis&quot; and the world of numbers in &quot;Digitopolis&quot; There's the &quot;Valley of Sound&quot; and the &quot;Forest of Sight&quot; and the &quot;Foothills of Confusion&quot;. Along the way he meets some strange characters as he bravely rises to the task of rescuing &quot;Rhyme and Reason.&quot;By the end of the book, the boy comes home older and wiser. And the reader has had the fun experience of smiling at the writer's cleverness as well as being reminded to appreciate things we take for granted such as our senses of sound and sight. After the first quarter of the book I was bored. However, I am sure I missed a lot of the subtleties, which would become clear if I wanted to read the book again.There are many valuable lessons to learn from this book. And I'm glad I read it. It's probably a great book for a 10-year old. But I just can't recommend it to adults."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I realize that posting a less than glowing review about this book is absolutely not allowed and that the personal attacks from the partakers of the proverbial Kool-aid will most certainly follow. This book was assigned as part of our son's 5th grade GT curriculum. Though I am a child of the 60's and grew up in The Berkshires (where Juster calls home), I had never heard of this book before it was assigned. The class assignments involved reading a couple of chapters at a time, journaling thoughts and questions, creating in depth character analyses, then providing a comprehensive summary. The unit also included class discussion (ad nauseam) regarding all of the aforementioned material. The total precious time now spent on this book has been about a third of the school year. There is a level of irony in this. Now, I realize that I am not prone to silliness, so I have a different perspective than the other 500+ reviewers who have absolutely gushed over this work. I felt no connection with Milo and neither did my son. Joie de vivre and a curious nature have kept me from ever experiencing the boredom felt by the young protagonist. We have nurtured the gifts of imagination, creativity, and self-soothing in our son as well. I can appreciate what Juster was trying to convey: the importance of education, wisdom and understanding. We occasionally even chuckled at some of the lame puns. There are some good topics for brief discussion such as integrity and perseverance. It is a cute book, but try as I might, I just cannot regard it as literary genius (sorry, Norton). In fairness, had we been able to just read the book, roll our eyes, and move on, we may have been able to look upon it more favorably. The fact that it was used as part of a GT curriculum (by a teacher who seemed determined to make this a life-changing event) sucked any semblance of joy out of the experience. If you must, this book might be best enjoyed when shared with a verbally precocious 5 or 6 year old."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I liked Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth because of all the wacky people Milo meets and the wacky places he goes to. The first person you meet is Milo. He is always board and doesn't do anything in the beginning of the story and starts his travel because of a tollbooth that ended up in his room. If you travel deep into The Doldrums with Milo you will meet a watch dog names Tock. This fellow is always worried about people wasting time. Dictionopolis is a city that looks like a book. The buildings are book spines and some people are pages - literally. Somewhere in Dictionopolis you will meet a beetle-like, human-sized bug named The Humbug. This bug is usually wrong and when he is right it is usually a mistake. Once you go through the tollbooth you will be in the Land Of Wisdom. Anything could happen everyday in life so be prepared for everything. Reading The Phantom Tollbooth was like trying to understand an elephant.

It was full of mathematical errors and it seemed like the author wrote some of the events just to fill up space. Those events had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and had practically no effect on the ending. I should have read this when I was 4 or 5 and actually liked this type of literature. Yes there was interesting word play, but it was not enough to make up for the total idiocy of the storyline. I simply CANNOT understand the people who like this book as it is boring and immature.

Well that's the adventure that Milo faces in The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.Milo is a bored child who sees no point in anything he has to do. He is not satisfied with anything.

One day, he comes home from school and finds a package that takes him to a magical new world with monsters, demons, and the ability to buy and eat words. And on top of all that, Milo has to rescue the two princesses: Rhyme and Reason who will restore order to the kingdom.The Phantom Tollbooth is not a very in depth book. Its characters don't really make you think. There were a few good lessons you could learn but that doesn't make up for the rest of the book. At first, Milo is a person who can't see the point in anything and acts like he doesn't care about anything but he goes through a great change.I didn't like this book because it was way too fanciful. The things they talked about were not things you would do in reality like, about the stock market of buying words is going up.

He was funny, touching, affecting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The same may be said of this narration. His voice so easily becomes that of a small boy as well as the voices of the many characters met on a fantastic adventure. Listen as young Milo discovers a strange tollbooth in his bedroom. Then, since the rather bored youngster has nothing better to do he gets into his toy car and drives through the booth.What does he find? An absolutely amazing place, Dictionopolis, chock full of words and inhabited by unusual characters from Tock, a watchdog, to Humbug, an insect.As youngsters accompany Milo on this journey they will not only discover the meaning of words but much to ponder, such as \\"The way you see things depends a great deal on where you look at them from, \\" Or, they might consider this: \\"'I never knew words could be so confusing,\\" Milo said to Tock as he bent down to scratch the dog's ear.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy novel written by Norton Juster and Illustrated by Jules Feiffer. The story is about a bored child named Milo, who travels to the fantastical Kingdom of Wisdom, where he makes friends, goes on quests, and learns valuable life lessons.The moral of the story is overt: Milo goes in apathetic toward everything and gradually acquires a healthy appreciation for reading, math, thinking, and learning in general. There are obvious parallels between The Phantom Tollbooth and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and Tollbooth is, in a way, a Pilgrim's Progress for thought and learning.Juster's story is based on wordplay, and is heavily pun-driven. But Juster's writing is so clever that this nearly always works without becoming tiresome, and the book is so humorous and entertaining that even adults should not get bored.Feiffer's illustrations are sloppy-looking pen scratchings. They aren't great, but they get the job done. Ultimately, though, in the almost fifty years since The Phantom Tollbooth was published, Fieffer's art has been indelibly intertwined with what this book is. In other words, The Phantom Tollbooth is not a book that could ever be re-released with a different set of illustrations.The Phantom Tollbooth is a classic of children's literature, a book that has held up well over time, and one that can be enjoyed by adults as well."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I have never read or imagined a more moving book than \`The Phantom Tollbooth' in all of my years, literally to tears of pure astonished and thought-provoked amazement and wonder! I picked this book up from where it sat, among a collection of books that I had already read, some I had not even touched, and others I hadn't seen in years in preparation for a garage sale for my church. Sorting through the books, I perhaps wantonly decided which one's I had grown out of between which ones I still liked, trying to decide whether I like them enough to possibly re-read or not when I happened upon the plain-looking blue covered Phantom Tollbooth.I had never read it before, and as it hovered before the box of books to be sold for anywhere between fifty cents to two dollars, I thought it would be shame to have not read it. After all, I recalled, during Quiz Bowl practices many of the literary questions often referred to this very book. I had heard that it was one of those classic books of all times that every one is supposed to have read during their lifetime... The kind that has that silver of gold medal stamp on them for an out-standing novel award, though the plain cover I held between my hands was merely that of a boy and a dog with a watch for a belly, did not.And so I turned to the first page, and was instantly and immediately sucked into Milo's adventure, unprepared for the moving of my heart so. Opening my eyes to so many things that I had missed, realizations of my own heart and mind, of life...Shocked does not even begin to describe it. With such a simple logic, humor, and words Norton Juster has taught me more than most of my High School teachers (although I think, now that I can look back, many have been telling me these same things in different ways). But as a fellow hopeful future writer of novels, the format of a book that shared a love of knowledge and words and imagination in such a new, timelessly profound way had me riveted to each turning page and ink pressed word... WOW...Wow...wow I found myself breathless and watery eyed by the time I had finished... Completely forgetting about all the other books I still had to sort between selling or keeping or re-reading...compelled to write about this \\"Novel Renaissance\\" as I realize how much more of life I have yet to be awakened to.

And not because you have to read it for some English teacher or because your parents say you should, not because it has all this literary acclaim or a shiny silver or gold circle plastered on the cover. Not even because it has a strange cover (I know, I really must stop judging books by their covers...they tend to become offended with me...)But because the more you look at that boy on the cover and the strange dog with a watch for a belly you simply have to wonder, I wonder what that's all about... And then immediately thinking those very words, please open to the first page of that very first chapter and begin with those gripping fish-hook words of \\"There was once a boy named Milo...\\"Wow...simply wow..."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

My husband and I are planning to have children soon, and I will definitely share this book with them. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Perfect book to use to enrich Language Arts lessons."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I was surprised that more reviewers didn't pick up on the fact that the kingdoms were arguing over a trivial matter because Rhyme and Reason were no longer part of everyday life, and that many other things had gotten out of control for the same reason. In a world where the decisions being made and the wars being waged seem to make little sense, I have always thought that this book was imparting a very profound message about the need for society to start using some common sense in everyday matters (not jumping to conclusions, etc) I first read this book in high school in a children's literature class, 30+ years ago. I love the wordplay and the messages it imparts."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I would only recommend this book to a person that has a good sense of humor and is ready for something new. The protagonist at the beginning of the book is quite bored and tired of his life. Life-changing events make Milo(the protagonist) see what is so great about his life. Overall, this book was a good\\"go to bed book,\\" but was much more satisfying than expected."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My fellow students: Have you ever wanted to read a book all about adventures but still was school related? Well, The Phantom Tollbooth, written by Norton Juster is just that! This is also a fantastic book for all ages.The Phantom Tollbooth takes place in a fantastic dream world called \\"The Lands Beyond\\". There all kinds of characters inhabit the land. Milo, the main character, is a bored child who always looks at things in a negative way. This is until he finds a mysterious box in his room one day. Inside he finds a Tollbooth and with it Milo enters \\"The Lands Beyond\\" and changes his attitude about life forever. During his travels, he finds that he has to rescue two princesses, named Rhyme and Reason. These keep order in the Land but are locked away in a castle. Not only does he mange to rescue them, but along the way he learns many lessons. These include using his time wisely, appreciating what he has in life, and choosing his words carefully. By the end of the book, Milo is a positive and happy person.This book was fantastic because it is not a common book. Not only because of the adventures it takes the reader on, but because of the lessons and morals learned. I recommend this book because it is the true definition of a great book."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"A wonderfully charming and entertaining book, which I credit with instilling me with a lifelong love for reading. From a child's point of view, it's a whimsical fairy-tale about a young boy's adventures in a magical land; from an adult's point of view, it is a well-crafted allegorical Bildungsroman about the journey from Ignorance to Knowledge. Highly recommended for anyone aged ten to ten thousand."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Looking for inspiration in your life? A carpe diem message? Hope? Lost dreams? Then this is the book for you. I especially appreciated Juster's fabulous play on language, and the awesome sense of adventure. My only gripe is that I wish the supporting characters of Tock and especially the Humbug had been developed more."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I found the book on a friend's bookshelf on the wettest of British summer afternoons about 10 years ago. I was early twenties and neither the name of the book nor the author rang any bells, but the title intrigued me so I read on. Early on in the book there is a description of Milo's sigh which causes a sparrow to rush home to be with its family.... I was utterly hooked.I would urge anyone who didn't like this book if they read it when they were young to really give it a go later in life. There's something about the inexorable passage of time which heightens ones senses to descriptions of the importance of making the most of life and living the 'Carpe Diem' anthem. I can understand how some folk might feel a little patroised by some of the seemingly over-simplistic specific imagery like numbers vs words, but the real importance lies in the ideas of balance, and probably the most significant figures of the piece really are the Princesses themselves, Rhyme &amp; Reason.Without the warmth of art and the focus of fact, life becomes less clear, and much colder. The creeping menace of some of the characters Milo meets in the mountains towards the end of the book become so much more malevolent and chilling when one has spent an entire day on the telephone sorting out a 'five minute job' and there went a day that could have been spent painting, songwriting, meeting someone new ANYTHING but answering the phone!!Read the book when you are a little older - I promise you, you will never touch another Stephen King again...the truth is much scarier!Thanks for reading.

I myself have never read the book, but my son really enjoyed it. I was concerned that the frequent use of word play would be confusing, but it proved to be good conversation starters for discussing the book. Some vocabulary is outdated, but for 50 year old classic children's literature, the fantasy of the story far outweighs the few words that are now obsolete. We chose this book because my son needed harder reading than Magic Treehouse (which he still loves, but finishes a book within an hour) - the chapters are good length and he still felt as though he was accomplishing the book, because it moved along quickly. I highly recommend the book for young readers who enjoy reading and are slightly more advanced in their reading skills and thought processes."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

The main charater's personlity is similar to me, but have some differences. The book started with describes Milo hate school and hate doing things everyday same. He wondered waht's the use of school. Then he started to travel to see fresh things, but it improved his view of things. When I was in sad mood, I took a walk to the mountain to make my mind stronger when standing on the peak of the mountain. Everything is in my sight.

Until one day he receives a package that turns out to be a tollbooth, and he travels through the Phantom Tollbooth to another world. He meets many new friends here such as Tock, Spelling Bee, the Humbug, etc. However, everything is very unusual indeed. When the kings were abandoned Rhyme and Reason, the lands have fallen to ruin. The kings give a task to Milo to find Rhyme and Reason to return back in the land. The Humbug and Tock help Milo successfully reach the castle in the air, and to return the land. After the journey, Milo realizes that he has many things to do in his life. This is a wonderful and interesting book because the characters are so funny. This book perfectly matches me because I am an ESl student. Moreover, I understand the plot when I read this book. As far as I know, learning is a funny thing in the life.

She loves to read, and this was perfect for her.I wish this book were more popular, because it is just as good as many of the more well-known classics.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"i love this book even thow i did not read it one/book my teacher read it to me and class mates"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I reread this after about 35 years, and was surprised by how much I remembered. I may have appreciated it more this time. The book is a paean to the inherent joy of the English language, with its puns, plays on words, and double meanings. The plot is secondary, and the characters mainly exist to make particular points. Tock and the Humbug are little more than observers, and Milo isn't much better - he mainly exists as the reader's portal into the world. It would not have worked unless the main character came from outside Juster's odd creation.The astonishing drawings by Jules Feiffer (infinitely more talented than the author) bring the book to life, and in many instances are masterpieces of the cartoonist's art. I later enjoyed Feiffer's strip in the L.A. Times for many years without making the connection.The 50th anniversary edition includes \\"celebrations\\" of The Phantom Tollbooth, consisting primarily of praise by other writers and educators. The only one that affected me was by Cambridge professor Maria Nikolajeva, who drew comparisons between the absurdities of the book and her childhood in Communist Russia: \\"Imagine a country far away, from which Rhyme and Reason have been banished. Where politicians repeat each other's words, using synonyms to disguise their true meaning. Where words are sold and bought in a market, and where officials decide which words are to say and which ones not to say...\\" She continues in this vein, and the correspondences are chilling. She does admit that Juster probably didn't have the Soviet Union in mind when he wrote \\"The Phantom Tollbooth,\\" but it will be impossible for me to see the book in any other way again. Nikolajeva goes on to observe that children's literature is subversive, and truly dangerous, because dictators usually ignore it. Someone was able to smuggle \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" into Russia because \\"it was, after all, just a 'kiddie' book.\\"Leopold Bloom \\"You keep on using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\\""},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Excellent reading for your boys...

Thus would be the reaction of the cabinet of King Azaz the Unabridged of the Kingdom of Dictionopolis. In The Phantom Tollbooth, we find the meaning of such statements as \\"It goes without saying\\", and \\"Half-baked ideas\\". We learn what might be the best kind of sentence you can get from a police officer. We are taught the rules of The Doldrums: one being that you're only allowed to smile slightly every other Thursday. And perhaps most importantly, we find out that you really do have to eat your words--so be careful what you say! The characters are fantastic! There's a \`Watch' Dog, a \`Which', \`Lethargians', a Senses Taker, and many more! Milo, our \`hero', takes a ride through this strange land and tries to save Rhyme and Reason (did you know they were people?) from the Castle in the Air (don't we all have one of those?). Fun for all ages, although you may not want to read this at bedtime, as I did, as it made us giggle more than yawn!

Somehow, every prospect in front of him is just another source of boredom. Then, a mysterious package arrives, a build-it-yourself tollbooth. The directions say, \\"... if not perfectly satisfied, your wasted time will be refunded.\\" Since driving his battery-powered car through the toolbooth doesn't seem much worse than anything else he can think of, he does ---- And ends up in a strange and wonderful land. His quest is to restore the princess sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to their countries. Getting there is the challenge. He is accompanied by a Watchdog, one who ticks and is guaranteed to be set to the right time. He meets outlandish characters of all sorts. That includes the ministers of Dictionopolis, the Mathemagician, demons, hoarders of sound, and lots of others. He is, of course successful in the end.His real success, after all these incredible adventures, is a regained interest in the world around him - a remarkable place, for anyone with the eyes to see. The moral of the story seems to be \\"Boredom is self-inflicted. Feel free to stop any time.\\"If you have an allergy to bad puns, you're likely to break out in hives within the first few pages. The book is sparsely illustrated, but in a style I like. Jules Feiffer's loose pen-drawings are as much a part of this book as Tenniel's engravings are part of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Again, this may not suit all tastes, but should be fine for any kid old enough to read the book on their own.For some, this is a children's classic of the first order. I came to it later in life, so it lacks that sentimental specialness for me. Still, I like it for itself, and I hope that the gameboy generation likes it as much as my generation did.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

This tollbooth could take him to the imaginary land of Ditionopolis and Digitopolis. So Milo decided to take an exhilarating journey to this supernatural territory.Once Milo got to Dictionopolis, he found how exciting words and letters could truly be. Milo soon met the King of Dictionopolis and he told him about the history of their unusual land. The King explained to him that the two wise princesses, Rhyme and Reason, helped bring peace to the nation. However, the King of Dictionopolis and the King of Digitopolis fought constantly over if words were better than numbers or that numbers were better than words. The noble princesses replied that words and numbers were both equal. Outraged by this answer both Kings banished the two princesses. After hearing this, Milo decided to take an adventure to rescue the missing princesses. First, Milo had to get permission from the King of Digitopolis. So with the help of a loyal dog named Tock and a fearful insect named Humbug, they started off to Digitopolis.Along the way, some strange creatures showed the significance of learning to Milo and his friends. He found how riveting and essential learning is. Once they reached Digitopolis they immediately came to the King. He was very kind and explained to Milo that without numbers, our world would not function properly. Then, the King gave him his consent to rescue the princesses but warned him that it wouldn't be easy.However, Milo, Tock, and Humbug courageously entered into the dark mountains where the demons dwelled and continued to search for Rhyme and Reason. As soon as they entered these dangerous hills, the demons were following them through every mountain and trail. They reached the flight of stairs where the princesses' room was at the top. As soon as they found them, the room started to float up into the sky. Tock, who could fly, took them down to the ground and they all instantly started to run out of the mountains. The demons were close behind but they all made it to Digitopolis where they were all given a hero's welcome.This book is an excellent example of living life at your fullest. Milo thought the world was dull and dreary, but he learns that our world is not at all like that. He was finally able to understand that there is so much to do and so much to see. His journey opened his eyes to observe that anything is possible. Milo met some strange creatures, but they allowed him to look at the world differently. Both Kings taught him the importance of word and numbers. Dr. Dischord and the old Soundkeeper showed him the value of sound. Chroma illustrated the brilliance of music and color. The intelligent princesses Rhyme and Reason showed him that we can and should learn from our past mistakes. Because of this journey, Milo is now stimulated to learn everything about everything.This is a novel that contains an outstanding plot along with an important theme. I learned how the value of education should be one of the most important substances in your life."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"In the Phantom Tollbooth Milo, the protagonist, is continuously bored with everything he does. Milo admits with truthful lament that, \\"When he is in school he longs to be out, and when he is out he longs to be in.\\" When a mysterious tollbooth appears in his room he has nothing better to do so he joins in with the game. A game turns into reality when Milo goes on a magnificent journey. He is sent on this journey to save the Princesses Rhyme and Reason. He starts out with meeting a strange character who is the Whether man. With Milo confused he moves on with his journey. To his disappointment, he gets stuck in many obstacles. Along the way he encounters Tock a dog who is always on the go making sure no one is wasting time. Tock assists him on his journey and he sure is a fabulous aid. He teaches Milo many lessons that Milo will hold with him forever. Even though Milo goes on one life-size adventure he really is experiencing many. On his way to save the princesses, he catches sight of many creatures trying to delay him. He happens to use his brain, Tock, and a little help from some tools to move on and not get confused or delayed. With lessons to learn, Milo is sure to learn many. When Milo accouters many odd characters, he realizes that there is much more to life. Milo changes into a sweet boy who appreciates anything and everything. He will now learn, understand, and appreciate better. So will you.The Phantom Tollbooth is a clever book because the author, Norton Juster, shows another world of understandable life lessons to enchant the readers. The book is a pleasure to read. It is no bore especially with all the excitement on Milo's journey. The thrill of the people and places is so astonishing and creative you have to read it to believe it. The adventure grants Milo an enhanced life. The author uses word play to assemble an even more imaginative book. Another grand up to this book is that it interests all readers children or not.Many themes emerge on Milo's journey. One theme is to appreciate nature and the world around you. Milo also learns to see different points of view. Another theme is to use your words carefully. Yet an additional message the author provides is not to waste time. Milo also learns to listen and be attentive. Another theme is the importance of learning to discover valuable secrets in life and extend your knowledge. The book includes many more lessons in a creative style. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"When I was a child, reading this book opened an entirely new world of literature to me. Books no longer had to be straight forward tales of the Berenstein Bears Having a Fight. No, stories could be preposterous (not that talking bears aren't), mysterious, and something I would later be able to put a name to--allegorical. The Phantom Tollbooth opens the mind to things both said and unsaid, real and fanciful.Milo's adventures through the Doldrums (where we all certainly have passed before), the Sea of Knowledge, Dictionopolis, and the Mountains of Ignorance lead him to meet such amazing (and strangley familiar) characters as Tock the Dog, the officious Short Shrift, the quack Humbug, and Princesses Rhyme and Reason. Along the way, he not only learns an overall lesson about the value of education, but through each particular adventure gains an understanding of just how these subjects work (if not in a practical, then certainly in a beautifully abstract sense).I won't prattle on about the eductational value of such a book, because I believe I can stand it's own in that regard. Whether you're looking to introduce someone young (or old) to a new way of thinking about life, desiring an meaningful modern-day fable, or are just wanting a great fairy tale/adventure, The Phantom Tollbooth is the book for you want."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I will tell you why this is the best book ever made. It is a cross between &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;. The land behind the Phantom Tollbooth is the best land ever! In dictionopolis, they sell letters to eat! Tock, the &quot;watchdog&quot; is a good add to the story. Soon,Tock,Milo, and the new member, the Humbug, travel to rescue the princess' Rhyme and Reason and to end the fight between King Azaz's Dictionopolis, and Digitopolis of numbers. They meet everyone, like Professor Dischord who makes sounds, Chromo who orchestras the colors of the world, the dodecahedron, who has twelve faces for each expression(!)and Alec Bing who grows from the air down(!)(Wow, two of those ! in one sentence). Here is some wonderful dialogue I have chosen.Letter man: Take the Z, for instance-very dry and sawdusty. And the X? Why, it tastes like a trunkful of stale air. That's why people hardly ever use them.Alec Bing: For instance, from here that looks like a bucket of water, but from an ant's point of view it's a vast ocean, from an elephant's just a cool drink, and to a fish, of course, it's home.Milo(after trying to go on the road to Infinity): I should have known it. This is just like the line that goes on forever, and I'll never get there.The book might have been even beter if the Spelling Bee had gone with them, instead of the much less likable Humbug. Then again, if he'd gone, it would be annoying for him to always spell things all the time. T-i-m-e. My favorite part is the climax with all the demons. This is where the &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; stuff comes. For example, the faceless Terrible Trivum is a way of poking fun at people who do useless things. The other demons, like the Wordsnatcher and the Gelationous Giant are wonderful too. PLEASE, READ THIS BOOK!!! It is the most imaginitive book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read the Phantom Tollbooth when I was 12 years old.

I am 19 now, and i have read all the fantasy books prescribed (Tolkien, Dahl, Rawlings) and have listened to everyone sing their infinite praise; however, when i debate over the best fantasy book, i can decide on none other than The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster brings characters of such important and amusing nature to life and intertwines them in a land so creatively manifested as to take the reader away into his new, amazing world. Parents, please get your kids this book: it is one of the reasons i continue to be such an avid reader today.

It is great for people who like fictional books, and for people who have a lot of imagination. If you think everyday life is boring, definately read this book! It will change your whole perspective. I read this book with my 6th grade class and I think I speak for almost everyone in that class when I say I think it is a wonderful book. The way Norton Juster describes everything is in great detail, and very true. I think the things he says are the truth in an exaggerated way. He knows what problems this world has, and states them in a very complex way. I think this book is his way of saying, &quot;This world has problems that we don't like to admit.&quot; It may be classified as a fictional book, but really it speaks the truth.

It's fun, interesting, and really makes one think about life and what it's worth. It's a great story to share with others and hopefully one day I will get the chance to read it to a child and share with them this story that combines a child's imagination and an adult's artful mind.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The first time I read this book when I was a kid, I found it to be a very mysterious and strange world. The characters did strange and crazy things and everything in the book seemed amazingly unique. My imagination received a good exercise and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could say I almost liked it for it's mystery and what I didn't quite get, as much as I liked it for what made sense to me.After having reread this book a few times, and being somewhat older now than when I first read it, the actions, characters, and plot, all make sense in a very metaphorical and allegorical way. Almost everything that happens means something else or reflects on something in the real world, and often have an underlying message that all would be wise to heed. From the beginning of the book we start in the land of expectations and subsequently leave it as the book progresses. When one jumps to conclusions, one literally flies to an island named conclusions and the only way to get back is a long and arduous swim through the sea of knowledge, but thats okay because rarely does anyone get wet. Places similar to these are spread throughout the novel and pretty much every character can be seen as a representation of something here in our world.Besides what I have already described, the book is incredibly funny for people who can spot the word play, and provides an overall positive and unique outlook on life. I recommend this book to anyone and would encourage you to reread every year at least and you will find your understanding of what is going on and why changes every time."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This is a great book for an adult who likes the idea of reading to kids, but finds the average kids' book vapid or badly written. As morals go,it's hard to object to the ones here: Wisdom requires Rhyme and Reason, as well as words and numbers. Words and numbers are both valuable. Life is full of interesting things if you keep your eyes open. There are a lot of ways to get sidetracked into a life that is neither useful nor rewarding. Even bright people can be small-minded. You can sometimes do the impossible, if you don't know that it is impossible beforehand.The amazing thing is that the book is light and sparklingly verbally and conceptually playful, despite having these lessons tucked into it. I read it again last night, and chuckled aloud, yet again.If you don't have a kid, buy a copy for yourself. Or for someone else's kid.

Open your minds, and suspend your disbelief. Obviously, a child wouldn't just drive through a tollbooth he found in his room. In fact, he wouldn't find a tollbooth in his room at all. If you're looking for 100% realism, then you need to separate yourself from pretty much every piece of fiction ever made, because almost every one takes liberties with human nature and reality. But if you're willing to broaden your horizons and accept and analyze what's written, then you're guaranteed to find one of the most clever, original, and creative pieces of fiction ever written."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I overlooked or simply did not understand so may of the references when I was younger. I was unaware of how applicable the life lessons presented throughout the book truly are. Encountering, among others, the overbearing know-it-all, the Gorgons of hate and malice and the threadbare excuse in his quest to rescue rhyme and reason, Milo learns countless lessons along the way. Most importantly, Milo recognizes that he doesn't have to imagine in order to have fun; life itself holds some prety exciting adventures. I'm as guilty of anyone of living vicariously through my books. I oftentimes am as content to live out the dreams of Anna Karenina or even Bridget Jones as I am to do anything with my own. Maybe rereading Phantom Tollbooth will encourage me to follow my own dreams, and I hope it encourages others to do so as well."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Unfortunatly, Milo went to so many countries I got a little bored with his quest and was finally dragging through it. However, this is covered up by how well the book is written and is a great tale that is well worth reading although you may get a little bored."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"After hearing about this fabulous little book for years, I finally succumbed and read it last week. What a treasure trove of wordplay, puns, interesting characters, and exciting adventures. Poor bored little Milo, though just a boy, could be any of us, old or young or somewhere in-between, who sometimes feel a bit jaded or disgruntled with life. After he steps into a magic tollbooth that has mysteriously appeared in his bedroom, he enters land after land with fascinating creatures such as King Azaz, Tock the dog, and Humbug the bee. On his adventures, Milo encounters half-baked ideas (the earth is flat), a thin/fat/tall/short man, and a city in which people no longer even notice their surroundings.Woven within the many situations and scenes, Norton Juster skillfully manages to insert several life lessons: (1) Don't give up despite the obstacles and the naysayers in your life, (2)each day possesses beauty and wonder if you pause to notice it, and (3)there's magic within the pages of a book. There's much to delight and entertain readers from 6 to 96 (and beyond if they can still see to read!). In fact, although the book is primarily intended for children, I think adults with their \\"wisdom\\" accumlated from experiences and plain old living can better appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster wrote the exiting book The Phantom Tollbooth. The book is about a silent boy named Milo who is bored with life. He finds a mysterious box and assembles the contents: a miniature tollbooth with a great adventure inside.Milo drives his toy car through the tollbooth into a fantasy world. As he travels through this world he meets many strange creatures. Many of the creatures he meets become helpful friends. As he quickly travels through the land he learns about two princesses, Rhyme and Reason, who are banished to the Castle in the Air. He decides to go save them. Driving across the land he learns many lessons that will help him become a better person.The author uses comedy and figures of speech to keep the story interesting. To follow Milo's adventure in the new land a reader would need alot of brains to understand everything. The adventure is constantly changing. Milo learns to be courageous in multiple situations. Even though the story is suspenseful, the ending can be predicted.The book has multiple messages. One of the messages that stands out is to keep on going no matter what the obstacles. Many times Milo and his friends are tempted to just give up, like when they were trapped on the Island of Conclusions. But instead of giving up, they push on and never give up which helps them accomplish to their goal of freeing Rhyme and Reason. Often it seems that Milo will be defeated. The reader has to keep reading to find out what eventually happens to Milo. Some times it is hard to get the point, I found that the PACES PAideia study guide helped me to see the message clearer.It is very important to keep your eye on the goal, especially today. This book is definitely worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Phantom Tollbooth is a great book.

I finally heard of it and subsequently read it for the first time at the age of twenty.I was amazed. Generally, I find the simplicity of vocabulary in most children's chapter books waters down the power of the narrative and drains detail from the accompanying descriptions. The Phantom Tollbooth, with its lighthearted handling of subject matter, avoids this by substituting comedy for drama. Don't be deceived: this is no slapstick tribute to bathroom humor masquerading as children's literature. The Phantom Tollbooth paints a fantastic world of fantasy and word play, weaving homonyms and mathematical brain busters into a vibrant tapestry of allegory. It doesn't deal with life's \\"deeper issues,\\" but brings readers on a comical exploration of learning's importance without a trace of preachiness. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Phantom TollboothNorton JustinSeptember 20, 2002The Phantom Tollbooth is a great book by Norton Justin. In it Milo, a boy who doesn't appreciate life and does absolutely nothing, gets a box with a strange letter on it. Inside he finds a tollbooth which will take him to a new world and change his life forever. He goes on many adventures in the new world, and meets many friends. He meets a watchdog named Tock who is a dog with a body of a clock and only goes tick, tick, and tick. Milo also meets Humbug a coward who nobody likes. Humbug was ordered by the king of Dictionopolis to help Milo on his journey. The author teaches you various lessons in humorous ways like to look in different perspectives.One of my favorite events is when Milo meets the Sound Keeper who prevents sound from entering a valley. The people of the valley needed one sound to load their cannon with. Milo goes into the fort to retrieve a sound but almost fails. He had an idea to say a word and trap it in his mouth. It worked, and thanks to Milo they destroyed the fort. Milo is my favorite character because he is a lot like me. He is never does anything and gets bored all the time. My favorite passage in this book is, \\"To an ant I look like a giant and to a giant I look like a midget it all depends on your perspective.\\" I think everyone should look at things from a different perspective.This is a great book and I think it teaches some valuable lessons. If you like adventures you would love this book because Milo goes on a long journey and under goes many tasks. Also if you like fantasies I would recommend this book because Milo travels in a world called the Land of Expectations where nothing is the same as real life. One example is letters grow on trees. Also numbers are dug up from mines. Everybody should read this book because the lesson I learned in this book made me a better person."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"When I first started reading the Phantom Tollbooth, I quickly got bored and disliked it. The main character is Milo, a boy who thinks everything is boring, and he isn't very fun. But once he enters the magical tollbooth mysteriously found in his room, the book quickly turns from drool to cool.Milo is soon faced with a decision; go through many dangers and conflicts to rescue two princesses, or to just not worry about it. Milo chooses to try and rescue them from the Castle in the Air. He and his friends, Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug, must be smart, quick, and brave in order to rescue Rhyme and Reason, the princesses, and to get past the dangers.I recommend the Phantom Tollbooth because it has an interesting plot and characters. The main character travels over the fantasy land, including Dictionopolis, Digitopolis, Expectations, the Doldrums, and many more places. The main character, Milo, also develops from a kid who can't find anything to do to a kid who wants to do everything. Phantom Tollbooth is a good read, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

As they venture on to meet Rhyme and Reason, they complete some very invigorating and hard tasks that stir up the story a bit.This book is a book that I couldn't set down, and I had to keep on reading it, for it is an adventure one after the other. The way that Norton Juster sets the plot, and makes everything so literal as it would seem, its one of the best books I've ever read. For instance, he used a watch dog that was half watch.

That's exactly what Milo did in Norton Juster's book The Phantom Tollbooth.Milo is an 11 year old boy who is very bored with his life. Milo dosen't think about things seriously. For example, if there is a problem Milo dosen't try to think of a solution. Milo didn't realize how many different ways he could use words. When a tollbooth magically appears in his room, he decides to take a journey. Milo thinks that it's going to be a boring trip. He soon realizes his trip is anything but boring. On his trip Milo meets some very interisting characters. Tock is a big dog who has a built in pocket watch in his side. Tock is a watch dog. His job is to make sure that nobody wastes time. Tock becomes best friends with Milo through out the book. Milo visits many different town's. His mission is to rescue the Princesses Rhyme and Reason. Milo becomes a much smarter person after his trip.The author, Norton Juster, adds a lot of hilarious words to the story. Juster will have you laughing out loud as you get a mental picture of all the characters and hear what job each character has. The book is a fantasy and it is a lot of fun to read.

Well, my parents had put the old B&W TV down there and I discovered Godzilla, The Blob, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Invasion Of The Body Snatcher, and War Of The Worlds. Milo is a lot luckier. He gets a car and a tollbooth. And from there he starts on an amazing adventure full of starnge creatures, stranger people, and the strangest lands - all of which is wrapped in puns and just enough reality to make you wish you could go along. We got this for our kids and it became an instant favorite for bedtime reading. And I confess to having read ahead after lights out to see what came next. This is suggested for ages 9 to 12. Our youngest was totally engrossed in the story at 5, even if she didn't get all the puns. So buy this book and find a young person to read it with, if you need an excuse.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This story takes place in the month of February in an imaginary place in the day time and at night, this setting is important because it was during Milos time, and because that was where most of the events that happed in the story.This look is mostly about a kid named Milo who was always complain that it seems to him that almost everything is a waste of time, and was always regarded the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all. He was also saying that he didn't know what to do with himself not just sometimes, but always. There is another main character named Tock and he always hanged around with Milo, and Tock was a dog who had a clock stuck to him. Then one time Milo bought something, and then he did something weird and then he was transported to an imaginary world and had many adventures.In my opinion this is kind of an awesome book.

I read it in middle age: apparently way too late.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"CuriosityA Book Review Of,The Phantom TollboothThe Phantom Tollbooth is about a boy named Milo in 1961, who was never interested in anything. One day he came home, and found a tollbooth in his room. Curious, he looked around, and found a note that told him how to go into the tollbooth. Pretty soon he found himself inside the tollbooth, in the middle of nowhere.Moving on, he found himself in different places, with problems that had to be solved. Then he found a place that was called dictionopolis that needed Milo to do the impossible, rescue Rhyme and Reason, from the evil mountains of ignorance. Going to rescue them was the hardest part of his journey, and when he did, he saved a town in The Phantom Tollbooth, and got a day named after him.Finally he went back home, and realized that what he had thought was weeks, turned out to be only one hour, out of the tollbooth. Now his life has changed, and it is far from boring. The next day he goes to school, and when he comes home, he sees that the tollbooth is gone.ReviewThe end of this book was not the best, because it ended suddenly, but it has interesting adventures. I give it 2 stars."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I think the buildup that I got for this book was too high to allow me to enjoy it fully. Had I not read the voluminous streams of unabashed praise from r.a.b.bers (that is the rabble that inhabits rec.arts.books) as well as recommendations from my First Impressions subscribers, I might have been pleasantly surprised by this book. As it was, I read it with an uncommonly sharp critical eye, thinking \\"it can't be that good,\\" and unfortunately the book wasn't able to overcome my, admitedly, unreasonable bias.Milo is just your average kid that receives a magic tollbooth in the mail and then proceeds to discover how to view the world differently by saving a magic kingdom. Hmmm, a few shades of Narnia? Yes, but no. Juster loves wordplay, and, while I admit some of it is incredibly clever, he tends to sacrifice story for puns. The disjointed movement between \\"scenes\\" reminded me of another clever book of wordplay, Silverlock (in which the wordplay is allusions rather than puns), in that Juster moves the characters to different realms solely to pun more rather than a smooth movement of characters to their goal. The book becomes almost dull in the areas between encounters, and definitely feels segmented.But, to return to my beginning, I'm probably being unfair. I cannot say that The Phantom Tollbooth isn't clever, and some of the bits are simply wonderful, like the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping). I would have thought the wordplay would be too esoteric for kids, but given this book's popularity, I think I'm selling youth short.If you haven't read this, you probably should. Perhaps my unfavorable tone will cancel some of the more shameless paeons for it, and you will be able to evaluate it without bias."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I had pleasant memories of this book from childhood, though something amiss lingered in my memory. There, in my gray matter, after three decades, remained a sense of unease with this book. Now, having read the book aloud to my daughter, I can see what went wrong. This book has on every page jokes and vocabulary that would challenge my college students. And yet the book is targeted to small children. Let me throw you a few examples: The Senses Taker, Dynne (a play on \\"din\\" and \\"djinn\\"), Kakofonous A. Dischord Doctor of Dissonance. Some needlessly tough words: salve, disdainfully, brandishing, gelatinous, and countless more.To be fair, there are a great many things accessible to children, such as (literally) jumping to (the island of) Conclusions, the watchdog (a dog with a clock in his middle), and Alec, the floating boy who is growing down. Moreover, the Jules Feiffer illustrations are superb. They greatly help to make sense of the difficult concepts in this work.Charitably, one could say that the author intended a whole set of bon-mots for the adult reader, and a more innocent story for the young. But I don't think this is the case. I think that Juster terribly overshot his audience and created a book better for adults than children. For those determined to read this book, reserve it for older children who are very strong readers. This is not a book that translates well to the young."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I kinda like this book, but it's pretty dissapointing. The author is named Norton Juster and is an ok writer.It's about a boy named Milo, and has always thought of things the boring and dull way. Then, one day he walks in his room to find THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH!!!! It tranports him to a new land of excitement and pure adventure. He meets many new friends such as, King Azaz, The Mathmagician, Tock, and the Humbug. As I said, the author probably didn't give their all. For instance, in the end of the book something happens that is a real bummer. But the illustrator, Jules Feiffer, can draw amazingly.The book is relatively short and has twenty chapters. So if you need a book that will only take a week or so this is the book for you. I most likely won't read this book again. But I'm sure that one person reading this review will like it.

He drives his toy car thru and finds himself in a strange new place where there are lots of puns and clever play on words. It's like Alice thru the looking glass and the Mad Hatter. Sure there are some clever bits but it is tedious having so much nonsense. The kid is not an active part of the story. He doesn't accomplish anything. He isn't clever or thoughtful. Turns out the twin princesses of Rhyme and Reason were banished (hey that makes sense). But when they are rescued there is no change in the nonsense, I believe there are more stories in this series but we won't be buying them. I wouldn't even take them if they were free.

Now loosely affiliate these concepts into a nonsensical journey to save 2 princesses named Rhyme and Reason for no apparent rhyme or reason.

Frankly I found this story to be a borderline psychadelic romp through a bizarre and over-the-top landscape filled with 1-dimensional characters and a \\"hero\\" that is about as inspiring as a bowl of cold oatmeal. Oh and don't forget the subtle (and by subtle I mean sledgehammer bludgeoning) message that we need to take time in our lives to enjoy the world and be wise in our speech and actions.

But I decided to keep an open mind and give this novel a shot. I'm glad I did.This is a wonderful story, full of creative wordplay. Juster makes you believe in this world where people eat words and numbers are dug out of mines, where color is played by a symphony and sounds are collected and hoarded. There's so much more, but I don't want to give anything else away.Just read it. Enjoy its charming narrative thrust, its imaginative way of making points without ever being heavy handed.

For any schoolteachers out there -- this is a highly effective, and arguably educational, means of crowd control, if you're in charge of droves of unruly kids. For any kids out there -- it was a good crowd control method because we LOVED it! It's just a fantastic story, one that gets you thinking about many illogical features of the English language. I bet a lot of writers got set on the road to being authors because of reading this book, when they were younger...It's just a terrific story, about a kid named Milo who is given a mysterious tollbooth as a gift (yes, I'm serious.) He drives through it in a toy car, enters a strange land, and before you know it he is immersed in a quest to restore Rhyme and Reason (two lost princesses) to the devastated, former &quot;Kingdom of Wisdom.&quot; Everywhere he goes, he meets really weird creatures. If you like to draw, it is a lot of fun to try to imagine what these creatures look like, and draw them. Basically, this book is just an awful lot of fun. You'll never forget it.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember this book with great fondness from my childhood. Even now, I periodically reread it because it is such a wonderful book. Part of its attraction lies in its wonderful play with language, where phrases we take for granted in everyday conversation (such as jumping to conclusions) become literal. And as in many good books, part of the attraction is watching a character you care about figure out how to extricate himself from the predicaments in which he finds himself. The characters he encounters are fascinating ranging from the wise, to the crusty and even ridiculous. I can't recommend this book too highly. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My whole family LOVES this- we listen to it several times a year on long car trips and never tire of it. The story is fantastic of course but it's really David Hyde Pierce's narration that makes this so amazing. He is an incredibly talented performer who voices all of the crazy characters in the book as if he was a whole cast of characters. This is fun for all ages - my kids range in age from 4-8 and all enjoy it and I love it too! This is a great choice for a car trip- it's fun, adventurous, and makes you think."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Mom, Dad, or Youthful Reader, this is a book to be shared. A creative romp with puns, vocabulary, and prods for independent and creative thinking. The companion pieces whether for teacher or an annotated volume are recommended especially if this is to be a shared you read to me, I will read to you experience. Lots of fun and laughs."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"What an adventure. The puns, wordplay, and insights are tremendous.There was even an unintentional pun in the Kindle e-book edition I read. Someone used an OCR to produce it, I'm sure. So, a few times - but only for the Spelling Bee's spelling - the letter l was rendered by the numeral 1. So, e.g., he'd spell thus: pilot, p-i-1-o-t. Given the words/numbers theme in the book, this added to the humor.This is a children's book only in the sense that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland or Peter Pan are children's books, i.e., only if we are all children.I'll be on the lookout for a hard copy - this is a book to reread."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This book is not only an excellent introduction to literary styles for young readers, but is enjoyable for book lovers of all ages. The clever wit used by Juster appeals to the literary senses and takes readers into a magical world in which the real and imaginary coincide."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I originally purchased this book for my grandchildren, but read it first as a form of censorship in case the content upset their parents. I was totally captivated by it. It is so cleverly and amusingly written. For anyone with a joy of the English language and its foibles, this is a must read. I am impressed with writers who have such a command of words and phrases as the writer of this book has. Example. \\"People who live in Infinity must be very poor because they cannot make ends meet.\\" It is written as a child's story, and while it is also meant for them, parents will find it very amusing as well. A caveat. It is not for young children. They would not get it. It is for an older child, perhaps 10-12. I guess it depends on their intelligent level and grasp of the nuances of the English language."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My childhood reading was equally divided between the entire Baby-Sitters Club series and &quot;everything else.&quot; Somehow, The Phantom Tollbooth slipped past me. I finally heard of it and subsequently read it for the first time at the age of twenty.I was amazed. Generally, I find the simplicity of vocabulary in most children's chapter books waters down the power of the narrative and drains detail from the accompanying descriptions. The Phantom Tollbooth, with its lighthearted handling of subject matter, avoids this by substituting comedy for drama. Don't be deceived: this is no slapstick tribute to bathroom humor masquerading as children's literature. The Phantom Tollbooth paints a fantastic world of fantasy and word play, weaving homonyms and mathematical brain busters into a vibrant tapestry of allegory. It doesn't deal with life's &quot;deeper issues,&quot; but brings readers on a comical exploration of learning's importance without a trace of preachiness. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Milo, Tock, the Humbug, the Spelling Bee, and many other characters bring a new light onto story-telling. Norton Juster continually teaches his readers lessons and morals in the exciting, adventure-filled novel. The Phantom Tollbooth is about a boy named Milo who doesn't appreciate anything and takes everything for granted. But one day, he finds a package in his room from- no one. He assembles it and it appears to be a tollbooth. Through this simple object Milo is taken for the ride of his life, finds himself on a journey to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason, and is taught some very important things about life, including the ever needed phrase &quot;don't waste time.&quot; I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of eight, and especially to the person who is in search of a very good book."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"It was over 15 years ago when I first plowed into this book, but it reveals a new facet to itself every time one delves into it anew. And it works on many levels-- as adventure story, as allegory, as Alice-in-Wonderland-style surrealistic tale.The chief character, Milo, has a serious case of ennui at a young age. He sees little point in doing or experiencing anything. One day, a mysterious tollbooth materializes before him, and through it Milo is transported into Dictionopolis, a world so weird that it makes Oz seem truly as normal as Kansas. There are characters such as the bickering Humbug, the aptly-named Spelling Bee (who reflexively spells out commonly-used words), and the marvelously tongue-twisting Weatherman, whose splendid spoonerisms would put Gilbert and Sullivan to shame. Things in Dictionopolis happen for no particular reason, its denizens act with no point in mind, and in general things make absolutely no sense. Even the poor king is constantly embroiled in conflicts with himself, over, of course, nothing at all. All this has come to pass because the princesses, Rhyme and Reason, have gone missing. It is thus that Milo sets off on his search-and-rescue mission. To say much more would be to spoil the book's ineffable magic, so whether you're getting this book for your ten-year-old or for yourself (and there is no shame in the latter!), it's a must-have for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I first read The Phantom Tollbooth in third grade at the reccommendation of the best teacher I ever had. I reread it every year, even going so far as to sneak across the road that separated my junior high school from my elementary school after I left 6th grade to read it. Luckily, the school librarian understood my love of the book and never gave me away. After I got into high school, I was too far away (and looked too old) to sneak in to read it, and I thought it was lost to me. 10 years later, I found it in a bookstore, and I found that it was enchanting to me at 25 as it was at age 8. Flash forward a few years, and I was rereading The Phantom Tollbooth, and my boyfriend asked me what I was laughing at. I read him the passage from the book, and he asked if I would read him more. My boyfriend has never been much of a reader, but this book started a new tradition for us. Instead of watching television together, I read to him. We've read many books together now, but he says that The Phantom Tollbooth is his favorite! Many other reviewers have told about the plot, so I won't bore you with a synopsis, but I feel that The Phantom Tollbooth has a way of bringing magic to your life, and that anyone can find something to enjoy in this warm, witty story."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"As a child, this was one of my favorite books. I must have read it 50 times. The author is so good at creating scenes which are so fantastic yet so well drawn you can picture them delightfully! A few example---having to climb infinity stairs, catching an unsaid word in your mouth to use later, a statistical half boy from the average family of 2 1/2 kids, and especially the wonderful thought of somehow coming home and having that tollbooth in your room, ready to set up and use! I like it that no explanation is ever given of how Milo gets the tollbooth, or who gives it to him---it's just a visitor from the fantasy world that as a child you always somehow feel is just out of your reach---out there someplace."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Perhaps the finest piece of adolescent fiction ever written, The Phantom Tollbooth teaches us lessons about life and grammar, love and arithmetic, heroism and common sense. As a child I learned not to jump to conclusions; I learned about rhyme and reason; I learned about wasting time. Everyone needs a book like this, lest they become complacent with mere reading. I am on my third copy for myself, plus every child I know has received this as a gift from Uncle Lee...and it will continue to be so...unless someone writes something better. Yeah, right...Humbug to that!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This is hands down the best audiobook I own. This is a great rendition of the book and is perfect for adults and children alike. I can't understand how the publisher let this go out of print. It couldn't be done better, and the book is a classic children's title.Pat Carroll the actress brings her excellent stage talents to bear in her reading (she's done several Shakespeare comedies in the DC area here to standing applause); she brings out the highly individual characters' personalities extremely well. Listening to her interpretation is a delight, and she perfectly complements the humorous, witty tone of the book. Just hearing her read in the characters' voices will make younger children giggle and strong adults smile. I highly recommend this audiocassette, especially for those long family car rides.The abridgement handily removes a slow-ish passage from the middle of the book, which makes the tape almost better than the book (at least to an adult)."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"First of all, this is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read! It is about a boy named Milo who is bored and doesn't see the meaning of things. One day, he comes and finds a toll booth went to him in his room. He takes his car and pays the toll and begins his remarkable journey. He journeys through Expectations where he meets the Whether Man. He dozes off and comes to the Doldrum and meets the Lethargians and a watchdog named Tock that goes Tick. Tock sets off with him for Dictionopolis, the city of words, where he meets the troubled King Azaz the Unabridged and Fainly Macabre. He decides to save the Princesses Rhyme and Reason, because without them, there is none. The lovable Humbug, Tock, and Milo set off. The come to the Forest of Sight and see the orchestra play the colors. They travel through the barren Valley of Sound and meet the Soundkeeper. They get to Digitopolis, the city of numbers, and meet the Mathematician. This is where the real difficult part of their journey begins as they venture into the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the princesses from the Castle in the Air. This book shows you the meaning of knowledge and reminds you to never rush and see and hear the bueaties of the world."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

But he gets a mysterious package, and when he opens it up...... there IT is! (I can't tell you anything good, since I want to be sparking your curiosity and all) Somehow, Milo gets into Dictionopolis! ... I really don't know how to summarize the book without spoiling it for you. Well, Milo meets many, many friends, even though they are peculiar, and with a couple of them, he saves two particular princesses from.... from.... you know... Well, in the end, (I hope this doesn't spoil it) Milo learns that life isn't so dull after all. This book is just so cool! I loved the word games, and I hope you would like them too, if you decide to purchase this book. I liked it. A lot. Yeah. There are word games, logic, MATH (ugh) and all the like! It's... sort of educational.... but, it's more fun than learning. :) Look, I can't make you buy it. Look at more reviews!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

But I would recomand reading to for others."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This was a good book. The puns were perfect, every humorous note perfectly placed and written. Regarding the symbolism: Milo realized that it would do him no good to spend all of his time in the Land of Expectations. Which, when translated, could mean one should not only expect but get on with whatever is being done instead of having great expectations and whatnot."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster has created a book that is, in one word, dazzling. It is one of my all-time favorites. Along with Jules Feiffer's great illustrations, the hilarious story that is make-believe but teaches oh so many lessons is a must-have. This book can be viewed on many levels. I myself believe that the book's purpose is not only Milo's adventures in the lands beyond, but also to teach the reader many a valuble lesson. Alongside that beautiful gift that many authors don't posess, Norton Juster has ability to weave in little jokes (as in Sir Cumference) and not stray away from the story. A book that deserves a loud applause, you must read the magical story by name of The Phantom Tollbooth!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Because 5 have been lent, and have not been returned. They were pretty dogeared when they disappeared, though.I still give it as a gift to those with the proper spirit of whimsy and questing to truly appreciate it. Enjoying a bad pun now and again helps, too.I still use quotes from it on my email signatures.Now if that's not a recommendation, I don't know what is!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I read this at school, and it was great! I like books by Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Lloyd Alexander, and people like that. I enjoyed because it had a simple plot, but was very interesting. The descriptions are great, but not so detailed so it drags on. The characters are unforgettable. It's a book about plays on words. There's a watchdog (with the body of a watch) whose name is Tock, a place called the Doldrums where nothing ever happens, plus when Milo (the main character) asks for a square meal at this place where they take everything literally, they serve little squares! It's a very fun book to read, and I totally recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Besides being entertaining and action-packed, this story teaches valuable life lessons about the importance of learning. One of my all-time favorites!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I picked this book up and never put it down. Watch as Juster takes your head and throws pictures into it, like the orchestra that plays sound into the world. The author also makes suspense which doesn't leave until the end of the story, such as what would happen if his main character after his 200,000,000 year sentence in the dungeon.His plays on words are the best part. For example he creates a watchdog, whith a clock on his side, that goes tick with a name tock. The message the author is trying to get out is English is a weird lauguage. Milo (the main character) goes on a journey through a tollbooth that appears in his room just because there is nothing better to do. But when he goes through he's in a whole diffent world. He goes on a quest to save Ryme and Reason. On the way he meets the Humbug, Spelling Bee and many more. This book is for all different readers, not just one type."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Belive it or not, I first found out about this book while I was reading one of Ann M.Martin's The Babysitters Club Series. When I ran into this book in my favorite bookstores, I bought it not just because the wonderful synopsis printed at the back flap, but also because its surprisingly low price ( it was an imported mass paperback edition). It was three times lower than average imported books prices in my currency. But as I read through it, I would as well buy it even if the price was three times higher.This book had given me a lot of valuable lessons about life. Realizing it or not, we all sometimes got into the same situation as Milo, and along with Milo's travelling I could see that even ordinary things in life have their own fun sides. And it depends on how we view things happen everyday in life. I even wish those places Milo visited were real. It is not a children's book, this is a book about life. After I finished reading this wonderful book and saw the reviewer's note that she thought this book was fantastic since the first time she read it when she was ten, I wish I had read this book twelve years earlier"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Okay, maybe this phrasing is too strong... but it is rare to find an entertaining book that requires its reader to think, and it gently leads you to believe that you too can notice and appreciate the colors of the sunset, or taking a different perspective, or about not jumping to conclusions (an island 9in the book!)
