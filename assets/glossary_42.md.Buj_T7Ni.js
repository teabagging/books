It is so much fun to read.Mr. Carroll was well acquainted with three young sisters. The middle one (who was his favorite) was named Alice. Once, on a summer picnic, he told the girls a story he had made up about Alice. They loved it so much that he made a book out of it and got it published. The illustrator he worked with was very accommodative, and he made the pictures exactly to Mr. Carroll's liking. The real Alice had short, dark hair, unlike the original illustrations. (Robert Ingpen takes some liberties on his version, but I am IN LOVE with his dreamy illustrations). As is stated in the first chapter, \\"What is the use of a book...without pictures or conversations?\\"I love the attention to detail in this book, such as a little cup of orange juice on a bookshelf.Alice herself is a wonderful character; she is confident, but humble enough to admit that she makes mistakes. At one point she [SPOILER WARNING!] relates to another character how she enjoys playing croquet with herself, and when she cheats, she will scold herself most harshly so as to bring tears to her eyes! She is also amazingly smart, especially for being only about seven. (She states her age in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".)I would recomend this book for ages twelve and up. It just won't be enjoyable for younger ages. I tried reading it to my 9-year-old sister (who has been complimented by many people on her amazing vocabulary) and she didn't get the humor. It was written in the 19th century and the language was just over her head.Now, I have seen many cats without smiles, but I have never seen a smile without a cat.

It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed \\"curious\\" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great. Nevertheless, if you find the time, pick it up if you want to. It's a quick read and you can make your own judgment about it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story read like all the sentaces has been thrown it a blender and then reassembled into a book. The only reason I could follow any of it was because I have seen the various movie versions many many times. I not sure why I assumed that because it was a classic children's tale it would be good. The entire thing made no sense and on more than one occasion I believed that maybe because it was the Public Domain kindle edition perhaps I was missing a page or chapter. I know it was missing illustrations but it also felt like it was missing whole paragraphs. If this edition is complete than this truley is a horrible book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES the Disney classic film; and maybe (as I'm sure some of you will point out to me) that is the problem, but I think there is a bigger factor to my lukewarm sentiments towards this Lewis Carroll classic.I read this on Kindle.Now I love my Kindle (app), and I love the bountiful \`free' books to choose from, but if I can muster any amount of warning it would be to steer clear of this particular book. The reason being is that \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is a visionary piece of literature that very much requires visuals to make it work. Reading the prose in mere \`black and white' so-to-speak, without any illustrations, makes such a low impact. In fact, the story takes on a tiresome tone without the aid of John Tenniel's illustrations. The fact that the Kindle version of this story omits them is a tragedy because it takes so much away from the experience. Sadly, my first experience with this story was on the picture-less Kindle version and my expectations were not met and I was left with this sour taste in the back of my throat. Thankfully, my mother has an illustrated version of this she let me take a gander at. When you tie both Carroll's wildly imaginative themes and Tenniel's beautifully constructed pictures you have a far more captivating and memorable experience.So, I feel partially unqualified to review this book since I didn't actually read it the WAY it was meant to be read.I will say that I felt the book definitely got off to a rocky start, for the repetitive nature of Alice's constant growing and shrinking became somewhat tiring to read. I also think that Disney's decision to fuse both \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and \`Through the Looking Glass' together in their classic 1951 film was a stroke of genius, for they both truly complement one another and elevate the other. That, and it also made for a more involving and better paced film, for the events in \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' become a tad redundant, especially the dialog driven parts. I mean, I'm never one to say \\"the movie was better than the book\\" because, well, how often is that true, but some stories are better told on the screen and this is one of them. Reading this banter is far different than hearing it, and it doesn't quite read as effortlessly as I'd wanted it to.So, in the end I recommend the story (it's one that everyone should read) but don't do as I did and simply read the \`free' Kindle version. You really need to get an illustrated copy, for it makes all the difference."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"And I have to say there is no contest.The kindle version delivers all the words, but it's just not the same things without the illustrations.The illustrated version is an absolute masterpiece for all ages, absolutely entertaining....Despite the terrible terrible movie......"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I never got this book if i paid for it then amazon or seller never sent it to me, please send it to me then i can rate it..."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I don't think this book is that good because it didn't really grab me as a reader and I didn't really enjoy It like some other b books I've read"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book wasn't horrible, I didn't read it through to the end.

If you've seen the film, the book seems comparatively brief and Alice seems to be exploring Wonderland with no specific purpose. Otherwise, its an interesting read and aptly suggests the nonsensical views a child has on the adult world."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I've struggled with this book on and off for a few years (well, decades I suppose) I first read it when I was about 10 or so. When I first read it I was a bit disappointed. But the Alice story persists. It's imagery pops up time and time again in other media, films, TV, video games, art. The Alice story is a lterary classic. Legendary even. Even people who haven't read a book in their life know at least something about it. They know many of the characters. Criticism of it is shocking, possible heretical.Meh. To me Alice In Wonderland is simply a nonsense story aimed at children. Nothing less, nothing more. Now, today the word \\"nonsense\\" has a perjotative ring to it, but back in the 19th century \\"nonsense\\" was pretty much a viable genre. But it's a short story, with little plot, no particular likeable characters, and filled with some of the most annoying literary creations ever. As some have said the events in the book are mostly non sequiturs, just seemingly random encounters that Alice has. It's written in rather sedate prose too, with little description of what Wonderland is actually like. In fact more information on the nature of Wonderland can be gleaned from the atmospheric illustrations by John Tenniel.I think Alice in Wonderland has survived through the years precisely because of it's vagueness and ambiguousness. People will read into what they want. It has provoked philosophical, moral, social and mathematical speculation. But I don't think there are any real hidden meanings or metaphors behind it all. It's an almost blank canvas for people to project their theories and speculations on what Wonderland is supposed to be. Something like a Jackson Pollock painting for the Victorian Age. Okay, maybe not *that* bad."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"THE weirdest book I have ever read in my entire life! It is wack!

I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real.

Most of you should have read Alice's Adventures, and if you did not, you are better off. If you watched both, then you would best understand the major differences between the novel and the animations. Though I am sure there are a lot more to point out, in this review, I will focus on theses three points: the change with characters, the difference in setting, and the alternation of plots.First of all, here are the major character changes! Many agreed on the Queen of Hearts being the one of the most different, and also, the Cheshire cat. The classic portrayal of characters indicated the Cheshire Cat as the property of the Duchess. In the film, there is no Duchess at all!! The Cat stands alone, and instead of staying calm and cool as the novel, it is rather playful and gets Alice into big trouble with the Queen. Not only Duchess was not even mentioned, the gryphon never showed up, and the mock turtle was totally out of the picture. The Queen is selfish and ignorant, and though she rules the kingdom, she shrinks from responsibility. That may not get you much information on why there are so many difference with the Queen, and that will go on to our second point: the settings.Settings were also dramatically changed, kind of combined with the other book, making it a total hybrid. The queen's selfishness was not mentioned directly on the original, only the screaming passion for winning. The Queen of Hearts on the film's personality was combined with the Red Queen (especially the \\"open your mouth wider\\" parts inherited from her personal lines), making clear that she wanted everyone to obey her and to make her as happy as if she could ever be. The other clear facts supporting the idea of the combination between the two books are Tweedledee and Tweedledum appearing after the caucus race, followed by the garden of singing flowers. I was clearly expecting more than this, so it will actually look like as if it WAS a two book in one film, not an in-between sidekick.When it comes to settings, it always has to do with plots. Though not mentioned above, the start and the ending have a lot to this section. First of all, it was just a pleasant afternoon, resting by her sister when Alice started to dream and saw the white rabbit hurrying by, not during the history lesson. Then, there is the white rabbit that appears more frequently than it used to in the original, even during the mad tea-party. However, the most important thing in the whole plot, is that Alice thought of this amazing world before even she started to dream, and found out it was a dream at the end of the story, BEFORE she woke up. In the story, there was no such thinking of this events and it was a surprise for her to know she grew back to her own size, and have been sleeping.Overall, there are a lot of differences mentioned in this comparison review, and despite of director effort to create a lovely animation, I think it was kind of messed out. There are some reasons I wrote down already, but it is mostly for the others which have not been. However, I DO appreciate the animator's hard efforts to even think of turning this perfect piece of writing to a film, so I guess the \\"missed-outs\\" are expectable.This was my comparison review, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any spare seconds, please put a thumbs-up on my review & share your thoughts with me. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The theme of this book is basically a mystical wonderland where the unexpected happens. She starts off by falling into a hole, and then her journey in Wonderland begins. Carroll's descriptive language is incredible and he's always engaging your imagination.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \`Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\"This is what Alice, a curious young girl, experienced one sunny afternoon. Very bored, she decided to follow a rabbit down its hole. Expecting to see the rabbit's nest, Alice was stunned when she opened her eyes and saw a teeny tiny door surrounded by teeny tiny furniture. This is just the beginning of Alice's journey to Wonderland. She encounters a mischievous disappearing cat, a larger-than-life caterpillar, and an insane Mad Hatter. Alice's adventure becomes complicated when she crosses paths with Wonderland's evil queen. The queen, jealous of Alice's looks, gentle personality, and innocence, orders that she be captured and held prisoner. Alice, united with her unusual friends, must help restore order to chaotic Wonderland by dethroning the wicked queen and returning to her own world. Does Alice find her way back home? Or is she fated to navigate through the foreign world for eternity? There is only one way to find out!Lewis Carroll, Alice's creator, brings a world of madness mixed with logic to life.

Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of. This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of. Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride. I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting. I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way. This book is for children and adults alike. As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I collect Alice memorabilia and have massive sites on &lt;yahoo&gt; and &lt;photobox&gt;.And maybe I'm the only one who saw the uncanny resemblance between Alice In Wonderland and my favourite singer Virginia Astley. Even her middle name is ALICE.Her instrumental album &quot;FROM GARDENS WHERE WE FEEL SECURE&quot; is the perfect soundtrack to Alice and all the titles she used were appropriate:Summer Of Their Dreams,Out On The Lawn I lie in Bed,Its Too Hot To Sleep,Hiding In The Ha Ha,A Summer Long Since Past...the music is accompanied by Nature sounds and splashing oars. Her later songs had titles like Nothing Is What It Seems and Over The Edge Of The World,these especially fit into her version of Wonderland. Virginia Astley even LOOKS like the Rackham illustration of Alice and not only that but she lived with her family in the 70s at Moulsford,Oxfordshire,with the Thames outside the back door and only a few miles South of Alice Country.Virginia is,in fact,Alice in the Deanery garden,her latest song &quot;I Will Miss This Holy Garden&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Most children these days are exposed to the magical adventures of Alice in Wonderland through cartoon movies, such as Disney's version, but very few are exposed to the exact literature, the book that made the cartoons, movies, and every other piece of merchandise on the market today happen. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is a complete children's classic. Unlike many children books of then and now, it makes you think, something we all, especially children, should do often if not done at least once a day. Not only is this book, which follows Alice through a magical world where the verdict comes after the sentence, tea parties are insane, and Mock Turtles sob continueously, a good fantasy story to keep young (and old) minds occupied, its also a good riddle and puzzle book. With constant interruption and riddles being said throughout the book by the 'mad' charactors, its a good book to read if you want something difficult to figure out or to wonder about. The author Lewis Carroll I've learned enjoyed complicated puzzles and intentionally included many in this piece of literature. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is definately a classic that must be read if not already read. It's a good book to settle down with and enjoy, for the young, and young at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a very exciting book.

How many other childrens stories are studied by theorists and philosophers?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I, like almost every other kid I know, grew up with the Disney movie. Although a rather accurate depiction of Wonderland, it cannot compare to the book (plus it muddled things together, mixing Alice in Wonderland with things originally in Through the Looking Glass). I never really took much attention to this very strange movie, but one day decided to read the book.Enter Wonderland.Absolutely no plot, no direction, no point. Lot's of silly nonsense but in spite of, or maybe because of this, it is very enjoyable. You literally never know what's going to happen next. After reading this book, I realized just how much my own dreams... Unforgettable characters, who can ever forget the cheshire cat or the caterpillar, jokes, interesting supplementary drawings, and puns keep you on your toes.This is really not for kiddies. Sure they can read it and maybe even enjoy it, but cannot fully appreciate it. A masterpiece, a classic, but more importantly, an enjoyable experience.Don't forget to read Through the Looking Glass! Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; don't pop up in Alice in Wonderland but Through the Looking Glass. Although &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; didn't appear in the movie, it's still a classic. Finally, an explanation of this ever-puzzling poem! And of course, &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; is one of my favorite all-time songs...One of those books that you can read over and over again and find something new each time. Definitely an essential. The most fun I have ever had with a book. If you've ever been cursed enough to watch the movie but never read the book, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!

The way he described everything Alice saw in Wonderland I felt I was also there.Alice a young girl is on the riverbank listening to her older sister read when she dozes off. As she's sleeping she dreams of a place called Wonderland, where people eat tarts made of pepper, and babies turn into pigs. Where Cheshire Cats are always grinning, and Hatter's have tea parties all the time.This is a wonderful, exciting, and magical adventure for all young readers, and don't think because you've seen the movie you know the whole story.

Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Alice is one of those books. It was a quick read, and thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, I wonder what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a child? I probably would have hated it, as the language and sentence construction is purposefully confusing. But now, at 50, although it makes no sense, it makes a lot of sense because I can see Alice's world from a parent's perspective. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a free book on Kindle and a must read for every child and grown up if you have not read it. The movie left out much of the parts that make this fairy tale memorable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved this book. It was a wonderful copy and a fun read. I recomend it to anyone sceptical."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was a pleasure to re-read this timeless classic based in a fantastical world. I've never turned away from nonsense, especially when it's \\"nonsense for the sake of nonsense\\". I do not \\"buy-in to\\" claims that this book is purely a drug-induced creative work. The language and the prose is so absurd and confusing at times that you feel as lost as Alice, which I like.I think it's important to read the works that were later \\"Disney-fied\\" so that you can see both why Disney made the decisions they did for their youthful audience, and, how the author originally intended the story to be."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved it. Be sure to read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" when you finish this one. I got so much out of this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I want to start by saying it's free, and it's hard to beat free, unless what you are getting for free is really good. This is one of those items that is just that. This story has been passed on through generations, and I would imagine is still on of the most popular stories to date. I had only seen the movies of this tale, and thought there is no way this book could be better than all of these movies made over that last 100 years. This book exceeds every movie ever made form this book and will probably be better than every movie to come. The way Carroll portrays the characters in story you feel as if you are in the Wonderland as a bystander as it's all happening. It's a very vivid story that I will read to my kids one day.With this being the free kindle edition, it didn't come with the illustrations as other editions and that was fine with me. Where as I'm sure it would be nice to see the pictures as they were 150 years ago, it's still nice to use your imagination of the way Carroll put them in words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have taken to read some classics lately and I found Alice in Wonderland as a free ebook. I read the book in a day and loved it. Though I did love the Disney movie as a child, after reading Alice in Wonderland, I find that the book surpasses the movie. I will probably reread this book again in the near future to read anything that I may have missed, because the story had me begging for more and I might have missed a few things. I loved the humor in the book and the sadness of the book. The pictures give the book more life and I recommend this to everybody."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the first time I read the book in its original version and I found Alice incredibly annoying and is just a pretentious self-centered little girl. Maybe that's what little girls do but surely it annoys me so much that I had the thought to abandon the book when I am 1/5 into it. It is always difficult to read a book when one dislikes the main character. I did finish it and it is a lovely ending. The other characters so fun and interesting - very imaginative and I can see why it is a classic. Guess it is just not my type of classic even though I love children books."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ralph Steadman's illustrations seem to be taken directly from Lewis Carroll's ingenious mind. Great combo!The only thing is... the book itself is too big if you're looking for an edition you can carry around in your bag.But if you're looking for something to sit quietly in your collection, it's beyond perfect."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"this is a beautifully illustrated version of alice. i love the work of alison jay....and this gives me further reason to be a member of her fan club."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"So, what's a 47 year old doing reviewing a classic children's book? Well, it occurred to me as I was looking through the available books on my Kindle, that many of the free ones (yes I'm quite open to free as an option) that there were many books that I assumed I knew because I had seen movies, seen summarized in some other form or simply because they were cultural icons and \\"everybody\\" knows these books.Many I have indeed read and did read as I was younger. However, now with a Kindle and a commute, it seemed a perfect opportunity to address some of those elements lacking in my basic reading. It was in this spirit that I down loaded Alice's adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and read through it is a remarkably short period of time. Many of these free books on the Kindle, are in the public domain and have been available in text or PDF files for quite some time. A simple conversion in format is all that is required to make it available. The question I asked as I read the book, is does the experience of reading it in this format take away anything from the experience. Children's Literature in particular is often about more than just the words on a page. Of course there are often illustrations, the physical book itself takes on dimensions that are bigger than usual. This adds to the experience of a child reading the book by themselves but in particular it adds to the experience of a child being read to who can then sit in a lap or look as the book as presented and share in the experience by learning to read or reinforcing reading skills.So, for a aging kid who needs something to read to round out his cultural iconic missing links this worked just fine. However, for those seeking to have an experience with their kids in reading a classic piece of literature, I'd not recommend it in that venue.As to the story itself, there's little I can say. In some ways, it's like reading a familiar story but in others it's amazing how much can be lost or glossed over in the pop-cultural offerings that sprang from it. Reading this piece of classic literature gives you some insight not only into the time it came from, but also into the heart of childhood that is timeless and can be recaptured at least in part, if we'll pause and exercise our imagination.4 stars. Absolutely 5 stars as far as the story goes. Because this specifically addresses the Kindle edition, a drop of a star so that any considering reading this to their children from a kindle, consider what might be lost by not obtaining a more traditional copy complete with illustrations and the opportunity to share at a level one notch above what the Kindle offers in this context.Perhaps something like thisAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. Take some time and look for what will work best for you and your intended audience.bart breen"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?\\" Someone might have thought to ask that of the compilers of this Kindle edition, which lacks any of the famed Tenniel illustrations, even though they're all in the public domain and have been made available in many on-line versions. Worse, the compilers also omit Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in the golden afternoon,\\" even though it's an integral part of the book. One gets the feeling that the goal was to not make the free version truly complete, so that one would have to wind up purchasing one of the non-free editions for one's Kindle -- which is probably a better solution from the outset."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I forgot how wonderful a tale this is. It is written so well that the images almost jump off the page. Even as an adult I couldn't help but to fall under Carroll's spell."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Do you remember the first time you saw a painting by Marc Chagall? His fantastic creatures wearing hats and trousers, people kissing while floating in mid air, layers of events happening at once, and conversations between animals and flowers? If Chagall was alive and asked to illustrate Alice's Adventures, it may have looked very similar to this.Only this is better.Simple and yet very rich illustrations bounce you from page to page. They are vibrant but not overwhelming, you are curious about where the images will take you next, it makes you hungry for more. And you get more! There is a printed illustration on almost every other page of the book! There seem to be as many small images, lending themselves as nuances to Carroll's text, as there are full-page illustrations. In a word, it's fantastic.I disagree with the editorial review of the School Library Journal. While I see this book as sophisticated, I also see very young children relating to the artwork. The dream is at times spooky and frustrating like the real world can be, just as at other moments it can be a playful party. Although Alice in Wonderland may not have been originally intended for child as young as three or four years old to read, they will be enticed into trying. A child as young as four will relate to this Alice, she is a small girl with flowing hair and dresses in an easy style. Deloss McGraw has illustrated a modern and truly dreamlike interpretation of Carroll's classic. Finally we have a total departure from the formal British and more grown up Alice that John Tenniel portrayed all those years ago and has been an influence upon artists attempting it since.Albeit a short, but important side note: the size 14 - 16 font is very readable for both old and young eyes, and comes in very handy for those readers-out-loud at late bedtimes in a dimly lit room.Of all the illustrated versions there are of this classic story, this will be the version your child would first pick up from the shelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland is repeated in a very readable text and is as delightful as ever. This is not, however, a childrens' book. Barry Moser's illustrations tell the story of Alice in a different, dark and somewhat menacing way. Is the rabbit hole just the means to reach an amusing world of people and animals with strange names and stranger habits, or is it the path to a nether region where the normal rules of social conduct and the shape and size of &quot;people&quot; don't apply? If his illustrations mean anything, Moser thinks perhaps it is the latter. For example, the Queen of Hearts appears not as the crazy, but ultimately harmless, creature of a Disney movie. Moser shows her as a dark and foreboding character and by his illustartion suggests that &quot;off with her head&quot; is a real threat. The text of the book is standard Alice, but the real reason to buy it is to get Moser's illustrations. This is definitely not a book for 10 year olds. But those of us who grew up on Alice as half comedy, half light hearted spoof will enjoy this twist on a traditional tale. Moser's other illustrations of classical works such as Moby Dick and The Devine Comedy are also well worth acquiring."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have this book. It is beautifully illustrated. I do not understand the comment of a previous reviewer who complained about the number of illustrations. Nearly every page is beautifully illustrated. Every chapter is introduced with a two-page illustration. There are numerous two-page and full single-page illustrations throughout the book. I'm an adult who fell in love with this story when I saw Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This is a worthy addition to my collection of things Carroll. I recommend \\"The Wasp in a Wig\\" if you can find it. The end of this Alice... has a nice and concise description of Carroll's writing of the book, photographs of the cover and first page of Carroll's handwritten first version, and a wonderful tribute to John Tenniel, the illustrator of the first published edition who provided the classic drawings nearly all of us recognize.

Of course the story is magic to readers of all ages but for me what is especially magical are the illustrations. Deloss McGraw has turned &quot;Alice&quot; and the world of illustration on its head. Now I understand why this book has just received the New York Society of Illustrators 2001 Gold Medal for Original Art."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The treasure of this edition lies principally in its beautiful layout and thoroughly original illustrations. Strict traditionalists may find Garcia's gothlike depictions of their favourite Wonderland characters a bit off-putting, while fans of Alice looking for something distinctly different won't be disappointed. The text is Carroll's original classic, nicely set, with a whimsical unjustified right edge and pleasing gradient toned pages. This volume does not include Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, which is a pity -- it would have been interesting to see Garcia's depiction of the Jabberwocky. Garcia's art notwithstanding, I would more highly recommend:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive EditionI also highly recommend:Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book received only included \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" is not included in the book, even though the picture depicts that both are included. I found the book that included both stories elsewhere and purchased it. I donated the book I received from Amazon to my daughter's school library instead of dealing with the hassle of returning it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This review is strictly for the Kindle version of this classic story by Lewis Carroll.I confess almost all books I buy for the Kindle are works for which I already have a paper copy, sometimes two, if it is a translation. I buy the Kindle editions in order to easily search for particular quotes and passages. These passages I commonly paste into writings I do on the Bible, and Lewis Carroll's works are some of my favorites, behind Shakespeare and Plato.I mention all this because unlike many other books, this edition is actually better for reading than it is for the purpose I just mentioned, because it does not have the pagination which would enable one to refer back to the original copy. In most Kindle books, you can locate the printed page number by doing a query on a word on that page. That's a bit hokey, but that's what you have to do. That trick does not work on this edition. Rules for scholarly source citations have not yet caught up with editions which are formatted especially for the Kindle.But for reading, the Kindle converters got two things very right. First, the edition has all of Sir John Tenniel's drawings. They didn't even spoil them by having them colorized, even thoughh the thumbnail picture in the Amazon header is colored. Second, formatting for poetry loses absolutely nothing as the size of the page or font is changed. This is especially important for that unique example of \\"concrete poetry\\", \\"A Mouse's Tale\\" which appears in chapter III."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I thought for sure the BBC would get Alice in Wonderland right and to some degree they have. The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story. Surely the BBC could have done better with one of Great Britain's classics!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this version does have illustrations, they are not the original illustrations by John Tenniel, which was what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is of course a classic story that has seen many, many printings. That said, I am very impressed with this edition. The binding is excellent, the paper quality is great (even the dust jacket), the print quality is great, the cloth page-marker is a nice touch, and the size of the book is perfect: classy and noticeable without being too large. I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"What a classic! Everyone knows the story of Alice in Wonderland, made even more popular by Disney years ago. All I knew of Alice was the Disney cartoon and the artwork of Tenniel and Rackham. What I didn't know was the brilliant writing style of Lewis Carroll, the author who created Alice and her Wonderland.Carroll is one of the most clever writers I have read. I kept thinking to myself as I read this book, \\"how the hell did he come up with this?\\" The dialogue is pure genius. I loved every minute of the Mad Hatter and his tea party.The story is very short and without much of a plot, but that is what can be expected of a dream. It's sort of just a walk down the rabbit hole and through wonderland. But in that walk, we meet fascinating creatures; creatures and objects present in the real world, but with a fantastical twist.What I loved more than anything was the book itself. I got a beautiful edition of this book through Dreamhaven, published by Firefly. It was a $30 on sale for $7.95. It's hardcover, clothbound, with thick, high quality paper and illustrations that I've never seen before for Alice.The illustrations are done by Ralph Steadman. His work looked familiar and I found out that he is the artist from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I didn't know what to think of the images at first, but I liked them by the end. They are definitely geared towards a more adult audience, but then again, I forget what it's like to be a kid. He adds a certain edge to the characters. The characters become menacing and bizarre. He gives a great introduction in the book and explains why he drew each one of the images the way he did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I've been looking for these editions since a certain bookstore stopped carrying them a couple tears ago. They are small, about 4x6. So they are perfect for carrying around in your purse or bag for a bit of reading wherever you may go. My book doesn't have the picture on the cover but its almost identical other than that. (I believe the ones with cover pictures came as part of sets.) My copy does have some illustrations inside in black and white.If you want a really cute, small hardcover Alice in Wonderland, perfect for reading anytime, pick this up.***As per the reviewer above... the writing is small. Has to be for the book size! So if you need regular print, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"An occasional review will focus on this point. Alice in Wonderland is no more children's book than, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".The reason this five star book gets less stars occasionally is not because of its contents or purpose; it is because of either being mistaken for a kids book, in which case one wonders why it is forced on kids, or it is so dated that even the reader thinks it is gobbledygook.You will find the book full of references to items of the time and play on words of the time.If you fall into either of these categories then you need to first purchase \\"The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition\\"; this will clear this understandable confusion. Be aware that every sentience is a play on words for a jab at the culture of that time.I will not go through the story, as that is why you are buying this book. However I will say that it is a classic and should be part of everyone's cultural education.When you make it through this book and enjoy it the next challenge should be \\"Alice's Abenteuer Im Wunderland\\" German Translation.If you are also interested in sci-fi then try to get a copy of \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\" by Henry Kuttner.Best of Henry Kuttner \\"Mimsy Were the Borogoves\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a horrible digitalization of a book.

The quality book binding incorporates a built-in bookmark on a ribbon that says \\"Read Me\\", in a delightful complement to this widely beloved story.

I own a print copy but wanted one for my Kindle, especially as access to free classics was a big reason I bought one in the first place. With writing like Caroll's I am not disappointed."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I read \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (hereafter \\"Alice\\") in college during the 1980s. Reading an annotated edition was probably indispensable because without it, I probably would have concluded, like many others, that \\"Alice\\" was an unrestrained, loony, dream-like fantasy - a literal pipe dream. But being in a collegiate, analytical situation, I was expected to plumb \\"Alice\\"'s metaphysical situation for some profound truths. As even the foreward to my \\"Alice\\" version warned, it would be relatively easy to construct a psychological, social, or historical dissertation from the characters and situations 7-year old Alice encounters. In other words, one could read practically any literary theme into the work. Fun as this scavenger hunt might be, I think there's really only one significant theme \\"Alice\\" reinforces - stay young and childlike and innocent as long as you can, because adulthood is harsh and inconsistent and insane.Consider the evidence. Almost every character Alice meets in Wonderland is a pedantic, supercilious, self-important adult that treats her with impatient disdain. Almost every character gives Alice contradictory, unfathomable advice and rules, symbolically underscored by the changes in bodily size and proportions Alice undergoes. We have the declaration from the Cheshire Cat (a relatively innocuous but still didactic adult figure) that everyone in Wonderland is mad to some degree. The authoritative nature of Wonderland's adults culminates in the ultimate authority figure - the utterly but irrationally and impotently tyrannical Queen of Hearts - who screams for beheadings but never accomplishes any. The most humorous denunciation of adult rules and customs arises during the \\"climactic\\" silly trial about some stolen tarts, where legal protocol undergoes zany pretzel contortions. Throughout, the \\"immature\\" Alice sees through the pontifications and does not take Wonderland's sneering condescension lightly, especially during the trial ending when the cards exasperatedly indundate her and cause her to wake from her dream, glad to lying in the grass next to a peaceful summer stream.To be more precise, Carroll championed a prolonged childhood for little girls, since he considered young boys unmannered churls and had a barely respectful fondness for Alice Liddell, to whom he dedicated \\"Alice\\". According to the annotation's foreward, as a minister who toiled in religious privacy, he would often look from his rectory and envy Alice's and her siblings' frolicks outside. With that knowledge, \\"Alice\\" as a Peter Pan-like paean to eternal youth becomes more understandable. What also makes \\"Alice\\" memorable is the bold assertion that a child can weather the eccentricities of an \\"adult\\" world better than most adults can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"this book was very entertaing and is a reallygood classic. its price is awesome so i dont think you can go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A long fall down a deep rabbit hole lined with book selves and small bottles should cause angst in anyone. What happens afterward is even stranger...Is it just me? Why is it that I compulsively analyze books and films only to find myself not enjoying anything?As a man I put away childish things- 1 Corth 13:11. The plight of modern man is that he is condemned to be free-Sartre. Are the aging condemned to be too objective as well?Children have \\"beginners mind\\" as Buddhism tells us. Only children can appreciate the world of Alice. Alice must constantly adjust to a world where size is relative and animals speak in rhymes and dreadful puns.Perhaps Alice herself is too big for the world she is thrust in...a place too silly even for a child.\\"I would say to a travelling fish with what porpoise are you going?\\" Dreadful...The book is supposedly riddled with riddles- conundrums left by Lewis Carroll the mathematician. I never found these layers of riddles or saw the ones I found as particularly important.Carroll, the clergyman left us with an Easter message at the end of the book, but none of the Bible symbolism of C.S. Lewis' Narnia. Wonderland is a place with a hidden God- a land observed by a cryptic reticent caterpillar who may be the persona of the shy Carroll.As the caterpillar asks the befuddled Alice \\"who are you?\\" We are forced to reflect on who we are and what we have become as the oversized Alice did when she looked through the little door towards the hidden garden beyond."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A wonderful tale with exquisite artwork from the original masters.

But I very recently watched the movie (with Johnny Depp) and was curious about the Jabberwocky monster that Alice defeats in the end. I couldn't remember it from the book. It turns out there's no such monster in the book (or in the sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" - as far as wiki tells me).What's marvelous though is everything else that *is* in the book. What other book has created so many characters that live on in our world? The Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Duchess, the Mock Turtle, Alice herself (and this isn't counting all the myriad characters from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" like Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, Humpty Dumpty, the Walrus and the Carpenter... I must read this second book now). \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" comes close, but as a child of British colonial rule, it's Alice's story, not Dorothy's that I remember best.\\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\"Why indeed. I loved all the mad things that happen so casually: the caterpillar smoking, Alice growing and shrinking, the never ending tea party, the \\"Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\\" And I especially loved how there's no moral, no lessons learned, no neat resolution. It only gets \\"curiouser and curiouser,\\" until an army of playing cards rushes at Alice, and she comes awake as if from a dream, her sister brushing leaves from her face."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"If you have not read this classic by Lewis Carroll, then by all means pick up this edition. However, I would caution you that, while the story is similar (excepting one poem as far as I can tell) note that this edition is lacking in the illustrations that make this work especially fitting for children. In that respect, if you are using this Kindle ebook as a means to read the story to your children, I would recommend either a pdf version with pictures or purchasing an illustrated version (they aren't expensive at all at this point). Otherwise, if you are reading this simply to sate your own curiosity as to the actual story or to reread the tale now that you are an adult, then this version is fine and you should be able to get along without the pictures.Don't get me wrong, the pictures are a definite added bonus and classic, but I find it hard to argue against downloading this classic anyway, as, well, its free. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I think it's because I'm not a big fan of Disney's animated Alice, and that kind of put me off from reading the actual story. I also have to admit the unsavory rumors about Lewis Carroll also steered me away from reading this one.I put that aside and decided to finally read this classic. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a delight. As soon as Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I found myself swept into Carroll's lyrical and strange storytelling and didn't stop reading until the end.Alice herself is the one who captivates the reader.\\"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\"After falling down the rabbit hole, Alice encounters some strange characters, the Chesire Cat, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter among them. The encounters Alice has with these characters are funny and strange and I enjoyed the silliness of the story. Interestingly enough, this genre is referred to as literary nonsense.Lewis Carroll was a mathematician and that is evident as you read this story.\\"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is - oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! \\"My favorite chapter was 5, Advice from a Caterpillar.I found it amusing that Alice comes upon a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom, smoking a hookah no less.\\"The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar.\\"I enjoyed this fairy tale and will be reading Through the Looking Glass next."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I bought the book strictly for the artwork of Camille Rose Garcia.

Since I have seen the movie I knew most of the things that were about to happen, but it still kept me wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This version does not include any drawings, but I am not entirely positive the original Alice had illustrations. I know 'Through the Looking Glass' did though. (Please comment if you know so I can edit review).The four star rating is for the actual story itself. It is timeless in a way, but it is short and somewhat bittersweet. I do believe that it is the better story than 'Through the Looking Glass'. In this fantastic story we follow Alice through some interesting adventures in Wonderland. We are introduced to an amazing cast of characters including the Knave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, the white rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the march hare, and several other wacky animals and other beings.I guess the bittersweet impression is because I enjoyed the characters, but they are typically brief. The Mad Hatter is a little more prominent in the story, as is the Duchess, the Knave, and the Queen; but I would have enjoyed more time with the Cheshire Cat and a few others. Also, Alice is quite petulant, and it does get a little old that she continually goes into her little asides and interrupts the stories. Still, some of her comments are quite funny.It's very good, a true and timeless classic. This is a great example of literary nonsense. It's not quite as silly as something like Candide, but more imaginative and fantastic in every way. The Kindle version is very good, and free.

What's up with that?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book is an absolutely splendid read for your inner child. It is down-to-earth enough for younger kids to enjoy, but is also full of logical jokes and play-on-words that adults can crack a smile from. After lazing off during her lessons, Alice is distracted by the peculiar sight of a white rabbit with a waist coat. She follows him down his rabbit hole, and finds herself in Wonderland, a place full of strange characters and substantial anomalies. During her adventures in Wonderland, Alice encounters all sorts of talking animals and seemingly illogical scenarios. The rationalization in Wonderland is slightly skewed, and Alice often finds herself adhering to their strange rules after hearing their unexpected but relevant justification. For example, after getting wet swimming in a pool of her own tears, Alice suggests that she and the group she's with dry off. Her acquaintance, the mouse, proceeds to recite the 'driest' thing he knows.Among other things, Alice meets a hookah-smoking caterpillar, a duchess and her cook (who is perpetually peppering soup,) a mock turtle, a deck of cards, a Cheshire cat, and 'her majesty,' the Queen of Hearts, who is always threatening to behead her subjects but never following through. My favorite aspect of the book was Carroll's witty insights to the way we perceive reality. The story made me question the world we live in, and why things that are considered 'custom' are so widely accepted, How did we even come to decide what qualifies as normal or abnormal anyway?Alice's Adventure in Wonderland was such a breath of fresh air as a book from a child's perspective, and I give it five stars because it was not only thought provoking, but funny and entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics.

It inspired me and I used to play out the story with my dolls and dad's playing cards - such fun to be had and all because of Alice in Wonderland! Alice's character is an inspiration to young and old alike - a young girl who says what she thinks and challenges authority, precocious, open-minded, and possessed of an admirable courage in the face of strange and frightening events. It is a story that appealed to me as a child and at a deeper level as an adult appreciative of the wordplay and rich symbolism contained within.As an adult who has read the illustrated versions, the Kindle title is a bonus that I can store and read at my convenience. But I would definitely prefer the illustrated version when reading to my 5-year-old child.

Wonderful and satisfying rendering for children and adults."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Almost everyone knows the classic tale of Alice in Wonderland. They've either read the book or seen the movies but none of the former publications quite bring Lewis Carroll's story to life like Camille Rose Garcia. The artwork in this story is fantastic! Every page pops and pertains to the scene being described in a nearly perfect fashion. After finishing this version I could not help wondering if I hadn't drifted off and visited wonderland myself.Now, obviously the art is one reason to purchase this book but let's not forget the story itself. Carroll pushes the boundaries of reality, leaving the reader as well as the characters themselves to wonder if what they have experienced is real.This is not your classic fairytale. There is a damsel in distress but she has to save herself. There are kings and queens but no princes to save the day. There is magic without spells and witches. There is life in everything from the animals to cards. There is chaos with a certain amount of order and a dose of fear.The story itself is imaginative and one of the reasons I enjoy books so much. Carroll reveals to us the magic of imagination. Garcia takes this imagination and brings it to life, making it perfect for people of all ages. You've seen Alice, but never quite like this.

The actors are top-notch as are the music and sound effects.The previous reviewer criticized this adaptation for not following Lewis Carroll's original; it's been so many years since I read the original (probably over 30 years) that if there were any changes in the sequence of events I didn't catch it. I will suggest, however, that Lewis Carroll's original be read before listening to this. There are so many whimsical and strange things taking place one after the other, and Wonderland is such a place of pandemonium (captured perfectly in this recording) that someone listening who isn't familiar with the original would probably be quite confused as to what is going on.I highly recommend this for children, families, or anyone who simply enjoys excellent audio dramatization."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"it wasn't quite what i had expected based on the fact that i had seen tim burtons new movie. i did enjoy it though but i was expecting more excitement. i would recommend it to young readers who enjoy adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I thought this book was good.

It was nice to read the book again after many years. The kindle edition does not, however, do any justice to the book.

That was not a detriment to me, as I loved to imagine Alice and her adventures when I was a child.

So ou may be looking for the Ingpen edition but unable to find an Ingpen review.I fell in love with the Ingpen edition when I saw it in the store. Every page turn features an outstanding color illustration by one of the of the world's leading illustrators.In Alice she says:'what good are stories without pictures?' We can read a story without a picture, yet when we have a picture it really helps us in imagining the story, and Ingpen has a great imagination when it comes to the picture story.This is the kind of book you will leave on the coffee table just so you can show it off to your friends. Whether you are a parent or just reading it your own pleasure, I found reading it this way much better. I do own a pictureless version which I never got around to reading.Sterling publishers have published other stories with Ingpen such as the Wizard of Oz. So if you wish to enjoy a classic story and to fire your visual imagination at the same time this is a great way to do it. I passed my version along to a niece and have the occasional pang of regret for having given it away.I highly recommend it, think you will love it and hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book dimensions are appriximately 4x6 inches.

But one too many references to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" made me finally decide I need to know, first hand, what all the fuss was about.Reading a text that has long become embedded into our culture, turns things upside down. I had so long heard of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Rabbit Hole, that I feel like I know these reference when in fact, I don't. Now I do and that is what I got most of the book. Alice's plucky, no nonsense tone is a bracing counterpoint to the ridiculousness going on around her. The Queen cracked me up and I now see where Baron Sasha Cohen's Dictator comes from. As a work of literature, perhaps its charms would have been more intoxicating at age 7 but alas, I cannot turn back time.So I'm glad I read the thing but there was no transport, no insight and my general dislike for children's books and fantasy remains as fortress-like as before I began down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"awesome part one is amazing but, i have the original unbigided version in hard cover from Barns & Noble which was CHEAP!!! looking forard for the complete tales of Edgar Alan Poe i shall say nevermorep.s. i'm nine"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Have never read this classic before.

This is a timeless story that can be appreciated by all generations, and this is a beautiful gift edition that people of all ages will enjoy.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of my favorite stories from childhood. As an adult, I hadn't read the story again, until this book touched my hands. It is even better reading it as an adult because I found so much more in the story than when I was a kid. I appreciate literature more now and Lewis Carroll is one of the best. If I had kids, I'd read this to them before bed or naptime.The illustrator for this special edition of the book does a truly amazing job with the artwork for the story. Camille Rose Garcia is exceptionally talented, and I really hope that she illustrates more books like this in the future. Her artwork is edgy and gothic, which gives this children's tale a more grownup or current vibe than when it was written.I absolutely loved this edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and highly recommend this as a book for everyone to get.

Some of the things they say - like the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter - will make you laugh.Carroll was truly a master in combining logic with humor. From any angle that you look at this book, you will find it enjoyable. No book, I think, has ever been so shrewd and witty. No E. B.

The imaginative phrases and descriptions are enough to keep you going strong until the very end. The numerous descriptions of the different areas of wonderland is pretty cool. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"From the very beginning, the book showed its weirdness. Alice is bored on the riverbank in the company of her sister, and sees a talking White Rabbit walking by. However, she's not amazed by this, but rather by it pulling a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket. Driven by boredom, she follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole, where she falls and falls near endlessly whilst having conversations with herself. Apparently one can pick up cups and pots and place them on shelves while falling at a terminal velocity.The entire motivation for Alice's adventures is the beautiful garden past the small locked door she wishes to enter. Throughout her seemingly random changing of sizes to try and enter the garden, she meets mice, turtles, a caterpillar, a Cheshire Cat, and many other weird creatures. All of them seem to have a quite annoying wit about them that bases itself upon word puns and spellings. Accordingly, Alice's painfully simple logic and way about doing things exposes these puns just about every page. Tale to tail, Tea to the letter \\"T,\\" and other similar things. To brighten things, the Cheshire Cat's demeanor is a little different, but not by much. He, like many other characters, is quite literal and has a cloudy and recondite service to the overall story.And to top it all off, when Alice finally does enter the lush garden, she meets the Queen of Hearts who has a record of both ordered executions and empty words. When she isn't screaming \\"Off with his/her head!\\", she's playing a rather silly, disorganized game of croquet. I would attempt to identify an allegorical message about foreign countries' governing systems in this scenario, but the ridiculous nature of that chapter was just too much.There really was no clear climax, and the resolution didn't suffice--for me at least. What was the main conflict? Not being able to enter the garden? The unfair trial about stolen tarts? If the latter is indeed, then it was never resolved. Personally I believe it was identified at the very start--her boredom.Overall, the adventures weren't that adventurous, and the wit not that witty. Perhaps if you enjoy ambiguity, you will appreciate this book. It's very hard to understand cultural references from a book written over a hundred years ago. Don't read this too critically; take it with a grain of salt--or you'll dislike it like me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really wanted to like this edition of Alice In Wonderland, as I happen to admire Lisbeth Zwerger's art. Unfortunately, there were inconsistencies between the illustrations and the text which marred my appreciation.An example:In the scene where Alice encounters the rather severe and pedantic caterpillar, Zwerger takes a top-down perspective, forcing us to see the creature from above, as we would in everyday life. Zwerger ignores the fact that Alice is the same size as the caterpillar (6 inches) and viewing him from a lower position (he sits on a mushroom, thereby gaining height over Alice). The text even specifies that Alice has to stand on tiptoe to see what is on top of the mushroom. I have always thought it obvious that readers (especially young children) are meant to identify with Alice and see things from her perspective. Instead, we tower over the caterpillar, taking away the unusual perspective that Dodgson would have wished us to have. Tenniel's illustration is faithful to the the text and the child's perpsective; Zwerger's, unfortunately, is not.What is more, with Zwerger's perspective, it is difficult to imagine the caterpillar as a stern, brusque, off-putting character-- much like some adults who have little tolerance for children(\\"Who are _you_?\\"; \\"What do you mean by that?\\"; \\"Explain yourself.\\") The text mentions, among other things, that Alice is rather shy of him. From Alice's (and thus the reader's) perpective, the caterpillar is an intimidating figure. Not so in Zwerger's interpretation, where the caterpillar is not only a diminutive thing, but also a self-conscious-looking thing, puffing nervously on a cigarette.Which brings me to the most glaring and incomprehensible departure from the text: the cigarette. The story clearly indicates that the caterpillar is smoking a \\"hookah\\". Zwerger perversely ignores the details of the story and substitutes hookah for ...a ciggy! Is this artistic license, or sloppiness? Either way, a child reading \\"hookah\\" for the first time will be betrayed by Zwerger's illustration; older readers who like to think the artist should be faithful to the text will find the changes disconcerting and annoying.Together, these inconsistencies dampen the pleasure I might have gained from Zwerger's lovely pictures and Carroll's story.And this was just one picture, from the Alice book only, mind you. I haven't yet looked at those of Oz, but I am too disappointed with the first to try.For the meanwhile, the books remain in their slipcase, in a remote part of the bookshelf, while I enjoy the original and delightful illustrations by Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I really liked Alice's adventures in Wonderland because it is so original!

The story does not suffer, since much of the omitted material is not essential.The quality of the reading by Fiona Shaw is flawless. The numerous sound effects are well done and contribute to enjoying the story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My daughter's name is Alisa( english spelling of the Russian version of Alice) and I always wanted her to get interested in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. But everytime I start reading the book to her( and I tried every possible edtion in Russian, in English, everything I could find both in stores and libraries), she would look through the pictures, listen through the 1st page and promptly loose interest. When I found this edition at our local bookstore I gave the book one more try. My daughter listened as before to the 1st page , looked at the pictures and ... asked me if we can buy it! I almost cried. Finally!Even though I appreciate \\"Alice...\\" for its head-over-heal crazyness, I always thought it was probably too much for a younger child and it was up to the illustrator to breach that gap in helping a child understand. Pictures in this edtion are modern, simple, colorful. The characters are not distorted, they're realistique and cute. So this particular edition has everything to help your child to get excited about this old classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an exciting fantasy novel by Lewis Carroll. His other works include Alice Through the Looking Glass, Phantasmagoria, Sylvie and Bruno, and Rhyme? And Reason? All of which are very creative and imaginative, but his best would have to be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book is enjoyed by most, but fantasy lovers and mature young adults seem to really love it. Once you read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you get hooked and you have to read more. Carroll paints a vivid picture of Wonderland and all of it's crazy inhabitants you find around every corner. Each chapter has a different plot and character even though the complete novel has a pretty well known main idea. Carroll keeps it interesting all through the book. You can really tell that he's trying to get the point across of the world not being perfect and it would be better if people just went with the flow. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. Most of them would enjoy it. It is a really fun, fun book! -Review By Madi Joiner"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"For those looking for illustrations by John Tenniel, the original artist of the book, this is the version that has it. Intentionally reproduced in this ebook format by the publisher, BLTC Press of Santa Cruz, CA in November 2007 who does the Introduction. It appears to be specifically done for the Kindle as in the opening credits it says \\"Release: 1/Kindle.The frequent illustrations are scattered throughout the book, not just at chapter headings.What a wonderful idea to buy a Kindle for an older child and preload a book like this into it ahead of time!Support efforts like this and spend a little extra for these special editions.N.B. I have no connection to any specific publisher. I'm just so excited that Kindle is getting such specific support so early on."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love classic literature to begin with, and so I was sure I would enjoy this book. Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me. Won't read again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I never had any idea where this book was going. I know that in some cases, that may be a good thing, but I'm not so sure it was good in this case. I don't believe that there was much plot at all, nor was there much of a climax. Throughout this whole book, I couldn't help but think to myself that there was something extremely wrong, so to speak, with Lewis Carroll."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"When I first downloaded this book I was a bit disappointed. I had previously purchased BLTC Press's version of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". The illustrations in Wonderland were considerably lower in quality (it was published at an earlier date). I took advantage of BLTC's interest in receiving comments and got a prompt, friendly response. A few weeks later I was notified that the images had been upgraded (how's that for responsiveness to a customer?). I've swapped out the original for the updated version. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I was great to relive a childhood book that just shows how a childs imagination should be. A classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful piece of literature. The characters described by Lewis Carroll make the reader feel part of another world. Alice is a young naive girl who encounters some unfortunate events during her time in Wonderland. I do not agree with responders who say they did not like the book because, I honestly loved this book. All of the characters have their own unique personalities. Even if some of those personalities are strange, they are different none-the-less. This version of the book was more than helpful to me while I was reading it for a school project. The fantastic illustrations kept my imagination alive as I read along.One of my personal favorite characters is the Mock Turtle. When Alice first encounters him, he is singing about Mock Turtle Soup, which is strange because he is singing about a soup made out of his own flesh! The Mock Turtle is one of the characters that the readers will wonder how Carroll could have ever imagined. I enjoy this character because of his strange personality and even stranger way of thinking. Another character that I believe is extremely funny is the Duchess. She is mad; her baby is truly a pig; her servants are insane and her Cheshire Cat has a mocking smile! These are only two of the characters that make this story exciting and compel readers to finish the novel.I was in the musical production of Alice in Wonderland, and I loved the story so much I couldn't keep myself from reading the book! The book had many similarities and differences from the musical, but the general storyline was the same. The main difference from the book to the musical was the elimination of the minor characters. The musical did not include the lizards or the dozen animals that were washed away in Alice's pool of tears. (Just the three birds and the French Mouse!)I would definitely recommend this book to all readers! Young children will not understand all of the adult themes, but the unusual characters and great illustrations will certainly capture their interests. Furthermore, hearing one classic can get them to become more interested in other classics in the future."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Review of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Carroll is a classic fantasy that is wonderful for Middle School students who love to read.This fascinating book is about an adventurous and curious girl named Alice who follows a \\"White Rabbit\\" and mistakenly falls into a long, long hole. When she lands she is in an amazing new land called Wonderland. Wonderland is a world of crazy ideas and unfamiliar rhymes. Alice meets many new characters such as, The Mad Hatter, The Dormouse, The March Hare, The Queen of Hearts, a Duchess, a Gryphon, a footman that is actually a fish, and The Cheshire Cat, as she tries new adventures to get herself back home. She doesn't just meet these characters she also battles with them in a court case which is bizarrely unfair , she plays crochet, and even continually shrinks and grows herself. She gets herself tied up in odd situations but her curiosity carries her onward. In the end Alice discovers something truly amazing!\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a great book for children who love to be urged onward by amazing and fascinating descriptive word choices and crazy creatures. This book is not very difficult but is not easy either. It may seem like a childish book but it really keeps your mind going and thinking about what will happen next. I recommend \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" to anyone. So next time you are at the library or your local bookstore pick up a copy and check it out. Everyone will enjoy Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It was the cover's picture of Alice and the Rabbit that caught my attention to get this book. Out of the many editions I would recommend the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice whith her neat hair, apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others. It is better for readers because novels usually have small fonts which are very hard to read.This book would be awsome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it it paper back. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels. I would not recommend this for traveling because it weighs more then the other paper back novels.You might get another version of Alice in Wonderland because you think that you are not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this book, you will want to read it again and again after you finish."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book is good I like it and I been reading it over and over and over again :) yeahh buddy"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the most creative story that I've read in years. Take a trip to Wonderland and enjoy Alice's adventures."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This review is for the hardcover. Wonderful new illustrations pair with an old classic story for a must-have addition to your home library.The hardcover version begins with Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in a golden afternoon,\\" accompanied by a beautiful illustration of anthropomorphic animals rowing a boat. I had only seen the Disney version as a child and as an adult desired to read the original, then decided to purchas this version because of the illustrations. I was not disappointed. Having been down a rabbit hole or two myself, I greatly enjoyed this nonsensical, imaginative tale. Although pinned as a children's book, the story is equally as enjoyable for the young at heart. Camille Rose Garcia's vibrant, haunting style perfectly compliments the dark whimsical story by Carroll. A full page illustration begins each chapter, numerous small illustrations are interspersed throughout the text, and there is also a two-page beauty in the middle of the book.Would love for Camille Rose Garcia to illustrate Carroll's sequel to this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll was certainly in wonderland when he wrote this story!!!!!!!

Sadly, this edition lacks John Tenniel's artwork, and it's surprising what a negative impact that makes on the story.

Why not just charge us the one dollar up front and save us the disappointment?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I suppose I have nothing to say really about the Kindle version, but what a bizzarre book this is, especially for the time period this was written.

It is a beautiful book. Even if you already own another copy or other copies of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you should add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Audiobook fans might recognize Jim Dale as the narrator of Harry Potter series. He has won two Grammy Awards and seven Audie Awards, and lives up to his reputation in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Dale brings to life this timeless story, giving the iconic book all the justice it deserves. Non only is his English accent comforting and accessible to American ears, he speaks with an ageless authority that instills both comfort and wonder. I can't imagine a better performance! There is something straightforward and comforting about the simple surrealism of Alice.Listeners of any age will revel in Lewis Caroll's book that defined the genre of children's science fiction. Forget the Disney knock offs - Caroll's original words are as entertaining as they were when first written, and his magical realism still delights beyond the wildest dreams of the most talented modern day writers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is one of the best Alice books I've seen in recent years. As soon as it arrived I heard people talking about the illustrations. My friends know I love Alice, and they have come to love her too. I gave this new copy as a gift. The art is fab, and the Alice image is more like the \\"real\\" Alice than the Tenniel Alice, which is very refreshing, I always think of her as real, don't you? If you haven't read Alice for a very long time, read this, dream about the little girl, pretend you are along the trip with her. Forget you're an adult for 2 hours."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was originally written in 1865 and has since been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, including theater and film. If you haven't already done so, isn't it time to introduce this masterpiece to your children?This edition is particularly enjoyable because it is presented like a large picture book, making it a great choice for a large range of ages. Sized at 9\\" x 12\\", beautiful illustrations by Oleg Lipchenko sprawl across every page, bringing the story to life. Broken up into twelve chapters, this is the perfect bedtime book. There is ample adventure and colorful characters afoot to keep children breathless and anxious for the next night's chapter.I think I was first introduced to Alice by the 1951 Disney cartoon. Like most book to movie adaptations, reading the story is so much better. Reading the book allows you to process Carroll's original text and allow your imagination to develop the characters, which makes the story uniquely yours. Here, Lipchenko's illustrations will act as a starting block, but they don't fully create the memory for you, like a movie will do.There is a reason Lewis Caroll's writing is considered a classic - it really does transcend the years. I'm so pleased that Tundra Books is offering this updated edition, so that I may introduce a whole new generation to Alice's adventures via a gorgeous book. I must point out that Oleg Lipchenko's illustrations plus Lewis Carroll's original text serves to make this a spectacular gift choice. Grab a copy and invite your own children to join the tea party and take their chances with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the demanding Queen of Hearts!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"AAW rating: 5Lewis Carroll rating: 5It appears that most of these reviews are reviewing the original book and raving about the illustrations and how wonderful the story is.

Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page.

It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand.

A classic - still modern today - but one better suited for children (as an adult, it made me curious to read an annotated version though, or an essay about different ways to interpret the text's metaphors ; if someone got a suggestion, let me know about it...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a beautiful book and in great shape! My daughter loves this story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It all started when Alice was spending a lazy afternoon on a river bank. Suddenly, she looked up to find a White Rabbit in a waistcoat go hopping by. Curious, she got up to follow him into his hole. Suddenly, she found herself falling down, down, down. And when she landed, she was in Wonderland, a strange place full of even stranger creatures. Yes, the animals all talk. But Alice seems to find herself growing or shrinking whenever she eats something. There's a locked door she can't seem to get through. A Caterpillar demands she recite. She visits the strangest tea party she's ever attended. And she plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts where the penalty for winning is a rather harsh \\"Off with her head!\\" Will Alice ever find her way home?I haven't read this book since I was a child. I remember enjoying it then. And I did enjoy it as an adult as well. The story is just crazy enough to capture the imagination of anyone who reads it. There were a couple times when I felt the book got a tad too repetitive, but for the most part the craziness was always fresh and fun.Plus this was a great excuse for some none sense poetry. While this book doesn't have some of Lewis Carroll's more famous I did enjoy what was here, especially \\"How does the little crocodile improve his shining tale.\\"As an adult, I must admit I found it a bit weirder than I remembered. However, keeping in mind the revelation of the final chapter certainly does help keep it in perspective. Ultimately, this is a classic that kids will still enjoy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"... and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\\" Good advice for reading this book, from the Red King himself.To say that \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a classic would be to state the obvious. Published originally in 1865, it was taken from stories which the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) told to three girls, the daughters of Henry George Liddell, including Alice Liddell who is the basis for the heroine of the stories. The stories inside are wonderful and superb nonsense which appeal to readers of all ages, as long as you don't try to read too much into it. The stories are filled with all sorts of absurdities based on language, logic, math, and parody. If you obtain a copy which has notes that discuss what is being parodied, it will add to the fun, certainly, but it isn't necessary because even without the parody it is still great fun. Also, you can certainly find references online to help find the sources which are being parodied.Other than to say that the book is about Alice's adventures it would be difficult to say that there are any great lessons here, other than perhaps to not take things too seriously. At the same time there are certainly some running themes throughout the stories. Size is a key element at some times Alice is very tiny, and at other times incredibly large, and food and drink are the main triggers for these changes. Sense and nonsense is another running theme as there are those who try to make sense out of the nonsense, and others who just enjoy the ride.The book opens with Alice following the white rabbit down the hole, and plummeting deep into the Earth. She meets many characters in her adventures, like the White Rabbit, a mouse, a lizard named Bill, a Caterpiller smoking a hookah, the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare the Cheshire Cat, the Mock Turtle, the Red Queen, and many others. The adventures include her descent into Wonderland, her loss of identity with her changes in size, her babysitting a baby which turns into a pig, the endless tea-party, a very unusual croquet game, listening to the Mock Turtle's story, and of course the trial at the end.The stories clearly have long lasting influence as well. In books, movies, music, and art, there are countless examples of works based on the Alice Adventures as well as references to them. One thing those works have done is led to some confusion with regards to the Alice stories. Characters like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red Queen are not in this book, but rather in the sequel \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\"."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"i love ralph steadman. his pictorial spin with the classic tale adds a new dimension to the story. this is not your disney princess story book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Tomorrow you will enter a planet where animals talk; you may even feel a bit smaller than usual after drinking a modest drink. There is going to be a door that you may be anxious to go in but not so anxious to drink what's on the table. If you are eager to go inside that door, read Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.Alices Adventures in Wonderland, where do I originate? Let's start at the beginning, Alice walking around in the forest then she sees a cat in a tree and the next thing you know she is in a room with a miniature little door in it and a drink on the table. One sip will do it you are as small as a mouse. Now figuring out that she can now fit into that tinny tiny little door. What will Alice do in that peculiar world with talking animals and cardish people who talk? If you think this book is right for you than run down to the nearest book store and pick up Alices Adventures in Wonderland, but watch out for the queen, she may behead you!I actually have two ideal parts of this book. My first favorite part of the book is when Alice sips the potion which makes her very small. I like it because in the beginning she really wants to get in a very small door and she realizes that she can now fit in that little door. My second favorite part is when she is at the tea party with the Mad Hatter. I like this part because she is so bewildered with what is happening because it is always tea time.The part of the book that makes me chuckle is when Alice is observing the queen play croquet. I think it is amusing because she is playing with these card/people things and if they do anything wrong the queen would behead them. She thinks they are always doing something wrong so, she always is sending people out to behead them.I would recommend this to people who are gloomy or have a bizarre life because; it would probably comfort someone sad up. It would also relate to someone who has a bizarre life because this is a strange book. I think this is for people 10-14 years of age. I give this book 5 stars, so read Alices Adventures in Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As everyone knows the story, the five stars I rated it are for Ralph Steadman's drawings. I've always loved the original illustrations, so it was with some trepidation that I got this book. But I love Mr. Steadman's other work, so I held out hope that this was just as good. And they are - they go great with the story - and manage to be both whimsical and creepy at the same time. I love it. the only thing that I don't like about the book is that it isn't longer - unlike a lot of versions of Alice in Wonderland this one does NOT also include Through the Looking Glass. But it's still great."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, a little girl named Alice wanders off from her sister on the bank to chase after a talking rabbit. Once the rabbit went down a well-like hole, she soon followed, falling down and down for what seemed like forever. At her landing, she appeared in a whole new world, with talking caterpillars, floating/disappearing cats, and food that makes you grow and shrink. Another major aspect of the rising action is when Alice ate a special cake that made her grow extremely large in the rabbit's house. It made her realize how weird this Wonderland was.I enjoyed the beginning of this book because it was very interesting how random organisms were talking, for example, a smoking caterpillar. Another interesting factor was the bottle that read \\"Drink Me\\" and the cake that read \\"Eat Me\\"; the liquid made her shrink while the cake made her grow. Once it got towards the middle of the novel, I got progressively confused. I think this book is a little too random: especially when it goes from the Mad-Hatters tea party to the Queen's croquet match. The transitions from each scene made it confusing to read because it went too fast. Another reason this book is confusing is because it was written in 1865 and some of the language is outdated. The style of Lewis Carroll's writing is creative, but extremely odd. I didn't understand some parts of the book, like when Carroll puts parenthesis throughout the dialect; overall, it was too obscure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Who know what \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Alice Through the Looking-Glass\\" are about?

A human's mind is such a complex thing; it helped us reach what we are today, surrounded by technology, art, architecture and whatnot. It's sad that eventually most of us grow out of this childhood way of thinking. We want to become mature, ignore the silly things we used to like when we were young. We tend to go towards \\"mature\\" things that eventually end up transforming us into boring, monotonous creatures that live in a depressing daily routine.

He was best known, however, as a author - writing under his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" - commonly referred to as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - was first published in 1865. Alice, of course, was based on a real person - Alice Liddell, whose father was the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and the Dean of Christ Church College.Sitting by a riverbank on a warm day with her sister - who has her nose buried in a book - Alice is bored beyond belief. So, when a fully-clothed, watch-carrying White Rabbit comes charging past, commenting how it's going to be late, she's obviously a little curious. Only a moment after the Rabbit had disappeared down a rabbit-hole, Alice herself jumped right in to find out what was happening. After a long trip down, she touches down in Wonderland...though, unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the Rabbit to get away. Still, she finds the key to a door leading off the hallway she's standing in...if only she were small enough to fit through it.I vaguely remember having read it as a kid, and I liked the Chesire Cat much more now than I did then. (I've always been a dog lover, but I may have felt honour-bound to dislike all *cats* as a kid. Still, Alice could have been a more discreet in bragging about her cat Dinah to a mouse and various birds...) My favourite characters, however, were the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. A short and easily read book overall, and one that really doesn't take too long in getting through. (However, having read up a bit more about the book, there seems to have been a lot of parodies, in-jokes and hidden references written into the book - most of which were lost on me. It didn't stop me enjoying the book though)."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love it! It is just like the movie that just came out, except a lot more describtive.

It is about ayoung girl dreaming about her own world. She is chasing a funny littlerabbit. As she follows this rabbit he leads her to many different adventures! A great book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll is a great author for kids and he represents a completely new phase in children's literature. Children are children and they only have grown-up age in front of them as a limited world and a perspective, the latter of which they may change when they are grown up by remembering what childhood was for them and the tales they entertained when they were children in order to tell them to a new generation of children. Lewis Carroll leads Alice into a world where everyday objects and animals, but also strange objects and animals, mix. Everything is right and wrong at the same time. Too small or too big. Everything speaks and tells stories or sings songs that remind Alice of songs she knows but that come out strange and distorted. This whole world of wonderland is a suddenly animated pack of cards in a doll's house and doll's garden. But at the same time Lewis Carroll invests the fears and the fantasms of the child into this world. We then can have and see a father figure and a mother figure that loom high in this world and represent a completely aborted sense of justice. Alice, the child, becomes the one who puts things together and back to straightness by just dreaming this disrupted world awake. She only nostalgically remembers the fascination that was hers and the strangeness that was that world's. Waking up brings her back to normality and clears this wonderland of the menaces it contained. Lewis Carroll is a genius when he thus depicts a world of fear and frustration and shows how this world can become marvellous in real life because it is the antipodes of everyday regular society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I ordered this book twice and both times received the wrong book.

Honestly, I wasn't that impressed. I suppose I thought it would be a typical situation--that the book would be so so much better than the movies. It was fine. It just wasn't as magical as I imagined it would be. The movies are always so visually striking and I thought Carroll's descriptions a bit flat.Obviously, the story is a classic non-sensical tale and it is good. I did especially enjoy the Mock Turtle's puns tales of the sea with slight variations on the words. My daughter enjoyed it.

Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them.I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book. I thought the novel would have a different story than the movie. From a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 7. Just because it was interesting and reminded me of the past."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As a person who likes to collect different illustrated versions of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, this edition by Angel Dominguez (Artisan, 1996) is perhaps the best that I have encountered so far. There are many full page illustrations that are simply amazing to look at. With a detailed style that occasionally reminds me of Graeme Base, he populates &quot;Wonderland&quot; with all sorts of exotic birds and animals, some of which aren't usually included in illustrated versions of Alice, such as anteaters, platypuses, hippos, etc. But they lend an air of strangeness to this imaginary world that nonetheless seems to be appropriate. The artist has included a number of unique touches to the world of Alice, and they all fit in wonderfully with the spirit of the book. I would definitely say this book is worth buying for your &quot;Alice&quot; collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This classic tale is the best of them all!

A particularly glaring example is the Mouse's tale. In the original, this poem is rendered in a series of indented lines of dwindling point size, curling to and fro across the page in the shape of a mouse tail. In this free Kindle edition, the Mouse's tale is flattened into a single paragraph, not even indented like a poem. Furthermore, this edition leaves out the prefaratory poem entirely.Unpleasantly, this edition also uses ASCII typography throughout: \\"straight quotes\\" instead of curly quotes, em dashes rendered as a pair of hyphens (--), and so forth.Read this book in a better edition, like the far superiorThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions), which unlike this edition, is complete, includes both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, illustrations (by Tenniel, Holliday, and Carroll), and annotations. (The Kindle Master Edition also does not reproduce the typographical tricks to render the Mouse's tale as a tail, though it does at least format it decently like a poem.)For a less portable version with full typographic fidelity, plus outstanding annotations explaining details of Victorian manners and culture parodied within the Alice books, I heartily recommendThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While this is generally considered a &quot;children's book&quot;, Alice In Wonderland can only be fully appreciated by adults or teenagers. It contains so many private jokes, grammar puns, and other such stuff that a child would not understand it, really. I first read it when I was in first grade, a rather hard book really for first graders, and loved it incredibly. But rereading every year of my life since then (I am now fifteen) one finally can truly relish the great puns and imaginative ideas that Carroll (or Dodgson, his real name) placed within this extremely random book. Yes, there really isn't much of a single plot. It jumps from place to place. Just like a real dream. I don't understand why some people think that this is &quot;scary&quot; for little children though. C'mon, the Wizard of Oz and Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall- if little children aren't afraid of THAT, I don't what would scare them) is more frightening than this beautifully-crafted story. Note that the Queen of Hearts, though she has an insatiable urge to decapitate every person she sees, never really kills anyone- the Griffin says so. It's not frightening, rather, it's full of what little children like- randomness, smiling cats, violent-tempered queens, talking rabbits, and imaginary animals. If one is discovering this book for the first time, let it enchant you. If you are re-discovering this book, find in it the things you couldn't find before. If you are simply re-reading it for the fiftieth time (like me), then enjoy every single moment of it. It really is one of the best books I have read, right up there with- dare I say it- Colour Purple and Les Miserables. Yes, even Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an unabridged audiobook production of Lewis Carroll's classic children's storybook of a young girl lost in a magical land of fantasy. Read aloud by Grammy and Audie Award-winning performer Jim Dale, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a delightful performance that adroitly captures this whimsical spirit of the story. Highly recommended as a giftbook to listeners of all ages, as well as for public library audiobook collections. 3 CDs, 2 hours 57 minutes."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book is delightful, but I'm not talking about the story of Lewis Carrol itself. I'm talking, literally about the book -- its size, texture of pages, color of endpapers, texture of dustcover, that it has a built-in silky bookmark and so on. (This is one book in which it is the right thing to do to judge a book by its cover.) I'm also referring to the extra material, though. First are the illustrations which are really cool. Then there is plenty of commentary on the illustrations. There is also commentary on the Author, Illustrator, Foreward writer and even commentary on the typography of the book. Finally, the Foreward is amazing. I don't know if I agree with all that the Foreward writer says, but that Foreward sure helps to build your vocabulary. I've had six philosophy courses and I still had to look up dozens of words in the Foreward. Really advanced, arcane or even never-heard-of words -- why?, beats me. You would need a Ph.D. in literature to know all the words without a dictionary. So whether you're an adult wanting to increase your vocabulary or you want to buy a nice little book that is a delight itself in its physical being as a book, this is the Alice to buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Young Alice has never been a patient child. Therefore, as she is sitting along the riverbank, listening to her sister drone on and on as she reads passages from a slightly boring book, Alice begins to find her mind wandering. After all, this particular book has no pictures to capture the eye. Alice begins thinking about doing something else, making a daisy chain, or climbing a tree, but she's too lazy to leave her comfortable spot. So, as she gazes about her, she finds herself drifting off to sleep, and soon she has spotted a White Rabbit dressed in fancy garb. She begins chasing the elusive rabbit, but quickly finds herself falling down a very deep rabbit hole that she had not seen previously. Alice is frightened as she tumbles down and down, but soon finds herself in a new world. A world not filled with dirt and daisies, but, rather filled with long hallways, and houses that are smaller than Alice herself. Soon, Alice begins encountering characters of all shapes and sizes. To the confusing Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, to the riddle-loving, smiling kitty known as the Cheshire Cat; all the way to the delightfully zany Mad Hatter who loves throwing tea-parties, and the vicious Queen of Hearts. But, as Alice continues wandering through this wondrous world of magic, where animals talk and dance, and even dress in fancy clothes, she begins to wonder how on earth she will ever find a way out of this backwards environment, and back to her sister, sitting upon the riverbank. For even though lazing about on the riverbank can be incredibly boring, sometimes it is preferred when your life is in danger by an evil ruler.I do not have to tell you how much I adore the tale of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Since I was a young child I have been enamored by Alice's adventures to Wonderland, where she met an array of lovable characters who made you question the sanity of this backwards place, and the people who reside there. From the film to the pop-up books, and everything in between - Alice has been something I have cherished. Therefore, when I stumbled upon Alison Jay's newest edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I could not pass up the opportunity to call it my own. The perfect thing about this edition is that the font is quite large, which makes it easier for younger readers to enjoy the tales of Alice on their own. The second thing I adore about this edition, of course, are the illustrations. Alison Jay is a magnificent artist who has laced almost every page with full-color illustrations of Alice and the various people and things she encounters during her trip to Wonderland. From the intelligent Caterpillar, to the delicious pink-frosting covered cupcakes she shares with the Mad Hatter at his tea party; and the delightful, yet strange game of flamingo and hedgehog croquet played with the Queen of Hearts, to Alice's trial with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle. Each and every illustration is enjoyable to look at, and truly brings Lewis Carroll's words to life. A colorful new ALICE IN WONDERLAND edition, that puts a new spin on the timeless tale.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is my preferred copy of AAIW, and I have several. The quality of the illustrations is superior, because they were made from recently excavated printing blocks. The result is they reveal greater detail than I had seen before, leaving me more impressed than ever with John Tenniel's talent--as if Lewis Carroll's wasn't enough. A beautiful, beautiful book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The BLTC Kindle edition is an EXCELLENT choice - 5 stars. 5 stars is also for the original book. The free Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"While the tale is the same as all other volumes of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the illustrations by Yayoi Kusama make it unusual and more beautiful than can be imagined.

The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book.

First of all this classic is beautifully presented here. Good paper, good print always add to the pleasure of reading. This volume could well become a beloved family heirloom passed down to generations not yet born.This book like many classics should be read several times in our life time. As a child for the wonder and adventure of it all. Later, for insight into human nature including our own. I suggest we read Alice every 5 years, not that I ever did, but I wish I had.As we age, or mature if we are lucky, we glean important insights we might have missed as children. Sometimes by living, sometimes by reading.

If anyone is wondering how this book relates to any of the movies it has some basis but as usual the book is much better."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"We all know what happened to poor Alice when she fell down the rabbit hole? Or do we?This is definitely not Disney's Alice in Wonderland or Tim Burton's wickedly awesome version of the tale. This is it... the real deal.I've been meaning to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for a few years now (you'd think I would've read it as a child, but nope, back then I was into Stephen King haha) and I chose this edition in particular because I fell in love with Camille Rose Garcia's illustrations. With it's fun-shaped narratives and two-page, colorful layouts scattered throughout. Originally I thought it was a shorter version of the novel, but to my joy and delight, it was the full story, so this is definitely one that I'm showcasing in my bookshelf at the moment.As for the story, well, it's complete nonsense of course, but that's the great thing about it. There are talking cats who disappear all but their grin. There are sneezing babies that turn into pigs. There are mock turtles, dodobirds, gryphons and hookah-smoking caterpillars. There is painting the roses red, a queen who won't think twice before yelling \\"off with his/her head\\", there are dormouse's with sleeping disorders who hang with nutty hatters and crazy hares. Oh, and did I mention Alice's problem with height... yea, the poor girl.Jibberish I tell you. But that's the fun of it. I would call it an organized mess. There really is no rhyme or reason to it, and that's exactly what makes it such a delight to read. Very imaginative, colorful and amusing - and I personally could not help feeling \\"curiouser and curiouser\\". I read it rather quickly too, as it's not very long.All in all, this was a very peculiar read, one that I can say is fun, whimsical and a classic that should be read at least once in your life.And one last thing, does anyone actually know:Why IS a raven like a writing desk?!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's story of the young girl Alice who chases a rabbit down a hole and discovers a completely new, beautiful, surreal, yet, dangerous world is a tale beloved by both children and adults. There are countless editions of the story available. This one is published by Templar Books and is illustrated by Rodney Matthews. The book comes in a wonderful hardcover slipcase. The illustrations that accompany the story are quite lavish and capture both the absurdity and fright that is an intricate part of Wonderland. The book includes at least one or two full-color, full-page illustrations for ever chapter as well as smaller, black-and-white illustrations of a quarter-page or less about every other page. Very young children (probably 4 and under) might not enjoy this particular edition of the story because there aren't enough \\"pictures\\". However, it is an ideal book for slightly older children as well as an edition to read to younger children. This isn't the best illustrated version of the Carroll's story, but it's not too shabby either."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"With the introduction of Tim Burton's new movie, there is brand new interest in Lewis Carroll's 140 year old dream trip down a rabbit hole. My first choice for an edition of the book (in print) is, most definitely, this volume. It is remarkably illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. Her wonderful painted illustrations imagine a troubled, hurting universe of the noteworthy characters - the Red Queen, the Dodo Bird, the caterpillar with the hookah.... Her surreal approach to art is unforgettable...rather like the explosion of emotions in first glimpsing Picasso's \\"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\\", the floating portraits of Chagall, or the folded clocks of Dali. Put in another way, the art in this volume of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" stays in your mind for a very long time. And because of that, the writing of Lewis Carroll does too.My second choice is the edition illustrated by the unbelievably talented black and white photographer - Abelardo Morell.Many will recommend the \\"Annotated Alice\\" [or even the \\"Annotated Hunting of the Snark\\"] but I think that's not the first way to experience Lewis Carroll. Second time around...yes...but \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" should be heard or read without footnotes, so that each person can interpret it individually and creatively.As for an audiobook, there is a very fine reading by Jim Dale, famous for his versions of 'Harry Potter.' Personally, I prefer the splendidly wicked audio version by Joan Greenwood ...but, alas, this is only available in cassette tape.Those who have never read the unabridged \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" will find it mind-bending...like first hearing Einstein's theory of relativity. No cheating allowed. The masterpiece has never been successfully translated into film. So, if you fail to experience it in the original, \\"off with your head.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"good book for my kid cousins.

First, it was much shorter than I expected. It wasn't nearly as dark as I expected. And I had no idea how it would end. Much has been written about it and it has been over-analyzed beyond belief. I didn't read any of the commentary on it and don't intend to unless one of you sends me a convincing argument as to why I should.My expectations must have come mostly from the 1951 Disney movie. And I expected a darker movie. Maybe I should see the movie again, as and adult and see if I still think it is so dark.I would encourage you to read it, if you have any interest at all.BTW, the version I read looked different from this one, but I couldn't find it on Goodreads or Amazon.

The entire book was just nonsense, yes I realize that's the point, but I really felt like there was nothing or little to be gleaned from it. I liked Through the Looking Glass a lot more. It too is about Alice's adventures in Wonderland and is also an imaginative little book, however Through the Looking Glass had more structure and was more interesting. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a lot closer to the Disney cartoon version than I would have thought. So I guess maybe if you liked the Disney movie this book is for you? Too much nonsense for me. It jumped around so much I just kept zoning out then I would have to reread to try and figure out what had just happened. It was definetly a struggle for me to finish. It was plotless so I never really got into the book or emotionally attached to any of the characters.

I decided to read the fairy tale on the kindle as it was offered on Amazon for free. I watched the movie when I was a child and wanted to read the story behind the film. Since it is aimed at children the story is easy to read. But still recommended for adults! Once you start reading you quickly get enchanted by the exciting journey through a fantasy world full of curious creatures and places. Adults might love the dark and frightening side of the story. Indeed, Alice is totally alone and needs to survive. I really like the fantasy creatures in the book. Especially the Cheshire Cat which represents the crazy world in a very good way. One easily understands the strange feelings Alice must get while speaking to the cat.Unfortunately, the book on the kindle does not come with illustrations. I think they would help to inspire your imagination. But this doesn't take anything away from the story.If you compare the movie and the book, I think both are great. Since I have not finished the book yet I cannot make a final comment on this.

I enjoyed the book all over again and would recommend it to friends and family. the price was right"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This book was very enjoyable and made me think about when I was a little girl and watched the Disney version while making up my own wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Written in 1865, this classic is a tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by creatures who assume human characteristics.'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late, the Rabbit say to itself..and when he actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurried on and popped down a large hole, curious Alice, went after it never considering how she was to get out again.Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? She tried to curtsey as she spoke...Ma'am is this new Zealand or Australia?... \\"Curiouser and curiouser\\" cried Alice... Now I'm opening like a largest telescope...Good-bye, feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.... When suddenly thump, thump, the rabbit was still in sight as it turned the corner saying..Oh dear! Oh dear! How late it's getting... ( from the book)And it goes on and on...and on. Of course the plot and the narrative are totally nonsensical but if you let your imagination roam and let yourself fall into its spell you will be transported along with Alice to a magical world with its memorable characters such as Mad Hatter having tea parties, and the terrifying Queen of Hearts threatening to behead everyone. You will meet Cheshire the cat, the turtle, the Duchess, Bill the Lizard, the Mouse, the Dodo, the Lory and Caterpillar and many more weird characters all the while growing and shrinking from drinking lotions and potions saying \\"Drink me\\". Ultimately you will move around very fast and achieve nothing...till you wake up and realize this was all but a dream...This adventure has inspired numerous comic books, films, TV movies through countless adaptations and hundreds of editions of the book throughout the years. This story was one of the freebees on my e-reader so I decided to give it a go. Early in I missed the visual aspect I have always associated with Alice, but as my imagination kicked in and the characters came alive, it became easier to understand the humour and wits that played within the words and admit it was a refreshing experience. However my fondest memories take me back to the animated version created by the late Walter Disney and his Studios. Who ever said a picture is worth a thousand words really knew how to leave a lasting impression in a little girl's mind"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My Aunt gave me a BedBook Classics Alice n Wonderland Bedbook for my Birthday and I feel in love with the format.

Kippy Lampkins"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice is of course a well known classic, having spawned many spin-off movies & sci-fi stories & it's well referenced by many intelligent people who love this kind of silliness. It's been one of my favorite books since I first read it in high school because I had finished The Hobbit & a friend told me I had to read Alice. Like Tolkien, Lewis Carroll creates a very complete world that quickly draws you in & that you can return to at any time & feel like you've always been there. For me, I can't really remember what it was like to have not read Alice. It's very much like what a critic/scholar of Shakespeare once said of the bard \\" Shakespeare is in the air....\\" Alice is as well.....& in your head..........& under the ground..........."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I purchased two copies of this delightful book. Two, because I wanted to keep one for myself (even though I have small children, it is actually MINE! I share it with them if their extra good...!) and give one to a colleague as a thank you gift (another adult!). Nancy is a renown doll artist, with a high level of both imagination and skill. The book's illustrations are photographs of Nancy's amazing hand-crafted dolls and sets. This process creates a unique half-fantasy, half-reality image you feel as though you could step into. So, my recommendation is~ when purchasing this book as a gift, get one for yourself to get lost in as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It amuses me that this is listed as being for \\"ages 9-12.\\" Really? I read this (and the sequel) as an adult and loved it. It thoroughly deserves its status as a classic and can be enjoyed by adults and children alike."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I had always thought that I knew Alice's story. I had watched the 50's Disney animated movie and suffered the ensuing nightmares during my childhood and those memories stuck with me. When I actually read the book I found not so many discrepancies, as is usually the case when going from adaptions to sources, but a whole additional layer of complexity and humor. Indeed, while the movie makes a great (if terrifying) children's movie, the book makes for great entertainment for all ages.If you haven't ever read the book, and especially if all you know about the story is its many adaptions, you are selling yourself short. This is a charming, odd, and softly humorous story that is both short and captivating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Here is another excellent full-cast dramatization from the BBC; with an emphasis on the wacky, surreal aspects of Lewis Carroll's fantasy classic \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" The sound effects are used to great advantage here; especially whenever Alice (excellently portrayed by Sarah-Jane Holm) eats or drinks anything and changes size; from small to tall and back again. This adaptation even has bottles, cupboards, and food talking back to Alice!This BBC dramatization is likely to leave the listener feeling slightly disoriented; which is precisely how Alice felt in Wonderland. The cast, led by Sarah-Jane Holm, is superb; especially The Caterpiller, The Queen Of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter. As portrayed here, the celebrated Mad Tea Party with Alice, the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse almost goes over the edge into total insanity."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"my daughter thought the book is good but not to good.

This is a must read book for teenagers and adults expecialy, maybe a little difficult for children. It allows your mind to go on an adventure. I truely admire Lewis Carroll as he points out all the characters leaving the mind full of imagination. The peculiar white rabbit Alice follows in the tunnel leads her to meet all kinds of different characters.Alice gets bigger and smaller through out the whole book as she drinks and eats all kinds of things. The characters make you smile such as the Duchess, Caterpilar who smokes but is wise, Chesire the Cat , lobsters who love to dance, the Mad Hatter, The King and the Queen of Hearts.

As she had a birthday coming up, I immediately set out to find the perfect hardcover edition. I already owned a copy with black and white illustrations so I really wanted something with color. Many of the books were charming but also seemed geared toward a younger audience. Then, I discovered this edition illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. I was struck by the unique drawings of what I immediately dubbed \\"Goth Alice.\\" I knew that my artsy \\"tween\\" would love this copy!(which she did!)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Camille Rose Garcia's work, in this new edition of Lewis Carrol's Alices Adventures in Wonderland, is amazing. Her characters and color pallet add even more enchantment to one of my all time favorite stories."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a magnificent edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The binding is very good quality, the pages have the gold edging, and the book itself also has the front and back cover illustrations. For me the last is important, as we bought this book for our 9 year old son, and we always remove the book sleeve covers from his books before he reads them. (Children are not always kind to book sleeves.)The pages are of high quality paper and the illustrations and print are crisp. Also, the book stays flat when opened at all times, very important for children.Best edition I have seen of this classic, and very good for children to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"One of my two-year-old daughter's favorite movies is a made-for-television version of Alice in Wonderland, so after watching the movie several hundred times I thought maybe it was time to read the book. Though I show a book cover, I actually read this book using DailyLit, a website that sends excerpts of classic literature to my email once a day, which I wrote about in another blog post.I found the book to be an enjoyable romp through a world of nonsense and fantasy, though at times a bit dour as many of the characters did not seem all that happy. I understand that Alice is a child in the story, but I still find it difficult to understand how children can be as lacking in intelligence as she is throughout her adventures - I don't recall being quite so foolish as Alice is at this age. My favorite part of the book was actually after Alice exits Wonderland and sits with her sister, telling her all about her travels. I was able to appreciate the story more once I found an entry in Wikipedia on the novel that explained much of what I did not understand, such as the various poetry recitations and songs, the real people that the characters were parodied after, the mathematical concepts explored, and the elusive answer to the Hatter's riddle, \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\" Answer: \\"Because it can produce a few notes, though... they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front!\\"Perhaps I have been disillusioned to the magic of this novel thanks to a combination of Disney's animated film and my daughter's obsession with her movie, but I would rate this book as a decently entertaining read, not one of my favorites. Though ,I am greatly looking forward to the upcoming movie Alice in Wonderland that stars Johnny Depp!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"A high quality book with beautiful cover. I would have preferred more illustrations because I am reading it to my Alice obsessed 4 year old. She starts to lose interest with the text being quite adult. The quality of the illustrations are high and most suitable for older children at the stage where they can read it alone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I have always loved this book and Jim Dale is a wonderful narrorator. Excellent purchase!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"As a child, Disney's Alice in Wonderland was my favorite movie. I loved the colors and the nonsensical fun. Carroll's novel does not lack in amusement; however, the book is far more than the silly story I know from my childhood. At a deeper level, the book is full of fascinating symbolism that mirrors political strife and unraveling social norms of Carroll's time. I truly believe that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has something to offer readers of all ages, from a child's bedtime story all the way through adulthood. It's a relatively easy read, very funny, and includes no questionable content. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's classic story. Nothing more, nothing less.

I felt like I was visiting an old friend by the way it is written. The way some of the wildlife are described gives the feeling of a personel relationship with them, such as the grizzly crippled by a gunshot.The descriptions of what it is like to live in such a place could be right out of our country's past years ago.The author does an excellent job of expressing her feelings about the natural world that surrounded her in this unusual place...a place so few have visited but so many dream about.The way she described how the scientist conduct their field research to monitor the grizzly, wolf, mountain lion, and coyote gives us a view into their scientific world, but on a personal point of view with some very humorous stories.If you've never been to a semi-remote place surrounded by beautiful mountains, variety of wildlife, or interesting people, buy this book and it will take you there."},{"Title":"Of Bears, Wolves and Men: In Homage to the Wild: The North Fork of the Flathead, Montana","review":"The gorgeous imagery of the West is what makes this so incredibly amazing.

It describes different herbs, their uses and how to plant them. I have to admit, though, that I bought it for the illustrations by Tasha Tudor.

Nice book."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's Kitchen Gardens","review":"Cute black and white illustrations, and great info on the various culinary herbs.

The faster means of communications have set into motion such rapid sources of transportation for men and material, which were far beyond the imagination of the earlier generations of human race. The enormous speed in the movement has brought forth revolutionary changes in the ideology and mode of living and it has created a cosmic society with socio-economic interdependence of nations. The problems relating to human life on earth, and its progress cease to be local. So every problem, pertaining to any single nation or to the human race as a whole, has its causes and effects inter-connected and thus become the concern of international importance.The supersonic means of communications have not brought about revolution only in the economic structure of the world, but they have carried with them vital changes and exchanges of thoughts and religious ideologies. The huge exodus of populations from comparatively economically depressed countries to prosperous countries has resulted in intermixing of populations at global scale. These changes have necessitated the learning of each other's cultures, languages and religious ideologies.The West with its economic superiority and political freedom has gained sway over most of the Eastern countries. Particularly, the general Muslim public has been increasingly getting strongly influenced by materialistic thoughts and irreligious life of the West. The necessity of learning English language, which promised the bright future for the Muslim population, made them neglect and even forget the necessity and importance of learning their own mother tongues and the languages such as Arabic and Persian in which are, treasured the original and basic knowledge of their faith.The endeavor of Professor (Dr.) Syed Vickar Ahamed to translate the Holy Qur'an in English is perhaps the greatest achievement of his life. The exact and precise translation of one language into another is not possible, particularly, when we are dealing with erudition, scholarly contents, richness, ineffable eloquence, and unsurpassable beauty of Arabic language of the Holy Qur'an. Prof Ahamed has put his best efforts with erudition to present the translation of the Holy Qur'an in an easily comprehensible, lucid, and precise manner explaining the ocean of inspiration and wisdom to the youth of the Muslim Umma. This undertaking will facilitate understanding and learning of Miracle of Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) till the Day of Judgment. The Holy Qur'an is a complete code of life for humanity providing divinely guidance for entire spectrum of human life. It should be remembered that the worldly education without accompaniment of religious education is an unmitigated curse for humanity.The book of glassy paper with flowery design of embroidery all around it and the presentation of the Qur'anic knowledge in its fullness with sublime beauty of its contents in the center, makes it irresistibly attractive and worth reading.I am immeasurably honored to write a review about sustained and tireless efforts of Prof Ahamed for the translation of the Holy Qur'an in English.Professor Tasneem H KazmiCity University of New YorkJanuary 7, 2002."},{"Title":"Interpretation of the Meaning of the Glorious Qur'an (Arabic Edition)","review":"This is simply a great interpretation of the Quran, the religious book for the Muslim faith. Whether you are Muslim or not, this book provides a clear explanation of the Arabic text. Mr. Ahamed's version is much clearer than other versions of the English translation that I have read. In fact, I think this translation is probably suitable for any reader who has even average vocabulary skills. The Shakespearean &quot;thee's&quot; and &quot;thou's&quot; that appear too frequently in other translations are thankfully eliminated here, creating a much easier to understand book. The Arabic text is side-by-side with the English, with each Arabic &quot;ayat&quot; next to the English sentence that is it's translation. The artwork in the book is also magnificent and inspiring. Another feature I liked about it was that the index not only had a reference by the title of the surah, but also by subject - so if you wanted to read only about the subject of treachery, you could look it up and then find the passages in the Quran that dealt with that issue. All in all, I highly recommend this book to all Muslims and others who want to learn more about the religion."},{"Title":"Interpretation of the Meaning of the Glorious Qur'an (Arabic Edition)","review":"Once in a while we are touched by words, thoughts, insights that enable us to suddenly see what was hidden - though always present - within our realm. And the world is a little lighter - so is the heart. That is exactly the impact of reading the &quot;Interpretation of the Meaning of the Glorious Qur'an&quot; by Syed Vickar Ahamed. The interpretation is alluring and flows with a rythmn that takes the willing learner into a an inspired spiritual journey. The book is precise and elaborate, giving the reader breadth and scope of the inescapable brilliance of the Glorious Qur'an.In addition, the reader is treated with the visual delight of the splendor of Islamic Art to which words do not do justice. It is probably the most beautiful presented book I have seen.I am inspired. I recommend this book to all, without reservation - espcially to young readers (of all faiths) who would like to gain in-depth understanding and insight of the Incomparable Qur'an. It's a keepsake book that you will want in your library for your future generations to cherish.

I'm glad that there are people willing to live and work in the rainforest to learn these herbal cures and preserve them, because I know I wouldn't be. I'm a city boy at heart; as far as I'm concerned, the entire purpose of thousands of years of developing civilization is to learn how to keep &quot;the great outdoors&quot; OUTDOORS.

Each chapter starts with a quick note on unique Mayan herbs and identifies their healing properties. This alone is a treasure. Sastun also gives an insightful, sensitive look into the character a true healer who deeply cares for his patients, mourns his lonliness, yet is energized by his spiritual support he receives in his healing and the thankfulness of his humble, hard-working and trusting Mayan patients. Personally, I loved this book... it reads quickly and easily, is beautifully written with touching humor and is remarkably uplifting."},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"I can only be grateful that Rosita Arvigo took on this challenge. Her own interests and career in alternative healing practices melded with those of a Mayan traditional healer. She was able to learn from Don Elegio and tap from his knowledge and experiences of his 60 year practice. And all of this essentially time critical, before further destruction of the rainforest and to memorialize Don Elegio's vast knowledge. Here's a real first-hand account of the search for medicinal cures in a rainforest, something we hear about in the media but never quite sure what it all entails. &quot;Sastun&quot; presents a realistic view of an American relocating and establishing a life in a Central American rainforest. One gets a glimpse of the life in a small Belizean village--the meld of Mayan and Catholic culture and the important role that a healer plays in this scene. We're visiting Belize soon and we'll make a specific point of visiting Ix Chel Farms and meeting Rosita Arvigo for a walk down the Panti Medicinal Rainforest Trail. I can only appreciate all that she has done in Belize in furthering the status of traditional healers in Belize and grounding it in science"},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"This book was written very well, but was still packed with ethnobotanical information and experiences. It read like a novel. I enjoyed witnessing the change in Arvigo as she became more accepting of Maya beliefs and less fixated on the thinking of american practitioners; the struggle she had with changing her thinking process and finally being able to kind of mush them together into her own way of healing. For example at first she would introduce a plant and what it was used for and how it had a certain chemical(s) in it that would give it that healing property. But as she learns more about the plants she has to adopt a spiritual understanding on how these plants work to heal. And I loved the ending!"},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"Sastun, is the amazing memoir of an American women's adventure into a renewed way of life as she transports herself and her family deep into the jungles of Belize. Rosita Arvigo, and Italian/Assyrian woman from Chicago, together with her husband and daughter, make the difficult decision to leave the hustle and bustle of today's modern society to attempt a new life by homesteading and opening up a health facility in South America. Rosita is trained in naprapathy medicine, a sort of chiropractic massage therapy, and her husband is a trained paramedic.Together they purchase a large many acre plot of jungle in Belize, spend years clearing the land as they set up practice, and live like pioneer settlers integrating themselves into this new world of backbreaking work and daily battles with sweltering heat, insect infestations, creeping jungle flora, perpetual damp and mold, and local diseases. Hearing of a local Mayan medicine man, Rosita makes his acquaintance and from that moment on, becomes determined to learn natural and spiritual healing to accompany her already trained hands.After meeting Don Elijio Panti, Belize's renowned healer and Shaman, Rosita falls in love with the 90 year old sage and soon begins a long lived friendship and apprenticeship in which she will sacrifice much time to slowly learn the ways of the forest, train herself with Elijio's guidance, breathe the natural world around her, and learn to harvest the many hundreds of jungle plants that can heal all of man's physical and spiritual ailments. This story is one of the most engaging and fascinating memoirs I have ever read. I can't imagine any reader not falling in love with the delightful and mischievous Don Elijio, aged and wrinkled, so full of life, love, and laughter, that turns no soul in need away from his door. Hundreds of South American patients travel many miles each day to be treated by Don Elijio, to seek his wisdom, medicine and healing hands.Never did Rosita imagine that such a full bounty of natural pharmaceuticals was right there at arms reach, just a few steps away in the heart of the Belize jungle. Just ripe for the harvesting, so many trees, plants, leaves, berries and bark samples, were there for the healing with the right knowledge to use them. Spending years with Don Elijio by his side training daily allows Rosita to witness healing and miracles like she had never seen in any modern medical facility or hospital. Medical emergencies and sicknesses abound in Belize and not a day went by where she didn't drop her mouth in awe as she watched and learned what the medicine man was capable of, using combinations of plants, the laying on of his hands, shamanistic spiritual counsel, and his 90 years of common sense and experience with the nature of man and the natural world around him. With a twinkle in his eye, an incredible sense of humor, and with the wisdom of the ages, he teaches Rosita to someday replace him as the village healer. The two embark on a journey close to that of father and daughter, welcoming the village people into their homes and hearts as they line up putting their trust and faith in their hands.This is a very insightful and illuminating story that will entrance the reader with the wonders of the natural world and what it has to offer us if we just learn to tap into it's gifts. The book surely holds a story that is uplifting, inspirational, and is a book that will renew one's faith in mankind. I found the knowledge within this book eye-opening and felt the man himself, Don Elijio Panti, truly a magical human being. To his own people he is a God. After you read this book you will agree he is what the world needs more of."},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"Rosita Arvigo narrates a moving and captivating journey through the rainforest to a higher plain. Her record of Elijio Panti is priceless, and the science behind the ethnobotany is fascinating. I finally understand the reason for the success of the plants my wife has given me and my children during illness.I look forward to visiting Ix Chel one day."},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It tells about Arvigo's true life experiences with a healer. She shows us that it is up to all of us to save our planet. It is also true that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. She was able to get help from the New York Botanical Garden. Arvigo is really a brave woman."},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"I purchased this book as a prerequisite for a Mayan Self Abdominal Massage class. It is inspiring to read the story and struggles of Rosita Arvigo as she comes to apprentice for one of the last traditional Mayan healers. This book is also a window into the damage we are doing to our rainforests and the potential ramifications as we lose not only our source of oxygen, but potentially life saving plants. This true life story is totally engaging and an easy read."},{"Title":"Sastun: My Apprenticeship with a Maya Healer","review":"This book is about Rosita Arvigo's life in Belize and her apprenticeship with a Maya healer. This is a Spectacular True story. The book captivated me, I could not put it down. Thank goodness she learned and is carrying on the knowledge of the Shaman's. We in the US have gotten too far away from Natural Remedies, replacing them with synthetic alternatives. There is a plant given to us for a cure for any human ailment we have, but this knowledge is dying with our Rainforests. I finished this book learning that Rosita is a courageous women living in the Rainforest of Belize who has dedicated her life to learning about the herbs in the Rainforest. She is dedicated to saving plants destined to become extinct thru moderization of our Rainforest. Thru her work a Medicinal Plant Reserve was established called Terra Nova. I felt great energy while reading this book."},{"Title":"The Fragrant Flower","review":"Very good read. The storytelling was a little old-fashioned. The history and setting were exotic and interesting. It was a refreshing change of pace from the romances I have been reading."},{"Title":"The Fragrant Flower","review":"This author always gives you a bit of interesting world history as well as a happily ending story. Great for a relaxing read. The book is fairly short and very well written."},{"Title":"Chakras: Balance Your Body's Energy for Health and Harmony","review":"I highly recommend this book if you want to learn all there is to know about chakras. Drawing on scientific research and a western approach, it explains the seven major chakras in detail using colorful photography and charts. It also explains the 21 minor chakras. I especially enjoyed learning how to nourish and heal my chakras through the many meditation, breathing, and visualization exercises. To my delight, it also includes a detailed account of how to heal your chakras using crystals, pendulums, colors and sound. My health and general well being have improved after doing the exercises and has given me a new perspective of how I view the world. I feel more at peace with myself and know I will refer back to this book time and time again."},{"Title":"Chakras: Balance Your Body's Energy for Health and Harmony","review":"Although every book that I own on the charkas is very valuable, each one has something special that sets it apart. Mercier's book is no exception.The introduction explains the concept of auric energy fields and the next chapter discusses the focused energy fields, the vortices within these fields that are the chakras and how they are connected to the endocrine and central nervous systems and the spine.The Indian tradition is discussed next, with reference to Yoga, and then each chakra is investigated in depth with beautiful illustrations and the appropriate meditations.The book includes a chapter on charkas and sound - each chakra responds to the primal vibration of sound through mantras, chanting, toning, singing, musical scales and specific instruments.The chapter A New Awareness explores beyond the 7 well-known chakras into a new state of consciousness. Here the additional charkas are discussed: Earth Star, Navel (hara), Causal, Soul Star and Stellar Gateway that exist as potentialities within the sequence of the seven.The chapter Chakras and Sacred Stones looks at the correspondences with crystals whilst the last chapter deals with healing the body and mind.The text is richly enhanced by brilliant paintings, photographs and illustrations, including illustrated exercises, and the book concludes with a bibliography and index."},{"Title":"Chakras: Balance Your Body's Energy for Health and Harmony","review":"Before reading this book, I had at best a passing interest in the subject of the chakras. Many of the other books I considered purchasing that dealt with this subject, were dense and difficult to understand. This book however is neither.The Chakras is a concise yet comprehensive treatment of the topic of the chakras. It is written for your modern day person and draws information from a variety of different teaching systems and cultures. The result is a synthesis of the most important and well-studied &quot;new age&quot; ideas and concepts. This is much more than a book about chakras and touches upon diverse subjects including the use of color and sound for healing, as well as shamanism. The illustrations are simply gorgeous and the text includes many useful techniques for meditation and visualization. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding their perceptual horizons and learning about the chakras.FYI- Knowledge of the chakras is critical for the understanding of shamanism and Toltec sorcery. I also recommend: 1) Shaman, Healer, Sage-Alberto Villoldo. This book gives a shamanic description of the chakras and explains how this knowledge fits in to the healing practices of shamans.2) The Path- Esmeralda Arana. Explains how knowledge of the Chakras plays a role in sorcery."},{"Title":"Chakras: Balance Your Body's Energy for Health and Harmony","review":"If you really want to know about ancient Hindu tantra sysytem read The Serpent Power by Arhtur Avalon. The concept of chakra development and use is a very complex and abstract study taken from ancient sanskrit writings. It is an ascetic system that was said to be extremely difficult as well as dangerous. You will get the real story by reading Avalon."},{"Title":"Chakras: Balance Your Body's Energy for Health and Harmony","review":"this is an excellent chakra book. mercier's other book, the chakra bible is also a must have.

The O'Neil System was meant to be an aggressive and easy to learn combative that could be effectively mastered rapidly. The system base form was a Chinese foot-fighting art (Ju Jut Su) compounded with techniques from Judo and Karate, making for a well-rounded fighting form.The techniques presented in this manual require no special ability or physical prowess to learn and employ. All the methods were based on gross-motor skills allowing then to be remembered and used in extreme situations under duress and/or stress. This manual does not have all the answers and has its flaws, were some of the techniques were irrelevant and just would not be applicable in combat and require a little too much memorization to use the techniques in combat. The book has some material on knife/bayonet employment incorporated through this work. The book is lavishly illustrated with period photography making the format easy to understand. Overall a well-rounded book, for insight to military combatives of WWII."},{"Title":"Deal the First Deadly Blow","review":"To me this manual is ok-not great,but not bad either.There are some good techniques in it that make it a worthwhile addition to your combatives library.The unarmed combat is based on the O'Neal system,which does have some good material,and that alone,makes it worth obtaining a copy."},{"Title":"Travel Diary","review":"The compact size (~5&quot; X 7&quot;) makes it great for recording any trip.

Note the huge difference between the young unwed mother in the beginning and the North African woman at the end.This is an important, even landmark, work in my view. I personally own two copies so that I can continuously circulate one among friends and family. Without fail, those who borrow it, come back to me grateful for having read it."},{"Title":"Both Right & Left Handed (Third World women's studies)","review":"This book consists of a series of interviews with Arabic women in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Algeria. Because the women interviewed were personal contacts or contacts of contacts of the author, it almost comes across as snapshots in a personal photo album. Most of the women interviewed are leaders, women of prominence in their countries, or university professors like the author herself. The attitudes they express towards the state of women in their countries is remarkably similar, but the reader can't assume that these attitudes prevail in these countries because no attempt was made at trying to reach a representative sample of women. Nevertheless, the book is extremely interesting, informative, and thought-provoking. Many of the women interviewed point out the strength of women and their remarkable achievements during armed struggles. They rail against husbands who ignore their intellectual abilities and accomplishments while requiring them to be perfect house cleaners, cooks, and child care givers. A number of the women reflect that they themselves may be partly to blame in the way that they raise children, especially their sons. Almost universally, they are unhappy with their present state, but on the other hand, they would not want to have the lifestyle of European women. But do they understand the lives of European women any better than European women understand the lives of Arab women?"},{"Title":"The Complete Games Trainers Play on Cd-Rom","review":"Having used some of the authors books previously from the Games Trainers Play series, this CD version is a great tool for trainers and workshop presenters. Being on CD, travellers will appreciate being able to carry all this information in a compact form. The index, guide, and search tools are simple, yet effective, and the ability to print exercises, or export to other word processors works very well. The bookmark comments capability also enhances the use of the activities included. As it is designed to work on earlier versions of MS Windows, the user interface could be better, but otherwise a well put together package."},{"Title":"Henry Explores the Mountains","review":"This is a very adventurous book. It shows how little kids can prove themselves responsible. It shows how young children, know ho to act in scary situations. Some people have to learn that young children can be trusted, but they should be able to prove themsleves first. Sometimes young kids just want to grow up, so they wanbt to explore and learn how to do things for themselves.I like the character Henry in this book. When Henry and his dog sent out on a journey to explore the mountians, they do not know what to expect. They have a good time exploring and take extra precautions. They meet some friendly and unfriendly characters, yet they know how to handle the situations. Henry takes controll of the bad situation and turns it into a learning experience. This book teaches a lot about how to act when on a journey. It also shows how kids get regconized for the good deeds they do."},{"Title":"Henry Explores the Mountains","review":"I got this book as a birthday gift for my grandson who lives in, and explores, the mountains around his home in Colorado. The story of Henry the explorer seems perfectly balanced.This Henry, like my Henry, is a clear-eyed adventurer, who takes along rope and sandwiches, who leaves a trail he can follow home, and who keeps his eyes open for bears. Henry has a great imagination, is practical, and is open to experience. The book has great charm, exciting developments, a mellow vibe and a happy ending. What more could you want?By the way, I got this book rather than \\"Henry the Explorer\\", because in \\"Henry the Explorer\\" Henry wanders around in the forest after dark, even though he has lost his trail and is walking away from a search party. This is such remarkably wrong behavior that I felt uncomfortable about the book even though it is otherwise perfectly cheerful."},{"Title":"Good Reading (Volume 5).","review":"My great great aunt was one of the authors. I was pleased to find a part of my past and in the conditon promised. Thanx"},{"Title":"When Asia Meets China in the New Millennium: China's Role in Shaping Asia's Post Crisis Economic Transformation","review":"Compared with a few other books on China published recently, this one makes most sense with its research and data underpinning the anecdots. The information density and quality is extremely high in the book.I certainly do not agree with all the views, but the conviction of the author's arguments serve to rock existing thinking and prompt readers to reassess their views.The book takes a rare fordward-looking approach to analyze the complex economic cross currents that are unfolding in the coming years. It builds the thesis of a new economic paradigm on not only the rise of China's economic clout, but also on Asia's structural woes, insufficient reform and persistence of crony capitalism.This book also goes an extra step to link the global economic development (problems) with Asia and China's development. The author argues that the changing global dynamics are part of the puzzle that builds the new economic paradigm.There is something for different types of readers to chew on. Those economic-oriented souls will find a wealth of clearly written theories to feast on. Those less technical readers will get a solid snapshot of the economic powerplays currently underway in Asia.The thrust of the book's message is 3-fold: 1) China's growth is more than hype and lies; 2) China's rising economic clout is not a zero sum game (by stealing others' lunches) - it could indeed enlarge the lunch for everyone; and most crucially 3) China's growth is creating a new economic paradigm, where the good old days of easy money and strong pricnig power are gone.The author's observations of the future global pricing trends and a new Asian business model are both far-reaching and insightful.His view of a decaying Japan may be too strong. But the message to the regional governments is clear - adapt to the new economic era by uprooting the old habits and living with China and stop scapegoating China for their policy failures.The author is a China bull. But he does not deny the massive woes that China is facing - broken banks, corrupt state firms, lack of accountability, mounting pension liability and so on. What he differs from the conventional pessimists is his reading of reform dynamics. He sees China moving fowrad, albeit slowly, instead of standing still waiting for a disaster to happen.Only time will tell if China would help make Asia a happier richer region, as the book argues, or it will be a destabilizing force crushing the region. This book will serve as a reality check in 10 years' time."},{"Title":"When Asia Meets China in the New Millennium: China's Role in Shaping Asia's Post Crisis Economic Transformation","review":"This book has critically examined the cause of financial crisis happened in Asia back in 1997/8, whereas someone might say this was currency crisis, but the author claimed this was actually a liquidity crisis. The unwillingness of many Asian countries, due to moral hazard, to initiate a fundamental structural reform has casued these countries a prolonged period of correction.As China are exhibiting competitive stress in the global manufacturing advantages, quite similar to the Asian's success back in 1980/90s, these Asian countries do require extra efforts to move up the competitive edge in order sustain its pre-crisis economic dynamics.In the meantime, the author also provides his viewpoints on why China will overtake Japan's fading dominant position in Asia, partly because of Japan's continual denial of her failures in a number of reforms for the past decade.This book is not only a good reference book for executives eager to explore China's role in the post-crisis economic transformation, but also illustrating a lot of interesting obervations and open-end questions for further studies."},{"Title":"When Asia Meets China in the New Millennium: China's Role in Shaping Asia's Post Crisis Economic Transformation","review":"It presents a thorough illustration on the 1997/1998 Asian crisis based on strong analytical ground, and the role of China in shaping Asia's economic future.Inspiring in its case studies, one on \`China's Pressure on Hong Kong' and the other on \`China's Pressure on Taiwan'. A lively and concise book, which provokes the question of \`Will China become the number one economic powerhouse in the 21st Century'?"},{"Title":"Almost Paradise","review":"In the opening of Patt Gavin's first novel, &quot;Almost Paradise,&quot; we meet the daring Peter Grant. He is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist, who is willing to put his personal safety on the line for the perfect picture to illustrate a story. When Peter sets his mind to something, he will go to any extent to achieve his goal.Next, we meet Craig Walters, a flight attendant, a theater major in college, who never realized his dream of being a big star. Working for the airlines has its perquisites: he has good benefits and gets to travel. He may not be as rich and famous as his best friend, Peter, but he makes a living. Peter was not always rich. In fact, he knows all too well what it feels like to be hungry so he anonymously donates money to food banks and soup kitchens. He is a true philanthropist in every sense of the word. Peter and Craig met in college and have been friends for twenty years. They were roommates and even dated for a while but, while Craig lives as an openly gay man, Peter remains in the closet. Peter felt that coming out of the closet would hurt their careers, so he kept his door tightly shut, even though Craig did not. Peter denied his intense feelings for Craig while the two men remained close friends and lived in apartments right next to each other.When Peter wants to relocate he finally professes his love for Craig and asks him to go with him. Peter discloses his homosexuality publicly and they become a couple once again. Peter is not subtle at work and he is not subtle in his personal life. He feels guilty for the years of denying who he is, especially for not helping his gay community fight for its rights. Peter decides to help his community in a very big way.Peter was oblivious to the discrimination gays faced; gay sub-culture was foreign to him. Craig has to fill Peter in on everything, as if Peter has been living on the moon, instead of here in the USA. Some of Craig's explanations to Peter make the reader wonder how any well-informed citizen would not know certain basic facts. You do not have to be gay to find such explanations tedious but, to anyone in need of lessons on being gay, it could be helpful.Almost Paradise is a story about one man's quest to make a difference in the lives of GLBT people everywhere. Peter orchestrates a migration to Hawaii that eventually leads to his seeking public office. He hopes to change laws enjoyed only by heterosexuals. If elected, he promises, and I quote, &quot;These rights would include the right to marry, to adopt children, freedom from discrimination in housing and employment, and all state sponsored tax rights offered to married heterosexual couples.&quot; If he wins the governorship, he will not only fight for gay rights but he will represent all his constituents whether they are gay or straight. He will govern for the good of all. For the first time in his life, Peter is not afraid to use his celebrity to further his cause. Patt Gavin writes an interesting, timely story about gays rallying together for a cause in order to make some positive changes in the legislation concerning gay rights and marriage. While the story may seem far-fetched at times, it is the privilege of an author of fiction to take such liberties. He hits upon a good idea for accomplishing their goals. Read &quot;Almost Paradise&quot; to find out what the idea is and if wishes come true."},{"Title":"Almost Paradise","review":"Almost Paradise explores the gay subculture in America from the perspective of two men who want to make their relationship legal in the eyes of the law. The topic is treated with a certain amount of humor, indicative of the handling of the situation by most gay Americans. Underneath the mirthful veneer is an example of what life can be like for gays if they band together, as well as what this country would be like for heterosexuals were all the gays to leave."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had read the Hobbit and the trilogy of the rings and thought the The Silmarillion would be a worthwhile read. However, I found the book to be unreadable. I am not certain what the author had done differently, but I could not get past the first 40 pages and those pages required serious work to read. It looked as if the author had some very good ideas but he had put it in a manner that was difficult to understand.Perhaps you will do better than I did. However, this was one of only a few books that I could not finish because I had a hard time understanding what the author was communicating.If you are interested in this book, I suggest getting it from a library and trying to read it, before spending money on it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The worst book i have ever read , it is no book but abosulout rubbbish"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I will be as terse as possible in the hopes of helping as many others as I can: unless you are looking for the cure for insomnia, avoid this audio book collection at all costs."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"but terribly written, most pages require 2 or 3 re-reads...the book is terribly dry, but i think the background was very helpful before reading the hobbit and the lotr trilogy for the first time...still, i wouldnt suggest it, the book is just too difficult to understand."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After reading LOTR &amp; the Hobbit I was hungry for more Tolkien.

Even if you loved The Lord of the Rings, as I did, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like this book. I found it much too dense and confusing for my taste, and had to draw up charts and diagrams to understand any of it. To sum it up, this book was NOT worth the read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If Tolkien had intended this book to be more than working notes towards a history of Middle Earth, he would have published it on his own. However, his son's money-grubbing has begun a horrible tradition of talentless sons pillaging the notebooks of their fathers, a tradition that has resulted in the continuation of an already tortured Dune series in addition to the collections of partial tales by Tolkien released after his death.He must be spinning in his grave."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Where the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings enchanted me and thirsting for more, The Silmarillion only put me to sleep. What an incredibly boring book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Disclaimer: I only read 1/6 of this book before I gave up. It may get incredibly interesting after that, but I'll never know.I'm surprised that so many people have rated this book so highly. I've never met anyone who attempted to read this book that didn't find it astoundingly dull. &quot;As boring as the old testament&quot; put one friend and I have to concur. Here's some sample text:&quot;Lo! And it came to pass that back in the ancient mists of time that Volan began Doonman who begat Hrygus. And Hrygus dwelt in the fortress Zapner which was in the valley Illytnil. And in Zapner dwelt too Hrygus' servant Foonfadle. And Foonfadle wore sneakers. And the left sneaker was called Lymar, and the right was called Damus. And Damus had a shoelace call Prylia. And the plastic nubby bits on either end of Prylia were call Foonus and Clenus. And Prylia was tied in a knot called Wengal. This is how it was when the universe was young.&quot;The book is nothing but exposition. If you're looking to learn all about JRR's fantasy world without being entertained, I suppose this might be a good book, but why would you want to? IMO, books should either entertain or inform you about the real world. This book does neither."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The stories have little depth and connections. The description of the elves are at odds with the elves in TLOR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarilion has never quite been up there with Lord of the Rings, in terms of popularity. Perhaps it is because Tolkien never actually finished this book himself - his son reworked and rewrote his fathers sketches - or it may have something to do with the lack of a clearcut adventure, with a single hero and a clear beginning and end. The Silmarillion starts of as Tolkiens version of the Old Testament, and ends up as an adventurous collection of tales from the history of Middle-Earth. All the appendices with family trees and elvish dictionaries are pretty geeky, but I must admit: I really loved all the stories and sagas about Feanor, Turin, Beren, Luthien and the other 'new' characters. It is just as mesmerizing as LOTR and, fortunately, not to be made into a motion picture anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Certainly a treat for Tolken fans, but hard for the rest of us to interpret."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a wonderful work, but it requires effort on the reader's part to follow what is essentially a book of Middle-Earth lore &amp; legends. It took me a few tries before I really was able to enjoy the book and soak up the beautiful use of language and the broad-brushstrokes of the fleshing out of Middle-Earth. The text is moving and tragic and heroic and a treasured fleshing out of Middle-Earth. Not every reader will have the courage to stick it out or immerse themselves in it, but I was glad I made the effort and was so richly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is by far more emotional than all of LOTR, with lots of excellent vignetes of Eleven lore by Tolkien.

As a story it is nearly devoid of any readable pace, it does not flow like the other Tolkien works. It reads mostly as a genealogical - geographical &amp; etymologic survey with all the excitment such a hybrid is likelyto have. If this work was set up like the appendixes of The Return of The King it would be far more interesting and useful, but as it stands it is just an overwhelming assault of information that no one can hope to digest without multiple re-readings of each passage. Here's an example of what I mean: Imagine that the first paragraph of The Hobbit was written in the same way as the Silmarillion:(Elvish names made up for illustrative purposes)In a hole in the ground, in the land of the Shire, known to the Noldor as Ulma, and to the Grey Elves as Shuma after the star of the North named Shumallil or &quot;Lives in Holes&quot; in their tongue after the ways of their kin, there lived a Hobbit, which were also known as the Pereniath by the Elves and Fuztpah by the Dwarves who in turn were known as Gulliamari by the Green Elves who were led by Luthior son of Luthio and brother to Luthi and father to Luthiori the tall, Luthirio the Grim and Luthiorio the Slender, etc etc etc You get the idea...The ENTIRE book is like this, and needless to say it's very wearisome to read. Call me a heretic, but I'm sure that Tolkien himself wouldn't realease this book as we have it now."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you read Lord of the Rings and then read it again, including the appendices, buy this book. If you're looking for a stirring fantasy epic, forget it. I read this 30 years ago; at the time it was billed as JRR's attempt to create the mythology/historical background for his more popular books. It accomplished its assigned task but as far as being great writing in its own right - no. The tale of the two lovers is poignant, but is only a sketch. Not for kids - too boring. Recommended for the Tolkien hard-core fanatic: for them its a must have, obviously. There are two editions floating around with the same illustrator. One has 50+ illustrations, the other 20. I think this one has 50 but Amazon is known to mix things up. Artwork is ok (as stated elsewhere, the landscapes are better)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After reading the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit I eagerly went out to read The Sil. The book is so complicated you need to read the book two times just to realize who is who in the book.

I'm Sea Eagle. My E-mail is aikido_seaeagle@yahoo.com Tolkien ist the best."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Well, as a Tolkien fan, I of course loved this book. It answers thousands of questions that a _Lord of the Rings_ fan wonders about, and even has a few of the strengths of the Trilogy. But as a person, I found it a little hard to sympathize with any character in this book, except perhaps Fingon, Luthien and Beren, and Tuor. Most of the elves are prideful, greedy, cruel, foolish, violent, unforgiving, and often weak. This book is far inferior to LotR or even The Hobbit, for there is little description and barely any characterization. The fundamental elements of a good book in my opinion include character growth, which I observed in only a few people, like Maedhros and Maglor, Fingolfin, and Fingon. But so many others are despicable and ugly in their actions. It seemed that no one had the courage to actually GIVE AWAY a silmaril. They just couldn't get the concept. Bilbo and Frodo in LotR was far superior to most of the elves in this book, for they were willing to give up the One Ring, which had possibly even more attraction and corrupting power. The style is pretentious at times, in contrast to the Trilogy's more &quot;human&quot; account, given largely by the least enlightened character in the group--a hobbit or dwarf. Very simply, this is a history more than a story, and can't be truly classed with Tolkien's other works as high fantasy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There is a reason I have read this book 8 times. it is the best ever.

Tolkien's Silmarillion is one of the most creative and imaginative book ever written. The one thing that Tolkien has done that makes the Silmarillion the greatest book ever written is his ability to create an actual world which he supplies with hundreds of characters. Basically he developed a whole history over a world he has created in his mind and has smashed it all into one book. It is the greatest book ever written and the greatest that will ever be written. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Excellent! A lot more comes into focus. Anyone who like this book should read The Histories of Middle-Earth, Unfinished Tales, and The letters of J.R.R. Tolkien. Read this book! You'll be glad you did. It's the perfect reading companion to Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Why on earth is the kindle version so expensive compared to the printed version? It's ridiculous! I won't buy until the price is lowered to (at least) the price of the paperback version."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm gonna have to say that Iiked LoTR a lot better. This is mainly just history of Middle-Earth. People sa it's the Bible of Middle-Earth, but I wouldn't strongly agree with that. This is written completely in the third person, and some of the Bible is first person. Lus the Bible is history, but has a good way of making stories sound interesting. I wasn't too wild with this, unless you need to refer to history because LoTR is too confusing or if you're really bored. I'd try some of his other books first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\`There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Il&uacute;vatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were offspring of his thought and they were with him before aught else was made.' This is how the book starts with the making of the world in the book. Il&uacute;vatar is like their God. Like the rest of fantasy books this one has elegant elves, rough dwarves, and men with tough lives. Where The Lord of the Rings is in the \\"Third Age\\", The Silmarillion tells about the \\"First and Second Ages\\". It is called The Silmarillion because there are three jewels that contain life. Everyone fights over the jewels and a lot of misery is caused because of the jewels.This is a fantasy book that is written in British English. It may be a hard read for some because of how it is written. It is the book of all that happens before the stories The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The Silmarillion is not as detailed as The Lord of the Rings and is more like a summary. It tends to be about groups of people or a place then following a character. There are segments in the book and chapters within the segments.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who read The Lord of the Rings. This book is for twelve and up. If you were confused about something you would find it in the book. Being the first and last of J.R.R. Tolkein's books it has a lot to live up to, but it does a pretty good job. It was begun in 1917 and changed around during his life and while he wrote other books. When he got old and died his son edited the book and it finally appeared four years after his death."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was awesome!

JRR Tokien's fantastical world of Middle-Earth seems to come alive so fluidly that it's easy to get wrapped up in this book for hours. If you have even the slightest curiosity about any related to Middle-Earth and the events that predate the LotR books, then I would highly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a wonderful read all by itself. It's a little like reading the Bible except you know for sure it's entirely fiction. Now I'm re-reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings after having read them many years ago.

Although since then have re-read the trilogy several times, usually once a decade, finally decided to find a hard cover Silmarillion to replace and found another first edition. Book was in great condition, much better than I remember my original was in, and price was definitely worth the value it has for me. I'm not going to write a critical review; if you're a hardcore LOTR fan then you already know, if you are a LOTR fan and haven't read it, then you will be amazed. But don't expect to derive much if you read this after only watching the movies...there is so much more in the books which the Sil puts context behind that is not in the movies."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"So often J.R.R. Tolkien's works are only brought to CD when they are &quot;adapted&quot; or &quot;abridged&quot;, what those two words really mean is trashed. So it was with some anticipation that I got my audio book copy of _The Simarillion_.Fortunately this piece does not dissapoint. Martin Shaw does an excellent job reading the book, and true to it's advertising it is completely unabridged. That makes for nearly 14 Hours of reading by Shaw. I'm not 100% certain that all of his pronounciations were correct, but I can certainly live with it. It is absolutely awesome to be on a long drive and be able to hear the story _Of Beren and Luthien_ .For any fan of Tolkien's work I cannot recommend this more highly."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I really liked Lord of the Rings, it has been my favorite fantasy series. Unfortunately they ended way too soon for my tastes, as I did want to read more about this wonderful land that Tolkien created in LOTR. With the Silmarillion I got my chance to once again explore this world. And while I was a bit disappointed, because it didn't live up to all of my high expectations, I was also thrilled by this narration of the past of Middle Earth and the surrounding lands.A problem with the book is its rather uninteresting beginning. It starts out nicely, although its basically like Paradise Lost. Then it bogs down in the names of various gods and godesses which I had a hard time keeping track of (by this time its mixing Greek and Norse myths with the Christian theme). After this it rather picks up its pace and grows more interesting. The tales of the elves are strong and emotional, and are a mythology all their own.Unfortunately the book's second and major problem soon becomes apparent. The tales are not covered in depth enough. Instead of all these short and involving tales, I wish he had written several novels covering them in depth. For example, the tale of Beren and the Silmaril could easily have covered as much ground as LOTR, but it only receives 60 pages or so. I understand the problems, given that Tolkien was dead, but I think it could at least have been expanded to include more information on these stories.Other than that, this book is really good. Anyone who enjoys mythology will love this book as it provides beautiful yet melancholy pictures of a world decaying from grace. The only problem: I wish it were longer!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As noted by other reviewers, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not for everyone.

Even though this is not a page-turner, or a book you will read cover-to-cover, you will probably enjoy getting Tolkien's thoughts (which drive the stories in the above-mentioned books) about the beginnings of Middle-Earth.It's also very handy as a reference book and the pronounciation guide and glossary in the back of it are invaluable. :o)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien is the master of fantasy. No doubt about it. So, I supose what I'll say below will leave many of his fans upset. The truth is the following: this book is boring. The concept is grandious, the creation of Arda magnific, the battle between the elves and Melkor amazing. But Tolkien's style is typical of some British writers. It is dry. Even when he writes about beautiful moments or beautiful scenarios, it's dry and emotionless, almost if it was just a newsman relating it. So, enduring reading the whole book is already a victory. Please pay attention to the fact that I'm not saying this is not a great book. This would be insane. I'm just saying the writing style is boring."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkein never intended for this book to go to print. He used it as background information to lend body to his masterpieces: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. While the Silmarillian may provide information to the die-hard Tolkein fan, don't expect it to evoke the same magic Tolkein's other works weave so adeptly. It contains neither the personal element of seeing Middle Earth through the eyes of the human-like hobbits, nor the redemption of a single coherent plot.

After several failures at trying to read it I restarted, keeping notes as to who was who, related to who, on the same/differing side and so on.

Unfortunately many of the stories are told at such a high level (low detail) that it's like reading a plot summary. Also just about every sentence is filled with long fantasy names, with hundreds of characters making appearances only once sometimes to reappear 2 tapes later.I would not suggest trying to read this book. Do it on tape (or CD)ONLY. You could spend the whole day just trying to pronounce the names on the first couple pages.Also the last story is just a review of what happened in _The Lord of the Rings_ so if you haven't read that yet (yes there are people out there that haven't read 'it' yet) then read it first or you'll ruin some surprises."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I give it two stars because I'm a Tolkien fan, but it's like reading a phonebook."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Am I the only one who doesn't think this book is the best one ever written? It's not the stories, anyone interested enough in the world of Tolkien will want to know what actually happened in the first and second era, but the style of writing is impossible! I have managed, purely out of my enormous interest in Middle Earth and its inhabitants, to wrestle myself through this book once; the second time I tried I couldn't even reach page 10.This book is clearly a collection of notes which Tolkien made about his world's history, which have never been rewritten in a pleasantly readable style, and which have never been checked to keep things consistent, as there are many given facts that differ from given facts in other parts of the book.In short: only read this book if you are really, really interested in the history of Middle Earth, otherwise it's impossible to get through."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is NOT a continuation of the LOTR/Hobbit story. I rated it only 2 stars not for any fault in the book, but rather the fact that this is really a reference book and not a story. I suppose that if you wish to ferret out specific details and \\"historical\\" content it would be fine. But I found it a little too dry and disjointed to read with enjoyment.The above review was written in may 2002. This addition to my review was written on 18 Sept 2006.I still find the Silmarillion hard to read. I did listen to it on an unabridged CD and liked it. Part of the problem is that the Silmarillion is disjointed and the place names are hard to keep straight. The audio version obviates that. Please don't think that I am down on printed books. Lord knows there isn't a low priced, durable, simple to use/store electronic device that can hold a candle to a book. But for the Silmarillion, I'd make an exception."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is an exeptional book that no one else has ever, could ever, attempt. It is better than TLOTR, mainly from the absence of Hobbits. Mind! I like the little fellows, but they are so much like real people that it hinders the true spirit of the elves from coming through. In the SILMARILLION there are no Hobbits, and the true magic of Middle-earth shines through. On the whole, I like the books in this order: The Silmarillion The Two TowersThe Return Of The King The Fellowship of the Ring The Hobbit (Don't get me wrong-- it far surpasses most books, but Tolkein was that rare thing-a genius)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien is a genius and this is his magnum opus.

It will never be matched."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Anyone who says that The Silmarillion is dull compared to LOTR or The Hobbit, has not truely stepped foot on Middle Earth. It is designed in such a way that it seems like your reading a collection of really good short stories but they are all related in one way or another. Some will make you laugh and others will have you screaming, some still will even make you teary eyed. To all adults and children alike...do yourself a favor and read THE BOOK by THE AUTHOR. I found reading them in this order made it truly enjoyable: Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion, LOTR...Hobbit, LOTR, Silmarillion....get the point?!?"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Upon beginning this book, I was fascinated by the creation of the children of Illuvatar and the song they wove; and in reading it, I was surprised because I have never liked mythology, yet these writings captured me.But when I was overwhelmed with many names and (at the time) poorly explained places, I feared that I would be among the unpopular reviewers of this book who gave it a low rating.Then, my hope was rekindled because through learning all of those strange places and unfamiliar names, I was given insight into some of the most fantastic, valient, and sorrowful stories that JRR Tolkien ever wrote.And if you avoid reading this book, you will miss out on that. Because, as is stated in the book's forward, this was the work of Tolkien's lifetime. Its creation grew with him and covered a time period that makes the seasons of work that he spent on the Lord of the Rings look like an overnight inspiration.If you avoid reading this, you will never know the sad fate of Hurin or the brave journey of Beren and Luthien. You will never learn of the monstrosity that is Morgoth, who makes his servant Sauron seem a peddling imp. Without reading this book, you will never truly understand the grief of the elves that is touched on in LOTR, and you'll never know where Gandalf came from.Therefore, I lay this doom upon any who begin this book: do not give up; you will be rewarded for your vigilance.In my review, I would also like to honor the efforts of Christopher Tolkien, who spent years compiling this masterpiece from the notes of his father. If he had never done this, none of these reviews would have ever been written and some of JRR Tolkien's greatest stories would never have been subject to our admiration."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I got interested in Tolkien awhile ago, and my Algebra teacher is a big Tolkien fan, and he lent me his copy of The Silmarillion, even before I had read anything about The Hobbit, or The Lord of the Rings.

Beautiful chapters are written in there even if you haven't read anything from Tolkien before. Yes, it is hard to read if you haven't read Tolkien before, but the words are stunning. If you have, this is a must. The stories in here are wonderful. Wonderful isn't even the right word, its better than that.If you have read Tolkien before, and especially if you've read The Lord of the Rings, it makes for great reading.This is one of the best books I've ever read, and once I get finished reading The Lord of the Rings, I'm going to read it again.

If you loved this, read the Illiad. And of course the Bible; Where you will read of the battle of good and evil and the role of man.

The Silmarillion is extraordinarily dense, full of Tolkien's characteristically hyperinflated prose and complicated renderings of the various races we first became acquainted with in The Hobbit and later in the magnificent Lord of the Rings trilogy. Still, it's a little like reading Shakespeare -- spend but an hour upon an idle afternoon, and lo! thou art immersed anon in the rhythm of his words. (There's a tremendous amount of &quot;lo!&quot;-ing and &quot;behold!&quot;-ing going on). Be prepared to invest at least an hour or two at a time reading this - taking in a few pages before bed will only leave you bewildered and frustrated. The level of detail and mythmaking is &quot;awful&quot;, in the original sense of the word. Tolkien has created THE ultimate backstory to a fictional reality. Read this, then read his more famous works again. You'll &quot;get&quot; The Hobbit and LOTR in ways you never did before."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Awhile back I read The Silmarillion after reading The Hobbit/LOTR series. I enjoyed the Old Testament inspired beginning of the book of how Middle Earth came to be and the Valar who strived to protect it from Morgoth the first dark lord. It was also interesting reading about the ancestors of characters such as Elrond. However, as many people have mentioned before in their reviews it does get complicated and isn't always easy to digest. At times I had to take notes on the names because I didn't know that there's family trees and an index in the back of the book that's very useful! It's a book that might need to be read over and over in order to fully grasp everything mentioned."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This can be read by the Tolkien fan, as well as the reader of fine heroic literature, of which I am both. It has a great deal of information about the increasingly famous middle earth; Tolkien has created a world that is as lifelike and fun to study as our own. The Silmarillion also shows Tolkien to be one of greatest epic writers of all time. His tale of the trials and tribulations of the peoples of Beleriand is timeless and should be remembered a classic for all time."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's use of symbolism in The Silmarillion is exquisite. His use of symbolism really enhanced the book. Because of the added layers of action that the symbolism provided I enjoyed the book much more because of it.The symbolism of The Ring being the source of the problem and also being the source of all evil made the action that more provocative. Also the whole book is a work of symbolism of our very lives. Tolkien being a catholic fashions his work as a symbolic portrayal of our fallen human world. All these things made me enjoy this book allot more than if there hadn't been any type of symbolism to think about.In conclusion I gave this book 4 stars for it excellent use of symbolism and for keeping me entertained and interested throughout the entire time I was reading. Through his successful attempt at employing the literary device of symbolism and creating an awesome book I recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is quite an undertaking as a reader. The book is not exceptionally long, but it is written more or less like a Bible of Middle Earth--making it more difficult to read than say....The Lord of the Rings. Then again, if The Lord of the Rings fascinated you, you probably would be willing to deal with Tolkein's jargon in this case. The novel is filled with names and locations and is at times overwhelming, albight a well-compiled index helps to refresh the reader's memory about characters and places. The Silmarillion, a truly wide ranging work, encompasses multiple smaller tales all somehow related to the main plotline.The scale of this novel is far beyond the scope of The Lord of the Rings and the events are all the more world-shaping (sometimes literally). This novel must be approached as a history, not a narrative. The reader rarely gets a deep understanding of a character before multiple others arise.Aside from the imaginative and exciting (yet sometimes dry) main novel, other connected stories concerning the shaping of Middle Earth, and even the days of Sauron (the Dark Lord of LOTR) answer many questions about Middle Earth.Although this book pertains to events preceding the Hobbit and LOTR, it should be approached after the completion of those novels. This novel is hard to appreciate without a Tolkien background.In essence, the Silmarillion is an engaging history of Middle Earth that is likely to only be appreciated by readers enthralled by his other great works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Ok. For most people their opinion of The Silmarillion, I think, depends on one specific question. Do you like reading history? Now I'm not saying that you have to like history, but if you are a person who likes history you will love this book.It begins with the creation of the world. Titled Ainulindale. It was very original for the time(and still is), and many writers have leaned heavily on it for their own creation stories.It continues with the Valaquenta which is an account of the major gods and lesser gods of middle earth.The book then proceeds with the Quenta Silmarillion. Now to me, the Quenta Silmarillion is the most original collection of essays/literary works that I have ever read. Except for a small portion, it covers the events of the first age. During which it concerns mostly the creation and history of the elves. I won't go into details because that would take up too much space. There is just too much knowledge in this book. If that is possible.If you have read The Lord of the Rings and want to know more about the elves this book is for you, because this is their story. Later in the Silmarillion the race of men come into the picture. My personal fav is the essay on Turin Turambar.In many ways these stories are very tragic, but that is what makes it all the more real. You become immersed in the story because the tragedy of it reminds you of your own lives and world.The book ends with geneologies, an index of names, and an appendice on the different elements of Sindarin and Quenya names.Of all the books I own.

Enjoy it as such."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This epic masterpiece and LOTR stand as Tolkien's best work. The stories in the Silmarillion are at a much epic and grand scale than Lord of the Rings, and dialogue is very scarce. Nevertheless, this book fully entraps the reader in Middle-Earth. This book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you have read Lord of the Rings and still want more adventures by J. R. R. Tolkien, you have to read this book! This book explains everything about the history of Tollkien's world, starting with the making of the earth, and finally leading to the events in the Lord of the Rings. It also answered many of my questions, including who Sauron and Balrogs are, and how Elves and Men were made.The Silmarillion is mostly about the First Age, when elves were the most important beings in Middle Earth. Elves familiar in Lord of the Rings, such as Elrond, Galadriel, and Celeborn take part in it. The ending of the Silmarillion is sad and tragic, and yet beautiful. Because the entire book is history, it covers many years and generations, and very many characters appear.Though I had a hard time memorizing the names of so many characters, I was helped by the Index of Names at the end of the book. I'm sure you will find it necessary when you read the story. There also are family trees of Elves and Men which I could use to locate ancestors of some important characters in Lord of the Rings. Like I said, this book is a must read to all true Tolkien lovers!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but I can understand why people disliked it, it is a little long winded. But if the other books (the hobbit and the lord of the rings) left you with a few question, this book is good for you, but if you're not into the whole mythology of it all don't bother."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a prequel to The Lord of The Rings. It starts with the creation of Middle Earth and how it came about. It talks about the fall of one of The Valor and the first wars. This book is a must read for any Lord of The Rings fan, it gives you the history and fills in some of the gaps the Lord of The Rings leaves for us. However, as I say in my title the book is touch and go. The book is well developed in some areas and in others you can notice the lack of development. I will not lie this book is poorly written, but this can be attributed to the death of Tolkien before it's completion. I found the book at times hard to follow and it was often slow reading. The ease of reading the Lord of The Rings is not present in this book. The jumps in time or place are often abrupt and jagged, almost irritating. If you are not a patient reader, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love LOTR, but once you read this book, you'll notice that way more time ( like many years! ) were put into the making of this book and that it about the creation of middle earth and tales that go along with it. Its just marvelous how Tolken was able to create so many ideas and tie them all together the way he did. though i have to point out that at many times the book can confuse you because it doesnt seem like it was put together perfectly, but thats only a minor drawback. this book covers over many thousands of years of middle earth and of the line of the Noldor race, from their creation, to Feanor and his sons, to the end when they all leave and middle earth is controlled fully by men. so many great tales like those of love, loss, friendship, betrayl, formation of kingdoms and their destructions, creation of the Valor, and much more are in this book, and it even summarizes the events of LOTR ( very short summary though ). i think this book is the best in the middle earth book series, and its definently the best book ive ever read! its a must have for LOTR fans!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a very detailed book of the history of the Middle-Earth.

The Silmarillion reads like a history book and really gives you a good basic knowlege of the world of middle earth.

He literally created a whole new world, all new races of people and each race has their own language and culture. Tolkien went into detail creating Middle Earth and most of that detail is included in this book. A perfect choice if the Lord of the Rings left you hungry for more.However, the Simarillion is not an easy book to read. It is full of details that can be hard to get through and keep straight. I kept the appendix of terms/definitions and the maps of Middle Earth dog-eared so I could keep flipping back to refer to as I read along to help me keep all of the information straight in my head. It's much easier to get through the second time. But, as difficult as it can be to get through, it's well worth it. It truely explains the who, where, what, why, and how behind the Lord of the Rings and gives greater understanding to the entire LoTR trilogy.By far, the Simarillion is my favorite Tolkien book!!! I refer back to it now and then when someone has a question about a character in LoTR. I love this book but it is definitely not for everyone!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book probably seems a terrible bore to those who haven't read lotr.

Never before has such a tale been created, perhaps never shall another such as this appear. The elements are those we know: mortal and immortal, power and weakness, love, hate, revenge, loneliness, celebration, healing, life, death, despair, hope, exile, homecoming. Light and dark. Tolkien's world has touched me so deeply not because it is, or ever was, new. It touched me because it is so old, because its elements are those taken from life and are as old as time itself. If the Silmarillion reads like a history book, that's because that's what it is.

It is the fantasy masterwork of the English language, and certainly succeeds in his attempt to establish a &quot;mythology&quot; for the British Isles (and all those deriving their cultural traditions from Britain). Peoples, deities, places, languages, and events are meticulously brought into being -- and are they any less real than our ancient stories or legends? Of course not. We enter a parallel world in the Silmarillion, but not necessarily a different one.

For fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion gives the reader a sense of the time, effort, and dedication J.R.R. Tolkien spent on the creation of Middle Earth. Most of the stories fully (or mostly) told here are, in some form, referred to in his previously published works--but the history of the elves, as presented in this format, now comes across with almost biblical grandeur and tone.Be advised, if you are new to Tolkien, this is not--repeat, NOT--the place to start. The language is archaic throughout, and the veritable sea of names is a lot for the uninitiated to digest. And this work, unlike those published in his lifetime, does drag at times. Having said that, the bad guys of the ancient world--Morgoth and Ungoliant, to name the most prominent--register with a level of dread that make Sauron and Shelob read like Bambi and Thumper. And the horoes--most notably Feanor and Earendil--lend new definition to the terms \\"hero\\" and \\"tragedy\\".I cannot help but think, though, that if Tolkien had wanted this backstory material for The Lord of the Rings published, he probably would have done so himself ...(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy, \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"The Silmarillion\\", a book written by J.R.R Tolkien (the author well-renowned for his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy), is a captivating tale of the creation of the land of Middle-earth. The amount of detail that can be found in this unique fictional world, which can only be described as gargantuan, makes for an unbelievably authentic setting. The story consists chiefly of the beginning of the world of Earth, and later the war that the elves wage for the Silmarils - three beautiful jewels crafted by Fanor, the most gifted and skilled of the elves - which Morgoth, the main antagonist, takes for himself. This book may seem unappealing and even a little intimidating to a few readers, because of the author's old-fashioned writing style. In fact, compared to the sixth book in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series (which is much thicker and probably longer), \\"The Silmarillion\\" is an unexpectedly difficult book to read. Also, since this book is actually a compilation of notes by J.R.R. Tolkien, the smoothness that was displayed in \\"The Hobbit\\" is not present. However, for those who prefer challenging books at least an inch thick, this book is perfect. The best thing about this book, as I expressed above, is that there is so much detail crammed into it that the reader feels as if they could just reach out and touch the world portrayed inside. I chose to read this book because I had read some of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, and also because I felt better after reading a very difficult book. Something I realized while reading this book was that while \\"The Hobbit\\", also by J.R.R. Tolkien, was a simple tale of one main character in a fictional world, \\"The Silmarillion\\" actually takes several detailed photos of that fictional world in the author's point of view and presents it to the eyes of readers everywhere, in effect giving each reader a small slice of his world. This is an excellent book for those that have already read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and wish to learn more about the world it is set in."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Great book for learning about the early ages before the events of LOTR occured. While a tale is told (sort of), I agree with other reviewers that it is more a historical telling of events than an actual story. Glossary of names is indispensable! Great artwork in this edition. If going to take on a reading such as this, or if looking for a showpiece for your coffee table or library - this is the edition to get! It is understandable if you can find a place and time to read where you have NO distractions."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Unless you are seriously into the Lord of the Rings, this book will most likely not interest you.This book goes really, really deep. If you've wondered about the connection between Shelob and the spiders in The Hobbit, or if you've wondered about details from the Appendix, or if you've wanted to know all about the beggining of Middle Earth, then this book is highly recommended.At times it can be slow, and most people other than the hard-core LOTR enthusiasts will find it incredibly dull."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's always been a wonder that Tolkien's banner works have succeeded to the extent that they have. The odd, inconsistent mixes of dialogue and sometimes-endless descriptive passages go against the grain of what is acceptable in entertaining literature. But the Hobbit and the trilogy do work, and work well.The Silmarillion, on the other hand, goes over the edge, and the resulting work is swallowed up completely by dry lessons on culture and history that completely obliterate any effort at establishing character. The efforts to completely cover vast periods of time and geography is admirable, but not very enjoyable.After reading the first four books, I was disappointed. I understand that there are two more movies in the works, the first one based on the Hobbit and the second one bridging the Hobbit with the first Ring movie. That bridge movie is likely to draw heavily from the Silmarillion, and I think that will be the most entertaining approach possible to this material, what with the epic battles, etc.It's rare that I recommend someone watch the movie over reading the book, but this is one of those cases."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is The Silmarillion told as Tolkien might have wished it told--not read silently but aloud, by a gifted tale-teller. Even before the first sentence is declaimed, the music that wells up under the opening of each major section perfectly sets the mood: when we hear the growing chords we know we are in for something worth attending to: dark, brooding, but full of wonder.Martin Shaw's reading rises to the tale's magnificence with a performance that is beautiful in every way. His actorly instincts are keen and true, offering perceptive, convincing performances of the varied characters. His voice weaves magic that touches the heart and satisfies the intellect.I already loved The Silmarillion as a book, in its published form and in the more detailed drafts provided in the HoME, but this reading brings the tale to life in a way I never imagined possible. I thought Rob Inglis' reading of LotR was mostly excellent, but this recording is unparalleled."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am lucky this was the first book i read written by J.R.R TOLKIEN, it was given as a present by a friend who insisted that this was the greatest book i would even read, he was almost right,this book was very interesting to me it was a kind of historical mythology,it give a very detail account of what happened in the first age and why! it's very much like the bible if i am permitted to compare,it begins with a great one and creator Illuvatar and his servants Ainur and their creations,songs of great power ect.., the great valar Manwe and the dark one Melkor who later became Morgoth, Feanor the eldar (first elves)who created a great gem called the Silmarillion, the envyous Melkor stoled it and fled to middle earth Feanor pursued and swore to reclaim the gem even if all his kins would die trying, he committed a very sinful act by slaying his kins men and was cursed, i have to tell you that while i loved this book at the end of it all it was but vain knowlege and empty.there are other interesting love stories in this bbok, such as the story of Beren and Luthien very romantic, you will learn of Turin a great warrior from the seeds of men, but all in all it's no different from reading Scandinavian or Greek mythology in some instances very similar ummmmh!! anyhow you have to read this book yourself and form your own opinions, no one can tell you what this book will be like it's all a matter of you intellectual ability and imagination that will make this book a classic or just another novel, well that all laters folks."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is the story that Tolkien wanted to publish before (during, and after, in fact) his most popular work, The Lord of the Rings. The only problems were, his publisher didn't think enough people would be interested in it. So, for decades, The Silmarillion languished in Tolkien's home; he worked on it off and on from 1916(?) to his death in 1973. It was also his most beloved.Originally composed to be the accompaniment to his elven languages, The Silmarillion is no ordinary story--it is the saga of the elvish race from the beginning of their existence up until the Destruction of Beleriand (which is north of Middle-Earth), and the beginnings of Men. In it you will find no hobbits, which many LotR fans may find disconcerting. In order to actually survive the many histories to be found inside it, one must be a lover of Tolkien.A profound and extraordinary work, the book is comprised of multiple histories and storylines, and in a way that only Tolkien could come up with, lots and lots of elvish names (which at times the multitude of which becomes very confusing, as there are characters with two, three, and more names that Tolkien may resort too without much warning). The book also shows more fully the worldview that Tolkien possessed, and his faith in Christianity. This is portrayed vividly in Akkalabeth--the creation. In it is told the story of the great music that Illuvatar (God) and the Valar and Maia (the angels) made in the creation of the world. Here also is to be found the fall of Morgoth, a Vala who would become the ultimate evil.This is, as plainly can be seen, Tolkien's most deppressing work, as can be more clearly seen with each rereading. It is essentially, a tragedy. A sense of dread grows with each great mistake that the Elves make, nearly all of them stemming from their pride and hunger for great jewels. We learn of the origins of feud between the elves and dwarves (as well as a delightful story about the creation of the dwarves themselves aside from creation). The lay of Leuthian (the tale of Beren and Luthian) is also the forerunner to the love affair between Aragorn and Arwen in the LotR, and especially delightful.All in all, there are many great and wonderful tales, along with the fall of Numenor and rise of Sauron, and it makes a great read--although it takes awhile to wade through. For those who have a definite interest in Middle-Earth, this is prime reading if ever there was any."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a mighty hard one to read. It basically encompasses the entire history of middle earth from the creation to the first age to the age of man, even touching on some events after the return of the king. If you're a fan of the trilogy (and I mean the book trilogy), then by all means, dive right into this one since there are details that you might find to your liking. I especially got a kick reading at what happens to the fellowship long after the Ship sailed from the Grey Havens. But understand that a lot of times the silmarillion is like reading your high school history text book. There a lot of interesting things here and there but there also a lot of passages that will put you off and bore you to tears (i.e. the story of Melkor) especially if you're only a fan of the movies and only barely managed to tolerate the original books because of the scholarly way that they were written. I swear that it must have taken me two months to finish this book back in high school because I keep putting it down out of sheer boredom."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you expect another Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit... don't. It's a rather slow book, in my opinion, though it is otherwise well written and quite interesting, which is why I would give it 3 3/4 stars. This is probably great for those with a bit of patience and well, I don't know how else to put it, but those that like this kind of book. It's beautiful in its own right, and many passages are great. But the book overall wasn't my favorite.It is definitely a must-have for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the world in which Middle Earth puts itself, and events surrounding its history."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a total Tolkien fan I recommend that you read this book. It is a condensed version of Tolkien's work that was never published, due to the fact of its sheer detail. Luckily we have his son, Mr Cristopher Tolkien, to thank for putting together all of his father's notes. I just kept wondering whether some of his father's scribbles were written on different media (Think table napkin, test sheets, etc.) making Mr C Tolkien's effort at organizing more difficult.For a Tolkien Neophyte I recommend staying away from this book and reading Mr Tolkien's more famous work's (The Hobbit & LOTR)to provide you a rough idea of what the author is talking about since the book gets confusing at the middle due to the myriad names and plot.It talks about the entire history of the universe of Tolkien, from the creation story to Frodo's departure in the Grey Havens. The languaged used is archaic similar to the style seen on the bible, very formal and brief. Even if the narative is very simplistic one can still see the humanity in all the characters, proving that this book is extremely well written"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It is quite difficult to write something about \\"The Silmarillion\\" when there are already so many people that have read it. But to write something about this new illustrated edition is completely different.The whole book is a work mayor fantasy, created by J.R.R.

The book should be read after having been read \\"The Hobbit\\" and The Lord of the Rings in that order, because if not its reading it could a bit difficult. Doing it this way you can feel as if you live each one of the histories like something that was made for us to know, but somehow didn't fitted in the previous books.Now let's take this classic book and let's add it illustrations... Can someone request for more? This edition overcomes the previous by arriving to 45 marvelously painted illustrations, made by Ted Nasmith. Some of the paintings are awesomely real. They caught my eyes from the very beginning. It's a pity that some paintings made by Nasmtih, like the ones entitled \\"E&auml;rendil Searches Tirion\\" and \\"Luthien Escapes the Treehouse\\" haven't been included in the final edition. On the other hand it was a big surprise to see the high-scaled map of this one. Not even the illustrated edition of LOTR has such a big and wonderful map.To tell the truth it's a privilege to have this book in my bookcase beside the illustrated editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".Once again thanks Tolkien for give us such a wonderful world to live in, and thanks Mr Nasmith for put it into images."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've been re-reading this book for at least 15 years. My copy is well dog-eared and the spine is cracked. Each time I read it, I read it from cover to cover, and it captures me each time. I can't even number how many times I've read this.I personally have no problem with the enormous amount of personal or geological names presented here, altho it did take me at least two false starts to finally read this. I've read the Bible from front to back many times, also, and if you can keep up with that pace, the Silmarillion won't hold any special challenge.With the spate of interest in JRR Tolkien, especially regarding the movies, I figure a lot of people may pick this up and hope to find more about hobbits and Gandalf. I think those casual readers may be disillusioned.But I hope that even those who are casually intereted in the Hobbits will find press on and read this book in it's entirety, and learn what sheer brilliance lays beyond Peter Jackson's cimematic interpetation.This is an entire mythos of creation, mainly as seen from the Elves perspective, from the beginning of the world to the end of the War of the Rings.I could go on and on, about the lingustical matters, and the author's denial of allegory, but other reviews and other books will talk about those...It's just as important to note that this was edited by his son, after his death, and a question often occurs to me - which is pure JRRT and which is CJRT? CJRT was working with a huge amount of materials and did the best he could with what he had. If you'd like to see the real-life cronological creation, the \\"History of Middle-earth\\" volumes are a good place to start.

Tolkien put into the world he created, Middle Earth. Songs and poetry extolling ancient heroes, tales of the history of Middle Earth and the Ring...Middle Earth always seemed alive because of those details (even if, like me, you skipped over most of the songs and poetry). The time Tolkien spent building that massive backstory was a big factor in the success of The Lord of the Rings, because the tale held together as if it truly were history rather than fiction. The Silmarillion helps flesh out a lot of that backstory.Somewhere between a Bible of Middle Earth and a history text, The Silmarillion is not a story in the sense of The Hobbit of The Lord of the Rings. The Silmarillion is more like a collection of short stories telling about the history of Middle Earth leading up to the War of the Ring, from the creation of the world to the wars against Morgoth and the destruction of Numenor. The Silmarillion helps to flesh out the world Tolkien created and provides a great deal of additional depth to the stories told in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, as well as helping the reader to more fully understand Tolkien's magnificent creation.If you're looking for a ripping good read, you should look elsewhere: this is pure exposition, as another reviewer noted.

The book, to listen to is at first hard to follow since there are so many strange names and a cast of hundreds (most of which are named). The book is well read and the narrator gives energy and enthusiasm to lines that might seem boring when read. Also it is nice to finally learn how to pronounce some of the character and place names. The Silmarillion gives a much better history of Middle Earth than what is given in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. After reading (or in my case listening) the Silmarillion, one is compelled to go back and reread the trilogy with a better understanding of the lore and history that surrounds that timeless masterpiece.Thumbs up to the Silmarillion, and thumbs up to the narrator Martin Shaw."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"An initial word of warning: The Silmarillion is not the best place to start your Tolkien reading, nor is it a book that many younger or inexperienced readers will want to venture into reading. In many ways, one can consider it The Bible of Middle Earth...and it's written that way.That said, the sheer scope and majesty of these tales is hard to ignore. Thousands of years of elven history are told, wrought with betrayal and sadness and battle and magic, all told in a skillful and poetic narrative. Tolkien's prose really shines in The Silmarillion, flowing and gorgeous.What's even better, reading The Silmarillion puts the scope of The Lord of the Rings in context better, allowing one to see &quot;the big picture,&quot; if you will. A facinating and enjoyable read that is recomended to all Tolkien lovers."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was, simply put, a great suprise. One of my friends who read it said it was good, but a difficult read. Now that i read it i can say it is more than i anticipated and an excellent piece of storytelling. It can only be described as majestic, enchanting, and of course adventurous. Sure you have to refer to the index of people/places a few times in each chapter, but, in the end, it is extremely rewarding. I am somewhat new to fantasy, but have enjoyed scifi adventures for awhile. After reading lord of the rings, the hobbit, and this, i'm hooked. Silmarillion explains the history of the lord of the rings characters and middle-earth itself in a grand scale. I particularly liked the way tolkien gets you really interested in these characters in so small amount of space for each one. Their emotions and inner conflicts, such as extreme sadness, bitterness, and pride, are clearly interpreted. It is difficult to name my favorite characters and stories, but those of beren and luthien, turin turambar, tuor are the essence of what a perfect fairytale would be. The conflict of feanor and the valar, the wars, man's role, melkor's fall and sauron's rise, and the story of the rings are all captivating. However, i do agree that it is probably wise to read lord of the rings and hobbit first. To sum, i would say this mythology is maybe the most interesting story i've read (this or lotr) and would highly recommend the Silmarillion to anyone."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Well, I read the hobbit. I was surprised cause I was never interested in fantasy (or, in my age of sixteen, in any literature :))) and this story cutted me absolutely off the whole life around.Then, I read the Lord of the rings and I found out that no movie nor anything else can give you so amazing feelings, so great memories just because of it's own existence. I still remember how I felt about it and how unforgettable that story it was. And millions of other readers support my opinion - nothing, I repeat - nothing in the world ever have been so beautyful vicarious experience for me. I loved it. Absolutely. And i will remember this till the end of my life (and maybe even later :)).After this, I tried The Silmarillion. Well... I was surprised, because this book seemed to me like a history book even more than a fantasy roman. But after a few pages full of names and places, I began to change my opinion and was totally amazed for the third time, but finally the most. I admit the Silmarillion is not for everyone. When you did not read the LOTR, you have no point to read this because you will basically not understand an expression there - but if you did and you loved it as the most of all the readers (let's say all), then you must try it. It may be really complex and confusing, but you must get over it. And it you will, I guarantee you that you will adore this. Yes, the LOTR was emotional, but what comes here you cannot even compare with it. I was moved by everything described there. The sad faith of elves, Valinor and everything else. I still feel my tears coming down on my face and deep breath I took every evening after closing the book. If you haven't read it you cannot say how it feels to hear about the endless love, value of friendship and majesty of the real kings described with Tolkiens's abilities. You will never feel the dust coming when Fingolfin runs to fight Morgoth in all his glory, even there is no chance for him to come from this battle alive. You will never know about the most heartbreaking and beautyful stories ever written. Is that woth it ???As a teenager I have a really opposite opinion on books and everything which is not connected with computers or TV, but as I said, this experience is locked forever in my mind and it's beauty and gleam will never vanish. What was created here is not a book, not a piece of paper with words. this is something much more you cannot evaluate. If you read The Lord Of the Rings, it is a must. if you did not, This is not a place to start with Tolkien's work, but it is surely his biggest masterpiece, if not the greatest thing in literature ever created."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I can honestly say that I did not enjoy this book whatsoever and was immensely relieved to have finished it. While it doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with the Lord of the Rings books (it can be a standalone) it was sitting on our shelf and I felt compelled to read it and finish the books we owned written by Tolkien.The Silmarillion is a compilation of stories, history, lore and other things of the elves in the time before the Lord of the Rings series takes place. There are also stories about the dwarves and men of the world as well, but they are not focused on as heavily. Within these tales are little stories of some of the peoples, wars, and goings on in the world at that time, not to mention, a sneak peek at the early lives of Celeborn, Galadriel, and Elrond. Towards the end it also goes over how the rings were made and how they came into the hands of the different people who bore them. There is even a very brief mention of Frodo's part in the histories.There are so many characters in this novel that none are really fleshed out and to be honest its hard to tell who's who in this book. Most of the people are similar in name and deed and this gets to be very confusing as the book moves along. Indeed, none of the characters stood out to me because of the way this book is put together. I would have liked to hear more on Elrond or Galadriel but instead we are introduced to so many characters in so short of time (and most without interesting stories) that it was like seeing a slide projection of someone's vacation photos; there might have been a few interesting things, but largely you are bored to tears and trying to be nice about the whole experience.The writing is overly descriptive and does read like a history book. History is not my favorite subject and this made the read excruciating for me. As mentioned before there are so many people, places things that the book is largely unfollowable without a notebook to track what is going on. While there are some glimmers of a good story that caught my interest, they are so short and so few between that it wasn't enough to redeem this book in my eyes. While I recognize that it was probably a personal labor of love for Tolkien, it may not have been the best choice to release the book as is.I like to read but in this novel I just could not keep up with who, what, where, when and why and it really took from my enjoyment. Die hard fans of Tolkien and history buffs may derive pleasure from reading this book, but I certainly did not.The SilmarillionCopyright 1977442 pages including appendixReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In the Tolkien canon, THE SILMARILLION is the most highly contested of all his works. Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\". And what a mighty work it is, despite its unfinished nature...........---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bonus Content:In November 28, 1999, I released a small review of \\"The Silmarillion\\" on Amazon.com (which is still accessible on the main product listing of this book), and as bonus content to the review proper (which is up above), I am including my original reviewTolkien's Bible, November 28, 1999\\"Hark now to \\"The Silmarillion\\", the Bible of Tolkien's fantasy world.

Tolkein weaves a master tale of beauty, valor, faith, and courage of the Children of Illuvatar against the relentless assault of the Great Enemy, Morgoth, and his servants. The epic proportions of the battle between Good and Evil reminds one of an even greater work - the Bible - and Tolkein appears to have been inspired by the language of the Old Testament.

Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\".

Just try to remember a few of the main characters. There is a helpful appendix in the back of the book with the names of all of the characters and places.

Tolkien's The Silmarillion by Martin Shaw is as much of a delight to the ears as were the lights of the Silmarils to the eyes of all who are fortunate enough to have beheld them. The eloquent prequel to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, created by J. R. R. Tolkien and edited by his son Christopher, comes alive as you listen to Shaw. Each character's voice and personality comes through, names I found difficult to read flow smoothly rather than interrupt the story. All too soon the 13 CD-ROMs were completed during my twice a week 60-mile round trip commutes and my short drives around home. After a break for the holidays, I will start with number one again. They are absolutely superb."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is tough to read and is more suited to an older audience. I wouldn't hesitate to get it for someone in high school if they have already read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. But the book is probably more suited to college age and above due to some of the vocabulary and themes the Tolkien presents. There are also a lot of names used by Tolkien, so at times it can be a little cumbersome to keep track of who is who, where they are from, what they did, etc. but if you can keep attention to detail it is worth the effort. For me, this book is the clearest \\"Catholic work\\" of the works of Tolkien on Middle Earth. The introduction almost feels as if it were taken straight from the Bible. But all in all this is a fantastic book and a must-have for anyone who is a fan of the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am a teenage girl who recently discovered Tolkien, and in the past year I have read The Lord of the Rings, Unfinished Tales, and finally The Silmarillion. I loved the first two, but reading the last left me completely blown away.It's definitely not for everyone, though. There probably aren't that many people my age who would enjoy it, and the beginning was a little bit slow. But once I got past the creation stories and the first couple of chapters (which you shouldn't skip over, no matter how boring you might find them) I was completely sucked in.I have to say that I enjoyed this book more than the Lord of the Rings. I still love LOTR, but there are some differences that make the Silmarillion better, in my opinion. The main one has to do with elves. After reading LOTR, I liked elves well enough, but I thought they were rather boring and disliked the way they all seemed so perfect and good.Then I read the Silmarillion, and my whole perspective on the entire race changed completely. The book is chock full of brave elves, heroic elves, wise elves, rebellious elves, angry elves, flawed elves, suicidal elves, insane elves, greedy elves, elves who kill each other, the list goes on and on. What makes it even better is that plenty of them have more than one of these qualities. I admire some of them, and feel sorry for some, and others I just hate their guts. It makes for a very interesting book.The other difference is that Lord of the Rings lacks female characters. The only ones that come to mind right now are Arwen, Eowyn, and Goldberry, one of whom has practically nothing to do with the plot. But the Silmarillion is full of fascinating and resourceful (as well as determined) female characters - Idril, Haleth, Yavanna, Emeldir, Luthien, and others.The one tale that I didn't enjoy (the creation stories were interesting, just a little slow) was the tale of the Children of Hurin. I just wasn't interested in it at all. The fact that I really dislike the main character probably has something to do with this. But this by no means dimishishess the awesomeness of the book. The tale of Beren and Luthien was one of the best, as well as the story (which continues throughout the book) of the Sons of Feanor, who are some of the least boring and perfect elves ever.You probably shouldn't read this if you prefer books with plenty of dialogue (something the Silmarillion is rather short on) or if you have a really hard time keeping lots of names (some of which are only used a few times, or are very similar to others) straight. The name thing does become less confusing once you read things over a few times. The family trees in the back are also helpful.This is certainly one of the best things I have ever read, and I reccomend it to everyone, even though not everyone will like it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is an oft-derided work, compared to the particularly droning passages of the Bible where so-and-so begat so-and-so for generations ad nauseam.It's true that this is a difficult text to get through. You'll want to keep a notepad in hand while you trace lineages of Elves and Men and keep the names of the gods and demi-gods (or Valar and Maiar, actually) straight.But in a time when there is so much substandard fantasy writing around, it's incredibly rewarding to read this book and get a good look at a true master with a relentlessly thorough mind and a rich eye for detail as he builds a world out of his imagination. Tolkien showed other writers how to build living, breathing mythologies. The world he created and the stories he filled it with are still fresh and resonant and unexpectedly touching.For fans of the Lord of the Rings, reading this book will fill in the gaps of all the obscure references packed into the series. Like I said, the book will be a challenging read, but when you turn the last page, you'll feel a bit sad that it's over and you'll want to read more."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a difficult read - I'll admit that. It;s not the page turner of LOTR but the depth and complexity of the world of Tolkien is mind blowing. It is like a history book so don't expect lots of action, although there is some - Armies of Balrogs, Dragons, Orcs etc. under the command of Sauron and his boss Morgoth!! I wish Tolkien had lived long enough to fully expand all of the stories contained in this volume - It would take about 7 Peter Jackson movies to do it justice..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is not a book that can be read passively. If you read it in this manner, even if you read it cover to cover, it will only appear as a fragmented, if beautifully written, quasi-mythology. Instead it should be 'undertaken' more so than simply 'read'. The deeper you delve into the details of the book, referencing names, etymologies, maps etc the greater the pleasure you will derive in the long run. This can be difficult and frustrating at first (especially if you are hopeless at remembering names of people and places like I am) but in the end it is totally worth the effort. Like all good books this one requires the reader to be an active participant, to fill in the gaps created by the narrative. The reward? Simply Beauty."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"First I'd like to point out that a lot of people made this book out to be one of the lost books of the bible. At first reading some of the reviews I almost didn't purchase this book b/c I thought it would be too hard of a read. What a MISTAKE that would have been. It was more complicated than the smooth flowing pages of the LOTR and The Hobbit but it was nothing like what some of the reviewers made it out to be. It took a few pages to get used to the structure of the book but after that it was smooth sailing. Reading this book one can finally find out more about the creation of the world we all came to love. If you ever wondered why the sword Aragorn had re-forged was so special or what made the 2 trees of light so special, you'll find your answers here. There are some things however this book does not cover or covers very little of.For example, if you wanted more information on the Ents and the Entwives keep looking. How about info on Tom Bombadil, nothing. This book does not cover in detail the histoty of the Edain or the Dunedain like one would hope. That's why I only gave this book 4 out of 5 stars b/c of the frustration factor. Other than that it was a Great book to read and very informative for the Tolkien fan. To those that might be reading this review and contemplating whether or not to purchase this book especially after reading some of the other reviews, all I have to say is that if you have at least a high school education, this book should not be challenging at all. Pick it up and enjoy. See where the Tolkien universe began."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have read the Silmarillion twice now and plan on reading it a third time very soon. The Silmarillion is a deeply emotional yet historical account of the First Age of Middle Earth. This book has nearly brought me to tears several times due to the magnitude of its epic tales. With literally thousands of characters presented, you're sure to find one or more to relate to and that will really help with this book. It is by no means an easy read and the childish style of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is not evident. Someone with a limited intelligence or attention span will not, I repeat will not, appreciate or even remotely like this book. You need to really devote some attention to grasping its ideas and seeing what Tolkien had in mind with it. Still, even if you don't plan on reading it, buy it. It's the next best thing to the Bible so in my opinion, everyone should own at least one copy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This review is regarding the 2004 Ted Nasmith illustrated edition of 'The Silmarillion'. I got my copy of this masterpiece finally yesterday, after a month-long agonising wait. Since this edition will, in all probabilities, be bought only by avid fans who already own a less expensive edition of 'Silmarillion', I will restrict my review to my impressions of this edition, and not the story. (Anyways, as far as the story is concerned, I can say with confidence that, so far, no other book had so much of influence upon me than the 'Silmarillion'. 'LoTR' simply pales in comparison to this in my eyes.)Among the renowned Tolkien artists, I rate Ted Nasmith's illustrations of Silmarillion as probably the best. John Howe and Alan Lee may have an edge in \\"LoTR\\" and \\"Hobbit\\", but they cannot beat Nasmith in \\"Silmarillion\\". His portrayal of characters might leave much to be desired, but his depictions of landscapes are too beautiful. And this new 2004 edition has over 45 of his renowned paintings. The book is a bit heavy and seems very much durable. The papers are of the glossy type that might give a little trouble in certain lighting conditions, but is otherwise quite elegant. Thus, in all ways, this book is the counterpart of the 3 volume Alan Lee illustrated box set edition of \\"LoTR\\" which, incidently, I happened to receive together with this. I think I can treasure this gem for the rest of my life.But I have got a complaint with this edition as well. I sorely missed two of Ted Nasmith's most beautiful artworks. One is the picture of Luthien clad in a blue dress dancing in the forests of Neldoreth. Whenever I think of Silmarillion, the picture that first flash through my mind is this. I was once quite shocked (a pleasant shock, really) to see it as the title picture of a music program in a local Malayalam language TV channel in India. (Maybe the producers had no clue as to whose picture it was. They may have used it as they found it to be quite beautiful.) Instead of this, the book has another picture of dancing Luthien that does not quite measure up to the one mentioned above. Another picture I missed was that of Tuor looking upon Gondolin across the fields of Tumladen. These were pictures that captured my imagination when I saw them on a website before I knew anything about Silmarillion.I do not know why the publishers omitted these. These were some of Ted Nasmith's best. Maybe they did not blend with the tone of the rest of Nasmith's paintings in the book. But if that was the case, they could have at least used these as the front and back cover for this edition. (They would have made a damn good cover better than the current one.) Moreover, the existing cover paintings are redundant as they are included inside the book as well.Other than this, the 2004 Ted Nasmith illustrated edition of \\"The Silmarillion\\" is a must-have in any Tolkien fan's library."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Word to the Wise:If you're a Tolkien fan, and loved the books, do not, I repeat do not make the mistake of *failing* to read The Silmarillion.Let me try and put it into perspective for you.What The Hobbit is to the LOTR TRILOGY, the LOTR TRILOGY is to The Silmarillion.If all of Tolkien's books were the 9 rings, which one of these rings would The Silmarillion most resemble-? The answer: None. For The Silmarillion is far brighter & more beautiful than the bewitching & deadly One Ring itself. In fact, it is made of an entirely higher order of stuff. I would liken it to one of the Silmarils themselves, and when you learn the story behind the Silmarils, and find that they are the most exquisite gems crafted by Feanor, the most gifted of all the elves, who lent all his heart and skill into their making, having trapped within them the divine starlight of the two trees of Valinor, why then and only then do you begin to get the picture. The reason I bring this up is because I have found that to read The Silmarillion is to discover hands-on the meaning behind the phrase, \\"No Pain, No Gain\\", insofar as it applies to literature.If it wasn't for the Index of Names in the back of the book, 'twould be a hopeless endeavor indeed to attempt ploughing through this remarkable mythos. It seems that every person and place w/in Middle Earth has at least 2 names, from differing elven tongues. To learn the lineage of the elves and how they came to split apart into different tribes is a story filled with wonder and acute despair. The destiny of Feanor and his bloodline will stop the discerning reader's heart at a few crucial points. To learn of the original Dark Lord Melkor, branded by the name Morgoth by Feanor himself during his rage at having the Silmarils stolen from him, is to be led by Tolkien's hand with such finesse into the deepest recesses of his mythos that I cannot imagine any dedicated reader becoming anything less than spellbound.And then again, I recall what difficulty the high-speech text presented to me the first few idle attempts I made at it, long ago. It is reminescent of the \\"difficulty\\" encountered when attempting The Fellowship Of The Ring for the first time, as a teenager. I thought it dry and boring, back then. Well having allowed it to age about 20 years like a vintage wine certainly did wonders toward the appreciation of this masterful tale. I devoured the LOTR trilogy the year before last, and was entranced from page one to the very end. It just takes a certain dedication, one which if given in good faith, will surely elicit rich rewards for the reader. Such is precisely the case with the far more arcane and written-in-high-language Silmarillion; it's rewards are, if anything, sharper and deeper than those found w/in the LOTR trilogy. However, the effort required to reap those rewards is greater, and most certainly worthwhile.So if you've been thinking of reading the Silmarillion, and have tried it but found it too \\"dry\\" or steeped in \\"high language\\", do yourself a literary favor and take a deep breath, and try again. Consider it a personal homework assignment. Look up each and every word that you aren't familiar with in the Index of Names. You will reference this Index somewhere along the lines of 20 to 30 times per page; like I said, no pain, no gain. But as I began the painstaking process of following the trail of terms and names through the Index, looking up Ainulindale only to find \\" 'The Music of the Ainur', also called The (Great) Music, The (Great) Song. Also the name of the account of Creation said to have been composed by Rumil of Tirion in the Elder Days.\\", as you can see I found myself facing the inevitability of having to now look up 4 new terms, \\"Ainur\\", \\"Rumil\\", \\"Tirion\\", and \\"Elder Days\\". And yes, once the definitions of these terms are looked up, indeed they contain yet another slew of strange names to look up, and the chain reaction continues. I found myself having read several entries within the Index of Names before I even started reading the very first sentence in The Silmarillion, because I was merely looking up the title of the first part: the Ainulindale.However, I can't imagine any reader making it to page 100 and not being thoroughly bewitched. By that time you learn about Morgoth and Ungoliant and Feanor and the bitter struggles caused by their interaction. I read on some Internet site that reading the LOTR trilogy is fine and all w/out having read the Silmarillion; however, a professor pointed out that once you've digested the history of the Silmarils, it prepares you to re-read the trilogy itself in such a dazzling new light that it is akin to reading it for the very first time, with a far more profound understanding of what is going on. This professor went on to say that for example, the scene at the Council of Elrond in Fellowship wherein Elrond tells Frodo he is in the company of certain reknowned elves of ancient history goes flying right over the heads of those who have not yet read the Silmarillion. This professor has stated that now that he's familiar w/the history of the Silmarils, he can not read that passage without eliciting tears from Elrond's statement to Frodo. Once you know of the travails the elves endured during the beginning wars against Morgoth, casual statements such as this become far less casual and evoke a much richer response in the reader.Anyhow, I have posted this here because I happen to know of the folly's and foibles w/in a modern reader's heart, how our attention spans have been damaged by this 21st-century thrillride we call Life, and I've found myself enraptured by the lyrical evocation Tolkien's Silmarillion has instilled within me. It is as if I've been waiting my whole life simply to digest this tome. It's not easy...but it is oh-so-worth it. I figured I'd give out a clarion call to all w/ears to hear that The Silmarillion is worth every word contained within. Ya just gotta put a little elbow grease into it, is all."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is essential reading for any serious Tolkien fan. Be prepared for a slow start though. The first 130 pages are rather like going through a very dense textbook - there are too many names, places, and events crammed into too tight of a framework, allowing for little or no character development. Because of this it can be rather hard to get into the earlier stories, and even harder to retain the information afterward. After about 80 pages I was sincerely beginning to reconsider my decision to read the book, but I'll tell those who may be having similar problems - keep going! It does get better, I promise.The Silmarillion begins with a shorter sub-book, the Ainulindal, which is the Creation story of Middle-Earth. It tells how Eru, or Il&uacute;vatar, the god of Tolkien's mythology, created the Ainur, holy beings who shape the world through their song. The Ainulindal goes on to speak of the Ainur who went to dwell in Arda, the earth, and became known as the Valar; the two races created by Il&uacute;vatar to inhabit Arda - the immortal Firstborn (Elves), and the mortal Followers (Men); and also of how the first evil came to be, as the Ainu known as Melkor and later Morgoth challenges the will of Il&uacute;vatar and falls out of favor, eventually to become the first Dark Lord of Middle-Earth.Next is the Valaquenta, a short section which defines and describes the Valar, the Maiar (the slightly lesser \\"servants and helpers\\" of the Valar), and the Enemies (namely Melkor and those he manipulates to do his will).The main body of The Silmarillion, the \\"Quenta Silmarillion,\\" is the history of the Silmarils, sacred jewels created by the elf Fanor, and all the events that take place around them. It is divided into chapters which take the form of short stories. As I mentioned earlier, the first several of these can be rather difficult to wade through - the abundance of character and place names alone will throw the reader for a loop. These early stories cover topics such as the shaping of the world by the Valar, the coming of the Elves into Middle-earth, the creation and loss of the Silmarils, the unleashing of the evil of Melkor, the rebellion of the Elves against the Valar, and the general layout of Middle-earth at that time.If after this the reader is a bit overwhelmed, don't despair! I found that, beginning with Chapter 16 \\"Of Maeglin\\" which begins on page 131, the stories really begin to pick up. From here on the tales are easier to follow and the characters are more fully developed and easy to identify with. Subsequent chapters deal with the coming of Men into Middle-earth and their migration westward, the continued malice of Melkor and the battles between his followers and the Elves and Men that remain good, the famous love story of Beren and L&uacute;thien (the first joining of man and elf), the tragic life of T&uacute;rin Turambar, the ruin of the realm of Doriath, the eventual overthrow of Morgoth, and of how the Silmarils came to their final resting places in the earth, the sea, and the sky.Following the main body of the text are two more sub-books, the first of which is the Akallabth, which tells the story of the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans, the race of men that dwelt on the island of N&uacute;men&oacute;r, closest to the sacred realm of Valinor in the far west. Ultimately the temptation to seek out Valinor overcomes them, and in punishment a rift is opened in the sea, swallowing N&uacute;men&oacute;r and forever cleaving Middle-earth and Valinor apart. A few of the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans survive and dwell in Middle-earth, and from these is descended Aragorn, who appears in The Lord of the Rings.The final section of the book is entitled \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,\\" and concerns just that. It speaks of the rise of Sauron, who had been Morgoth's primary servant and ally, and who comes into power of his own following Morgoth's downfall. The book provides a brief overview of the battles between Sauron and the peoples of Middle-earth, which come to a temporary halt when Isildur cuts the One Ring from Sauron's hand. The events thereafter are picked up in the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.This second edition of The Silmarillion includes at its beginning a letter written by author J.R.R. Tolkien to good friend Milton Waldman in 1951. I found the letter very interesting, as it provides a nice overview of the material covered in the book, tying it all together in condensed form and helping to provide a framework that holds the stories together as the reader goes along. At the end of the book are supplementary materials that are equally valuable, including lineage tables of the key characters, a brief treatise on pronunciation, and an extensive index that also serves as a useful dictionary of names, places, and other Middle-earth terms. At the very end there is a map of Middle-earth as it looked at the time of these stories.The Silmarillion is not what I would call an easy read, but for an attentive and interested reader, it should not be overwhelmingly difficult either. The information within provides a very detailed background for the events of Tolkien's most famous work, The Lord of the Rings. Some of the stories in The Silmarillion are excellent, self-standing short tales even without benefit of the rest of the history, and could probably have made very engaging books in and of themselves had Tolkien decided to develop them to that extent. Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more of the history of Middle-earth, though I strongly suggest finishing both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings beforehand."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Many have criticized The Silmarillion for being a dull, slow, and wholly uninteresting novel. While those who have actually read the Silmarillion cover to cover will first have the question of whether these people actually read beyond the first 20 pages before spouting off with their opinion pop into their heads, they must also question whether these individuals are fans of Tolkien's LOTR or Hobbit series at all. True, the Silmarillion is at times very slow and without action - the entire beginning of the book can be classified as thus. However, both the LOTR trilogy and the Hobbit can be similarly labeled. Almost half of the Fellowship of the Ring is dull and slow-moving, and so are sizable portions of Return of the King and the Two Towers as well as almost the entire plot of the Hobbitt. The Silmarillion is an entirely different book than any of these, as many fans have already noted. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Silmarillion is clearly a stand-alone novel - one need not have any knowledge of Middle Earth to enjoy this book, and readers of the LOTR trilogy may be surprised to find out just how different the original world of Tolkien was than the one they encounter in LOTR and the Hobbit. The Silmarillion is, in my opinion, unquestionably better than either of Tolkien's more famous works. A sprawling mythological epic history, The Silmarillion weaves a tale of a world strange to ours, but not strange to those of the ancient Norse and others. Its characters are tragic and inspiring. The stories are moving (I must confess that at times my eyes began welling up at certain points, especially during the saga of Turin) and engrossing. Tolkien's writing style can be a bit heavy at times, but it is nothing that readers of LOTR or the Hobbit are unused to. Beyond mere storytelling, Tolkien does an excellent job examining the morality and ethics of his created world. The Silmarillion is simply a masterwork on every level, and any fan of Tolkien, mythology, or simply great epic writing would be remiss not to have this novel on their shelf."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's novel is both an enlightening tale of history about the loved world of The Lord of the Rings, as well as a thrilling narrative that is bound to entice the reader. The Silmarillion tells the tale of the creation of Middle-Earth, the coming of the First-borns, the Second-borns, and the creation of all other living things through the hands of Eru, otherwise known as Ainulindal, the creator. At the beginning of all things he and the Ainur sang together, and that song kept on going longer than any other. They all sang, but then Melkor, a powerful being among them, became jealous and greedy and twisted the song into his own. It was then that Eru showed the Ainur that their song had created a world filled with magic, wonder, and darkness. The Ainur were amazed and traveled to the beginning of that world to help form it into what they had seen. Through the chronicle we discover how together they labored, some with the trees and other living organisms, others forging mountains, while others manned the seas. It was then that Melkor betrayed his brothers and proceeded with the forging of his own lair and monsters. Many battles followed between the Ainur, or Valar, and the forces of Melkor, driving the world to a dark era.Tolkien uses a series of accounts to familiarize the reader with the first ages of the world and the multiple events that lead it to what the reader came to know as \\"Middle-Earth.\\" Melkor taking over the mainland of Middle-Earth, the Valar escaping to an outcropping of land which would be known as Valinor, and the Light of the Trees together with the predicaments of the Valar are all part of the stories the author has to share before the highly anticipated emergence of the First-born. In the rest of the book, different anecdotes of the Elves, Men, and Dwarves tell of the fate of the world as well as the despondent stories of many of them, up until the forging of the rings of power, ending in short summaries of the events in other works of Tolkien, including The Hobbit and, in turn, The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Many aspects of the novel were both invigorating and moving to the reader, leaving one with the feel of a well-developed story. One chapter in particular, \`Of Beren and L&uacute;thien,' is quite Byzantine. It is one of the many chapters that possesses a direct allusion to the occurrences of later stories such as those in the famous trilogy. Tolkien writes:\\"Then she would become mortal, land subject to asecond death, even as he; and ere long she would leave the world forever, and her beauty become only a memory in song.\\"As the quote illustrates, the choice taken by L&uacute;thien was the one to forsake her immortality, much like Arwen's choice in The Lord of the Rings to remain in Middle-Earth with Aragorn. The song of Beren and L&uacute;thien is even sung by Aragorn at a certain point in the novel. Another intimation to the other works of J.R.R. Tolkien, although not as clear, can be found in the chapter \`Of the Voyage of E&auml;rendil and the War of Wrath',\\"Bright E&auml;rendil was then lord of the people that dwelt nigh toSirion&iacute;s mouths; and he took to wife Elwing the fair, and she bore to himElrond and Elros, who are called the Half-elven.\\"Elrond can be considered a main character in the three renowned books, and E&auml;rendil gave birth to the line from which Aragorn was part of as well. These quotes are only a couple of examples to the highlights and action portrayed in The Silmarillion which will certainly delight both fans and not enthusiasts of other of Tolkien's work.The Silmarillion, as well as being filled with precarious adventure, also holds a historical value. Many of the aspects of the novel relate directly with the history of our world, as well as the stereotypical facets of living creatures that tend to portend their downfall. Chief among these is the lust for power and propensity to betrayal of one's allies and kin. In historical documents it is seen time and time again how brothers and friends of kings and rulers turn against their own in order to gain power over the rest of humankind. Some of Tolkien's stories even correlate with stories in ancient Greece about the gods and their influence on the lives of men. It is a great reflection on civilizations' tendency to cause self sabotage. This is why The Silmarillion, despite being a work of literary fiction, can be considered an appreciable historical oeuvre.Through many allegories and haunting tales, J.R.R. Tolkien has succeeded in making The Silmarillion and exceptional novel that fiction and fantasy enthusiasts, as well as historians, should be ashamed to miss."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"...... this is NOT a novel. It is, rather, a collection of stories, more or less chronologically arranged, detailing the history of Middle-earth, from the creation of its universe to the end of its Third Age (the time period in which Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings take place). If you go into The Silmarillion expecting a ...kicking fantasy novel along the lines of LOTR, you will more than likely be sadly disappointed.Having said that, I think this is some of Tolkien's best work. The key thing to remember is that this is fine wine, not Boone's Farm (not that there's anything wrong with Boone's Farm ;)) - it is to be sipped, rather than gulped.However, plain sailing it's not. A few tips, then, to hopefully make your reading experience a more pleasurable one.1) Read The Hobbit and LOTR FIRST. They are much more acessible introductions to Tolkien's universe than The Silmarillion is. Also, there are some major spoilers to LOTR in The Silmarillion, so if you read The Silmarillion first, you'll know how LOTR turns out before you read it (a very bad thing).2) You'll probably find it helpful to read The Silmarillion as soon as possible after finishing LOTR, especially if you at least skim its appendices. The will give you a helpful road map to The Silmarillion.3) Take it slow, particularrly in reading the first 60-70 pages. Remember, this is a gourmet meal, so take the time to savor each morsel. Read 15 or 20 pages, set it aside, meditate on it for awhile, and then pick it back up again. You might also find it helpful to read certain passages aloud, not just for clarification's sake, but to really appreciate the poetry of Tolkien's prose.4) This may sound ridiculous, but I found it helpful to write down the names the chiefs of the Valar (Manwe, Varda, Ulmo, etc.) with a brief description of each on a 3 X 5 card and use it as a bookmark, so I had a handy reference of who was who while I was reading.5) Don't be afraid to look stuff up! Christopher Tolkien was kind enough to include genealoies, a table detailing the Sundering of the Elves, a glossary of names, and other helpful references in the back of the book. Also, you might find an additional glossary, such as Robert Foster's excellent Complete Guide To Middle-Earth, helpful to your enjoyment of the book.Having said all that, if you get 70 or so pages into it and it's just not happening for you, you're probably better of just dropping it and reading something else. It's okay - it's not a book for everyone. But if you do decide to stick it out - enjoy! This is epic storytelling at its best."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien's better known works, don't be fooled that Silmarillion will take you on another epic adventure... it is not a novel, but more a collection of interconnected short stories, that together tell a larger story. The stories are reminiscent of Greek Myths, or Shakespearean Tragedies. The book intends to tell the story of the Silmarils, which are magical jewels. More specifically, once the jewels are stolen by Melkor, who is basically the Devil, the book follows the consequences of an evil oath of the jewels creator, an Elf named Feanor, and his sons, to get them back at any cost (and remember, Elf's have LONG lives, and the stories span many thousands of years and this oath results in wars, murders and many betrayals).The book starts with the creation of the world, the elves, man, dwarves, orcs... all of middle-earth. It answers many of the questions you are left with after The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. It explains where Elves go when they go West out of Middle-Earth, for instance, and where Sauron comes from and what he is. The stories are incredible - again, a mix of Shakespeare and Greek mythology. One of the stories tells of a man who wants to mary an elf - Beren, the man, is taken to the King, who is Luthien, the Elf's, father. The King says Beren can only marry his daughter if Beren brings back a Silmaril from Melkor's (the Devil) crown. Thinking he has sent Beren to his death in this hopeless quest, and has put an end to the issue, the King finds that his daughter has gone on the quest as well. The story doesn't end as you might think, but treats you to a wonderfully surprising adventure, wrought with bravery, battle and honor.There are points in this book that are so poignant and powerful -the \\"wow\\" factor certainly applies. The book is not a novel, but at the end, when you really look at how the stories have been intertwined, and how the characters are inter-related, you will really be impressed with the imagination and planning that went into not only this book, but all of Tolkien's stories."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"One of the things that must be understood about the Silmarillion is that it is a long narrative and not a character driven story like the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. So if you go into this book expecting that sort of thing you will be in for a surprise.The published Silmarillion is basically a summarized version of the \\"full\\" story Tolkien always intended to tell. Basically it is all the essential information one needs to understand the epic events of the First and Second Ages (as well as the early and mid Third Age) of Arda and Middle-earth (The Lord of the Rings took place right at the end of the Third Age as you might know). That being said, one should also realize when reading critiques about the books dryness, that it was intended to have been at least as long as the Lord of the Rings by the author. What we have is indeed J.R.R. Tolkien but it was greatly trimmed down by his son Christopher from a mountain of notes. I believe that Tolkien commented in one of his letters that the Silmarillion, as he intended it, contained over 600,000 words. I think if you can get beyond the flawed mindset that the universe is all about human interaction, and happen to have a better than average imagination, this difference in style will not matter at all.All this being said, it is still a fantastic work. I like the long narrative format and feel that it is in perfect harmony with what Tolkien was attempting to do (create a uniquely English mythology). It must be understand that the Silmarillion came first and was started as early as 1916/17 during his time serving in World War I. It contains the very creation of Arda (which is indeed our own earth), the shaping of it by the Valar (angelic \\"godlike\\" spirits), as well as the very origins of The Wizards, Sauron, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs.If you where intrigued by the wealth of history and detail in the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion is essential reading to fully appreciate the Lord of the Rings on a level above \\"adventure story\\". Tolkien created an \\"imaginary history\\" of our own world, not some planet in a different galaxy or dimension. If you like history of truely epic proportions, and understand what the author intended, you should enjoy this book immensely. It truly is a work of genius.One warning to the first time reader. The one obstacle for some might be the plethora of names in the book. It's not really the number of names as it is the similarity of the names (particularly of characters) used that can be confusing. This was of course intentional, since it fit with Tolkien's specific philological themes and tastes. My advice would be to read it and not worry about remembering who is who at all points your first time. It is a historical theme, and many characters, while being major historically, are not characterized. The book contains plenty of genealogical charts to help anyway. After finishing the book, and if you where intrigued in the same way you where with the Lord of the Rings, I would suggest buying the Atlas of Middle-Earth and reading it a second time while using the Atlas, so that you can better visualize Tolkiens world (the maps in the books do not illustrate major places like Aman or the Iron Mountains). The Complete Guide to Middle-Earth is an excellent resource as well as it contains specific definitions to every person, place, or thing in Tolkiens Middle-Earth saga. Then, if you want more, pick up the Histories of Middle-Earth volumes and the single book called Unfinished Tales. These go into more detail regarding races, characters, etc. featured in the summarized Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is not the easiest book to read, but it contains a wealth of information about Middle Earth and the ancestors of those characters we have grown to love in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. One gets a sense of reading an actual history and not a work of fiction. The scope of this book is astonishing. Anyone who loves The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, will appreciate the depth that Tolkien has gone to in writing The Silmarillion.My approach to reading this book was to treat it as an actual history, rather than a work of fiction; in doing so I found it totally believable and enlightening. I feel I know so much more about the world that Tolkien created, and the wonderful (and sometimes terrible) beings that enhabited it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In The Silmarillion, Tolkien, himself a devout Christian and student/professor of mythology, has created something far more interesting and readable than that which he himself studied.He creates a cosmology that is a combination of that which he believed to be real (Christianity), and that which he believed to be mythology. At the very top sits Iluvatar, also known as Eru, or The One - obviously, God. Below him are the Valar, what I refer to as Tolkien's version of the head deities of various cultural mythos, be they Greco/Roman, Norse, Sumerian, or what have you. Below them are the equivalent of archangels or demi-gods (the Maiar) - we see them clearly in the Lord of the Rings in Saruman, Gandalf, Sauron and - believe it or not - the Balrog of Moria.Some call the stories contained within The Silmarillion dry and boring. I can't see how. If the book is taken as a work of mythology, as it was intended to be read (from which both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were somewhat accidentally withdrawn), it reads much easier than the Bible and practically every mythological work I've ever read.Within The Silmarillion, mainly, we are told of the Creation of Middle-Earth and all of the races that eventually populate that world. We are shown in narrative form the disgrace and downfall of Melkor, later called Morgoth (the Satan/Lucifer character) and that is so much more intriguing and fulfilling than merely being told of it happening. There is a compendium of the Valar, describing their various powers and stations, a history of the race of the men of Numenor (from which Aragorn is a descendant), and the crux of the book - the History of the Silmarils (Quenta Silmarillion).The Silmarils were three jewels created by Feanor, one of the most gifted of the race of Elves (not the Elf we see in Legolas, or even Elrond or Galadriel, but an Elf far greater and more powerful). Within these jewels Feanor set the light of the Two Trees of Valinor (the home of the Valar). Morgoth destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, and then stole The Silmarils, setting them within his crown, and held within Angband, his Barad-dur, so to speak. Quenta Silmarillion is the valorous tale of Feanor's impossible quest to regain that which was his, and the wreckage that followed in the wake of that quest.There are more stories within, including a history of the rings of power and the third age, and for those interested, an in-depth detail on how Sauron (who was himself the greatest lieutenant of Morgoth, and fought with him in the great War of the Silmarils) infiltrated himself amongst the Elves and learned their craft of ring making, thus setting the scene for The Lord of the Rings. It is a fascinating account, and makes for great reading.For fans of the Gandalf, it should be of interest that he is here identified as the wisest of the Maiar. In Unfinished Tales, when he is asked to accompany others of his order to go to Middle Earth and help with their struggles against Sauron, he says that he is weary from his travels and that he fears Sauron. Wise indeed, for Sauron in his avarice, unlike Gandalf, desired Middle-Earth to be his own, whereas Gandalf was content merely to enjoy the creations of Iluvatar. Greed is and should be frightening even to those who are strong enough to defend against it.The Silmarillion is the work that firmly places Tolkien atop all others in his field, for it demonstrates a breathtaking imagination and work ethic. One wonders what The Silmarillion would have looked like if he had not been burdened with teaching to subsist. The Lord of the Rings never made an enormous amount of money during his lifetime (unlike current authors for whom he paved the road today - J.K. Rowling, Robert Jordan, etc.). We'll never know, but what we've been given is a work of astonishing wonder and brilliance."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I tried twice before to read this book but, for some idiotic reason, never got through to the end. What could I have been possibly been thinking? Anyway, many years later, after the cobwebs have (apparently) been cleared out of my mind, I can finally appreciate it for the awesome epic it is.This is the history of Middle Earth. That, to my mind, is basically what separates Tolkien's fantasy from most of what came after. Tolkien took great pains to build his world from the ground up and the Silmarillion is the most refined example of those labors. It exists primarily for the purpose of making the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings that much more rich and believable a world (Tolkien wasn't convinced it would make good reading for the book-buying public and wasn't all that eager about seeing it published; it was published posthumously). However, the tumultous battles and conflicts contained in this book are such that they make those in the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings seem rather like mere skirmishes. It relates no less than the creation of the world and the god-like beings set to watch over it; and of the original Dark Lord, a scarier figure than Sauron, who was merely his servant.Those who point out the scarcity of women characters in LotR, can raise no such point here. Women are given meatier roles in The Silmarillion and practically every named woman is regarded almost as a goddess (even when they aren't). Women are also allotted the best names. While the male characters sometimes have these sort of weird, clunky names like Maglor, Turgon and Huor, the females have such great names as Galadriel, Luthien Tinuviel and Melian. It's obvious that Tolkien held women in great reverence.The most remarkable thing about all this is that Tolkien succinctly packages this grand epic legend in less than 400 pages (and this includes a summary of LotR); yet one can still relate to the characters and appreciate the scope of it all."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm going to come right out and say what will make most people think I'm slightly crazy: I enjoyed reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" more than I enjoyed reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Why? I haven't the faintest idea. Maybe I was too young to properly appreciate \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Maybe my love of mythology made \\"The Silmarillion\\" a shoe-in. Maybe the lack of three-dimensional characters was more understandable in a book this vast. Maybe I'm just weird.In any case, \\"The Silmarillion\\" is challenging, beautiful, epic reading and well worth the time and effort it'll take to fully appreciate the work Tolkien has put into his secondary world. Published after Tolkien's death and edited by his son Christopher Tolkien (who had the unenviable task of wading through his father's mountain of notes), \\"The Silmarillion\\" provides the historical background for what follows in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Yes, as mind-boggling as it may be to conceive, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is only the tail-end of a massive history, as \\"The Silmarillion\\" is far more than a mere 'prequel' to Tolkien's famous trilogy; in fact anyone who does describe it as a mere prequel is doing it a grave disservice.For \\"The Silmarillion\\" is a history; albeit a totally invented one. The inspiration for Middle-Earth came through two major facets; Tolkien's desire to provide a mythology for England (believing quite correctly that the Arthurian legends were strongly influenced by the French) and his own passion for created languages. After designing two invented languages (Quenta and Sindar), Tolkien needed a context in which they were used - what followed was \\"The Silmarillion\\". It's impossible not to feel a sense of awe at the completeness of Tolkien's visions, for found here is his life's work set out into several books and chapters:\`The Ainulindale' is the rich and poetic account of the coming of consciousness to the world as Iluvatar, (Middle-Earth's God), makes a contingent of Valar (reminiscent of angels) and teaches them a harmonious song that shapes a vision of the world that is to come. Yet even now there is strife, due to the presence of Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar who sings his own melody against the tune of the other. The parallels to the Biblical account of God and Lucifer is very clear, and the similarities continue into...\`The Valaquenta', which is a detailed account of the fourteen central Valar; seven male, seven female. The Valar are best described as gods, each with separate attributes assigned to them. Though this segment is devoted mainly to describing each one and their positions within the world, it is written with extraordinary imagination and poetry as Tolkien describes the hierarchy of the Valar, the secondary spirits called the Maia, and the enemies that emerge at the dawning of the world.This is followed by \`Quenta Silmarillion', which makes up the bulk of the book and contains the namesake of the book. The silmarils are three beautiful jewels formed by the elf-craftsman Feanor that contain the light of two miraculous trees. But when Melkor (soon to be called Morgoth, the first Dark Lord), hears of their existence, he forms a plan that allows him to successfully capture the jewels and escape. Furious at the theft, the hot-headed Feanor swears a binding oath to retrieve them, setting into motion a tragic chain of events as his people set sail from the Western Isles back into Middle Earth to wage war upon Morgoth.What follows is a massive chronicle, highlighting events and individuals within this great war, with a scope too large to even begin to summarise. Needless to say, it's nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters (especially when they have similar sounding names) and one story blends into another continuously so that it feels like one massive volume rather than a range of smaller stories. The story is marked by the founding of great cities, the forging of dynasties, the division of peoples and waging of battles. There is tragedy, beauty, torture, escapes, murders, betrayals, hubris and even incest, all of which is too vast and detailed to go into any further detail on.However, one story does deserve special mention, that of Beren and Luthien, a mortal man and an elf maiden who fall in love (and are the precursors to Aragorn and Arwen). After Luthien's father tells Beren he can only win his daughter's hand by fetching one of the silmarils that rest inside Morgoth's iron crown, the couple take it upon themselves to steal the gem from within the Dark Lord's own fortress. A major theme prevalent in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is also present here, that of simple folk (in this case an outcast and a maid) doing what the great and mighty find impossible. Tolkien himself drew a comparison between the hobbits and this tragic couple, but the tale of Beren and Luthien held an even deeper meaning for him. He affiliated his beloved wife Ethel with Luthien, and when she died he had the name \\"Luthien\\" inscribed beneath her name on her gravestone. When Tolkien passed away several years later, the name \\"Beren\\" was added to his name.Finally, \\"The Akallabeth\\" moves away from the Elves to explore Mankind, their island home of Numenor and its destruction (much like our legend of Atlantis) and \\"The Rings of Power\\" which puts the events of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" in a nutshell, ending on the most poignant note imaginable.When coupled with \\"The Silmarillion\\"; \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" suddenly take on an even greater depth and beauty than when read singularly. My appreciation for both volumes went up tenfold after experiencing the massive history and scope of their history that Tolkien meticulously mapped out for them. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" may be Tolkien's most famous work, but \\"The Silmarillion\\" is his masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Okay, I kept putting off reading this book because I thought it would be pretty dull. I figured that after the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, there'd be nothing else worth reading by Tolkien. Boy was I wrong. This is great stuff. Equally as good (perhaps even better) than Lord of the Rings. The Silmarillion, with its allusions to both the Bible and classical mythology, is stunning. The tale of Beren and Luthien is both beautiful and tragic; and the Oedipal Turin Turumbar is also magnificent. And to think that what would eventually became Lord of the Rings makes up only the last 5 pages or so of the Silmarillion! Imagine if Tolkien had lived long enough to tell the story of Beren and Luthien in the form of a novel!I must warn people, however, that the Silmarillion requires a bit of an effort on the part of the reader. There are a ton of names (Finwe, Finarfon, Fingon, Fingolfin, Feanor, etc.) Also, the Ballantine paperback version comes with a very hard to read map, and it definitely takes some time to learn the lays of the land. The work involved, though, is more than worth it"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read the well-known Lord of the Rings trilogy before Sil, and I LOVED LOTR. I read Silmarillion for an independent reading project at school, and got a good grade. The best part? I LOVE this book! It's more like a history book than LOTR, but it's SO much better than any history book that your teacher hands you and tells you read Section One. After reading Sil, you wanna read it again... and again...Then I began reading the trilogy again and not only will understand about Beren and Luthien-- you'll understand a LOT more, too. Like when Gildor Inglorion says he is of the House of Finrod, you'll COMPLETELY understand what House he's talking about, and WHO he's talking about. You'll begin to wonder about not only Bombadil, but also Goldberry (river-daughter? Ulmo's? But he dwelt alone...), and Glorfindel... need I say more? If you love Tolkien's works, you MUST get the Silmarillion!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The book is without doubt my favourite in Tolkien's landscape. It completes the epic with biblical resonance. Moreover, those familiar with Old Testament theology will quickly spot the parallels between the Fall of humans from paradise (Eden) and subsequent cycles of pride, sin and tragedy and the world Tolkien paints for the relationship between the Elves and their sub-creators (the Valinor). Ultimately the Elves are restored in their relationship with the Valor through the heroism of humans (the \\"lesser\\" race). In this quest the centrepiece of the book contains the most dramatic piece of romantic adventure I have read; the Beren, Lutherien and Huan epic.The later part of the book describes the Fall of the humans and leads into the Lord of the Rings. Of course here the humans are ultimately saved by the hobbits (the \\"lesser\\" race). My only gripe with The Silmarillion is the direct cut and paste of the unique biblical phrase \\"hardening of hearts\\" to describe the Fall of humans (the context is exactly identical). My reasoning is simply that up to this point in the book the Old Testament was ever present but never spoken,...In the same context that the bible describes complete logic in God's relationship with creation from Genesis to Revelation, e.g. unity, rebellion, eternal re-unity, Tolkien attempts the same, giving his work a sense of greatness.Tolkien used many influences beside the bible to shape his world e.g. Finnish, Icelandic and Germanic sagas hence the \\"polytheism\\" of the Valor. The central plot however and thus my great liking for this book is undisputedly biblical.Further supporting evidence is not stated here.Michael"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At points it was somewhat like reading a dictionary, with all of the lengthy names of cities and people, but it was still very enjoyable. I'd say it ranks second in my list of best J.R.R Tolkien books - behind \\"The Hobbit\\" and in front of the trilogy series of \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I suggest it to any Tolkien fan but not to a reader who wants constant action. In conclusion, this was a great book and I really enjoyed it, so read it yourself!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you enjoyed the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, there's a good chance you will also enjoy the Silmarillion. It is grand, sweeping, in scope. It begins with the creation of the world, and ends where the Hobbit picks up. Notably, in the first book of the Silmarillion, called Ainulindale, Tolkien recounts the story of the creation of the world in such a way that he nicely summarizes the cosmology that was transmitted to the Middle Ages through Plato's Timeaus. It is a lofty and inspiring vision, and it carries through the entirety of the work. It can be easy to get lost among the myriad players and events - it at times reads like a history book (for indeed, that is what it is - the history of the world of Arda), but there are plenty of grand mythical elements that make for a great story. Reading the Silmarillion will also greatly enhance your reading of the Lord of the Rings - there is so much depth revealed behind numerous events, characters, etc., that are completely glossed over in the famous trilogy. The Silmarillion is truly Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Love it on kindle!

It turned out to be some kind of history of all the world of Middle Earth, with many explanations but very little if any narrative or plot.If you're interested in the background and history of Middle Earth, this is for you. If you want something similar to Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In the Tolkien canon, THE SILMARILLION is the most highly contested of all his works. Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\".

Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\".

One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles.

The first two sections deal with the creation of Middle Earth by Illuvatar, the god of Middle Earth. Although it is written as prose, it has a beautiful poetic quality to it. However, from the very beginning of the book it becomes evident that if you really want to read the Silmarillion, you have to grapple with an enormous number of names and characters. Unfortunately, although it is a testament to Tolkien's amazing creativity, he frequently gives multiple names to the characters and places in the books, all-the-more complicating the task of keeping the huge cast straight in your head. For this reason, I found the maps in the book and the index of names at the back invaluable.Although it certainly requires more patience, flipping back and forth from the index and maps to get a pretty firm grip on who the major characters are will greatly increase your enjoyment of the book. Some of the best parts are in the middle with Beren and Luthien's tale, and the records of Turin's valor. One of my personal favorites was the account of Fingolfin's challenge to combat with Morgoth. For those looking for background info for the LOTR and Hobbit, you won't find much directly pertinent to those books until the last two sections of the book, dealing with Numenor (the great race of men) and the forging of the rings of power.Although it is chronologically prior to the Hobbit and LOTR trilogy, I would definitely recommmend reading those books first. The Silmarillion is a difficult read (although it get much easier after the first 75 or so pages) and will be most enjoyed by dedicated fans of Tolkien's writings looking for more history of the intriguing Middle Earth. Perhaps my only disappointment with the book is that it is such a dramatic difference in style from the action &amp; dialogue-filled Hobbit and LOTR. However the Silmarillion has a beauty (and tragedy) of its own."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is Tolkien's genesis and revelation, the very foundation of his imaginative works. As a fan of his literature, I consider it to be his best work; rising above Lord of the Rings. Here, he uses his abilities as a bard, a philologist, a professor of language, and his uncanny look into the soul of his characters.This collection of tales heralds the story of the Elder Days, the basis that breathes life into Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. This web of plots and intrigue is certainly well thought out mythology, often giving the reader the feeling of stressed tedium. Nonetheless, the drive of the characters and their inner struggles fuel the fires of interest.The central story is centered around the Elves and their Golden Age-and with every Golden Age there is a fall. Faenor was one of the first to see the light of the Two Trees of Valinor-the gleaming trees of Illuvatar's light that bathed Middle Earth in eternal, holy light. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, the most skilled of the elves, and in them the light of the Trees were contained. But they were stolen by Morgoth, First Dark Lord and rebel of Illuvatar's way. Thus ignites The War of the First Age, one that will place good against evil and unfortunately put Elf against Human.Other works within the Silmarillion besides the main story: \\"Ainulindale\\", the myth of Creation; \\"Valaquenta.\\" the theology of the Valar; \\"Allakabeth,\\" the lay of mankind's downfall of their great civilization; and \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,\\" the prequel to The Lord of the Rings.Again, I consider this to be John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's finest work. The trump of his literary genius so to speak. It proudly sits on my book shelf, adding not only an excellent story, but a profound reference to any lover of Tolkien's literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Talking to others who have read (or attempted to) The Silmarillion, I discovered that you either love it, or you hate it; there is no middle ground (not to be confused with Middle Earth). I loved it. It is a fascinating take on a Creation Myth that is more than myth when you consider that some of the characters are still present in the Lord of the Rings. What lured me into risking reading this book was a desire to learn some of the back-story to the Lord of the Rings. By reading The Silmarillion, you'll discover why Frodo's cry to Elbereth is so powerful and why there is a familial bond between Aragorn and Elrond, among other fascinating insights into the fully developed world of Middle Earth. It does not read like The Lord of the Rings, but it is not as disjointed as some would have you believe. Yes, it is stilted and formal at points, but so is The Return of the King, in contrast to The Fellowship of the Ring. I recommend giving this book a try - even before reading the trilogy if possible."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In another review, I rated LOTR as \\"simply the finest work of fiction in the English language\\". One reason for this is the rich and totally credible alternate reality created by Tolkien. Before he could write LOTR, he had to create in his mind and entire alternate Earth, complete with its own mythic history and multiple races, each with its own set of unique characteristics. Each race, therefore, had to have its own language, its own lifestyles and architecture, along with a compatible environment. Hence, he made maps, providing habitats (hobbitats?) for each of his races - from the caves of Moria to the forests of Rivendell.Having created all this, Tolkien picked the most compelling portion to retell with both more depth and breadth as LOTR. As an instantly classic epic, LOTR has resonated with multiple generations.However, it was not until after professor Tolkien's death that his \\"research notes\\" were published as \\"The Silmarillion\\". Their organization and final form were established by his estate, so this is not 100% Tolkien, although all the ideas and most of the words are his. As such, it provides a panoramic view of Middle Earth before, during, and after the events of LOTR.Note, hoever, that the same caveat applies to \\"The Silmarillion\\" as LOTR, only more so - this is not an easy read! Just as engrossing, it is nevertheless much drier than LOTR - reading much like a textbook for a mythology course. It also has the same cast of characters as LOTR, plus other characters and races which have come and gone and play no role in LOTR. In other words, there's a lot more to keep track of!Still, for anyone who loves LOTR, this is indipensible reading."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am a huge fan of Tolkien and am currently reading Unfinished Tales. The Silmarillion is a beautiful but brief book that sketches and outlines the history of Middle Earth. I believe that it is an essential read for anyone interested in Tolkien. It answers many questions and gives wonderful background info for The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. The names in The Silmarillion are simply gorgeous! Besides the familiar characters from the Trilogy you will meet and fall in love with their Elven ancestors. I personally read The Silmarillion after I read the Trilogy, but the order in which you read them is irrelevent. However, I strongly recommend reading The Silmarillion before Unfinished Tales and the series that is started with The Book of Lost Tales 1. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book starts out with pretty much how the High Elves made Middle-Earth. The book goes on to tell all the history of the Elves and the role they played thru out the ages of Middle-Earth.Silmarllion goes on to tell you how the Elves delt with Morgoth the Enemy. It then tells of the One Ring and of Sauron and the coming of men into middle-earth. This book starts out very slow for about 30 or so pages then becomes very interesting. I recomend this book for anyone that has seen the movie The Fellowship of the Ring or has read any works by J.R.R. Tolkien (the best author out there)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Ouch! I had to restart this book about 4 times before I actually built up enough momentum to finish. The first page can be very daunting indeed, as you are suddenly thrust into a complete world and its associated but not always explained mythology. It is, however, an excellent read, and really lets you understand the Lord of the Rings better."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"While not as immediately engaging as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the true depth of of Tolkien's work. This is not so much a novel, as it is the collected mythology of a place and time that never existed.This work reveals in even greater depth than his other works, Tolkien's inspirations. Furthermore, his background in linguistics is revealed as the evolution of Middle Earth's denizens gives rise to a host of languages of amazing depth and consistency.This is not the easiest book to read. But a close reading will offer hundreds of delightful tidbits and will provide an incredibly thorough historical foundation for the events in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was a wonderful way to answer all the historical questions of Lord of the Rings. The strange thing may be that Silmarillion can't be read first; it'd be like reading a history book to a world you know nothing about. I enjoyed every moment and everything was put into it's place. Now I understand more about Elrond and Galadrial. And I know where the dwarves really came from, but Tolkien still leaves Olorin a bit mysterious. I loved it and anyone who loved Lord of the Rings will too!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have read the entire series, inluding this book, several times, and each time I am nearly brought to tears not only by the beauty and terrible tragedy of the stories, the depth of feeling that Tolkien was able to portray, and breadth of the world he created, but also by the sheer majesty of his writing. The Silmarilion in particular is truly a work of art -- a masterpiece of the English language equal in every sense to the other great classics of literature. This does not use canned and recycled techniques of evoking emotions. There is very little dialogue, and most of the stories are told in a much broader historical manner than the traditional novel. And yet, through Tolkien's language the reader truly feels the pain, the sorror, the triumph and ultimate tragedy of so many of his heroes. I am a great fan, and perhaps I am biased, but I find myself in a near worshipful state of awe each time I read these magical works. And I feel a great sense of humility as well. Tolkien was a true master of the art of language like very few before or since, and though at times I almost feel competent, he still can, with but a few words, make me bow in joy to his creation."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion volume is for Tolkien experts, or those with at least an intermediate knowledge of Middle Earth, who are looking for the weighty building blocks of the vast Tolkien mythology. This is more of reference work that JRR Tolkien created slowly over much of his career, as background for his other more structured works. This volume is constructed as a list of mythical fables, which are mostly self-contained with only minor threads of continuity throughout the book. Here Tolkien writes as a historian of folklore who has uncovered an intensive mythological history, and that's what makes this book so unique. But of course, Tolkien created this huge body of myths himself, approximating a cultural tradition that would take most societies thousands of years with thousands of storytellers. If anything, Tolkien's lifetime of work is astonishingly enormous, with an entire universe of characters, legends, and settings upon which his famous epics are built.With so many self-contained myths and stories that were apparently created as background and support for other works, there are readability issues with this book. A fiction volume that reads like a cultural history is surely a unique and fascinating concept, but here the reader will suffer from information overload. This can be partially attributed to Christopher Tolkien's hands-off editing (which is actually more like compiling and organizing here), as all but JRR completists would appreciate some brevity and condensing of the huge world of the Silmarillion. This can be seen in Christopher's index of places and character names in this volume, which is certainly helpful. But at more than forty pages in small font, the index illustrates the sheer intellectually imposing breadth of the mythology. Those who have built or are building an encyclopedic knowledge of Middle Earth will find this volume to be an invaluable compendium, but fans of an exciting read may want to stick with The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you, like me,are big into Tolkein and fantasy in general, than I would recomend picking up this book. However, if you are not really that interested, and are just looking for a fun read to pass the time, than I would pass on this for something else. It was my experience that you have really want the knowledge The Silmarillion contains, to have any hope of getting through it.It reads a lot like a genisis for Middle Earth, and the story line is equally as gripping. There are unreal amounts of names that he throws at you, and what is worse is that everyone has four different names and they are all used here or there. I litterally read it with a highlighter, marking when new names came into play (there is also an appendix that i did notice until half-way through).The story concerns Sauron and Elrond, with mentions of Gandalf(although through his elven name) and some others you want to hear about. Mainly the part you would recognize occurs in the last quarter of the book. What you do get to read is about various stories that are briefly refered to in LoR trilogy.It took me while to get through, but I am glad i did. It did not tell me everything I wanted to hear about, but it was pretty cool."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is so close to Shakespeare. It has some of the most beautiful language I've ever read. It's different then the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, but in a really good way."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this masterpiece soon after my first completion of The Lord of the Rings. When I first started I found the book to be rather boring and I stopped reading it. Three weeks later I picked it up with an open mind and read the book over the course of two weeks. I found this book to be amazing. Tolkien was a profoundly religious man, and The Silmarillion makes it evident. The Silmarillion is his life's work, and it is obvious that he was very passionate about his mythology and his creations. The opening pages are parallel to the book of Genesis, and the overall content is very similiar to that of the Bible. It's similarity to the Bible makes it difficult to understand at times. There are many characters in the book and many different family trees to remember. At times the reading is rather slow, but there are other times in which the content is so exciting that I never wanted it to end. The battles were epic to say the least, and I am very glad that I read this book. I recommend it to anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings and wants to find out about the legends that the characters sing about in their poems and songs. It is difficult sometimes, but in the end you will feel nothing short of satisfaction. That is a gurantee."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It was fun to read but I also have the Guide to Middle Earth and the Atlas of Middle Earth which helped greatly in reading this. It can be hard to keep track of all the lineages of the Noldor and Edain. The illustrations were great."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As a huge Tolkien fan myself, I found this book to live up to its full praise as a work of art. The Silmarillion was not only beautifully written, but very informitive as well. It discusses everything from the creating of the Earth, the many evils and battles that led to the downfall of its people, to the Numenoreans, and all the way to the forging of the rings of power. This book answers all questions or confusions left after the Lord of the Rings series, and is a must read for all Tolkien lovers!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Sillamarillion is a great book. It's a prequel in a way to the Lord of the Rings series. It tells the Tales of the first and second ages. The original Dark lord Morgath, Feanor and his sons, the forging of the Sillamarils. This books has any type of tales you could want. Love stories such as that of Beren and Luthien, to the adventures Turin Turimbar. I think anyone who reads this book will enjoy it greatly. Although I strongly suggest reading The Lord of the Rings first to get a Idea of what they are talking about."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is not the easiest book to read, but for those addicted to the &quot;truth&quot; of Midddle-Earth and its inhabitants, an absolute necessity. It explains all the history of the beginning, the interludes and the finality of this magnificent universe. It pulls together many histories that were omitted in the recounting of earlier stories. Tolkien's concept of the beginning of the earth surely rivals that of the Bible's Genesis. The only problem found by some readers is that the &quot;accounts&quot; are not necessarily time-sequential; but if you can understand this, the reading will make each reader wizer and more fulfilled by this metaphor of our existance and our dreams."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In anticipation of the upcoming LOR film trilogy I recently reread the Silmarillion after a gap of at least 10 years. I found it immensely satisfying.Don't expect an epic narrative a la Lord of the Rings; the Silmarillion is more a series of related short stories that relate the origins and early history of middle earth, and especially of the elves whose descendants populate the world of the Lord of the Rings.The language is beautiful, and many of the stories are moving and compelling in their own right. Tolkien's use of the English language is masterful, in an entirely different league from the vast majority of fantasy on the market today. And the world he created holds together better than virtually all of the many writers who have followed in his footsteps. If you enjoyed LOR, and want to understand the history that got middle earth to where it is in the trilogy, this is truly essential reading.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book tells us the story of middle-earth ,in the times before the &quot;lord of the rings&quot; saga. the great march of the elves to the land of the valar reminds me a bit of the bible's great crossing of sinai desert. The whole book is a kind of simile to the old testament, beginning with the creation of the world by Eru and the ainur reveling to his creations like the angels who praised God. Not forgetting the Fallen morgoth, most powerful of the ainur, who can safely be assimilated to you-know-who. i think what Tolkien did here is a fantasy masterpiece that refers openly to the Bible without being a pathetic copy of it. The silmarillion drips with epic wars, heroic deeds and an undescribable atmosphere ,that guarantees you'll always be finding the necessary time to plunge back into the story, forgetting everything else happening around you. And just like me you won't want the book to finish. This work is a must-have for every fan of the fantastic.Period."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a must for those who have read the LOTR. I read it when I was 10, so I was a bit confused, but I still thought that it was a really great book. Last year I read it again and liked it even better."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Well, liked how tolkien creates a whole new world, and then builds a plot from that. Very good, I like the part where that big spider girl attacks melkor best. I wonder, why arnt there any gods that roam around in middle earth in the lord of the rings?. Preaty good, thought it is LONG."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In the Silmarillion, Tolkien describes the creation of the world as an evolving chorus sung by the Angels. The Dark Lord rebels in braying discord, but the clear melody of the One God ultimately triumphs. Tolkien's passage describing the Song of the One is perhaps the truest review of the Silmarillion itself: the faintest whisper at first, becoming slow, deep, and wide, possessed of an almost unbearable sorrow from which chiefly arises its beauty. Tolkien's elegantly crafted prose creates a web of many hundreds of hauntingly realistic lives that captures, then pierces your heart with the overwhelming tragedy and nobility of the human condition. A must read for serious students of the soul."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This tome, although a tough read, contains such an overabundance of both joy and sorrow that reading it makes my heart dance and my head swim. The WORLD that is created on these pages is utterly amazing and the peoples who inhabit this world touch my soul like no book I have ever come across. The many individual stories that make up this book are so filled with emotion that one cannot help but to be left awestruck by their scope and majesty. The way that Tolkien weaves these sundry tales together to form a cohesive history of Middle Earth never fails to remind me that J.R.R. Tolkien had the most fertile mind of anyone who has set a pen to paper in many an age. May he rest in peace in his beloved Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book stands alone. No other author offers the reader the scope, depth, fierce beauty and tragic character flaws like Tolkien. You must however be prepared to reread this book multiple times in order to appreciate all the subtle interelations of the characters. I have studied his work for nearly twenty years and continue to be inpired each time I pick it up. If you only read one book in your lifetime, this should be it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Wow, it was confusing for a bit but then it became really good. It made the lord of the rings much more clear and with the information that was found ( in an interesting way ) the story of the lord of the rings is made better. Way to go Tolkien"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read this book when I was 10. I didn't get it at all. Confused and bewildered. I reread it two years later and fell in love with it. Simply the greatest book I have ever read. Many people consider the beginning dull, I won't argue against that. But who has not cried at the death of Beleg? Or felt excitement and dread at the battle of Fingolfin and Morgoth? Or wish that the Sons of Feanor would relent in their Oath? If you loved reading tales of King Arthur as a kid, I think this book is right up your alley. Each tale is grand in scope and importance. Each warrior the greatest, each love the truest, every loyalty the strongest, and the last betrayal the most heartbreaking. The Silmarillion is about the tragedy which we call life, and how beautiful it is. Though I don't believe that Good needs Evil in order to exist. I do believe that tragedy is bittersweet and a lot of good comes out of the bad. The Silmarillion shows that in every story. This is the book I love to surprise on my friends who think they have found the ultimate novel."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book starts slow, but once you get past the first section the action begins to pick up and the story becomes one of the better ones that Tolkien has ever written."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Thank you Christopher for editing tihs book so we can read it. This amazing book about good vs evil, elves vs Morgoth.It has everything, if you have reed LoR then you should read this book to."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is quite different from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It is not a single story told in a linear fashion as is Lord of the Rings, rather, it is a collection of stories and legends from a much older past, when powers much greater were at work. From the very beginning of history up to the Great War of the Ring, each story adds detail to Tolkien's world until you are simply in awe of the magnitude, complexity, and yet continuity of his creation. This book (as hard as it may seem) can only increase your enjoyment of reading Lord of the Rings again. Since the next time you read:&quot;But if you take it (One Ring) freely, I will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, Hador, and Hurin, and Turin, and Beren himself were assembled together, your (Frodo's) seat should be among them.&quot;You will better understand the honor that Elrond was bestowing upon Frodo. A must read for those whose curiosity was pricked for the understanding of such names. An excellent book.A warning: I felt the beginning was kind of dry, it seemed like either Tolkien or his son (Christopher, editor) wanted to make the beginning sound like the King James Bible with the extensive use of thy's and thou's."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"i loved lord of the rings and the hobbit so i decided to read this and i was very happy that i did. this book allows me to fully understand everything in the lord of the rings and the hobbit. J.R.R. Tolkien is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If this book were not created by the undisputed master of fantasy, nobody would be giving it 5 stars. It reads like the quick draft of a backstory for a fantasy world. Dungeons & Dragons dungeon masters often create things like this when they make up a new world.As a narrative intended for readers to read directly, it's terrible. Dozens of people have similar names. Some people and places have several names, or are renamed/nicknamed after certain events. Tolkien continues to use both/all names interchangeably. Characters and places are introduced, then never referred to again.There's at least seven names for the Elves alone (they're almost never called Elves) depending on whether they fully, partially or skipped crossing the ocean (the first time), whether they returned or stayed in one particular kingdom.Remember Gandalf? That's not his name. He's a minor god named Olorin, except he never told anybody his name so the Elves (sorry, the Noldor & Sindar) named him Mithrandir and the 'men of the north' called him Gandalf. The story about him continues to call him Mithrandir. I'd normally read a book this size in a day or two, but with constantly flipping to the back to check the mini-encyclopedia/index, it took over a week. Is Finlagund (also named Finrod) the same guy as Fingolfin or Finarfin? No, Finrod is Finarfin's son and Fingolfin is his uncle. These are the kinds of exciting questions you'll be pausing your reading to answer as you go.These difficult-to-follow stories are the result of Tolkien playing around with his invented languages (like Quenya, the language of the Elves) and imagining the history that created dialects and branches. \\"Fin\\" means hair in that language, so apparently the similar fin-names translate to \\"the blonde haired one\\" and stuff like that, if you want to pick the terms apart. He submitted these stories for publishing, but they were rejected. It was after he wrote Lord of the Rings and then died that his son assembled the stories & published them for his diehard fans.If you want to know what's in this book, read the wikipedia article on it. It's a good summary without all the pointless detours & multiple names for things. If you're fascinated with the Quenya language and want to see it used in a natural setting by a lingustics master, then read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"great! really fantastic book explaining how Middle Earth came to be.

There are some chapters that feature a little bit of dialogue, but honestly, it's rare, and I feel that takes away from the narrative. It sounds more like Tolkien wrote this for his own benefit than anything else, a sort of method to keep track of the histories of Middle-earth like when you are jotting down notes as you write. Either way, it's fun for the knowledge. I do wish there was more about the Valar, but their presence isn't as profound in the book as I hoped."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It is the background for the Hobbit and the Lord Of The Ring and Aragoran's lineage. It was interesting learning how the world began."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you need to know Tolkien on the go it is a great thing to have! yes in did it is"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is, altogether, a triumph. Its joys and griefs are deeper than those of The Lord of the Rings, and its stories are more beautiful and haunting.The price paid for this is the writing. It is intensely descriptive, and does not read quickly. A bit of patience is nessacery to start the Silmarillion, but any reader who gets a little ways into it will quickly forget the frustration of the first few pages.Among the highlights of the volume are the tale of Beren and Lutien, which speaks of a love born between the kindreds of elves and men which is haunted by the sorrow of the enemy; the tale of Turin Turambar, which is a haunting account of fate, courage, and the power of a desperate will against evil; and the tale of Earendil, which is Tolkien's message of enduring hope and an account of the end of the first age.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a journey through the imagination of J. R. R. Tolkien. It begins with the creation of Arda (Middle Earth) and gives us a history of the world up to the Lord of the Rings. The novel is split into four main parts; The creation, The First Age, the Second Age, and the Third Age.The Creation sets the stage of our story by telling the story of how Arda, Elves, Men, Dwarves and all living creatures came to be. We see how the land and sea are formed and we are told of the fallen that bring evil into the world.The First Age tells the story of the many Wars between the Elves and the Evil One (and all of his Orcs/Goblins). We also see the transition between the old world of the past and the new world of Middle Earth from LOTR.The Second Age revolves around Men and their growing influence in the world. The live on an island called Numenor aka Atalante (sound familiar). Here they live and prosper for generations as we read of their exploits. The Second Age ends with tragedy as you can guess from the Numenor's other name.Finally, The Third Age tells stories regarding the Ring of Power. We learn more about the Ring and how it was forged, and we are given insights from the perspectives of various characters concerning the forging of, search for, and destruction of the Ring.All in all, this is a GREAT history of Middle Earth. This is Tolkien's real life's work, as he started writing it in his early teens and worked on it until his death. We are given insights into history and language and we are transported to another world that seems that it could have really existed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book isn't his best, but it's worth the read. My favorite chapter was, of course, Of Beren &amp; Luthien. It was a little confusing, in the middle, but I got over it. I liked the dark elf chapter. And, for LOTR fans, Galdriel is in a few pages."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a great help for those wanting to understand Tolkien's Middle Earth. For someone who has never even looked at Tolkien, I wouldn't recommend starting with this one. Check out the Hobbit instead. For those already steeped in Middle Earth, this book gives you great info about the First Age and what went on. It gives stories about characters only mentioned in The Lord of the Rings, plus a great mythological account of where all the elves, men and dwarves came from. It is a great guide to use to tie the story of Middle Earth together."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read this book about 12 years ago. Since then, I've read many great fantasy works (Jordan, G. Kay, Feist, Martin, Eddings, Brooks, Zimmer-Bradley). I've also read much mythology and medieval romance (Mallory, Greek/Norse Myths, Dante, Piers Plowman, etc.) The Silmarillion equals or tops anything else without question.This isn't a novel, it's an epic tragedy. Approach it with this in mind and it rewards well. Though the writing is inconsistent, the poetry of the stories and, in many cases, the beauty of the language combine to make the experience deeper than any other fantasy out there. The opening passage of the book, describing the creation of the world in music, is a masterpiece in its own right. The subsequent history of the elves, with the inevitable corruption of the world as the major theme, is a fitting fulfillment to the promise of the opening lines. Technically, Tolkien might not have been as good a writer as many others, but the sheer force of his vision over the course of his life has left us a true piece of literature.Timeless."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have been an avid lover of fantasy for my entire life. Of all hundreds of fantasy works I have read, including those of Feist, Eddings, Goodkind, Martin, Jordan, Lawhead, Salvatore, and countless others, Tolkien's Silmarillion stands out as the greatest that I have ever known. I have always been fascinated by the works of Tolkien and even more so by the man himself. Many people do not realize that in creating the Silmarillion, John was creating an entire mythology for his country of England. What takes entire cultures hundreds of years to develop, he created within a few decades. This achievement is simply staggering. The Silmarillion itself is a second Bible to me. Even more amazingly, it transcends the Holy Book in some areas with poetic wording and an epic scope. Readers literally become one of his characters and feel the awesome power and majesty that Tolkien succeeded in conveying unlike any other author since. The only other way I can express how deep my feelings are for this work is a quote from George R.R. Martin--a great writer in his own right. &quot;Let them keep their heaven. When I die, I want to be buried in Middle Earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A truly spectacular account of the creationism of middle-earth and of the days before days.

Published one year after his death The Silmarillion tells of the mythology and the history of the Elves. \\"In the beginning there was Eru, the one, who in the elven tongue is called Illuvatar...\\" so says the Valaquenta, one of the five parts of The Silmarillion. The Silmarillion tells of the evil of the first dark lord Morgoth, and his many attempts to darken Arda, the world. Morgoth will stop at nothing to destroy and corrupt the world. Yet there is hope for the great elves have the help of the Valar, those who are basically gods. I would recommend this title to only those which belong to the group of the Tolkiendili, or lovers of his work. This book is written in a format which would bore many to sleep, a form much akin to a bible. Now for my critique of the edition. This edition of The Silmarillion is a great edition. The printing is very good, and almost never if ever a mistake. The maps are excellent, the appendix of names and the index are very great, and help me very often.

While I am not native English speaker I got used to the archaic language quite fast to my surprise (I was actually scared by all the comments). The difficulty I had has more to do with the number of names and places, and pronunciation of some of them. Don't be discouraged about the book's difficulty, you can read it in chunks and consume it in your own pace!

As a matter of fact, get this book and read it repeatedly - you won't need another after this.Second point for the one and two star 'boring' people: this book was not intended for you. The tales are epic, so there's a lot of names. The writing is sophisticated (though accessible), so there's some tough paragraphs. The Hobbit was written for one class of reader, the LOTR for another, the Silmarillion for yet another."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Although it lacks the beginning to end continuity of LOR, perhaps due to being edited by Christopher Tolkien, the scope and depth of the stories and the ability to truly capture the imagination of the reader is unmatched by any book I've read. I first read it when I was 11 years old and 20 years later and about 20 readings later it still makes my heart soar. When the pressures of everyday life get too great this is a great place to be transported to, and even a cynical person like myself can find it believeable. To me, the LOR is a primer for the greater tale of the 1st age of Middle-Earth, and Tolkien's vast mastery of the English language is put to wonderful use in the Silmarillion. No matter how many times I read it, it still brings me to every realm of my emotions each time. It has a strange way of seeming more real than even the best novels that are set in the world as we know it. As a lover of Greek mythology, I particularly like the early sections of the book. I think that in this day and age the idealisms in this book are sorely missed, and there many parallels to our modern day problems and the stories in this book. It reallly is so well done that it seems more like a history than a work of fiction. Although chronologically it precedes LOR it seems that it should be read 3rd, after the Hobbit and LOR, due to it's increasing scale. I've read most of the classics but to me this is the greatest literary gift that I've received."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I was incredibly excited to begin with this book as i'm a pretty big fan of Tolkien. When i got it from a friend i immediately started reading it, hoping that it would enlighten me on the history and creation of Middle Earth.I am amazed at the language and storyline Tolkien has come up with, it was beautifully written and is very complex.However, the thing that i find disappointing in this book, is that, as many have stated, the amount of energy you spend to read it. It eventually wears you out and leaves you quite confused and not to mention, really tired for most of us. But I do give my respect to the master storyteller and I admire and praise him for the book's intricate tapestry of storyline and history."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion consists of a history of Middle Earth from the creation through most of the period before the Lord of the Rings stories take place. It is written as a history, not as a modern novel (unlike Lord of the Rings); and so do not read it expecting a novel. However, if you are very addicted to the Lord of the Rings saga and plan to read it again, the Silmarillion will definitely provide a lot of key historic information that will enhance your enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings. It will help you understand the origins of the races and many of the names and places mentioned in the songs and tales which may have seemed rather obscure the first time around.You should also read The Price of Immortlaity, you will not be disappointed"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have just finished reading this wonderful book. I am afraid, however, that those who do not generally love to read will not get very far. My favriote part in the book is the Ainulindale (Am I spelling right?), or The Music of the Ainur. I also love the compassionate story of Luthian (spelling?) and Beren. Tolkien created just the right ending for them. As well as good reading, this book also clarifies a great many things from the Lord of the Rings. Practically all the songs in the trilogy are found in longer, more comprehinsible, story format. What was the religion of Middle Earth? How did Gandalf survive for so long? How come he didn't take offense when Elrond said, \\"Men are weak\\"? Who's Elbereth? Why did Bilbo write a song about Earendil and the someone (I forgot who) said that he was brave? Learn all this, and more... *cuts to ominous music*"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Forming the mythological backdrop to the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion is a different work than the classic Lord of the Rings. It is not a simple novel. It is a epic mythology of creation and tells of the long history prior to the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien, over his long lifetime, created an incredible work, and the Silmarillionis almost indescribable. Easily suprior than anything by the Greeks, Shakespeare, Dante, Dickens, Tolstoy or others masters of literature, it shares some of the greatness of those works. It will move you to tears of sadness and you may shed tears for its beautiful, moving poetry. The deeds are heroic and grand, dark and deadly. Pride and hatred vie with beauty and love. The Tales of Beren and of Turin are heartwrenching to any reader with even an iota of compassion. It has all the elements of a great mythos: the ultimate evil, despairing heroism, epic love, anguish and joy, oaths sworn in anger, doom and despair. It explores all the themes of epic lieterature and does so far far better than any other work of fiction, before or since. Like the Lord of the Rings, it deserves rereading and each time it will demonstrate some new facet that will take you to new heights of literary pleasure. It is incomparable, it has never been surpassed. It simply is the greatest."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As noted by other reviewers, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not for everyone. It is not for those who cannot appreciate the Truth and Beauty of Myth. It is not for those who want their stories carefully pruned of any hint of sadness or misery. It is not for those who seek &quot;relevance&quot; (actually narrow-mindedness) in their literature. Nor is it for those of Tolkien's fans who see the history of Middle-Earth as nothing but a backdrop for the real action, for it delves deeply into that very history, starting at the very beginning -- Creation. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is for those who know that Truth and Beauty are timeless -- that people of all ages everywhere throughout all of history can resonate with the courage of Hurin facing the hordes of Morgoth Bauglir, or the love of Beren and Luthien, or the sorrow of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, or the fury of Feanor at the theft of the Silmarils. It is for those who realize that fantasy, which can deal with universal themes that all of us -- rich and poor, black and white, male and female, ancient and modern -- can relate to, can often teach us more about the &quot;real world&quot; than &quot;contemporary fiction&quot;, which can only tell us about one person's experience of one part of one country in one time period. It is for those who realize that fantasy, when it is well done, teaches us about ourselves -- about what we truly desire, about what our true purpose is. It is for those who realize that fantasy, as written by J.R.R. Tolkien, helps us answer those eternal questions -- &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;What is life's purpose?&quot; and &quot;Why am I reading this review?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am not willing to review here The Silmarillion because I believe it takes quite a sensitive critic to do it properly. I keep on discussing it with a friend of mine who is one such critic and his opinions differing completely from mine I assume I need more time.At any rate, read the appendixes of The Lord of the Rings: if you like them you probably will like The Silmarillion too; if you do not... save your money.This edition is particularly agile in that it spares the reader foot notes and alternative versions: if you just wish to get an idea of the work it will suit you admiringly well whereas if you need an edition to rely upon you better choose another one.The print is excellent and easy to read but the publisher chose a very shiny magazine paper which is painful under artificial light.Illustrations are many but just average: the artist is a competent landscape painter with a good sense of colouring but his people are stiff and unpleasant. Some of the picture are quite rough, as if from another, less competent hand.I would not buy this volume again for this price: it is supposed to be a collector's edition but it would result better as a slightly more expensive paperback."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A very long history of Middle Earth.

Tolkien - the Silmarillion is probably not your cup of tea.But when the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit have drawn your interest in how Tolkien masterfully invented this world you can't do without The Silmarillion. Don't expect though to read it as a novel or even an epos like the Lord of the Rings. Sometime it's dry stuff. But if you have the endurence to digest The Silmarillion you get a wonderful insight in the consistency and the beauty of the word Tolkien made up so craftedly."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book started out as the &quot;first&quot; tales of the tales of Middle Earth, but was never published during his lift time. At points, he took it out and worried with it, redid it, polishing it. I think as his other tales came to life the saw the need for adjustments in the roots of his tales. Still when he died it remained unpublished. His son, Christopher, picked up the threads and edited the book tells a tale of the Elder Days, when Elves and Men became estranged by the Dark Lord and it was finally published, but to the thrill of Tolkien fans, four years after his death.Many new fans of his thrilling works have come to know his tales through the Ring Movies, but will have questions, want to know more. So I recommend this for all Tolkien fans, old and new wanting to have more depth to the Beginning.A super gift for your Tolkien friend!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is really helpful in decribing how things came to be and what caused many of the things in The Lord of the Rings to happen. My personal favorite in the story is the Tale of Beren and L&uacute;thien, which is a tale similar to that of Aragorn and Arwen. Overall, this book was beautifully written and exellent for any Lord of the Rings fan."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a serious fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's other books and you want to learn more about the history of middle earth, then you will find this book fascinating. One word of warning however; It is not a story in the sense that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is. Yes, it does explain many of the myths and stories from the past hinted in LOTR, but it a series of stories rather, that all happen to be a part of the history of middle earth. It is also easy to get lost with all of the strange names and unfamiliar places, but it is rich in detail and well worth reading if you want to delve into the events that led up to those in LOTR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"There was Eru, the one, who in Arda is called Illuvatar and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offsprings of his thoughts, and they were with him befour aught else was made\\".One of the greatest Litterature starts like this, the beginning of everything and the Ainurs make a great Music and in this music Eru Illuvatar creates the world Middle-earth that we later know in the lord of the rings.The silmarillion retells the legends of Middle-earth, from the creation of the world, the making of elfs, humans and dwarfs to the destructive power of the greatest Ainur, Melkor.The silmarillions are three holy crystals that holds the remaining light of the two holy tree\`s destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliante.

Certainly not! It started to read like one,old and lacking of momentum. But after a couple weeks I was enthralled at the majesty of Tolkien's vision. He created a whole world,complete with languages and culture. Towards the end,I couldn't pull myself away! I found myself rationing the few last pages (REALLY!). I don't see how anyone could go without reading such a fantastic book. Just read it. My favorite parts were Turin Turambur and Berin and Luthien! Oh,and the Numenorien thing! And the part about the third age! Just all of it!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have talked to a few people who said they thought the story was choppy, or the narrative hard to follow, but I personally loved the story. The complex history, and intricately woven tales were wonderful. I've read it no fewer than four times, and enjoy it incredibly every time. The background provided here opens the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings to an entirely new level of intimacy.I would suggest this book to any fan of the Lord of the Rings, or fantasy stories in general."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien has, beyond any doubt, created the most extensive fantasy world, Arda, in wich Middle-Earth figures.This book is highly recommended to any Tolkien reader, it counts the beginning of the days, how the songs of the Ainur created all things , how the elves made the Silmarils and were stolen by Melkor the Vala, the wars of the ancient days and many important things of the past of Arda, including the forging of the rings of power.Another admirable masterpiece of J.

The Silmarillion is the #1 source for stories of Middle-earth beyond those of Lord of the Rings. This is a compilation of stories that tells the history of the elves. This book contains the stories that are alluded to in song among the great races of Middle-earth. Stories like that of Beren and Luthien. Reading this book will help you understand the importance of the items of lore referred to through out Lord of the Rings. So if you liked Lord of the Rings, this is the next book to get. It is a must-have for all Tolkien fans. I give it five out of five stars and highly recommend it to all who has read Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you have read Lord of the Rings and still want more adventures by J. R. R. Tolkien, you have to read this book! This book explains everything about the history of Tollkien's world, starting with the making of the earth, and finally leading to the events in the Lord of the Rings. It also answered many of my questions, including who Sauron and Balrogs are, and how Elves and Men were made.The Silmarillion is mostly about the First Age, when elves were the most important beings in Middle Earth. Elves familiar in Lord of the Rings, such as Elrond, Galadriel, and Celeborn take part in it. The ending of the Silmarillion is sad and tragic, and yet beautiful. Because the entire book is history, it covers many years and generations, and very many characters appear.Though I had a hard time memorizing the names of so many characters, I was helped by the Index of Names at the end of the book. I'm sure you will find it necessary when you read the story. There also are family trees of Elves and Men which I could use to locate ancestors of some important characters in Lord of the Rings. Like I said, this book is a must read to all true Tolkien lovers!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As profoundly beautiful as the creation of the world through the eyes of Tolkien really is, this book is for those who *have* to know *more* about Tolkien's elves, or for those who have a passionate love (and attention span) for myths and ancient legends.Where as the Hobbit was a children's story compared to the breath and scope of the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion is another step up in the complexity ladder of Tolkien's fictional history books. Interweaving characters and situations together, creating a complicated tapestry of Middle Earth, pre-War of the Rings, this is not light reading - but it's just as fanciful and enjoyable as Tolkien's other Middle Earth works. Brave it only *after* you've read the Lord of the Rings, if you so desire to know more about the origins of many characters and places such as Galadriel, Elrond, and Rivendell.Sorry, the Sil *still* doesn't explain that whacked out Tom Bombadill character though!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"How to begin... This book is essentially a history for Middle Earth. Books 1-6 and 10-12 of what are now considered the Histories of Middle Earth, were simply early revisions of this work. In the Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien essentially took all of his father's latest work on the history and put it together into this series of tales.The Silmarillion will remind the fan of mythology of tales from the Romans or the Greeks especially. Truly, Tolkien's fantasy should really be termed mythology or history instead, for there is very little of what most would term to be magic. Any power that any being has is derived of its nature. For instance, Manwe may have some power over the winds and the skies, however, he is termed a god, or in reality an Ainur and so it is logical that he have this power.The book is written in a very archaic form of language, which to some may be annoying, but I personally find it quite pleasing to the ear. It indeed makes sense that it is written in such a way when you consider that it is to be ancient history. It is not necessarily an easy book to read. Aside from the somewhat difficult language, there are a multitude of characters, many of which have several names, and it is somewhat difficult to keep up. I have found the chart in the back of the book to be of great assistance. Also, the map in the front is easy to read and will help one who cares to do so, keep track of the action.Lastly, I will argue for the purchasing of this illustrated edition over the simple paperback. First, it makes reading so much easier as it will simply lay open, which is nice if you like to read in bed. Second and most importantly, Ted Nasmith is a fantastically talented artist. His illustrations are just breathtakingly beautiful. They make you feel as if you were there. (I might mention that I own the edition before this one, or at least it has a different cover, Maglor tossing a Silmaril into the Sea. Not that that makes a difference.)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Don't let the reviews citing slowness or complexity scare you off from this tremendous piece of literature. True, the work functions more like a reference material at times (one reviewer has alluded to the constant flipping back and forth to the tables and indices), and this IS a necessary inconvenience until you get more engrossed in the characters and their relationships. But i, personally, was fascinated by the geneology charts and the timelines, and by finding much more info on things that were only alluded to in the Hobbit and LotR...your mileage may vary, as they say.The narrative also should NOT read like the other four works (Hobbit and Trilogy) because the scope and depth of the work is far too broad; Professor Tolkien would have been writing endlessly for 100 years in order to make it read like the other books. His son Christopher has done a masterful job with this text, much better than with the other &quot;Tales&quot; books that he has published more recently. One leaves the Silmarillion with a completed view of the entire history of Elves and Men, including the events of the Third Age and the Rings of Power.For those who watched the films and asked such questions as, &quot;What is all this business about the Elves sailing into the West?&quot; or &quot;How is it that Arwen changes from Elfmaiden to Woman?&quot; or &quot;Who exactly are the Half-Elven?&quot; or -- well, don't want to spoil too much of the third film, or the books themselves...But if you are hungry for more Tolkien after the LotR, this is definitely the book. Take another reviewer's suggestion and borrow it first, if you must, but i don't regret buying my copy, and will buy a hardcover soon. In keeping with the Christian allegory, Silmarillion is the Old Testament whearas the Trilogy and Hobbit are the New Testament. That helped me to process both works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I think that many of the people who gave this book a bad review had a real mis-understanding of what type of book it was suppose to be...It is NOT a novel like The Hobbit or the LOTR trilogy!! It is more of a history book. It's a compilation of different legends and lore from the first ages of Middle Earth. Parts of it are rather &quot;dry&quot; (boring) to read, but many parts are very interesting! For instance, I loved the long chapter about the romance between Beren and Luthien. By reading The Silmarillion, you gain a much deeper understanding of the LOTR trilogy. There are many names in the book - so many that I could not keep them all straight. I frequently had to look up names in the dictionary in the back of the book - in order to remember who someone was...Approach this book with the right perspective: It is a history book for the serious LOTR fan. If you are someone who just has a surface or temporary interest in LOTR because of the movies...then you will likely not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"The Silmarillion\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic story of noble forces of good battling and overcome the overwhelmingly powerful forces of evil. The odds are definitely not in their favor but by not giving up they are able to prevail in the end. This is the basic theme to \\"The Silmarillion\\", which acts as a prequel to his other works \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Silmarillion\\" is more like a collection of tales and legends than it is a story. It is the story of creation of the world of Middle-earth, and of the events that occurred in the first age. In the realm of Valinor, land of the gods, across vast seas to the west of Middle-earth, the elves lived in prosperity for many years. Creating many works of great beauty and power. The greatest of these were the three Silmarils, great jewels created by the elf lord Feanor. Within these jewels was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor, trees that contained the pure light of the gods. But the dark lord Morgoth was inflamed with jealousy of the work of Feanor, for he had always desired to posses the light of Valinor, but had never been able to do it. In his jealous rage Morgoth destroyed the Two Trees and covered the land of Valinor in darkness. Then he used the cover of darkness to enter Valinor again and steal the Silmarils from the house of Feanor. Morgoth fled from the land of Valinor and stole back to his stronghold in Middle-earth. Feanor is so enraged by this that he rebels and also leaves Valinor with his kindred in pursuit of Morgoth. This is the beginning of the war against Morgoth for the possession of the silmarils. Many adventures and acts of great heroism occur during this battle against evil. In the end it seems that Morgoth may be able to win the war against the peoples of Middle-earth. But finally the Valar to come to the aid of the people of Middle-earth, and with the combined forces of the elves, men, and Valar they are finally able to defeat Morgoth. Manwe, the lord of the Valar, banishes Morgoth to the void, a black space of nothingness from which there is no escape.In \\"The Silmarillion\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic tale where the forces of good are up against the seemingly endless forces of evil. If they fail then the world will fall into the darkness. But by keeping hope alive and never giving up the forces of good are able to keep evil at bay and in the end the triumph over it. This is the never-ending fight between good and evil. Where good starts out against seemingly unbeatable odds, but in the end they find away to defeat evil. Good always triumphs over evil; this is the basic principle for this book and many others like it. In this book the setting is extremely relevant to the theme. It places the reader in a magical world with elves, dragons, monsters, and great warriors. The battles events that take place and the characters that were involved in this story wouldn't have worked in a different setting. A mystical world threatened by a dark and evil lord, courageous warriors fighting to save their homelands and to defeat evil in their world forever. The time period that this all takes place in is also very relevant. This book is meant to set up the history that takes place before any of his other books. It sets up things that come into play later in the book, and things that happen in completely different books. The chronological order that events happen in have a big effect on the way the story the book tells comes together. The setting plays a major role in making the theme of this book work as well as it does. The magic power of the elves played a huge role in the forces of good winning over the forces of evil. When Morgoth is banished to the void the power of the Valar along with the elves was the only thing that allowed the people of Middle-earth succeed. This is one of the more important aspects of the setting, the characters and creatures in Middle-earth. Without all of the different types of people in the book the story wouldn't have worked like it did. Even though the theme is the classic theme of good verses evil, the setting and characters in it take this simple theme and make it into an epic story that is both very believable and realistic, but also very complex and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is my favorite book ever. I have to start with that statement. I was not planning to read &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; I had heard how slow-going it was. But as my love of Middle-Earth grew, so did my lust for more knowledge of the characters I so loved.I am extremely glad I picked up &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; Everybody I listened to is right. It is a slow read. There is almost no fast-paced action, and many sections read like chapters of an International Bible. But these are not downfalls of the book by any means. This is a wonderfully crafted writing. I take my time reading it, so that I may absorb the history of Arda (Tolkein's Earth) more easily. I read each chapter with anticipation of reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; again with a deeper understanding of where many of the characters came from. For instance, I now have a much deeper appreciation of the Elves.I would not recommend this book for everyone, but if you have a little patience and a great love for Middle-Earth, buy this book now."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm 31 now and I think I first read LotR when I was 12. It's an amazing story I've read at least 10 times. The Silmarillion gives meaning and depth to the The Hobbit and LotR. It provides the historical background for the events at the end of the Third Age, and in itself is a fantastic cycle of tales. While some would say it's &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;, I would disagree. I believe the tone of the book is intended to convey a written (or oral) history, written at a much later date than the events depicted in the text (possibly &quot;Translations from the Elvish&quot; as written by Bilbo Baggins in Rivendell) and as such is (for the most part) written in the third person, without much dialog but with plenty of action. The creation of the Silmarils by Feanor, their theft by Melkor, and the trajedy of the Oath of the Noldor is epic fantasy at its peak, and has yet to be surpassed by any other author."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; what the books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) are to the Gospels. While it is certainly possible (indeed, probable) to obtain a certain understanding about the life and ministry of Jesus by reading the Gospels and ignoring the entire Old Testament, one obtains a much fuller vision of the meaning of the Gospels if one has an understanding of the Old Testament.This analogy fits very well with the relationship between &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and Tolkien's other fiction. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; one examines in close detail two specific episodes at the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth, just like the Gospels give an account of the brief life and ministry of Jesus. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, like the Old Testament, provides a grand, sweeping background of thousands of years of history, making the later stories come alive in a new, more deep, more rich fashion.Like the Old Testament, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not always an easy read. But who says that great books have to always be easy? And &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is indeed a great book. I've read it now about 20 times, and re-read it usually about twice a year. I can no longer go through it without being literally reduced to tears.Who can fail to be moved by the creation of the world? Or by the great duel between Fingolfin and Morgoth? Or by the love and devotion of Finrod Felagund? And who can even begin to claim to understand any of Tolkien's thought without having been immersed in the tale of Beren and Luthien?My heart is moved, and my emotions rise to the surface merely by writing these words. If you do not read &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, you will be turning your back on one of the greatest, most beautiful works of fiction ever written in the English language."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"First, I am not an accomplished reader. You should know that I labor just to read my computer magazines by the time the next one arrives. I hope you can appreciate that I even made it through the Silmarillion!Now, to the book: don't hesitate to buy this edition of The Silmarillion. It is nicely bound in a subdued blue cloth cover. There are no fancy gilded decals or edges. Don't let the simple cover fool you - inside are the finest illustrations of Tolkien's incredible history of the land of the Elves and of Middle Earth in the early days.The paper is high quality, glossy and with a clear typeface. This is not one of those cheap knock-off editions by unauthorized printing houses. You're getting what you pay for in this edition. Buy with confidence!If you don't know about the premier artists of Tolkien's works, there are three that immediately come to mind: Alan Lee, John Howe and Ted Nasmith. Lee and Howe are reknowned for their artwork in the Third Age - the days of Tolkien's LoTR and The Hobbit. Ted Nasmith brings the early first and second ages of middle earth to life. His artistry is masterful. I especially enjoy his scenery paintings. He helps bring the world of the elves to life for me.This is a beautiful edition of The Silmarillion, almost too nice to crack open and read. For me it will remain part of my \\"nice book\\" collection - I have cheap paperbacks for reading!As for the story of The Silmarillion, this is not lightweight reading. If you enjoy Deuteronomy or physics journals, you'll breeze right through this book! I tried unsuccessfully three times to read The Silmarillion. Ugh! All the names, places and events. Too much for my simple mind. What's worse, Tolkien isn't content to just name his characters once, he likes to use their names in other languages, as well. I think he did that to keep his works in the hands of really literate people. But, I fooled him!I bought a copy on eBay of The Silmarillion on CDs by Martin Shaw. It is a ver batim version so I could just follow along in the book; sort of my version of \\"letting my fingers do the walking.\\" It worked wonderfully and opened up Tolkien's incredible world to me.Before tackling The Silmarillion, if you have seen the movies, read The Hobbit. It's light and breezy and even I got through it without any difficulty. Then, either read Lord of The Rings (LoTR) or watch the movies again before diving into The Silmarillion. Pay particular notice to the historical glimpses such as Isildur and Elrond in Mount Doom and to the looks of all the elves. Try to guess their ages.Now, crack open your new edition of The Silmarillion and watch the heroic and tragic story of the elves come alive. You'll find out why Frodo's and Sam's little vials of light worked like they did, and you'll hear the story behind Shelob, the spider. You'll be astounded to know that Sauron, the evil one, was a mere shadow of the real true Evil One. His name was Morgoth. Well, that's one of his names. Melkor is another.I promise you, buy this book and you'll have a classy addition to your library. Read this book and you'll never see LoTR the same again. And if you think elves are little cartoon characters who work for Keebler making cookies, you're in for the surprise of your life! They make humans seem so small and fallible.I was truly sorry to see The Days of The Elves come to an end. Look in the night sky - Elendil lives! You're in for a great experience. Enjoy the adventure..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is not for the neophyte or faint of heart. It is the core of the mythological world created by Tolkien. In fact, Tolkien began this work well before he began to weave it into the more familiar Middle Earth of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. He dispaired of its ever being published, and yet desired its publication more than any of his other works. It was not until LOTR achieved greatness that this could be released to an audience already demanding more of Hobbits and the Middle Earth.Few but the most die hard fans are aware of the background of how Tolkien created this world. A philologist, (study of language development) Tolkien took the Elven language he had created as a young boy and teenager and determined that no language could truly develop without a corresponding mythology. The two were inseperable in his understanding.The Silmarilian is that Mythology. It is a labor of love and one, while no doubt influenced by the Norse mythology and life long pursuit of Sir Gawain and the Green Dragon, as well as Beowulf, it is more than that. A work of genius by one of the greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century, it demonstrates the love and attention to detail that have set apart the works of Tolkien from all others in the Genre.Buy it, read it and marvel at the creativity and machinations that most readers are introduced to in the narrative greats of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. You'll come to understand why those stories, monumental as they are, are only the tip of the iceberg waiting to be discovered.After you've read the LOTR and Hobbit and other of Tolkien's smaller works, come to this work and when you've read it, you'll read the other again with greater understanding, appreciation and even a sense of awe that were not there the first time. You'll have the pleasure of reading these great books like you read them the first time!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I just finished this book, and I must say it is my favorite of Tolkien's work thus far. That said, this book is not for the beginner. Read The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy before tackling The Silmarillion. This book gives a lot of great background on stories and people mentioned in the above mentioned books and also details the beginning of the world and the First Age. The last two stories (not a part of The Silmarillion, but in the book): &quot;Akallabeth&quot; and &quot;Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age&quot; really bring the entire saga full-circle.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Tolkien's work."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I must've been about 16 when I first picked this book up. I'd read The Hobbit a few times, just finished The Lord of the Rings and added Farmer Giles of Ham and Smith of Wootton Major to my portfolio for good measure. Tolkien had well and truly won me over.Then I launched myself into The Silmarillion, assuming it to be a work not unlike the Rings trilogy, only perhaps with a less formal &quot;adventure&quot;-style storyline. I think I got about 10 pages in before I shook my head with disappointment and confusion, shut the covers and returned it to my school library. It had been nothing like I'd expected, and just trying to remember all the names of the gods and their vassals was difficult enough, let alone trying to wade through an epic narration of the creation of the Earth that somehow reminded me of the more tedious Sunday school lessons I'd yawned through as a kid.So, 14 years on, and having re-read the Lord of the Rings twice more, marvelled at the movie and delved into Humphrey Carpenter's biography of the world's greatest author, I decided that it was time to try and gain a wider understanding of Tolkien's mind. My taste in literature had matured, and I figured what may have been dull as ditchwater to me over a decade ago might have an entirely different effect on me now. I bought a second-hand copy of The Silmarillion and went for it.Having just finished reading it, I am deeply and infuriatingly appalled at myself for having scorned this amazing book as a teenager. My only excuse for having tossed aside this rich tapestry of mind-bending myth in my younger years is that I was bloated on the flippant impatience of youth and just didn't give it enough of a chance.I now repent. The Silmarillion is too grand to be described in a few paragraphs, and there aren't enough superlatives in the English language to bestow upon it. True, the first few pages relating to the music of the Ainur and the creation of the universe may be a tad dry, but these scenes provide the platform for the story that unfolds, and they fit into the greater whole of the story of the First Age beautifully and vitally. By the time you're halfway through this book you'll be lost in a world that only Tolkien could embellish. To say it made everything in The Lord of the Rings so much clearer, and gave every character, location and event so much more depth, is only the most basic legacy it left on me. I now understand the Elven race and their feisty relationship with Men and Dwarves; creatures like the Balrogs and Dragons, mentioned so briefly in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, exist in a wider, richer context; and most of all, I understand why the events in these books took place.Moreover, it's the way this book is written that impressed me so much. Like most Tolkien admirers, I consider his ability to transport the reader into his world using a skilful, unique manipulation of the English language his greatest strength. His descriptive talents and the wordplay between characters is what made The Lord of the Rings so enrapturing for me. But here we have a narration in the true myth style; an epic unfolding in the words of a storyteller, his diction ancient and formal. It's nothing short of brilliant; it vies for accolade with Homer and Herodotus.Don't be put off as I was all those years back. Persevere, and you will find this book incredibly rewarding, empowering and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Most fantasy works can be read by the general populace, especially the genre specific populace and easily enjoyed. This is not true of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is one of those books that gains GREATLY from rereading - this cannot be said enough. At first read it is a confusing selection and notes and names with little real story. Later sections (especially Beren and Luthien but also Turin) have a more connected story, are closer to the Tolkien we have all grown to love.This disjointedness is the Silmarillion's greatest weakness and one of the reasons I cannot give it five stars (although I would rate it that way for myself). The other is that only true Tolkien afficando's are going to enjoy it. Anyone who loves Tolkien will probably love this - they will enjoy an opportunity to see the back history of Middle Earth, to some of the legends and Elder Days mentioned in the Lord of the Rings. Thus for those that have read Tolkien, this will be a great book.My other complaint with this book is that I doubt Tolkien would have ever published it. He spent such effort polishing his work, I do not think he would have published something as disjointed as this. And although I am glad to see it, that also detracts from the pleasure.Anyhow, the Silmarillion is an interesting collection of myths and legends of the Elder Days of Middle Earth - of the War of the Jewels. It is tragic and reminiscent of Norse mythology and great for those interested in the Lord of the Rings. For everyone else though I would say don't bother."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"First off, let me say that if you couldn't read or didn't like the writing style in book 5 of Lord of the Rings, you won't be able to make it through this book. However, once you get past the distant, biblical writing style, you get the greatest prequel-type story I have ever read. The main reason I read this book was that I was extremely interested when reading The Lord of the Rings by Legolas, Aragorn, and the mysterious backgrounds of their races. Unfortunately, I turned first to Unfinished Tales to satisfy my craving for Elven and Numenorean knowledge. I read the book and greatly enjoyed the stories of Tuor and Turin... but without background info or a map of Beleriand I was lost as to where these tales fit in to the history of Middle-Earth. I finally bought the Silmarillion and read it in about a week. While it undoubtedly was in need of some editing by the original author, I am glad that Christopher Tolkien still made this available.Simply put, this is a great book for anyone who has interest in the elves, especially the speakers of the Quenya and Sindarin languages, or for anyone who wants to learn about the mysterious West and the great enemy of old, Morgoth. Most people I have talked to are less interested in the elves than I am. I believe this is because their first introduction to the Firstborn was the conflicting profile presented in the Hobbit- are elves good or not?- while my first sight of an elf was of Glorfindel on the approaches to Elrond in the first book of LotR. This book taught me all I wanted to know about the history of the elves and the first and second ages. I knocked off the star for two main reasons: First, the book told me (I felt) far too little about the Dwarves, Numenoreans, and Hobbits. I realise this is a history mainly of elves, but it wouldn't have hurt to put in more than a passing reference to the Halflings. If you want to know about the men of Westernesse, buy Unfinished Tales. The information on the Dwarves is very interesting, but seems too little and slightly biased against them. Second, the narrative style of this book was a little too high and mighty/biblical for me. The similar names (Haldar, Haldir, Haldad, Haleth, Halmir, Handir, Hador, Hareth, Hathal, Hildor), the multiple names (Thingol is Sindacollo is Singollo is Elwe) and the lack of dialog (except in the notable stories of Luthien, Tuor, and Turin) all make this reading you have to really think about to like. However, this is still by far the best companion story to The Hobbit and LotR out there. If you are new to Middle- Earth and Tolkien, this is the order I would recomend reading the books in: The Hobbit, LotR, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, LotR, The Book of Lost Tales (1&amp;2), The Shaping of Middle Earth, The Lays of Beleriand, LotR. This is great stuff, the best I have read, and I would recomend it all to almost anyone."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien wrote three major works about Middle Earth: The Hobbit, Lord of The Rings, and The Silmarillion, and they were written in three vastly different styles. The Hobbit reads like a children's book, the LOTR reads like a great epic quest written for adults in the old style of Nordic mythology, and the Silmarillion reads like a cross between an ancient semi-biblical history and an elegiac poem.To be honest, I first picked up the Silmarillion after reading and falling in love with the LOTR expecting to find more of the same. It wasn't and isn't, and the first time through the book I felt really bored and disappointed. The style was far different from LOTR, more confusing and dry in places, and the characters I fell in love with from LOTR weren't there. I finished it frustrated, but, after a few months, still yearning for more of Tolkien's world, I decided to give it another chance. With my expectations set differently, I found a completely different book, one that I ended up loving more than LOTR itself.Taken on its own terms as a poetic blend of theology, mythology, and history for Middle Earth, the Silmarillion is a work of astonishing beauty and tragedy unlike any other book you will ever read. The poetry is high-poetry in the best sense, and the history, which can seem dry upon first reading, is as rich and interconnected as any you will find in the ancient histories of our own real world. This book provides everything you will need to create your own, fully 3-D conceptualization of middle earth and the magic that underlies its magic. And the language is often extraordinary and inspired, reaching the level of song-in-prose at many points. If you are the kind of person who is willing to put some work into what you read, I highly recommend The Silmarillion because it rewards your efforts doubly."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien began the Silmarillion in 1917 and never stopped working on it until his death. Edited and compiled by his son, Christopher, it has become the masterwork of his lifetime. The tales contained therein span a &quot;history&quot; of approximately 37,000 years, from the creation of &quot;Arda&quot;, the world, to the ending of the Third Age, when the Dominion of Man begins. The prose is rich, the imagery fantastic, the stories inspiring, uplifting, and heart-rending all at once. I've read the Silmarillion over and over again, and I've never gotten tired of it. The Lord of the Rings, being the personal account of the hobbits, only scratches the surface of Tolkien's great history of Middle-Earth. The Silmarillion fulfills it. The characters in tLotR; Gandalf the wizard, Galadriel the elven queen, Master Elrond, Cirdan the shipwright, Aragorn the ranger, Sauron the Dark Lord, Saruman the White, and even Treebeard the Ent, all come into clearer focus and their re! levance to the entire story become deeper, and gain more import, in the reading of the Silmarillion. You learn what all the fuss in tLotR was really all about. The Ainulindale, the story of the Great Music in which the world was created, is pure, and satisfying mythology in a grand style. Nearly biblical. The tale of the revolt of the Noldorin elves high adventure. The story of mortal Beren and elven princess Luthien's love and quest, pure romance. The tale of Turin Turambar is a twisted tragedy. The story of the downfall of Numenore is Tolkien's allegory to the legend of Atlantis. And &quot;Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age&quot;, the last installment in the book, tells concisely of the immediate background plot of The Lord of the Rings, from the elven standpoint. This book may be a difficult read for those who are used to mundane language, but a persistant reader who already appreciates J.R.R. Tolkien's work will come away from it with a whole new insight to what tha! t work is all about. THIS BOOK IS A MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"And finally, when all is said and done, you close the final page of The Lord of the Rings. You believe that this is as good as it gets, and that you have come a long way. Yes that is partially true.But you never knew how deep and rich the genius of Tolkien really was. You never know why he held back so long on his final work, his magnum opus, which he did not live to see published. Which his son Christopher Tolkien had to publish after his death.This work is Silmarillion.The Silmarillion is biblical is scale and breadth. It is legendary and epic. All the stories and myths of Arda, Middle-Earth, are laid bare before you to see. The incredible bliss and agony, the depths and heights, from end of end, you see just how good it can get.A theme of enduring sorrow and decay runs through the works of Tolkien, and this starts from the Hobbit. I have noted this theme in my earlier reviews.In the Silmarillion you finally come face to face with the purity and innocence of an age lost in time, when the world was new and young and the first born walked upon it, gazing at the stars in wonder.It was an age when demons of the underworld and dragons of fire were as numerous as flies. When mighty battles where fought that broke the earth and mountains, and tossed asunder the very essence of Arda.It was an age where acts of heroism and valour occured that sowed legends. Acts that inspired legions of heroes for ages to come.Though that age is forever lost, the spirit of that age remains. It endures and comforts. You see that spirit in The Lord of the Rings.I think some folks will agree reading this work can bring a sweat to your brow. It is not light bedtime material. The density of the writing is like trying to eat blocks of granite, however if you are strong and well entrenched in simpler Tolkien works prior to this, you will make it.And when you finish the Silmarillion, you will get a sense of satisfaction and completeness. Only then will you truely have made the complete journey that began with the Hobbit. Only then will you grasp the COMPLETE essence of the imaginative genius of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Firstly, I don't believe that anyone who has read \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" as one book, or as a multi volume experience, will suggest the read was anything short of incredible. The world and the fantasy created by J.R.R. Tolkien were unprecedented, without peer, and elements are adapted into many contemporary fantasy epics. Happily, pieces are integrated more as a tribute rather than plagiarism. Another well-known saga created by George Lucas contains bits that clearly are made as an acknowledgement of Mr. Tolkien, who created the most original world of fantasy.I was surprised when reading some thoughts of other readers, this is a much different read than what Tolkien fans are accustomed too, but it is not a measure of a reader's intellect, or whether they appreciate the intricate nature of the book. The book is brilliant, very different, and since Christopher Tolkien spends several pages explaining why this was a nearly impossible book to piece together, you are in the best of company if you find the read difficult. The book is not an I.Q. test, nor does it require some sort of Tolkien connoisseur for the book to be appreciated, statements like these are simply presumptuous, arrogant examples of nonsense.This is a great book and I would hate to see anyone pass it up. Christopher Tolkien states, \\"As the years passed the changes and variants both in detail and in larger perspectives, became so complex, and so many layered that a final and definitive version seemed unattainable.\\" He also states that absolute consistency with the other books is impossible, the book is at times vague, lacks cohesion, etc.This was an evolving work of half a century that never was brought before the public until after the writer's death. It was a work in progress for 50 years of the writer's life, and he never stopped changing it.And the entire pretense about the book's complexity or the need for an exclusive audience is nonsense. If you like reading Tolkien, this is different, but you will enjoy it. Christopher Tolkien provides a great deal of background material, and multiple indices so the reader can follow the players. In a way, the fact it takes more time to read is a blessing, as there are no new books that are going to be written.Mr. Tolkien was a great friend of Mr. C.S. Lewis, the Author of dozens of books, from theological \\"Mere Christianity\\", to children's books \\"The Chronicles Of Narnia\\", and his own Science Fiction Trilogy \\"Out Of The Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That Hideous Strength.\\"This book like Lewis's \\"Space Trilogy\\" can be very complex. In their respective works both men were writing about theological and philosophical preoccupations, as well as fantasy, mythology, and legends. Parts of \\"Silmarillion\\" actually began as poetry.The \\"Third Age\\" of Tolkien's world with Gandalf and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, are familiar friends to readers everywhere. This book is a great addition to \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" but it takes place in the \\"First Age\\", so you deal with some of the references made in the former as events that are \\"contemporary\\" and not historical. Think Phantom Menace versus A New Hope.There is still a great deal of unpublished work about the first through the third ages, and perhaps someday all will be available to be read sequentially.Unless and until the complete story is shared, enjoy this book. There are 3 movies being made of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\". While I hope they do justice to the writings, I would hope a person's first exposure to this man's work is through his books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I will start by saying that it took me a while to read all of The Silmarillion. Of course part of that is that I was reading it when I was too young. That being said I think that it is a wonderful book. However, because of the way it was written and later edited, it is not a book for casual Tolkien fans.The stories in the Silmarillion predate the Hobbit by millennia and are like other mythological stories; they add a depth to Middle-Earth, but are rather dry in their telling. Tolkien worked on the Silmarillion off and on from its inception around the time of the First World War to his death. From what I read he never imagined it to be published, yet I think Christopher Tolkien did an admirable job in piecing together his father's notes to show just how much detail, just how rich his father thought Middle-Earth was.And all of this, from Tolkien's essays on Sir Gawain and the Green Night to the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings to the Silmarillion all show his love for Language. He created his Middle-EArth to show how Language grows with the telling of stories; good and bad, dry and dynamic. We have what we have and it all must be taken as a whole, not as individual pieces.Looking at it that way one can truly see the genius of John Ronald Ruel Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Yes, this book is hard to read. Anything is hard to read when your eyes are red and puffy and flowing with tears. Early in his life, JRR Tolkien delved out of his mind and experience a literary jewel of unsurpassed brilliance. He faceted and polished it with genius for the rest of his long life. The Silmarillion has the scope and substance of the Old Testament, combined with the glory and tragedy of the Illiad, the Odyssey and the works of the Bard.Neither Feanor, nor Dante, nor the inspirited recounters of our own Story ever created something more beautiful or enduring. And yet, this epic tale of the history of a World, and of its many peoples, is told in language so spare that not a single word could be excised without grievous harm.O! to have heard the Music. O! to have gazed upon the Light of the Trees. O! to have seen the Silmarils. O! to have been in the company of Fingolfin when he contested the might of debased Morgoth. O! to have witnessed the beauty and constancy in love of Luthien.My heart breaks for something that never was."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien's better known works, don't be fooled that Silmarillion will take you on another epic adventure... it is not a novel, but more a collection of interconnected short stories, that together tell a larger story. The stories are reminiscent of Greek Myths, or Shakespearean Tragedies. The book intends to tell the story of the Silmarils, which are magical jewels. More specifically, once the jewels are stolen by Melkor, who is basically the Devil, the book follows the consequences of an evil oath of the jewels creator, an Elf named Feanor, and his sons, to get them back at any cost (and remember, Elf's have LONG lives, and the stories span many thousands of years and this oath results in wars, murders and many betrayals).The book starts with the creation of the world, the elves, man, dwarves, orcs... all of middle-earth. It answers many of the questions you are left with after The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. It explains where Elves go when they go West out of Middle-Earth, for instance, and where Sauron comes from and what he is. The stories are incredible - again, a mix of Shakespeare and Greek mythology. One of the stories tells of a man who wants to mary an elf - Beren, the man, is taken to the King, who is Luthien, the Elf's, father. The King says Beren can only marry his daughter if Beren brings back a Silmaril from Melkor's (the Devil) crown. Thinking he has sent Beren to his death in this hopeless quest, and has put an end to the issue, the King finds that his daughter has gone on the quest as well. The story doesn't end as you might think, but treats you to a wonderfully surprising adventure, wrought with bravery, battle and honor.There are points in this book that are so poignant and powerful -the \\"wow\\" factor certainly applies. The book is not a novel, but at the end, when you really look at how the stories have been intertwined, and how the characters are inter-related, you will really be impressed with the imagination and planning that went into not only this book, but all of Tolkien's stories."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"david young in one of these reviews said that you should be reading this before you read lotr well that wouldnt be a good idea because this gives away the ending"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As a huge Tolkien fan myself, I found this book to live up to its full praise as a work of art. The Silmarillion was not only beautifully written, but very informitive as well. It discusses everything from the creating of the Earth, the many evils and battles that led to the downfall of its people, to the Numenoreans, and all the way to the forging of the rings of power. This book answers all questions or confusions left after the Lord of the Rings series, and is a must read for all Tolkien lovers!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book cannot be judged by conventional means. The amazing command of language Tolkien uses, and the intricate plot he has created is ... extremely, extremely ... I don't know. All I know is, if you can read and know what is best for you, read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"To enjoy this book you need to REALLY want to know more of the history of middle-earth. Superbly written, and vivid description, but there is too much to take in in 300 pages. At times it is boring, at others exciting, but quite interesting all the way through. Reommended if you want to learn more about Tolkien's world, but otherwise, I think you should stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a compilation of JRR's notes, with some fleshing out done by his son Christopher. If you want to understand the history and mythology of LotR, you should read this. But don't expect the same consistency of quality. Some of the chapters are superb, others are truly boring. Also, since this is a collection of notes made over a long period of time, don't expect it to be entirely consistent with itself or with LotR. Then again, neither is the Bible."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"So you've read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and you just can't get enough of the Middle Earth and you are ready for more? Well hold tight to your Elvish sword and cloak - this one will make you wonder just where you are and what you are doing here and how do you get out fast. This history of the first age of the Middle Earth is more the companion novel to &quot;War and Peace&quot; than to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. It is tough reading in half poetic prose told in the manner of verbal tales of Elvish lore and myth (What's that - you aren't familiar with the style of Elvish myth? Neither was anyone until this was published - unless they read &quot;The Lost Tales&quot; which this is based on) and the characters change names as often as characters in Russian novels, so you need a notepad to keep up with the action - and speaking of action, expect to get it in small amounts between long passages of descriptive landscape or genelogy narritive - and figure out just who is annoying and/or killing who. However, if you put up with it and hang in there, the entire background of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the ring trilogy will make a good deal more sense and you will come away feeling a closer bond to the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Let me say off the top that getting through the Silmarillion is very worthwhile. It provides a great deal of background and context for what happens in 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings', which alone is worth the effort. And after all, it's by J.R.R. Tolkien. :)Make no mistake, it _is_ an effort. I found the book to be almost impenetrable, so I bought a set of the audio tapes which was easier but still required dedication to get through.Don't even try to keep track of the endless stream of interlocking geographical and geneological references, unless you're really into that kind of thing. It will break your brain and ultimately prove not that important as long as you can keep up with the general flow of events.My biggest complaint is that the audio version could have been a great deal better. The theme \\"music\\" at various points sounded cheap, tinny and overblown. There's just no excuse for such poor sound in this day and age, especially for such a hallowed work.The narrator was no more than competent. He spoke clearly and with something of an English accent, but his voice was flat and without inflection with no hint of skill in characterization at all. To put it bluntly, he sounded like he would have been more at home reading corporate stock reports than epic fiction. I hate to be a Simon Cowell about it but there it is.But if you're a true Tolkien fan, you really need to do the Silmarillion in whatever version you can manage. It answers too many questions to be overlooked if you really want to know things like why the Elves were abandoning Middle Earth with such finality during the LOTR days and how Sauron got to be the power he was before the end.Just be prepared to put your backs into it and don't give up until it's done. You'll feel good about yourself for having gotten through it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is interesting if you really enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, and you want to learn about Tolkien's meticulous development of the backstory. It would also be helpful to anyone who is engaged in a roleplaying game based on Middle Earth. Overall, most people will enjoy Unfinished Tales more than this book--because it is a lot lighter and more story-oriented.However, do not be deceived: this is no novel. It is told in a historical-narrative format, and is extremely dense. Even if you loved Lord of the Rings, it is unlikely that you will enjoy it. This is essentially exposition, not storytelling.In time, when Tolkien receives the literary recognition he is truly entitled to, I envision high school students reading excerpts of the Silmarillion as part of learning about the process of worldbuilding that went into twentieth-century fantasy literature. Unfortunately, they will find this task boring--hopefully they will enjoy Lord of the Rings anyway.If you are a Tolkien fanatic and you really want to see this process in action--if you want to understand what happened in the thousands of years prior to the Hobbit, and want to know the lineage of all the main characters--this book will be for you. However, I'd advise reading Unfinished Tales first. This deals with a lot of the same material in a more readable format."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is huge and complicated. it's a hard read but it helps when you can type in keywords and search for themes and motifs.

If you haven't read any fantasy, this book is a good starting point. A vast telling of the characters and stories within the universe of Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

You can read parts or all at once. This edition is beautifully illustrated and a great addition to any library. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a compilation of Tolkien's mythology of Middle-Earth. Tolkien had worked on this mythology for much of his life, long before he even considered writing the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Many readers get turned off from the Silmarillion because of Tolkien's archaic style and the sheer number of names. My advice is not to worry about all of the names the first time you read through. Just try to remember a few of the main characters. There is a helpful appendix in the back of the book with the names of all of the characters and places. Moreover, Prof. Corey Olsen has a podcast on iTunes that explains the Silmarillion, which is worth listening to if you really want to appreciate the book.But make no mistake - the effort you put in will pay off. First, it will it enhance your understanding of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy, as the Silmarillion stories form the history for those novels. The Silmarillion goes from the creation of the universe right up to the war of the rings. In the First Age of the world, Men and Elves battle an evil lord that make Sauron look like a clown. Some of the stories, such as the defection of Feanor and the Noldor Elves, are stunning in their emotional power. It's some of the most gripping fantasy fiction ever. My one regret is that Tolkien didn't live long enough to publish this work himself."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm not a fan of fantasy literature by any means... mainly because Tolkien's was the first I ever read and everything else has fallen completely flat in comparison!I can't really claim that this is the book that made me a dork, but I certainly have it to thank for showing me what a wonderful place dorkdom is and why I'll never want to leave it! I did read the Lord of the Rings prior to reading this book -- my uncle bought me the three-book volume (just in time for those glorious years of middle school) and I demolished that sucker right before the Fellowship hit theaters. Then the very next Christmas, my 70 year old great aunt (who knew nothing about fantasy fiction or preteens, bless her heart) bought me The Silmarillion. Seriously the best Christmas present I've ever received. I like LotR well enough, but I've only re-read it once. Yeah, The Silmarillion? I have read it AT LEAST seven times in its entirety, not to mention the number of times I've gone back to hit the chapters with the highlight stories. It's that wonderful to me.These stories are the kind that turn out precisely the way you most hope or most fear, even if you don't realize it until after you've finished reading. Tolkien knows your wishes before you do; he just really understands the human condition (or elvish, as the case may be...) Some people complain about the masses of characters, places, names, and years covered in this book, but hello, how could you have it any other way? The epic scope of The Silmarillion is what makes it EPIC! You know what, it makes me sound like I have Asperger's or something but I will admit it: I LOVED memorizing these innumerable details when I was a kid! The Middle Earth of the LotR was exciting, but it took the depth and huge scale of the Silmarillion to truly awaken my imagination. Yes, I credit this book literally with giving me my imagination, and therefore making me who I am today.I've tried unsuccessfully to get my friends and relatives to read this for years, but whether it's because of the nerd stigma or the mass of characters, they aren't ever willing to commit to it. So I'm moving on to Amazon users now: READ THIS BOOK.And if you can't read it for yourself, at least give it to your socially awkward misfit niece. It may mean the world to her."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you're going to read THE SILMARILLION, this is the only copy worth getting.Years ago I had tried reading a paperback copy of THE SILMARILLION, but it was in vain, for the sheer size and scope of the story was depressingly daunting.In my opinion, this edition makes the plot of the SILMARILLION much more interesting and readable by being bound between the covers of a book with excellent quality.PRODUCTION PROS:--Textbook quality hardback, as are the pages.--The book can be opened flat without feeling like it is going to fall apart on you.--Excellent color illustrations by Ted Nasmith that completely capture the essence of many scenes. My personal favorite being the one of Luthien dancing in the moonlit forest.--Large map of Beleriand included at the back of the book.--The text is not too small, thank goodness.--Tables and index are immensely helpful in understanding who's who.PRODUCTION CONS:--Sometimes the index is TOO informative, unintentionally revealing spoilers by telling the fate of certain characters.PLOT PROS:--Chronologically covers the history of Arda, from the Creation all the way to the defeat of Sauron (end of the Lord of the Rings).--Seeing the \\"big picture\\" and learning of the origins of many things later mentioned in the LORD OF THE RINGS is extremely fun, educational and rewarding.--Some excellent words and names that just roll off your tongue or sound awesome: Gabilgathol, Radhruin, Luthien Tinuviel, Eldalie, et al.PLOT CONS:--Since this book is mostly backstory and synopsis, after about 200 pages the text may come across as dry and repetitive.--The sheer number of names and special words can be hard to keep track of, which in turn may make the story hard to follow.OVERALL, despite a few flaws, this edition is clearly the only one worth reading and in spite of the backstory nature of the stories, greatly adds to one's enjoyment and understanding of THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of loose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those beings that lived there.

I will finish it eventually. It is a nice addition to my collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I purchased the paperback because they were out of hardcovers. The hardcover appears to have pictures. I have not yet read the Hobbit or the LORs. I intend to read them as well. I do own the extended DVD version of the LOR. I was told by many who have read the Hobbit and the LOR to NOT waste my time or rack my brain trying to read the Silmarillion. I tend to agree with them: however, for different reasons. Let me start by saying that this piece of literary work is simply a JRR Tolkien Masterpiece. It is clearly a mind expanding experience to read this book. But why would I not read it if I could go back in time before I made the choice to read it? The reason is that JRR Tolkien starts out painting such beautiful planes of existence of unbridled bliss! Places that the reader can go to! Places created by the Valar, the Maiar and later the Elves. Then at the noon tide, Melkor, a Vala later called Morgoth chooses to destroy it all? The majority of this book is devoted to this downward spiral into unrecoverable darkness. I actually experienced a sense of depression while enduring the absolute hopelessness of it all. With the coming of men celebrating and actually championing ignorance and darkness, it becomes a marathon Shakespearian tragedy. So to sum up it up, while I didn't mind the fact that JRR Tolkien will change the name of a person, place or thing as many as a dozen times and then choose to randomly refer to the one of dozen names during the reading experience since I love to decode, I did not care for the painful downward spiral into the pits of darkness that go deeper than Hell itself.Given that; I now understand the LOR movies. Watching the movies are a blast but it is hard to follow them. For instance I could never understand how Sauron came into existence. Now I know he was a Maia that specialized in Smithing. In the first age Sauron was lured by Melkor, a Vala, to serve him. When Melkor was rechained by the Valar and sent to the void, Sauron was left as the highest ranking dark lord. Since Sauron was a Maia that was gifted in Smithing, he created and enchanted the Ring to rule them all. For me this is the true gift of information from this book.Of greater interest is the Second Age, where Middle Earth was ruled by the Numenoreans. Again the same cycle of tragedy. The Valar create the Garden of Eden called Numenor for men located east of Valinor. Then after twenty some Kings, the Numenoreans decide to worship Sauron!!!!? What? The Numenoreons wage war on Valinor and say good bye to paradise. This becomes the JRR Tolkien version of Atlantis.Like I said at the beginning, this is a book of unbridled contrast of good vs evil or duality with evil being the greater of the polarities. Evil is ignorance. In this book evil becomes the predictable wrong choice of Elves and men."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a great book and a must for any Tolkien fan. It provides a lot of background for the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the whole Middle Earth mythology in general. It's a tough read, especially for those expecting an adventure novel, since it's more like a history book than anything else. I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in Tolkien's works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"My husband and I all are both Tolkien fans but neither of us had managed to really get into the Silmarillon. The book's length and somewhat stiff narrative slowed us up or put us off. Finally we heard that the audio book version was good and thought we'd give it a try.While the beginning \\"creation myth\\" may still be a bit slow for some people the audio book version overcame many of the book's obstacles. The reader has a clear, sonorous, English-accented voice which is a perfect match with the tone of the story. His commanding narration bought to life the tragic tale and completely engrossed us in the story in a way that the book failed to do."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book more or less compresses hundreds of years of history into twenty-four chapters, but that description hardly does it justice. The prose is polished to the point of shimmering and the tales are complex and beautiful. The Silmarillion clears up a lot of mysteries hinted at in the Lord of the Rings as well. It's not an average novel in style or content, but something more.

I have to say that the Silmarillion is not only better, but also a must read for any fan. One of the best books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read LOTR and found it to be a masterpiece of fiction. It contained all the things that I thought were necessary for an epic. What genius to creat this trilogy It is comparable to Homer inventing all of greek mythology and then writing the Illiad. No book has yet to capture My attention in such a way that I could read this book over and over again. It is difficult reading but It is well worth it. I hope for future readers it will be too. My favorite part (of which there were many), was when Eowyn the princess of Rohan slews The Lord Of the Nazgul with the help of Meriadoc the Hobbit. To me this part created such a mixture of emotions. The Silmarillion also lives up to the standards of LOTR. If anything it has a more magical fictious feeling than LOTR but that just adds to its to overwhelming descriptive and imaginitive compulation. I hope as well that most people who read this book like it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I gave this book to my brother, a great Tolkien fan, for Christmas when it was first published and he didn't like it. So I didn't read it until 10 years later when a friend told me it was great. I agree, it is great, but it will not appeal to every Tolkien fan.It is a pre-history, which includes the creation myth and the development of the &quot;gods/goddesses&quot; who inhabited the universe and middle earth before man and the elves came, as well as the story of the elves and also a little prehistory of men. The trilogy is primarily about men and this book is primarily about elves.The early parts of the book will interest those who like mythology. The later chapters are the pre-history and folk tales which are often mentioned as historical/legendary events or figures in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The trilogy does not delve into that history, it merely piques our interest in the legendary characters which are mentioned. The Silmarillion gives us the stories of these legendary battles and characters.I reread the Silmarillion last year and truly enjoyed it. Particularly the story of Beren and Luthien. The history of the two trees is also especially lovely.If you like fairy tales and folk stories. There's a lot of material here for you.The style of writing is often different from the trilogy. But I find it altogether enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This has to be among the best books I've ever read. It's difficult reading, as it reads more like the Bible than LotR, but in the end it's much more satisfying for it. To call this book an epic is an understatement. I recommend it to all who can read it without rushing it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is one book that Tolkien's son should just have left in the desk drawers or shoeboxes he found it in. The concept and base information behind the book is good, as it provides an almost bible like account of the creation of the world in which middle-earth is located, how the elves and dwarves and men were created as well as the ancient powers that play out in the Lord of the Rings. You find out where and when Balrogs came form, about Sauron, Galadriel, etc. in the early days.However, the writing is absolute crap. Period. I cannot understand how anyone could think that this bound together collection of pages is worth reading.The problem is this - Tolkien went on a power-trip playing around with his invented languages and the mority of the book ,be it read or even listened to on CD (which should be a bit nicer) , is the reader getting bombarded with 5 names for the same thing and thing after thing being named with proper names, from every person, rock, forest, hill, continent, wind, weather, etc. Its insane, stupid, and not at all entertaining. Do we really need to know the 3 names that some forest was called by 3 races of creatures? Try to figure out if he thing he just mentioned was the name of a continent, super-being, elf, forest, hill, season, etc. Good luck.I love The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but this thing is crud. The material, I'm told, is available in much better books. Forget about The Silmarillion - its junk."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After reading Tolkien's books The Hobbit and Lord Of The Rings, I felt I had to read the other ones-they were so great. When I first started to read the book, I was thoroughly disappointed. It was boring and slow, and the opening was terrible- I never even bothered to read it all. After Tolkien's first books, this was a thorough dissapointment."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The true genius of JRR Tolkien's work becomes evident in the epic collection, \\"The Silmarillion\\". The sheer scale and grandeur of vision of this creation is truly mind-boggling and yet it is as engaging and exciting as anything I have ever read. Beginning with the creation of the the world, to its historical and geographic shaping and eventual fate, leading up to the time of \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" it tells the story of the legendary and heroic actions of Gods, Elves and Men in their epic battle against the forces of evil and darkness. \\"The Silmarillion\\" weaves an intricate web of history and legend that forms the mythic backdrop for all of his works and fantasies. And yet the telling of this incredibly complex plot and the setting up of this intricate framework of legends is achieved in a literary fashion that awakens and engages facets of one's imagination that one did not not even know to exist before the reading of it. Between the unparalleled literary and creative genius of JRR Tolkien and the succinct and lucid editing work done by his son, Christopher Tolkien, the world of fantasy, and indeed literature as a whole, has been bequeathed a jewel that would have compared favorably with the legendary Silmarils of the Noldor Elves."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This great book fills in much of the history of Middle Earth.

But if you are one of those people who need to know the backrouond and history of that world, The Silmarillion is more than worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love it, though there are so many names for persons places and events that they are hard to keep ordered in the mind. Tolkien's imagination of how his universe Ea and its creator Eru/Illuvatar brought about creation is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Any love of Lord of the Rings will be equally delighted by this masterpiece. It is a tough read, but worth sticking out."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a masterful book, but not one for the faint of heart. Tolkien of course needs no real introduction, not after the blockbuster film trilogy that was The Lord Of The Rings. Here we have what he would likely consider his masterwork, edited, compiled and published after his death by his son Christopher.As I said above, this is not for the faint of heart. If you liked the Lord Of The Rings movies and want to delve into the world of Tolkien, this is not the place to start. First read The Hobbit, then the actual Lord Of The Rings novels. I promise you, there's more than enough there to hold your interest even if you know the films by heart. If you finish up there and still want more, then you would do well to read The Silmarillion. I've seen other reviewers on here refer to it as Tolkien's \\"Old Testament,\\" and that's an apt description. This is the founding and breaking of Arda or Middle Earth, from its genesis to the defeat of the Dark Lord Morgoth, followed by a couple short essays bridging the end of the Quenta Silmarillia and the events of the Lord of the Rings.This is a very good book, but be advised: its not a unified narrative, not a novel as were The Hobbit or The Lord Of The Rings. The Silmarillion is a collection of the myths of Middle Earth's First Age. As such, the language is high and more suited to a reading of Homer or The Volsung Saga (which are themselves sources that Tolkien drew inspiration from) than it is a contemporary novel. This is not a bad thing, but you need to have the proper expectations going in or your experience will be tainted."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Purchases always arrive on or before time and as advertised, notifications are always accurate and polite. I will be returning."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a book that holds your attention and you have to pay attention to what is going on or you can get lost. I have not finished it yet, but I love it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are no Hobbits in J. R. R. Tolkien's Silmarilion. This may appear to be a trivial observation but it is an observation worth considering when reading Tolkien's works. Tolkien, it seems, wrote in two styles. He had a \\"low\\" style that he used in The Hobbit. This was a familiar, wryly humorous style, perhaps too deliberately written for children in places to be entirely successful as a children's story. The other style is a grand, epic style, more suited for the affairs of kings, elves and great battles. The Lord of the Rings was a mixture of these two styles. It began in much the same style as The Hobbit, but as the story became more serious and the danger of the Ring and its pursuers more acute, the style became darker and more serious to match. By The Return of the King, with its tale of the great War of the Ring, the style became almost entirely, but not quite, the grand style. There were always the hobbits to return the story to a more down to earth level.The Silmarilion is written entirely in the grand style. The stories are epic tales of gods, elves and men fighting against the first, and far mightier, dark lord Morgoth. There is little room for the sort of humble details of everyday life found in The Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings. The characters are all kings and heroes of ancient times, not humble gardeners. This is not to say that The Silmarilion is not a good book to read. It is an excellent book, and Tolkien is, in his way, comparable to the great composers of national epics like Homer or Vergil. That was indeed his intention when he began writing these stories of the Elder Days and to some extent he did succeed.There are actually five parts to the Silmarilion. The first part is called the Ainulindale and tells of the creation of the world by Eru, the One, who the Elves call Illuvatar. Illuvatar first creates the angelic powers or Ainur, and teaches them to sing to a melody He has made. This song was a vision of the world and many of the Ainur longed to dwell in that world so Illuvatar created it and sent the Ainur, or Valar to complete the work of creating and ordering the world. This they did against the opposition of Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar, and one who sought to rule the world for himself.The next section is called the Valaquenta, is simply a list of the chiefs of the Valar and their names, and attributes. There is not a narrative here, but it is useful to read it as a guide for laterThe middle and longest section is the Quenta Silmarilion, or the Silmarion proper. This is the epic story of the Elves in the First Age of Middle Earth. The Silmarilion tells of the awakening of the Elves in the dark times when Melkor ruled Middle Earth. The Valar go to war against Melkor to save the Elves and he is defeated and imprisoned. TheValar then offer to take the Elves to their home, Valinor, far in the West. Many Elves agree to make the long journey and are named the Eldar. Many others prefer to stay in Middle East and call themselves the Avari.The Eldar travel to Valinor and become mighty in lore and power. The most skilled of all the Elves is Feanor and his greatest work is the three jewels, the Silmarils in which he captured the light of the Two Trees of old. After a time Melkor feigns repentance and is released. He poisons the Two Trees, steals the Silmarils and flees to his stronghold in Middle Earth. Against the will of the Valar, Feanor leads his clan, the Noldor in pursuit of Melkor, who he has renamed Morgoth, the Black Enemy. Feanor is slain but the Noldor and their allies among Elves and the new race of Men continue the war. They fight bravely against Morgoth and managed to confine him to his stronghold for many years, but in the end, their war is hopeless. Morgoth has hosts of Orcs, troll, Balrogs and dragons and is himself a Valar, one of the mightiest beings in the world. The Elves and their allies are utterly defeated only the intervention of the Valar prevents Morgoth from ruling forever. Morgoth is defeated and the Silmarils are lost. Much of Middle Earth is damaged beyond repair and the Western lands where the Noldor fought and died is submerged beneath the sea.The Akallabeth tells of the history of Numenor, the island that the Valar gave to the Men who fought on the side of the Elves. (Most Men sided with Morgoth). The Numenoreans were given a life span beyond any of the Men of Middle Earth though they were not immortal and could not travel to Valinor. Over time, the Numenoreans grew increasingly jealous of the immortality of the Elves and since they could not make themselves immortal, they began to seek for wealth and dominion in Middle Earth. The last king of Numenor, Ar-Pharazon challenged Sauron, the servant of Morgoth, for the rule of Middle Earth, actually defeated him, and carried him back to Numenor as a hostage. Sauron quickly gained the confidence of Ar-Pharazon, and preying on the old king's fear of death, induced him to assault the Valar and wrest immortality from them. This ended with the destruction of Numenor and the Numenoreans with the exception of a few refugees led by Elendil.The final part of the Silmarilion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, relates the history of the dealings of Sauron and the Elves of Middle Earth. Sauron deceived the Elves into creating the rings of power and attempted to enslave them by forging his own One Ring in Mordor. There is a brief summary of the history told in the Lord of the Rings and a brief mention of the destruction of the ring by Frodo the Halfling and his servant Samwise. After this, the last remaining Eldar of Middle Earth, rendered powerless, leave for Valinor and the cycle is finished.This is a rather grim cycle of tales, probably inspired by Tolkien's love of the rather grim Nordic mythology. Unlike the Norse tales, evil is defeated in the end, but the damage done can never wholly be undone. Then evil arises again after an age. Oftentimes evil corrupts or misleads the good and sometimes the most damage is done by those who fight most valiantly against evil. Beren and Luthien wrest a Silmaril from Morgoth so that Beren can present it to Luthien's father as bride price, but the Silmaril causes wars among Elves and Dwarves and the sons of Feanor and eventually causes the destruction of all the Elf-kingdoms. Turin son of Hurin spends his whole life fighting the servants of Morgoth, and is cursed because in the end all his valiant deeds only bring about Morgoth's victory. Even when Morgoth is defeated, the evil he does lives on to afflict later ages, as does his servant Sauron.When Sauron is, in his turn defeated, and his Ring is destroyed, the Eldar also rendered powerless, no longer wish to live in Middle Earth and return at last to Valinor leaving a colder, grayer world for those of us who are doomed to stay behind."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I would suggest this book to any Tolkien fan who hasn't yet read it. Especially for those that want to gain a greater understanding in this expansive world. There are so many questions I had after reading the trilogy, and I found many of those answers in this book. I don't believe this a story for everyone to take on. It has more characters and locations then any normal reader can remember, but with the added feature of the short notable character/location synopsis made it doable. I would also suggest to not take any extended breaks from this book (ie. days or weeks). If you do it's really hard to remember what's going on."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The best way I would describe this book is like &#34;the Bible&#34; of Middle Earth. In it are a collection of stories of Middle Earth, its creation and the creation and history of its inhabitants, both good an evil, right up to the Fourth Age... and beyond.If you have read The Hobbit, and/or The Lord of the Rings, you may have many unanswered questions. Were did elves come from? Why are they &#34;magical&#34; what are the Eldar, the Valar, the Numinorians? Where did Sauron come from? How did the One Ring come about and how did it control then others? What is the history of Gondor, Rohan, Lorien, Imladris (Rivendale)? Who/what is Gandalf, and where did he come from? What were the Silmarils?If you read and love the Hobbit/LOtR and ever wondered or asked yourself these questions and others. You will find them here in the Silmarillion, and more. Some say this book is hard to follow... I can't even begin to understand what they are talking about. Are we reading the same book?As I mentioned, It isn't one particular story from Start to finish. It is a collection of stories and tales of thecreatures, cultures and histories of the land and time. Much of it is told in &#34;Old English&#34; style, but that adds to thehistorical feel and sophistication of the stories and characters. Some of the stories are very full and detailed in classic Tolkien style, and some are more general and less developed. Christopher (JRR's son) has done an incredible job of putting all the notes, stories, narratives, and even jottings together to create what I would call the Bible of Middle Earth. Not only because it contains the creation and histories of Middle Earth, but it fikjnd it similar in the way it contains many small stories, tales, and legends that go together In that time and place.I find after reading this, I have a greater love and understanding of the &#34;mainstream&#34; books. It has given me a greater appreciation for all of Tolkien's works and is wonderful imagination and storytelling.I recommended this book to anyone who has read the classic tales and wants to know more about the lands, its history and creatures we know and love ( or perhaps hate in the case of Morgoth and Sauron )."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have to start saying it is a dense book, can give you headaches specially at the beginning but definitely one of the best stories if you want to understand the middle hearth.

I enjoyed the depth and back story, but certain parts were a little slow when it was talking about who was born to who and so on."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For those who enjoyed the rich tapestry of Middle Earth in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion provides a deeper history. The storyline does not provide the close association to the characters that readers will get from reading the other books, but it does provide the background and rich history of the Earth of Tolkien's world. I initially read this book in the seventies, and found it to be a difficult read, probably because it tended to be a little drier than The Hobbit and LOTR. I have re-read it a few times, with greater understanding, and recently read/recorded it for my grandson, at his request.While I believe that it is an excellent resource, and an interesting read, I rated it four stars because it can be a bit difficult to read and absorb. It contains a great deal of information, and can be better understood if the reader makes a separate listing of characters to refer to while reading. This may be a bit too tedious for those who are not interested in the deeper histories of Tolkien's primordial beings, the elves, of dwarves, and men. But for those with a thirst for more of Tolkien's magic, it is a trip worth taking."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is definitely worth the read for any Tolkien fan, it gives the back story to the elves, dwarves, the rings and how it all came to be."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read the Hobbit as a child, and the LOTR as an adult, but never got around to tackling the Silmarillion. I say &#34;tackle&#34; because Tolkien's prose or writing style was a little difficult for me to follow. Eventually however, I got into the rhythm and adored all the richness of the entire evolution of his middle earth universe. Interestingly enough, now I am re-reading LOTR with a renewed perspective and understanding of the arcane references to middle-earth history throughout the tales. Also, since the volumes have been edited and rereleased, I think I shall go back and read the latest edition of The Hobbit.I highly recommend &#34;tackling&#34; this important volume!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the single greatest mythological book since the greeks wrote their mythologies. It is as if A re-amigining of an utterly heathen literary tale from a christian writer which tolkien was. The only desciption I can give of tolkien was he studied wholly heathen works as a Professor of Linguistics, and tried to put them in a christian mold, or rework them as had the writer of beowulf. He was always perplexed as to why he, a christian was drawn to these stories. But a good heroic tale seems to be his aim. A hearkening back to the time of his nordic and english ancestors before the norman conquest, and christianization."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"No one can call themselves a Tolkien fan unless they have read The Silmarillion. If you have only read the Hobbit and LotR, you have only savored a taste of Tolkien's genius. I have also read Unfinished Tales and HoME 1-5 (which all Middle-Earth lovers should also read!) plus many more of The Prince of Fantasy's magnificent works, but the Silmarillion is still my favorite work by Tolkien. In fact, The Silmarillion is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE !!!! It is Tolkien's unfinished masterpiece which has been skilfully and artfully compiled by his son, Christopher.Tolkien has the power to draw readers irresistibly to his work and hold staunchly their undying and unswerving loyalty. Like any other mortal (or immortal), I am not immune to this magnetism. Indeed, any intelligent, sophisticated and creative lover of art and literature will find him/herself completely enraptured with this novel. Only those seeking superficial, meaningless violence or possesing short attention spans will not appreciate the subtle and inconcievably complex style for which Tolkien has become renowned.I read all the previous reviews of this book before I wrote mine... Now, I consider myself an extremely open-minded person; but anyone giving this book less than 5 stars is really pushing the right to freedom of speech!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am going to preface the following by admitting that I have not read more than about 8 pages of this book. I am neither stupid nor uneducated, but this book was simply too much for me. I'm only giving it 2 stars just in case I'm totally missing something here. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings it doesn't mean you'll enjoy this. It is a _very difficult and confusing_ read. I have spoken to 3 other people who attempted this book. My father was one of them and he reads all the time including old english poetry and he found that this book was just not worth the mental effort. You have but to read one page and you'll see what I'm talking about. Two adult friends of mine have failed reading this book as well. Obviously SOME people here enjoy it, but I'm guessing that we don't hear from those who couldn't be bothered to finish it - and I would feel absolutely confident in saying that this is the majority of those who try. Perhaps the book gets easier but my father made the greatest headway completing 100 pages of it and he never got into it. If you are looking for a comfortable read sitting by the fire with some wine look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"When I read the Hobbit as a boy I had to reread it again and again I even tried to read it to other people and to this day I am urging my children and nieces and nephews and any friends who havent read it to open up the covers and let the magic out. BUT... I can't recommend the Silmarillion, I hve tried to read it many times and rarely do I get past page 200. It reads like the Bible. I am not saying the Bible is a bad thing but it is not an exciting and dynamic read. A fictional Novel should be. It should involve dialogue rather than a recounting of actions of one person or deity and then jump days, years, or centuries ahead to recount others. I love tolkien but I think I will stick to the Lord of The Rings"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Ok this book is different than the Hobbit and LOTR as much as apples are to chopped liver in the way they are wriiten. Very heady and lots of information. Although a tougher read especially in the beginning, the book starts making more and more \\"sense\\" to LOTR lovers. Lots of great lore, battles, you name it! If you are a Middle-Earth buff you will much enjoy this book. Lot's of names, family trees and geogrpahy make it a bit hard on the brain for casual readers but the more important ones stay with you throughout the book. Exciting tales await the reader of this book if you are willing to tough out the more brain-draining parts of the book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I know that this book was meant to be a \\"Bible\\" of sorts, of middle earth, but I think tolkien tried to make it too much like the real bible. This book to me seems to lack focus, like Tolkien was trying to put to many things in it at once. Im not going to lie when I read a book I go back and read some parts again to make sure i don't miss anything. But I found myself going back way to much for this one. If you want to know about the Begining of Middle earth and the gods of middle earth then yes read this book. Other than that turn away and run. This not a book for \\"skim readers\\" who like to glide trough a book and say they are done. This is book that takes alot of determination to read and grasp what you have read. PEACE!!!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien geeks will absolutely love the Silmarillion. Everything you wanted to know about the background and origins of Tolkien's world is there, albeit much of it briefly stated.For the average person who really liked LOTR and just wants some more background, might I suggest that having lit bamboo splints shoved under your eyelids is less painful than trying to plow through this book. Many, if not most characters in this morality play have a number of names they are known by and you never know which name they are going to be referred to by. I found myself constantly going to the name in the back of the book to refresh myself as to which name went with who. There are many characters and much information that you ask, &quot;SO?&quot; about after reading it. It doesn't take long to see that the Nordor (Deep Elves) are one bunch of dumb bunnies. They are reminiscent of the Isrealites. Etc. etc. Anyway, if you are Joe Blow and just want to pick up some additional info on the bigger Tolkien world, might I suggest there are several internet sites that will make it much easier. If you insist on trudging through this book, allot 2 packs of yellow post-it notes and 3 months to fully read, remember and digest it. I made it through but I'm not sure why....."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;tough reading, and at times boring&quot; sums up my view of this book.To me it is not a book that you can relax with, or pick up when you have few minutes to spare. There are a lot of names and places to remember that kept my flipping back to the index.From all the glowing reviews on here I keep turning the pages hoping that it will get better but I have yet to find anything that really draws me into the book.I read through the hobit and lord of the rings at a record pace and loved reading them but the silmarillion has been a real roadblock to me.Out of Middle earth and back to the Forgotten realms for me."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It took me 10 years to read this book. I'd started with the Hobbit when I was in my early teens and enjoyed it, then read Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I picked up the Silmarillion at a yard sale, not even knowing of it's existance and started to read. I didn't get through 2 chapters. I've read the Bible cover to cover twice and I couldn't get through this book. It took me 10 years to finally read it cover to cover and I couldn't tell you what happens beyond a basic description. It even has pages and pages of begats, just like Genesis. The only reason I even finished it is I set a stupid goal for myself. The book takes you through generation after generation, and gives you the origins of countless Tolkien species. In General, Not that interesting and I wish I hadn't bothered"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Of course The Silmarillion lives up to its difficult & fascinating history of the beginnings of the world and I highly reccomend the book to any lover of Tolkien. However I have some problems with this particular book.The map image of Beleriand is cut off on the edges, neglecting site of the remainder of the Ered Luin and some of the Dwarvish cities. Not to mention how the map was clipped on the south and the north as well. Perhaps I've become spoiled with Houghton Mifflin's 50th Anniversary Edition of the LOTR?The printing was often mottled within the text. There were places where letters were half missing. Other places where several lines of text had a crinkled line running though it; where it looked as if someone made a poor photocopy of the text by using a wrinkled original.The registering of the text on each page was off from being parallel with the top edge of the paper which skewed the entire block of text at the slightest angle.J.R.R. Tolkien's content itself is excellent!This printing is not!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Great book. You cannot enlarge the type, paragraphs are dropped. Must keep smallest type to read totality.Oh well, guess the glasses are on."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a great companion piece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'm enjoying having it, and this was a good deal for what I got. My only complaint is that it was marked as \\"like new\\" condition, but when I got it, it had a small tear in the front cover. That wasn't enough to ruin it for me, though, as you can see from the 4 star rating I gave it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a fascinating story of the creation and early millennia of Tolkeien's universe. It tells of how the Creator, Illuvatar, made the Ainur, the Holy Ones, who helped him create and guide the universe. It talks about the creation of the various races of Middle Earth, and some of the battles among the Ainur, which also resulted in battles among the inhabitants of Middle Earth. The book concludes with Sauron and the making of the Rings of Power.The book is not easy reading and the myriad of characters makes the story somewhat difficult to follow, but if you want background information about the Lord of the Rings Triology, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I find The Silmarillion a little hard to understand due to the old fashioned English used to write it. Once I got further into the story, though I liked the way Tolkien described the Lords of the West, especially Melkor. Tolkien\`s story vividly portrays the evolution of the Elves and their wars, their relationship with Men, and even the Dwarves. I appreciated how Tolkien summarized Sauron\`s creation & role in the Lord of the Rings. With patience, this book is well worth reading. It ties all the relationships of his characters in his world together."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I find the simarillion among my favorite books. It is full of action and suspence yet it also reprsents the true history of earth. Like Satan Elkor takes the fall then strives to rule the world. I must add that though this book is stirring do not recommend it to younger readers even those that enjoy lord of the rings may find this a tough read. however i have seen exceptions so if their reading level is really high then they can probably read it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is an amazing read to anyone who considers themselves a fan of Middle Earth mythology. Its breathtaking creation story is without compare in fantasy fiction (IMO), achieving the exact effect Tolkien intended of being a text that seems like an ancient history handed down through centuries of oral and written tradition. Tolkien fearlessly shows his audience the creation of the heavens and the earth, the origins of evil, and the ancient battles that set the stage for his later Lord of the Rings tales. Even though this isn't the whimsical yet dangerous frolic of The Hobbit or the world-saving epic journey of the Rings trilogy, fans should still be fascinated by the scope of Tolkien's imagination. He boldly starts at the very beginning of everything, then details the rise of the world and all life, the key conflicts that established the world's opposing forces, and the valiant quest for the Silmarils. This book is not recommended for casual fans of the Lord of the Rings movies, but for readers genuinely interested in Tolkien's unrivaled contributions to fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you want to better understand the LOTR: Lord of the Rings SEries it would be highly beneficial to read this book. I have read it so many times from my library i decided to just buy it for myself. But definetly a good read if you are a Lord of the Rings nerd like me. :P I bought the hard back and can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's hard to review and recommend a book that has really only a core niche audience in mind. But then again Tolkien didn't have marketing demographics for publishers in mind when he wrote this rather impressive tome. Tolkien was on a mission of sorts to create a new mythology for his homeland, and did a splendid job in his more casual reader friendly Hobbit and Lord of the Rings' works.The Silmarillion, as has been stated before, is essentially backstory to his popular works. It's Middle Earth's \\"King James\\", so to speak, which deals with the intelligence and/or supernatural being that created Middle Earth, and how the gradations of lesser beings went forth and helped shape and form that world.The scope of writing is biblical and epic. There isn't much in the way of examining individual tales and actions so much as there is a narrative of who did what, when, where and why. From Glauron, the father of all dragons, to Angband, Melkor/Morgoth's secret dark fortress, to Eru Iluvitar, and all of their servants, minions, followers and so forth, do we get a historic overview of the supernatural history of a mythology that might have been had it not been for the bloody French invading England way back in 1066 (to coin a phrase).It's not light reading. It is in fact reading meant for the serious Tolkien aficionado. Me, as a young man who was soaking up Tolkien's world, loved it as bit of insight into what happened before the time of Bilbo and Frodo. It was interesting to read about events and personae referenced off handedly by the characters in both Hobbit and Lord of the Rings' books. You get a real sense of the passion Tolkien had for his work via the scope of the tapestry he created.As an older adult I can still smile at the fantasy and be impressed by work, but like all mythology it is after all only make believe. Tolkien borrowed from Norse mythology, elements of Wagner, and even a sprinkling of Greek mythos here and there is used, to create his wondrous Middle Earth.Very impressive, but again this work is really only meant for the serious Tolkien fan. Even so, if you're just curious about things Tolkienish and Middle-Earth-like, then you might want to try cracking this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What can I say, it's Tolken and this is a must have companion for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is more of a study than a simple read for those who want to know more information about the history of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was in SUCH GOOD SHAPE that my hubby wont read it for fear he will mess it up lol. Everything was PERFECT, all maps and extras were secure and included, cover AND cover protector were PERFECT! Thank you sooooo much!!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I liked &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; trilogy which is what led me to read this. In my opinion it is like a great opera that keeps you on your seat at all times. No other fantasy author has ever made me feel that. In my opinion, one of the greatest books ever."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is so detailed and has too much information to be light reading. Put it to you this way, it has like a 50 page index. When I knew what was going on, I thought it was amazing."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Yeah, it's hard to stomach at first, but after you get done reading it, you will be in awe at how grand this book is. I think all the the time I spent understanding this book was well worth it! It is almost overwhelming. You won't regret reading it, even if it takes you a year!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Simply put: the most beautiful book I have ever had the good fortune of reading..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A must for all lovers of Tolkien's writings"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I recall reading at least 3/4 of the way through this book and giving up at some point. I can't really recall why I gave up reading the book with less than half to go. I tried again and I think I got a bit farther and then, just as mysteriously stopped, probably interrupted by some event or something and then just not picking it up again. I guess what made me not want to resume reading was the Bible-esque prose. While reading it, I found I sorely missed the more down to earth prose of his more popular works, i.e. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. I realize that Tolkein's intent was to pattern the history of Middle Earth somewhat on the Bible and that the structure actually seems to make sense that way, but that doesn't make reading it all that much easier. Still, there's a lot of stuff in this book and despite being smaller than The Hobbit and LotR (all told), paints a much broader picture and tells the story of the struggle of the Gods, Elves and Man against the true Dark Lord, Morgoth, who makes Sauron, (Morgoth's &quot;lieutenant&quot; in the Silmarillion), look like a piker. It also explains how Sauron came to take Morgoth's place as the Dark Lord and what the story is with all those rings, particularly the One Ring. So, all in all, a good read. If you can slog past the slow bits, you'll find some real meat in this book and that it will deepen your appreciation of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a must have if you liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The only problem with JRR Tolkien is that his books were too short."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I agree that the beginning is slow. The first time I read it it was difficult to get through. I've read the book 7 times, it seems to get easier with each reading. If you like/love elves, which I do, you'll enjoy the creation of the elves. I love Tolkien\`s version of elves. It is a great shame that he didn\`t write more than he did."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Out of all of Proffesor Tolkien's works this is my absolute favorite. It may take a little hard reading at first, but when you read it a few times you will use it as an important rescource for any one of the middle-earth books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a beautifully written book. It is the best and most descriptive tale of a New World I have ever read. Anyone who likes fantasy in the least bit should read this book. It is absolutely perfect."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Excellent! The writings of Tolkien are the most imaginative and mentally stimulating books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is concerned with the Lord of the Rings. It is an account of the Elder days or the first age of middle Earth, where the children of Iluvatar constructed Middle Earth. It is a great book and it was published four years after the death of the author , J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had ordered The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien some time ago. I received it only a few days after I ordered it. The product was in fantastic condition, there was nothing wrong with it. The delivery was fast and high quality. The product itself was perfect as well. Exactly what I wanted and more than I expected."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Yes, Tolkein almost got me a detention, if I recall correctly. I was roused up by my study hall teacher for falling asleep yet again for reading Silmarillion. I have fallen asleep during other times, but especially when reading Silmarillion. I did not want to touch it constantly. Finally, with a deadline approaching, I went to the library (and had to sleep once while there) and read a lot of it. It was there that I ran into the tale of Beren and Luthien, a love story in which Luthien, a Valar, determines to give up her eternal life to be with the mortal Beren. Charming. Epic. I loved it. Stories like this gave the book redeeming value. But you pretty much had to wade through it. I can't recall the details of any of the book that well, because it is told in historical form, the reader assuming an omnipotent god-like view. I guess this could have its merits. This book seems more for the die-hard Tolkien fan, willing to sacrifice his time for each tidbit. Not me. I read this book as a precursor to the rest of the series (which I still have yet to touch). Since it's been some time since I've read this (about two months), maybe I should forebear, but considering what this book did to me (and considering I can't remember the details that well...) for now it gets two stars. Maybe when I read it again someday (if I read it again someday) this review might improve. But as for now, it gets two stars."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've owned 'The Silmarillion', along with 'The Hobbit' and a collected 'Ring trilogy' for some time, but hadn't actually tried reading them til now. I thought 'The Silmarillion' would be the best place to start, but I now know better!I wasn't expecting it to be a novel, more a collection of connected short stories. It wasn't til I actually started reading that I realized I was wrong. The best word I can use to describe this book is 'impenetrable'.I can't help thinking that the book's posthumous release was just an attempt by Tolkien's son to just get something out on the market for the fans who'd discovered the trilogy and/or 'The Hobbit' in the '60s.Perhaps it's telling that, although this book has remained in print alongside the others, it seems to have faded into the background, and is apparently something only the most dedicated Tolkien fans can enjoy.I can certainly see how Tolkien was influenced by the folk histories and creation tales of various cultures. Unfortunately, this work is just as dense as they are! The archaic sentence structure is most reminiscent of sagas such as 'Beowulf'...which up til now has been the single most difficult literary work I've attempted to read! I only finished that because it was required reading for college. This similarly scholarly work is absolutely NOT meant for anybody who has never read Tokien's work! I might try to read 'The Silmarillion' again, but not until I've read 'The Hobbit' and 'LOTR' first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Well I warned you and hear we go. I had just finished The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. I was amazed I hadn't read Tolkien until now. So I figure what else has he done that I would enjoy. So Amazon has this book and 310 reviewers review it at 4 and half stars or something. So I get it and start reading it.I couldn't get past about 100 pages. I tried I really did. I would read two pages and put it down and take a break and try again but I couldn't get anywhere. The story he was telling wasn't a story at all. It seemed like a history lesson, with a boring hard to follow plot and people whose names you couldn't pronounce let alone remember. Now I've read some Tom Clancy books that were longer and as boring as watching CNBC but this was ridiculous.OK so I'm sorry if you love this book I'm sure if I was devoted to Tolkien maybe I would give this book another shot. However if your looking for a good read from Tolkien try the LOTR again."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It isn't a novel, it's the comprehensive dictionary of Middle Earthian backstory, formatted like an old Viking Saga. Not a light or interesting read. Think of a farmer's almanac and the thousands of endnotes that go with any serious history volume. Now combine them -- you get this book of details involving Middle Earth.If you want more along the lines of The Lord of The Rings Trilogy or The Hobbit, re-read the originals. If you are a Tolkien fanatic and want to know who Smeagol is related to fifteen generations later in Hobbiton, the elvish words for the names of the beloved swords carried by the first elves, and the names of like five hundred dwarves who died at Moria, this is the book for you.Why one? My expectations were off -- I expected a novel, not a badly formated roleplaying sourcebook made of author's notes. When I tried to read this, I always fell asleep. Not even calculus or 18th century philosophy does that to me.Yes, names were beautiful (Professor Tolkien had a degree in linguistics), and parts of it were like an alternative universe Bulfinch's Mythology, but as a novel, it fails."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien criticized his friend C. S. Lewis's fictional writings for being overly allegorical, but his own work is pretty darn allegorical, too. The Silmarillion opens with a religious creation story clearly based mainly on the Judeo-Christian version, though with elements of Greek and Scandinavian mythology mixed in (which somewhat improves it). He even adopts a quasi-biblical/mythological style. This makes it much harder to get through than The Lord of the Rings, but it has some nice moments, and its epic scale is pretty much unmatched."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There is a very good reason this was not published in the author's life time: it wasn't ready. Events pass too quickly, yet the story drags; there is such little characterization that I can not possibly begin to empathize with a single charater; every charater has about three names and it's impossible to care why they have those names; the dialogue is practically non-existant; et cetera. There are some parts that are more developed than others and there the potential has been reached, but far too much of it is not. I have read and enjoyed non conventional books (i.e the Heimskringla and Hesiod's Theogeny, may be a close analogy despite these actually having historical significance), but the way this reads now (at the pre-publishable state) it seems only self-indulgent.

Tolkien. But the SIMARILLION outlines only the bare bones of the story and is in no way comparable to the LORD OF THE RINGS or even THE HOBBIT as far as the treatment of the environs, the dialog and mood is concerned.

He is too great an author to have written such disjointed and meaningless drivel. When a book runs 377 pages and then has to have nearly 100 pages to explain what was said is unacceptable. There are 73 pages of names and explanations of those name. The book is hard to read (and I do have an Masters degree in education) for most people just because of the excessive names and places to be remembered and connected.If you like Tolkien, stay away from this discouraging example of prose. Read his other very fine books instead -- The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This work of Tolkien's pales in comparison with The Hobbit.

It tells of the making of Arda by Il&uacute;vatar and the Ainur, of the coming of the Elves and Dwarves and Men to Middle-earth, but also of their corruption and the great battles that lead to the downfall of their civilization.I read the Silmarillion for the first time 7 years ago, and I must admit my English wasn't good enough then, so I really struggled with the language. I wasn't as familiar with Tolkien's world as I am now either, having only read the Lord of the Rings in French two years before, so it only seemed to me like a confusing succession of names. I didn't enjoyed it.Now, after a second attempt, I'm proud to announce I changed my view. Even though of course the Silmarillion still ressembles much more a history book than a novel, and even though I still found it hard to concentrate at times, and even though I still mixed all the characters' and places' names, I could match the words with John Howe's illustrations. Therefore everything took colour and became three-dimensional. And I even drew some of the scenes myself.And now I want to read it again... so that must be a sign, right?"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I cannot even begin to explain. Many others who have reviewed before have done the explaining justly. I just have to say that this is an amazing book and if you are a fan of Tolkien and want to know more about his amazing sub-creation, then you should seriously look into 'The Silmarillion'"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is an incredible work. Tolkien probably wanted it published, but we'll never know. His son did the world a great service. I for one, consider this to be one of the greatest literary works in history."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"NOTE: The below pertains to the audio (CD) set, not the book per se; Amazon seems to have misplaced this review.Martin Shaw is to be commended for his magnificent reading of J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion,\\" the epic saga of the Eldar days of the world that became the setting for the better-known Lord of the Rings. He brings a gravity and seriousness that is perfectly in flavor with these sagas of cosmic import (nothing less than the entire creation of the Universe is represented here, after all). And never once does he stumble or feel uncomfortable with all the different languages (primarily Elvish) and names that Tolkien so liberally doles out.These stories -- narratives, not a novelization like LOTR -- have tremendous scope and power and beauty. They make the Rings books seem almost confined and diminished (as Tolkien indeed made the world out to be by the Third Age), such is their scale and vastness. Many stories only alluded to in the Rings are here told in full, and the context in which the Rings of Power came to arise, the fall of the Elves and of Numenor, and the rise of Sauron (himself only a diminished version of the truly awe-inspiring Morgoth) is gloriously spread before the enchanted reader (or listener, in this case).Centuries ago, tales such as these would have circulated orally, so this set makes a splendid addition to your fireside gatherings, say, or to relieve the tedium of long traffic commutes. Read the book, by all means, but don't overlook this gem of an audio set!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was a good size and takes about a week to read.It kept my attention more than the other Tolkien books,but makes the war sound a little too hopeless. He answers a few questions from the previous books and makes the fantasy world a bit more complete.i really enjoyed this one and recommend it to everyone. The part about the Valinor who are the next step from kings is interesting. One war was because the mortal men couldn't go to the deathless island of the elves or the valinor's island.So the men were pretty much on Saurons side the whole time and the Elves and dwarves on the other.The book is very creative and therearen't so many journeys"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"The Silmarillion\\" is a coda to author J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and a fascinating one at that. The story describes Tolkien's world in ancient times, before there were hobbits, rings of power, or even elves. Think of it as the Genesis of Middle-earth, the creation of Tolkien's world. For those who have not yet read the Lord of the Rings, the names and places may be a bit puzzling. But the stories are engrossing as fantasy on their own. For Tolkien fans, The Silmarillion sets out to explain many of the tales and legends that were mentioned but not fully revealed in the Rings' trilogy. There's the story of the unchaining of Melkor; the coming of the high elves and men to Middle-earth; the courtship of Beren and Luthien, the fairest to ever walk in Middle-earth; and the fall of Gondolin. Perhaps most interesting is a chapter on the rings of power that describes Sauron's rise and his forging of the omnipotent One Ring. A fan of fantasy or curious about some of the legends of old that are mentioned in the main books? Then I say: \\"Read on!\\""},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the amazing work that J.R.R. Tolkien devoted his whole life to. The History of the First Age of Middle-Earth is very captivating, and it really goes deep into this fantasy world. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings did not have this kind of incredible awe about them like the Silmarillion does. From the beginning of Arda (the World) with the Song of Illuvitar to the final defeat of Morgoth at the end of the First Age, this book creates a complete history of a world we hardly know."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was actually written first, before the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. He couldn't get it published because they thought it too detailed. He later wrote The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, he never lived to see the Silmarillion published. The demand by the readers, though, for a history of Middle Earth is what brought this out of the drawer where it had been kept for so many years.A definite read for those who love Middle Earth and the many who live there. :)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Ahhh...The Silmarillion. This book, which is the history of the Lord of the Ring's Middle-Earth is perhaps the deepest work of the imagination that I have ever read. Looking at the story by just scratching its surface one can see influences from the Bible, Homer's Iliad, Arthurian legends, and many more great books of the past. However, it is much more; if you are well versed in Tokien's other works, such as the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you will only begin to appreciate the level of creativity, passion, and skill that Tolkien infused into this masterpiece.For instance, the ideas for the Silmarillion were begun in the first decades of the 20th Century before there was such an established genre as Fantasy. Tolkien created this branch of literature. Second, Tolkien created an entire language (&quot;Elvish&quot;) to go with his world. Another is that if you first read the Hobbit and LOTR saga, then read the this work you see that those books would not have been so detailed, nor felt so real were it not for the &quot;fleshed-out&quot; history that the Silmarillion provides. Everything in the LOTR can be traced to events, places, or people that existed long ages ago during, before, and shortly after the time of the Silmarils.That this was Tolkien's life's work is evident in the details and care he put into it. Details like the geneology charts for many notable characters; details like the poems and songs both in Common Speech and in the language of Elves. We learn that Aragorn in LOTR is directly descended from the Kings of Numenor, the first of which was Elros the Half-elven, brother of the elf Elrond. Arwen, his bride-to-be and Elrond's daughter therefore is related to him, though hundreds of generations and thousands of years distant. For since their parents were each half-human and half-elven, the brothers Elros and Elrond were allowed to choose between living as mortal Men or immortal Elves. Elros chose humanity and founded the nation of Numenor many thousands of years prior to the time of the LOTR. The maritime civilization of Numenor grew mighty over 3000 years. So powerful in fact, during the second age an invasion fleet from Numenor to conquer Sauron and his minions scared Sauron's troops so much that they fled his side. Sauron then surrendered and was taken back to Numenor, but tragically he also became the principal architect in its downfall.Let us also not forget Tolkien's masterful writing skills. The turn of a phrase or the image of a battle can be so clear that I will read and reread the same passage many times until it truly sinks in.In closing, the Silmarillion is not a book you must necessarily read to enjoy the LOTR, but it makes the whole experience much richer and gives Tolkien's work a deeper meaning, one I'm glad the rest of the world could share."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I LOVED lord of the rings and the hobbit so I decided to read this book even though at first I had no clue what it was about.When I first started reading it I was fascinated at how deep it delved into the history of middle earth, so now if you see any references to lore in the lord of the rings after reading this book you can say \\"hey I remember that\\". However this book can probably only be read by serious readers who can stand what is basicly a history book. There are man6y interesting tales in this that are part of the shaping of middle earth in fact the entire book is. Some people have tried to associate tolkien with the occult but all that is a huge lie(seriously the guy was a christian) in fact some of the storyline is similar to the bible like the fall of the Noldar. ***PLEASE NOTE: This review was written by my teenage son who accidentally logged into my account. I like the review, and I trust his judgment, so the review stays."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have a lifelong problem with reading history books. They tend to bore me because they usually don't focus on specific people, but instead on events filled with people we never really get to know. The Silmarillion has somehow avoided doing that even though it reads like a history text. I am in love with the book, and really excited to go back and read the Lord of the Rings again (for about the fourth time) with the new knowledge I have. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Elves and Hobbits and the like."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I like J.R.R. Tolkien's nearly everybook. He writes wonderful fantasy books but I was a little dissapointed when I opened the book and started reading--The beginning was very boring! The language that Tolkien used was very different than the one that he used when he was writing the Lord of Rings triology. But then(suddenly) something changed. I felt something strange--I was in the book, I could hear every whisper the characters make. As you can see when you read this book, you take something from it,something that the characters have.The story begins with a &quot;MUSIC&quot; that the souls and the One make together. It is the story of the Elves and the humans and the Earth. Every single sound has its own character. The One made these characters alive. The Earth formed and Valar started to prepeare it for the Elves and Humans. U know everybook has a bad guy... This guy is a Vala in this book and called MELKOR. He tries everything to destroy the world. Can he do that? Just read and see!!!Don't get dissapointed with the beginning just go on reading... You can like this book. BUT NOT FOR ALL TASTES!!!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Delivery was prompt, and the book was packaged well for protection. It arrived in pristine condition and every bit the product as advertised."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"The Silmarillion\\" provides a formidable foundation on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" mythos. The author obviously spent a great amount of thought and time creating the wonderful world compiled with appendices for names, places, and maps including references to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Characterization is limited having little dialogue but addresses critical events that shaped the ancestors of the Fourth Age.The novel equates more as a geography and history text as opposed to a tale of deeds by adventurers. The conception of the world by Eru, the One, and the creation and manipulation of the Elves, Dwarves, and Humans by the other gods governs a majority of the book while explaining the evolution of creatures and evil within the people of Middle-earth. Hundreds of similar names for people and places will be confusing for almost every reader.I recommend the book to any fan of the Middle-earth realm.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"While Tolkien's masterwork will always be Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion is a work of undisputed genius. For the devoted Tolkien reader, this book is a must read. The best way to summarize The Silmarillion, is that it completes the picture of Middle Earth and makes it whole."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'd already read The Silmarillion twice and come to love it when I bought this edition. I relied on another reviewer's description of its production values, and wasn't disappointed. The paper and binding are high quality; the 45 color plates are beautiful and dramatic interpretations of scenes from the stories.I wouldn't describe The Silmarillion as difficult reading. It reminds me of the books of myths and legends I used to enjoy as a child. Many of those were written in 19th Century prose, so I was ready for Tolkien's archaic style. It was necessary to consult the geneology charts at the back a few times to keep track of the characters.The Silmarillion consists of connected stories rather than a tightly knit plot. Some of the stories are more fully realized than others. More detailed but unfinished versions of many may be found in the Unfinished Tales and History of Middle Earth series. Although not fully realized, the stories contain moving and unforgettable moments. For me, Hurin's reunion with Morwen at the grave of their son is one of the greatest. Collectively the sweep of The Silmarillion is impressive, creating a sense of an alternate world that is both familiar since it derives from myths and legends we know -- and strange since Tolkien has synthesized these elements into something new and altogether his own.Like any other book, this one isn't for everybody. But for those readers enthralled by The Lord of the Rings or intrigued by myth, it's worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you're a true Tolkien fan, this is definetly a book you should read!To find out about the Valar, how Middle Earth came to be, why Melkor became Morgoth, the story of Luthien, I can keep going, but there are many other amazing stories in this book.The one thing is, it's a little harder to read for some as it's a blend of stories, not one big one like Lord of the Rings, and not a light as The Hobbit. But I still believe that people, besides Tolkien fans, should read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Although it was indeed a post-humous publication, the Silmarillion is truly the work of J.R.R. Tolkien (with a little organization by his son) and as such, it is probably his crowning achievement as a writer. Embodying everything that he desired to acomplish linguistically as well as creatively, the Silmarillion stands as the greatest volume by the accomplished philologist.Perhaps the greatest achievement of this work is its grand scope, covering the earliest years in the history of Middle Earth. Written in an extremely mythic style, the story begins telling the tale of creation. Due to his devotion to Roman Catholicism, Tolkien indirectly imbues these early myths with Judeo-Christian sentiments, leaving room for other northern-European influences as well. Because of this basis in true-world mythology, the early tales of the Silmarillion stand out as more than isolated tales of a fictional world. Indeed, they inspire the reader to imagine beauty which is beyond the confines of Middle Earth, renewing awe in the nature of the world and Man's place in there.The main body of the work, the tale of the Silmarils and the events surrounding them is a story which is once again mythic but yet is a most excellent heuristic for looking at hubris as well as the corruption of evil. Indeed, this is an ongoing theme in the work, linking, in many ways, to Judeo-Christian teachings and myth. The overall theme of the work approaches the idea of subcreation and the beauty AND responsibility that come with it. The development of all the characters reflects the ramifications of free choice and the temptations that can stem from the abilities granted to individuals.Because of its wholistic nature and thorough integration, the Silmarillion is a superb work which stands on its own as a fantasy mythology. However, this development lets the work to refresh the reader's view of the world and also grants insight and reflection on the responsibilities of mankind. Because of this, I highly recommend the Silmarillion for all who are willing to take the time to make through its elegant prose."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I came to know about Tolkien and his works only when I saw the TFOTR. But I was so influenced by the film that I bought 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Hobbit' and 'The Silmarillion'. I had read many reviews that 'The Silmarillion' is a bit too 'strong' stuff. But my experince was just the opposite. Of the three books, I liked 'The Silmarillion' the most. It is an enchanting tale of the creation of the world through the music of the Ainur and the events of the First Age. It is a tragic tale from almost the first to the last. In the beginning, we see the establishment of High Elven kingdoms in Middle Earth as the Noldor Elves arrived in Middle Earth to wage war against the the Dark Lord Morgoth to recover the Jewels of Feanor, the Silmarils. The book takes us through the lives of many Elves and Men which get intertwined with the War of the Jewels. Finally, we see the inevitable fall of these Elven Realms despite all the heroism of the Noldor. The book also delves into the rise and fall of Numenor and the Wars of the Rings in the Second and Third Ages. This book will help you to understand 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' better and will provide answers for many of your lingering doubts regarding these.On the overall, if you are an imaginative, romantic kind of person with a love for art, history, philosophy and mythology, this book is for you. (You will find it difficult to put the book down till you have read it to the last). It might even rouse the artist in you! (It did in my case, anyway :-)) ) But if you are an ordinary kind of person who take these things casually, this book is definitely not for you. (You probably won't get past the first page.)This book also shows you the level of imagination of the genius that was Tolkien. If he had lived during the Classical Age, he would have probably created a religion all by himself!I'm now planning to buy the 'History of Middle-Earth' series. :-))"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What makes Tolkien great is that he understands that modernity is a lie; that there was a better world inside of man long ago, and if there wasn't, well then there should have been.It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion was a great book- a little hard though, when you're only 13 and has english as a second language! I liked it a lot, but it's very sad. It's about how Middle Earth developers (please ignore my horrible spelling) ,and about how evil came there. I specificcly liked the part about Turin Tarambar and Beleg. Sad, scary, beautiful, and absorbing!

The Silmarillion includes some of the most beautiful yet tragic tales I have ever read as well as some of the most heroic. While the book is not without its flaws (a long description of who begat who and who is from where is important but truly the slowest part of the book)these do not over shadow a book that keeps you looking for more of the story even after you reach the final page."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a fascinating work of fiction on many levels. The work itself is intricate and should satisfy all but the most rabid Tolkien fans. But on another level, it is also fascinating that a \\"fake history\\" that is, in many ways, as difficult to read as an 16th century humanist saga, should be so attractive. After all, there are \\"real\\" mythologies abounding, and despite our familiarity with the main characters (Zeus, Ulysses, Odin, Thor, etc), there is as much to be learned in the background as Tolkien presents in the collected Silmarillion.Perhaps the attractiveness is that Tolkien presents us with a completed cycle from the birth of the world, through to (presumably) the world as we know it. The departure of the Elves at the end of the Third Age, the diminishing of the Dwarves, Hobbits, and Dark Elves provide a bridge between the creatures of our own mythology and the world Tolkien created.It is also interesting that Tolkien so thoroughly avoided theology. His \\"fallen angel\\" is familiar enough. Anyone who has read Augustine's City of God will be immediately familiar with the perspective in which Tolkien holds the gods of his story as opposed to the dark powers. It is the strange dichotomy of Man & Elf / Mortality and Immortality, and the \\"purposes\\" for each implied in the creation of the World that is left tantalizingly unexplored. Thus the \\"advantage\\" of Tolkien's \\"fake history\\" is not pursued, leaving one to unsatisfying conjecture.As a minor complaint, the fractured nature of parts of the book are apparent and disappointing, if understandable. The writing style, vast material covered, and lack of depth in the characters will disappoint many LOTR fans. But the gems buried within (the origin of Gandalf, for example) are well worth whatever discomfort the work might cause. And ultimately, after reading the Silmarillion, the leap to \\"real mythologies\\" becomes a lot easier."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It has been said that the Silmarillion is the masterwork of Tolkien. Long before he wrote the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien was working on what would become the Silmarillion. While Lord of the Rings is rightly his most popular work, it is only part of a larger world. Tolkien created the whole of Middle Earth and we only got to see a little glimpse of it. The Silmarillion can be treated as a history of Middle Earth.Actually, that might be the best way to look at it. It is not a single story and there does not seem to be any one thread or theme running through the course of the book. Instead, we are given everything from the origins of Middle Earth right up to the events that led into Lord of the Rings. If you think of the Silmarillion as a history book, you won't have any sort of unreasonable expectations going into it. It is the history of a familiar world that never was.I can't imagine that this would be a good starting place for someone looking to read Tolkien, but for fans (and only for fans) of Middle Earth, this is required reading to get a sense of the history of the land. Like all of Tolkien's work, this is well written but it is also a little dryer than his other stuff."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"if you are a fan of LOTR than this is the book for you!!! it goes more in dept to the characters and descibes them in a deaper way....sorta. :) this book doesn't have a stoyline, but it's more of a desciption of how middle earth was in the 1st age and how the elves and the men were. it's a very good book and every tolkien fan should own it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After reading the Lord of the Rings series, I decided to read the Simarillion.

This writing of this book is so vivid, I felt like I was living the history of Elves, Men, Orcs, Dwarves, and Ents. I suggest taking the time to read it through twice, you will pick up so much more.

Every time Gandalf or Aragorn mentions Luthien, Earendil or anything else - it's a reference to events that are laid out in this book.

That genre is mythology. If you find ancient myths and legends of heroes interesting, you will find The Slimarillion to your liking, even if you are not familiar with Tolkien's other books. This is a good place to start, because it details the creation of the author's world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are few words that can describe the immense nature of this novel. Spectacular, magnificent, grandiose...I do not have the skills to shower my praise in words. This is not for the regular reader either, this is for those who are truly interested and willing to sift through all the information of Middle Earth.For starters, the beginning is wholly beautiful and interesting, yet its boring. The creation of Middle Earth is one of the most intriguing and beautiful ideas that Tolkien ever had. Yet just the way it's presented can make any reader weary. After the creation, it only gets better. The treachery of Melkor in the beginning lays the foundations of the evils of The Lord of the Rings. The history of the Elves is by far the most interesting aspect. From their early days in Middle Earth to the Noldor uprising to the destruction of Gondolin, this will enchant any reader. The story of Luthien and Beren is spectacular to read. Then comes the early history of Men and their dealings with the dread of Morgoth in the East and in the West. Then the dealings with Sauron and the forging of the great rings provides a spectacular prelude to the Lord of the Rings books.If only Tolkien had lived long enough to finish this, then it could've been a 10 out of 5 stars. Definetely a classic read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien at his best!Reviewer: Eric DavisI recently reread The Silmarallion, and it was absolutely spectacular! Never before have I better writing. The mix of emotions, the battles, the loves, and the betrayals is simply wonderful. The book tells about the creation of Middle-Earth, the coming of the different races, and their tribulations. The tome span is incredible as well. The timeline starts before the beginning and goes up to the end of the third age. I&#65533;d say more, but I don&#65533;t want to give the story away.I first read this book about three years ago. I loved it then and I love it now. If you really want to know the story behind The Lord of the Rings, I highly suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Even as an 'extreme reader' and a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, I found The Silmarillion a rather daunting book. It most definitely is not for the moderate reader or someone with a short attention span. While The Silmarillion ended up not being quite as hard to get through as I was expected, it did still consume a good deal of time. The beginning took the most effort to read, but after that, I found the Silmarillion very fascinating.If you're interested in getting an in-depth look on how Middle Earth came to be, where elves, dwarves, and men came from, or how certain events or peoples pertain to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Silmarillion is a wealth of information for anyone who will read the book.It also shows how much time and thought J.R.R. Tolkien spent on his imaginary world of Middle Earth. The book has a very well documented history of Middle Earth from before it's creation to a brief summary of the events of the LotR books. Everything makes sense and fits together in a way no other fantasy has ever come close to doing. The Silmarillion is a highly recommended read for those who also love Tolkien's writings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion for the most part gives a very detailed historical background to all things that exist and happen in middle earth during 'Lord of the Rings'.

It is most definitely among the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien has respectively created such a unique and complex world or worlds as I might quietly add to the huge pile of information. The object that draws my to this account of the Quenta Silmarillian is the gargantuan capacity of events that happen in such minute space. The thoughts of this biosphere that Tolkien is in the \\" winners circle of Mythology, with all its controversy among the valar and the miar. The best qualities of his books are he recites the epic tale of good versus evil in an interesting manor, and the fact of Tolkien's consistency there are not flaws in this neo-classic. But his greatest accomplishments have to be the languages. The languages that Tolkien mustered up for his works are all self derived; he was a linguist and a powerful one at that. He devised 16 full languages and they all differ immensely. Tolkien is a genious leave it there and do not touch it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Finishing \\"The Silmarillion,\\" one feels as though one has read the history of the world; so rich and lengthy was the world within the mind of JRR Tolkien.Reader be forewarned, this book - the word \\"book\\" is hardly fitting - is NOT at all like the Lord of the Rings or its counterpart, The Hobbit. Those works were wrought from a more individual point of view, one being's perspective. The Silmarillion, however, is a book whose scale accounts for the happenings of more than eight thousand years. This script contains the complete history of the world of Ea, the creation of Tolkien. The scale is immense, something of an \\"Elvish bible.\\" A mere taste of this history was accounted in the Lord of the Rings, which was of great importance in Tolkien's history but nonetheless takes about a page total near the end of Silmarillion.This book begins with the creation of the World by Iluvatar, something of the God equivalent in this myth. It goes on to describe the events of thousands of years in Arda, the World. Starting on Valinor, essentially Heaven, it fades into legend as events move to Beleriand, the ancient land of the Elves.This is where the reader compares to the events of the Lord of the Rings, and realises that despite all of the splendour of it there was a much greater land in the past. The Elves seem a relatively small part in Lord of the Rings, but in the First Age, thousands of years before LOTR, the Elves were the great ones, and all that was in Middle Earth in the Third Age of LOTR was a mere remnant. One also discovers the origin of many unrevealed things in LOTR. We discover the Dark Lord Sauron's origin as a mere servant of Morgoth, whom at the time was even more powerful and evil. The happenings of Beleriand in the main body of the Silmarillion are mainly about the Elves and Men's wars against Morgoth, and also of the Silmarils.The Silmarillion simply overwhelms the reader with the scale that it is on. One must read it to discover it, and once begun you will be immersed in his vast world. Truly a work difficult to comprehend by our own minds that Tolkien has tapped."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For those of you who just read The Lord of the Rings -- do read LotR first -- this is a totally different experience. While LotR puts the reader in the midst of the action through the use of sympathetic characters one can relate to and graphic exposition and description, The Silmarillion is more distant, reading like a cross between The Bible and a good book of classic mythology. There is one overriding story of a great war between the High Elves and the first Dark Lord, Melkor, but the story takes place over the course of many millenia, encompassing the rise and fall of many great kingdoms and heroes among elves and men. Like classical heroes, the great elves and men of The Silmarillion are the titans and gods of myth, mighty in deed, but subject to catastrophic tragic flaws and flights of hubris. Like the Norse gods, they have an inevitable doom hanging over them. LotR readers might be surprised especially at how petty, vicious, and treacherous some of the elves are portrayed.Like classical myth, the world of The Simarillion is pure hyperbole and fancy -- there are literal earth shaking battles, tales of endurance rivaling Orpheus' descent into Hades, descriptions of magic realms that could never be literally believed. Unlike LotR, where you might suspend your disbelief, you could not believe in the cosmos of The Silmarillion, unless you can believe that the world was once flat and lit by two giant lamps, or that Venus is actually a magic gem on a ship sailing through the sky. Still, the freer, more mythological framework of this book allows more fantastic stories and situations to unfold than ever imagined in LotR. The image that sticks in my mind most after recently re-reading this book is the aerial duel between Earendil in his flying ship and Ancalagon, the mighty black winged dragon.In the Silmarillion you will find the genesis of most of the major races and magical creatures of Middle Earth. Hobbits get almost no mention, except in a closing chapter that deals with the Third Age, included to provide a complete history of the High Elves in Middle Earth. Some of the names occurring in this book will be familiar to LotR readers, but aside from Galadriel and Sauron, no major characters from LotR appear in The Silmarillion. Sauron is as frightening, or perhaps even more frightening as in LotR -- in The Silmarillion, he is a shape changing Lord of vampires and werewolves. By contrast, The Dark Lord Melkor comes off as rather buffoonish and cowardly, subject to remarkable lapses in judgment and easilly fooled by puerile ruses, as in the story of Beren of Luthien, wherein an elf princess tricks him into letting his guard down by dancing for him. My other complaint, besides the lack of a really frightening main villain, would be the lack of detail in the book at times. This last problem can be attributed to the richness of Tolkein's imagination. He had so many stories to tell that they could not have all fit in one book; indeed, including everything alluded to would have made The Silmarillion too long and cumbersome. But I did feel like I wanted more at times. In conclusion, I would say that this is an excellent book, dramatic, poetic, and epic, but not for everyone, not even all fans of the Lord of the Rings. But if you have a taste for tales of epic battles, tragedy, and supernatural wonder, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"THE SILMARILLION was Tolkien's first and last work of fiction. He began writing it during World War I as a way of providing a history for the \\"fairy languages\\" he had created. During his life he continued to refine these legends, but it wasn't published until his son Christopher Tolkien put together his notes after JRRT's death. Essentially, the Silm is like a Bible of Middle-Earth, recording its history from its creation through the epic conflicts of its First Age, thousands of years prior to the events in LOTR. Whereas that series was written like a standard close-quarter narrative novel, the Silm is written as though compiled from records and tales handed down over centuries - there is a feeling of distance and a lack of concrete detail. Despite that, many of the stories here are quite moving, including the massive battles of the Elves with the first Dark Lord (Morgoth) and the tale of Beren and Luthien, which is a prototype for the story of Aragorn and Arwen in LOTR. When the Silm is good, it's poetic and larger-than-life; when it's not so good, it reads like a history textbook. But this can definitely be an interesting book so long as one doesn't expect another book exactly like LOTR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've read the first hundred pages (through chapter nine) of The Silmarillion once, and the rest of the book more times than I can remember to count.Tolkien's 1938 \\"Faery-stories\\" lecture defined the modern fantasy story in terms of its climactic \\"eucatastrophe,\\" not exactly a happy ending necessarily but a moment of heartbreaking joy, which he variously demonstrated in each of his fictions. The Silmarillion's is even better than the one in Unfinished Tales, precisely because the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" proper is Tolkien's most tragic saga, a superhuman epic of magic and passion. Nothing can quite prepare you for it, because there isn't anything else quite like it.The \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is also Tolkien's purest tribute to the medieval literature that didn't survive. It reflects the centrality of the Old Norse Elder (or Poetic) Edda (a cycle of songs accidentally discovered in Iceland, which imply far more of both mythology and metaphysics than they actually record) in Tolkien's critical view of medieval literary history. Paragraph one of chapter ten demonstrably scans in Sievers staves.It should be noted that the shorter sequels following the \\"Quenta Silmarillion,\\" \\"Akallabeth\\" and \\"Of the Rings of Power,\\" require knowledge of the first two appendices to The Lord of the Rings. My own personal hypothesis is that the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" was metahistorically written by Galadriel, its most domestic character, at Gandalf's behest, when he first arrived in Middle-earth, a thousand years before The Lord of the Rings.It's not true that there are no hobbits in The Silmarillion, but it wouldn't make much difference if it were. I'm waiting to see them make a movie out of this one: there's no conversational dialogue at all, only speeches. And yet there are great love and great wisdom. Readers of both the Classics and the Bible will be better prepared than most."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"When I started reading this i stopped it was terrible, it made no sense.(3 months later) I gave it another chance, which i am so grateful for, I found out there was a index of definitons in the back....I skipped the first 50-75 pages (too hard to read). I had much trouble but once after page 100 I couldnt stop reading it! This book means so much to me and I cant even think what would happen if I never read. On the other hand my friend, who got me to read Lord of the rings, tried to read it but couldnt make it past page 75. So it is up to you wether you wanna read the best book ever, which opens you up to many other Tolkien books (Unfinished Tales, History of Middle-Earth(which is a harder read then Silm)) I ask you to read this and you'll get a new stronger perspective on everything Tolkien did and how hard he worked on his books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"So often J.R.R. Tolkien's works are only brought to CD when they are &quot;adapted&quot; or &quot;abridged&quot;, what those two words really mean is trashed. So it was with some anticipation that I got my audio book copy of _The Simarillion_.Fortunately this piece does not dissapoint. Martin Shaw does an excellent job reading the book, and true to it's advertising it is completely unabridged. That makes for nearly 14 Hours of reading by Shaw. I'm not 100% certain that all of his pronounciations were correct, but I can certainly live with it. It is absolutely awesome to be on a long drive and be able to hear the story _Of Beren and Luthien_ .For any fan of Tolkien's work I cannot recommend this more highly."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Im only writting this cause i feel obligated to say a big thanks to JRR TOLKIEN for all his work...Silmarillion is a piece of bookart that ive never read before...maybe a bit tyring..cause of its big length but noone can create a whole new world in just a few pages!Most of you might need to read it 3 or 4 times and still find new things to enjoy it...I strongly recomment to all readers of Tolkiens to read this and everyother of his books while their cd player rhymes NIGHTFALL IN MIDDLE EARTH CD(BLIND GUARDIAN)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As one reviewer noted, this is like Tolkien's bible and can only be appreciated by the hardcore Tolkien fans. It starts out as a creation story, detailing how Arda (the realm of earth) came to exist through the songs and thoughts of Iluvatar (God) and the Ainur (.....angels???). Some of the Ainur decide to go to earth, so they are then called the Valar, and prepare it for the Elves who are to be born much later. There is much trial and tribulation as one of the Valar, Melkor, becomes evil and jealous and tries to wreck everything. Theres a lengthy description of the different Vala and Valie and whos in charge of what; wind, earth, plants, stars... etc. THEN when the Elves are born theres all the different families and types of Elves, Wood Elves, Green Elves, Dark Elves. BUT they have names like Moriquendi, Noldor, Teleri, Umanyar... etc, depending on whether they made this journey and saw these trees.... AND THEN theres all the different sons and daughters who are descended from this guy whos descended from that guy who was married to this woman who was descended from this king who perished in that war.My advice is to photocopy the family trees and maps in the back of the book so you can use them as an easy reference (I know... it's kinda dorky, but for those of you with short attention spans this WILL prevent massive headaches). There is just so many different people and descendants... it can be confusing. But once you have a good idea of who the main characters are and what they are doing it becomes an incredible tale in which you can get to know the older characters that are usually only briefly mentioned in the LOTR series, or their histories aren't entirely given; like Galadriel, Elrond, Mithrandir (Gandalf), Morgoth, Sauron, even Shelob. Tolkien's style of writing is incredible and his stories should not be missed. If you REALLY loved the LOTR series (not the movies either, which are good too, but im talking about the BOOKS)then go on and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read many reviews here where many readers of 'The Silmarillion' (even those who claimed they enjoyed the book) commented that the first part was the most dull and boring. Strange it may seem then, it was the Music of the Ainur that hooked me up for several days even after I finished reading the book for the first time. The whole concept of God creating the holy beings, the Ainur, who sing the mighty Theme and who mould The World That Is through The Music when the Theme was given Vision, is a magnificent idea. It shows the philosophical depth of Tolkien's works. Take for instance what Iluvatar says to Melkor after he rebelled against The Theme:\\"Mighty are the Ainur, and mightiest among them is Melkor; but that he may know, and all the Ainur, that I am Iluvatar, those things that ye sung, I will show them forth, that ye may see what ye have done. And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.\\"If you had the patience to read this, you will notice that a refreshingly new concept of Good and Evil is implied here. Evil was not Melkor's own creation in truth. Melkor CANNOT obstruct the designs of Eru. No one can. Even when it appears so, Melkor and his forces of Evil are in fact executing the designs of God himself (though Melkor is unaware of this). Simply put: \\"God is Almighty. Both Good and Evil have their ultimate source in Him. These opposite forces exist for a reason that is beyond our ability to fully comprehend. God is executing his designs through the Valar, Maiar, Elves, Men, Hobbits, Dwarves and even Orcs. You will understand the true purpose of all this only when Good and Evil blends into One mighty Theme in The End.\\" The portrayal of Evil as disharmony in The Music and its ultimate fate to blend with rest into a harmonious whole is so beautiful. I do not know how many of my Christian friends will agree with this concept of Evil. But for a person who believe that all religions are the creations of mankind, this is Theology at its best.Now think about the War of the Jewels between the Noldor and Morgoth. Or the War of the Rings between Men and Sauron. It is'nt the plain (and distressingly common in our time!) Good versus Evil battle that we see here. There is a far deeper process at work though neither Frodo nor Gandalf nor Sauron know it. I only wish Tolkien had written a book exclusively about the Music of the Ainur.Another \\"shortcoming\\" that many pointed out was that it was too much like history, with little details. For events that span many thousand years, I'm not sure how you can describe them in any other way. In fact, this approach offers another distinct advantage in that it leaves a lot to the reader's imagination rather than stuffing ideas down his/her throat. This book was not meant to be a novel. It is like an account. A disjoined and incomplete account of ancient times. It is just as if you walk into an old library at Rivendell and bump into many stories and poems pertaining to the past Ages stacked in a corner. Or you were dreaming in Elrond's hall and you hear beautiful Elven songs or laments of long forgotten times. You do not even know if they are myths, legends or historical events. The book is as the title says: \\"The Myths and Legends of Middle-Earth\\". That's the beauty of it. It leaves a mysterious and haunting air even after the book is finished.You may even wonder after the end: \\"Is this a myth? Or did this really happen?\\"But I agree with many others that the book has one real shortcoming. It is too short. Far too short.In short, if \\"The Hobbit\\" is for the Hobbits among us and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is for the Mortal Men among us, then \\"The Silmarillion\\" is for the Elves among us. (I think it takes a lot of Elvish mindset to fully comprehend the book's beauty.) And for those among us who love the Elves (like Sam and of course, me), there is nothing like it. You will see that a Silvan Prince like Legolas is merely a toddler in front of the mighty Noldor Princes like Feanor and Fingolfin. I hope you get the idea of how the book would be. It is a beautiful, timeless classic.By the way, the character I really liked in \\"The Silmarillion\\" was the proud, mighty, arrogant son of Finwe, Feanor the Great!I really envy Tolkien. I do not have such a creative and imaginative mind. :-(If anybody want to communicate with me, my email ID is: s_n_ilyushin@rediffmail.com"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's hard to believe that only a year ago I became enthralled with Tolkien, LOTRs, and \\"The Hobbit\\" but alas, it is true. DH bought me this book as he grew weary of watching me read and reread my \\"Hobbit\\" and LOTR books. After viewing the movie \\"Two Towers\\", he realized that the year 2003 was going to be a long one until \\"Two Towers\\" Special Edition DVD comes out in NOVEMBER 2003 and the last LOTR \\"Return of the King\\" premieres the following month.I love this book and the illustrations. \\"The Silmarillion\\" contains murder, incest, cruel betrayal, the story of Beren and Luthien in detail, and more murder. The book explains Orcs, Dragons, Balrogs, the creation of Middle Earth, the Numenoreans, and the relationships between Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Pretty good info for the Tolkien junkie who simply can't get enough Middle Earth.At times the chapters are disjointed. Very difficult also to keep up with who's who and how the characters relate to one another. Thankfully the book contains a large Appendix to clear up some of the confusion with the names. \\"The Silmarillion\\" briefly touches upon Wizards but lacks the detail that I would have prefered.\\"The Silmarillion\\" totally removes the veil of perfection that shrouded the Elves in the LOTR books and movies. As always, Tolkien finely attunes the reader to the idea that absolute evil shows no mercy, never truly goes away, and is indiscrimimate in whom it affects. Ultimately, mankind is connected and humans must be vigilant and unite to suppress evil. Timely ideas in a period of great chaos and change.In conclusion, if you are a huge Tolkien fan then purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've heard many people say they envy those who are reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the first time, because the excitement of that first discovery is unique. That's how I feel about &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. I like LotR, but I love &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Every time I dip into it, I discover something new. It never loses its freshness.Do be aware that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is NOT &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. It reads more like the Old Testament, with stories that are fully described without being fully fleshed in the way a novel might treat them. It is the mythological underpinning of Middle-earth, and the style will not be to everyone's taste. You don't need a Masters in Education to appreciate it, mind you, but it remains a challenging read... and vastly rewarding. (The excerpt available here would not have been my first choice. It's from what is essentially the Silmarillion's Book of Genesis, to continue the comparison to the Old Testament. I'd judge it more daunting than the balance of the book, where the Elves and Men and Dwarves take center stage.) Anyone entranced by &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; would do well to read &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, which includes expanded portions of the stories of Tuor and of the Children of Hurin, as well as other short pieces that complement the mythology pre-dating LotR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There is life after The Lord of the Rings! I read the Lord of the Rings when I was 9 years old, and the series simply blew me away. Tolkien is the author that really got me involved in science fiction/fantasy, and I have never been dissapointed by any of his works. The Silmarillion offers the history of creation; basically, Tolkien retells Genesis in his own style-and what happened afterwards. I was astonished to see so much biblical reference within the web of the story (i.e.-Melkor=Lucifer, Manwe=Jesus Christ, ect.) but the wealth of the whole book lies beyond just theology and such. I'm a sophomore in highschool, and let me tell you-if our textbooks were written in the way the Silmarillion was, no student would ever fail History class again. Sure, the writing style might not be the easiest to read, but I personally think that the style is more preferable than that of, oh say, Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe. Seriously, if you can't get enough of Tolkien, READ THIS BOOK! It is definately worth it.Also, if you enjoy reading fantasy, but in an easier style than The Silmarillion is written in, try out Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series, Tad William's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, or George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice. They are the best that this generation of author's have to offer."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The publication of the Silmarillion was a labor of love by Christopher Tolkein, who was responding to JRR Tolkein's fans call for more tales from Middle Earth. His presentation of an edited prose version of his father's papers and notes gives us a coherent summary of the mythological foundation of Middle Earth and the basic conflict between the Children of Illuvitar and Evil. The style, a detached third person narrative, incorporates traditions from both the Christian Bible, the Norse epic poems, and more modern prose forms. It is useful to note that one of Tolkein's best serious works was his rendering of the Beowulf saga into English. His retelling of Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight also received critical praise when first published.For the modern fantasy reader, embracing &quot;The Silmarillion's&quot; style requires the same suspension of modern reality/disbelief required to enjoy fantasy novels. One should put oneself in the great hall of a King or chieftan, and imagine a skald, bard or travelling minstrel recounting the old stories and legends that tell the audience what shaped the world they live in. The MTV generation must remember that stories were once told where words painted pictures. Nowadays, the &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; model seems to be have taken the lead. A similar embracing of an author's style is required when reading Uncle Remus or Just So Stories, which use a particular voice to capture a time and condition with which we are not familiar in contemporary society.For non-Tolkein fans, The Silmarillion is best read after the Hobbit and the LORD of the Rings (both execllent stories), for they bring the world of Middle Earth to life. This book answers the question &quot;What gave Middle Earth its shape, character and fundamental conflicts?&quot; The explanation in an appendix of what elvish names mean is a nice bonus.A final note: a superb analysis of Tolkein's mythological derivations is presented in David Day's &quot;Tolkein's Ring.&quot; This book explores in depth the mythological models JRR Tolkein drew from in creating his own complex mythology for Western European peoples, and does so in a lucid, easily read prose style."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If it was fleshed out more, The Silmarillion would have been the greatest epic tale told, in the history of literature. Unfortunately for us, Tolkein never actually sat down and wrote it like he did with his other books. In the History of Middle Earth series you can find portions of it, like the endless attempts at The Tale of the Children of Hurin and The Escape from Bondage. Instead, Christopher Tolkein gave us the best that was available in a continuous form. It can be frustrating, and sometimes immensly dull (whatever you do, skip past the chapter on the geography of Belieriand). But it is worth it. In terms of sheer story, it is simply amazing. There are also some moments of great writing, but nothing like what is in Lord of the Rings. However, the trilogy just looks like an epilogue or an afterward compared with this volume. Oh, and whenever you start a chapter, be sure to finish it before you put the book down. Makes it a [heckuva] lot easier."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"When I first read the Hobbit and the Rings, I frequently came across references to events and characters that were all prior to the trilogy's time period. I felt more like I had dropped in on the middle of a movie and who then had to piece together the events to understand the story as a whole. I didn't do so well so I almost gave up hope on Tolkien. I decided to give him one last try and I delved into The Silmarillion and thank the Valar I did. I couldn't put it down. The beauty and sadness began with the first page. Tolkien's mind is absolutely colossal. It so cleared up who the elves were, the wizards, the Valar, the dark lords, etc. Most readers find The Silmarillion too difficult to follow but I never understood why. It had quite the opposite effect on me - it was the Rings that I couldn't follow the first time around. The Silmarillion was so chock full of history that it inspired me to go back and read The Hobbit through The Return Of The King all over again with much greater comprehension and appreciation for his work."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I really liked Lord of the Rings, it has been my favorite fantasy series. Unfortunately they ended way too soon for my tastes, as I did want to read more about this wonderful land that Tolkien created in LOTR. With the Silmarillion I got my chance to once again explore this world. And while I was a bit disappointed, because it didn't live up to all of my high expectations, I was also thrilled by this narration of the past of Middle Earth and the surrounding lands.A problem with the book is its rather uninteresting beginning. It starts out nicely, although its basically like Paradise Lost. Then it bogs down in the names of various gods and godessed which I had a hard time keeping track of (by this time its mixing Greek and Norse myths with the Christian theme). After this it rather picks up its pace and grows more interesting. The tales of the elves are strong and emotional, and are a mythology all their own.Unfortunately the book's second and major problem soon becomes apparent. The tales are not covered in depth enough. Instead of all these short and involving tales, I wish he had written several novels covering them in depth. For example, the tale of Beren and the Silmaril could easily have covered as much ground as LOTR, but it only receives 60 pages or so. I understand the problems, given that Tolkien was dead, but I think it could at least have been expanded to include more information on these stories.Other than that, this book is really good. Anyone who enjoys mythology will love this book as it provides beautiful yet melancholy pictures of a world decaying from grace. The only problem: I wish it were longer!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love the Lord Of the Rings and have read all four books multiple times, i have seen the movie, own several collectors editions, own the soundrack of the movie, 2 atlases of middle earth, and i have not grown tired of it yet. I picked up the Silmarillion hoping for another Lord Of The Rings, another epic novel. I was sorely disappointed. The Silmarillion is written by Tolkien, and edited by Tolkien. This is misleading J.R.R Tolkien &quot;wrote&quot; it in the sense that he had written it in bits and pieces, notes here and there. His son, Christopher Tolkien actually compiled it. It was like the appendix at the end of return of the king, thought very cool, nifty, informative, it lacked the story-telling ability of J.R.R Tolkien. It was a bunch of ideas, notes, albeit good ones. But that is all it is, it does not flow like the Lord Of The Rings does. If you are looking for a history of Middle Earth, something similar to the appendixes at the end of LOTR, you are in luck. If you seek another Lord Of The Rings, you will have no such luck."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the king's road to all of the lore alluded to in Lord of the Rings. Many of the songs of LOTR, especially, retell the mythology and history of Arda (the world), and it's too bad those songs aren't so great... they attempt to capture some immense, rich stories.This book isn't for all tastes. If you came away from LOTR yearning to learn more about the folklore, background, and language of the elves, this textbook is what you're looking for. But if you're looking for a good novel, look elsewhere. The elves, as in LOTR, seem more to be carved in stained glass than flesh and blood... but they are also portrayed as being far less perfect. I've knocked off one star because The Silmarillion didn't really have to be such a forbidding, scholarly volume. It could have been a children's book to knock the socks off of D'aullaire's Greek Myths or any book of stories from the Bible.The Silmarillion is where Tolkien and son showcase J.R.R.'s godlike gift for inventing an entirely different world, and seeing all of it with omniscient splendor. Thingol, Feanor, Beren, and Luthien are mythological heros every bit as much as Heracles and Theseus.You will spend a lot of time looking at the lineages in the back, and checking the index of names and especially places. But I for one came away from this with a full appreciation for the rich tapestry of Tolkien's invention, of which LOTR is only the most care-worn and tattered end. And I look forward to telling all of my friends the stories from the Silmarillion... I know they won't read it, but these stories must be told anyway."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The biggest, and really only, problem I had in reading this book is the depth of the language: I normally consider myself a pretty fast and educated reader, but while reading Silmarillion I lost track of how many times I would have to read a passage, then go back and re-read it repeatedly simply to get a basic understanding of it. It can be a tiring process and if you're into reading for a simple laid-back effort only, then this probably isn't a book for you. The beginning, which deals primarily with the myth of Middle Earth's creation and the Valar, also seems a bit slow until the focus of the tales switches to those of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men, but not unbearably so. If you can make it past that, you've got yourself a good pace going and therefore you should be able to make it more easily through the rest of the book.This is definitely no kids' book; as far as Tolkien books go it's completely on the opposite side of the language spectrum from the written-for-younger-audiences Hobbit. But if you can get past the heavy, often difficult to comprehend language-- which once you come to understand it, is quite beautiful-- the book's definitely worth the trouble. Aside from getting a more in-depth look at the backstory of things that were only briefly referenced in the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, the individual tales on their own are very good-- filled with adventure, romance, the ever-present struggle of good vs. evil, and of course a fair share of tragedy, all with an epic feel to them. Tolkien paints a beautiful picture in your head with each tale, and as much as I loved LoTR, there are definitely times I think the Silmarillion is a better book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For a true fan of the fantasy genre this is a must read. For those that call Middle Earth their second home, this is a great mythology that may become your Bible (only much better written!). From the Creation myth to the rebellion of the Noldor to the drowning of Numenor to the last ship setting sail from Mithlond, you will begin to see the extent of Tolkien's vast imagination and truely appreciate the world he has given us. From the making of the Silmarils and the glory of Valinor you will see the greatness of the Elves. From the Fall of the Noldor you will learn their sorrow. The Battle of Unnumbered Tears will show you the glory and the treachery of mortal man. You will learn the beginnings of the dwarves, the eagles, the ents, the orcs and much more. For those that find the hints to the Elder Days in The Lord of the Rings to be better left as hints, I say please do not read this book, because you will not like it. But for those that want to know more about the first and second ages and to perhaps learn the secret knowledge known by only Tolkien himself I recommend this book along with the twelve part History of Middle Earth series completed by his son Christopher."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The sheer scope of this book is staggering. The writing of this book is a feat unmatched in the known history of the world that any one man could create an entire mythology over his lifetime and mostly in secret! I was one of the few people who read The Silmarillion before reading either The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. As such, I was blown away, even more so than when I read the latter books, by how grand this story is. It is a dark and somber tale that doesn't revel in trite victories against the forces of darkness like Lord of the Rings. Rather, it is a tragic tale of endurance in the face of unyielding evil. The Silmarillion is much longer and challenging to read than The Lord of the Rings. However, for those who persevere throughout the many thousands of characters and lengthy history of Middle Earth, a jewel of a book is to be found. I would recommend The Silmarillion for all true J.R.R. Tolkien fans and fans of mythology as well.

I loved it so much that I immediately went out after school and bought The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings. When I reached High School, of course being cool was more important than \\"Supposed\\" nerdy things, like reading Tolkien books. Several years ago, when the hype for The Lord of the Rings movies started, I picked up my old LOTR's book and read it again. I quickly fell in love as I did years earlier. A year ago, I purchased The Silmarillion from this exact site. I read it and soon realized that it is an even better read than The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Not that those books aren't great by any means, b/c they are. They were the books that originally got me into Tolkien lore. But I have come to realize that The Silmarillion is better b/c it gets you involved in the history of Middle-Earth. You start at the beginning with the creation of Middle-Earth and learn about all its wonders. Since the movies came out, I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings once a year since then, and I am now doing the same with The Silmarillion. The Sillmarillion is a fantastic book, and I would recommend it to any huge Tolkien fan, but not just a casual reader, as it is easy to get lost in the stories without some knowledge of the Tolkien universe. I would suggest though, that you read it before The Hobbit, and The LOTR's. By doing that, you'll come to understand more about the back stories that characters are talking about in the books. At first the Sillmarillion may be a little hard to follow, but I found the Glossary in the back of the book to be very helpful. I flipped back to it everytime I had a question, or forgot something about a character or event. This book is definitely one of Tolkien's best in my eyes, even though it was his son that pieced it together from notes and short stories. Christopher Tolkien did a very commendable job continuing his father's legacy. Don't be afraid to give this book a shot. Any Tolkien fan will find it very rewarding. And for the price, it is very worth it to spend a few hours of your life just to read it once."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"...you can make it through this. And you'll find it's well worth it. Yes, the first two hundred pages read like your first childhood attempts to read the Bible, what with the \\"Eldemere begat So-and-so\\" and such, but if you can make it through that... you're golden. The first few hundred pages provide a condensed history of Middle-Earth and the surrounding regions, with the highlight being Melkor and Ungoliant's betrayal of the Elves, the spread of Elven culture, and the arrival of Men. If you're willing to brave the slow times, you'll be rewarded with adventure in spades. Remember when Aragorn sings in the Fellowship of the Rings movie? His songs will have a lot more meaning after reading this book. And the tales of the Silmarils themselves are well worth the time-consuming price of admission. If you've got any attention span at all, I highly encourage you to read this book. If you made it through the Fellowship of the Rings book, with its lengthy introduction and six hundred pages of Frodo hemming and hawing over whether or not he should stop for sixth breakfast one more time before heading out of the Shire, you can certainly make it through the lineage of the Elves. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"IMO, this is the best book by Tolkien. He spent his whole life writing it (he started when he was young and never finished it), and that's probably why it's so good. Some people (like my parents) say it's boring as hell, and yes, it is in some places, but I think it's very gripping in others. I am of course, a hardcore Tolkien fan, and I'm more into Tolkien than others, but really. Read it! At least give it a try! And if you got far enough (100 pages or so) and you suddenly got bored, just bear with it, it'll get better...Of course, if you're no Tolkien fan at all, then don't buy this, but if you are, IMO it's even better than lotr itself!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarilion's style is in the great tradition of the Greek epics and the Bible. If you like Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings but are still unsure if the Silmarilion is for you, I suggest you read some of Appendix A in the Lord of the Rings which is closely related to the Silmarilion.In reading the Silmarilion I was amazed how Tolkien has created a complete mythology from the beginning of time through thousands of years. The tension of the story is the classic struggle between good and evil. It is more interesting due to the evil characters being almost as well described as the heroic ones. The struggle of the characters in dealing with a very troubled world is very real. These are people of passion who run the gamut of heroism to greed and envy. There is nobility and pure evil.As usual Tolkien's writing is filled with wonderful detail and invention. The depth of his descriptions are amazing. The only question is if you can adjust to the epic style of this book. If you can, then you can look forward to a journey into an amazing world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm a long time Tolkien fan, and yes that means before the movies came out. If you are reading the Simarillion, then you are most likely a Tolkien fan as well. I'm personally always captivated by the amount of detail Tolkien goes into. We all know that he is wordy, (or better we should call it abundantly descriptive), but that is part of the joy of this book and the rest of Tolkien's works. The Simarillion will give you your first glimpse into the ancestry of the people of Middle Earth. You begin to learn the histories, the tales, the languages, the dialects, the joys, the losses of all the races. some of the questions you had from the Trilogy, will be answered. Just like the rest of his books, it's a wonderful ride and I hope you truly enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion may be the most difficult book I've ever read, and likewise the most difficult review I've ever written. It's incredibly dense and filled with so much information and so many stories that a proper review would be quite long. In essence, it would be like reviewing the Bible, to which The Silmarillion is often compared, and that would certainly be no easy task. Nevertheless, I have tried, and this is the result.I imagine any reader of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit would be somewhat familiar with The Silmarillion. This book, written as a collection of myths and legends, is epic in its scope, spanning from the creation story to the end of the Third Age (i.e., after Frodo destroys the Ring). The Tengwar inscription inside gives the best description of the book that I've read.\\"The tales of the First Age when Morgoth dwelt in Middle-earth and the Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of N&uacute;menor and the history of the Rings of Power and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end.\\"That sentence contains so much in its simplicity that it's almost deceiving. It demands questions. Who's Morgoth? What are the Silmarils? Ooh, what else can I learn about the Rings of Power? And what the heck is Tengwar? While The Lord of the Rings may hint at some of these things, the answers can only be found in The Silmarillion.So what is The Silmarillion? It's essentially the bible of Middle-earth and all of Arda. It's Tolkien's legendarium, his masterpiece and life's work. It's a history book of things forgotten by many, and cherished by others.After I read LOTR in 8th grade, and then The Hobbit, I got The Silmarillion. I tried to read it, but I've never been much of a fan of history, and this just lacked the beauty Tolkien's other works had, so I sat it aside, intending to give it another chance some time later. After a decade of waiting, the time finally arrived.This time through it didn't seem as much as a history book as I remembered. Sure, it was dry from time to time, but for the most part I rather enjoyed the read. For one, it felt like reading a book on some other culture's myths, and I suppose this is actually what I was doing. Also, some of these stories are so breathtaking and tragic that it's hard not to get pulled into the tales. Yes, The Silmarillion may seem like a history book, and it is, in some ways, but it is also so much more.The entire volume is essentially one long story arc, but it is broken up into several different parts. In the beginning, after Il&uacute;vatar has created the Ainur, one of his creations rebels and seeks his own song. It is this, the rebellion of Melkor, also called Morgoth, that has led to the ills of the world (Arda) and the problems that follow the creation. Time and time again different heroes rise up to oppose Melkor and his followers, and this is what The Silmarillion consists of, hero stories. Stories with characters you want to root for, despite their long odds. Stories with villains so dastardly that you pray for justice.These tales are fascinating. Tolkien's mythology is humongous, and each story has the epic feel associated with things like The Odyssey or The Iliad. Yet, as Tolkien writes in The Fellowship of the Ring, the tales are all fair, \\"though [they are] sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth...\\" Indeed, there are a few silver linings throughout The Silmarillion, but mostly everything is heavy and tragic. This certainly does not limit the enjoyment of the book, however, as we already know how it ends 'ere we start (provided some simple deduction).One distinct difference between this work and Tolkien's others is that The Silmarillion tends to lack the overly-wordy description that is famous throughout the LOTR. Here we get some description, but nothing like the adjective-heavy words commonly associated with Tolkien. There still seems to be some extraneous information, but this was no problem really.The hardest thing about reading The Silmarillion is the gigantic cast of characters. Not only are there numerous people named, but so are the lands and rings and swords and whatever else Tolkien fancied Proper Nouning. (Can I do that? Use \\"noun\\" as a verb?) Add the fact that there are many different languages in Arda, and you may get one character with three different names, if not more. For that reason, I occasionally got lost trying to recall who was who and who's son someone came from and the proper lineage and blah blah. If I read this again, I think I may keep a notebook handy for side notes.The Silmarillion is a beautiful book that I regret took me so long to finally crack open. I think I had some preconceptions about how the historical writing would pan out--that I would be bored and not enjoy the read--but I was wrong. J.R.R. Tolkien is a master at what he does, and it's evident that the time and love he put into this book took many years. It's sad that the man didn't live long enough to see his life's work published, but at least the book hit publication.Overall, for anyone that read and enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, it's a no brainer. The Silmarillion is a must read if you're interested in any of the background of Middle-earth, especially Elven history. On the other hand, I would also recommend this book to anyone with a strong interest in mythology. Tolkien borrowed from Norse and German mythology, and lovers of these legends may enjoy The Silmarillion as well. In the end, The Silmarillion is not a light book, and perusing would be difficult, but the reader will find excitement and tragedy within its pages."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This work is not a straight-forward novel. Think of it more as a cross-reference guide to all the hints and references made in the Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings books. This is a collection of short stories and novellas that give depth and meaning to the rest of Tolkien's universe. The Ainulindale, the intro, is the story of the mythical creation of Tolkien's universe, and the setting of the board of the battle between good and evil. The Valaquenta deals mainly with the Elves, and their struggles with Morgoth, the first and by far greatest Dark Lord, of whom Sauron was only an emissary. Some beautiful tales are told here, notably for me, the story of Beren and Luthien, the doomed lovers mentioned several times in the Lord of the Rings. This tale held special private meaning for Tolkien himself, as he called himself Beren, and his dear wife Luthien. The Akallabeth follows, and gives a quick rundown of the Men of Numenore and their time on Elenna, the Land of Gift, to its destruction at the hands of the Valar. Several genealogies are given, along with pronunciation guides, an index of names, and an appendix on Quenya and Sindarin, the elvish languages spoken in parts during The Lord of the Rings. As a base guide to Tolkien's world, this book is indispensible. Such care and work went into this, it's amazing. There is no real flow to the entire book, only that of a history book, with the flow of time throughout evident. Tolkien began this book well before either the Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings, and he continued to edit and rewrite till his death. This is a must-have for any Tolkien fan, and as an avid reader, I can only sit and be amazed at the labor of love and imagination this represents."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It is inconceivable that anyone writing in the 20th century couldimagine the Beginning of the World in language equal to the KingJames Bible or the original Hebrew authors, but J.R. R. Tolkienhas done just that. The audio CD by Martin Shaw is magnificent -profound and moving. Others have written about the content of the Silmarillion... the great battle between Good and Evil; Beauty and Darkness. But something is lost if the poetry is not heard orally. Martin Shaw's version is thrilling, like listening to the CREATION read by the best actors in the land.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's more than slightly staggering to consider: the epic fantasy \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to be the tail end of Tolkien's invented history. The \\"Bible\\" of Middle-Earth, the \\"Silmarillion\\" stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the creation of the many Rings of Power -- and the One Ring of Sauron; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; fans of Hobbits or Dwarves will not find as much here. It will also answer some questions that \\"Hobbit\\" and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made -- what is Numenor? Who are the Valar? This includes those things, and much more.The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It's more formal and archaic in tone; Tolkien did not get as \\"into\\" the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.It's clear to see, while reading this, the extent of Tolkien's passion for his invented history. Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened. In a genre clogged with shallow sword'n'sorcery, Tolkien's coherent, carefully-written backstory is truly unique.If you can take the formal prose and mythical style, this is a treasure, and a must-read for anyone who loved LOTR or \\"Hobbit.\\" Only after reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" can readers truly appreciate Tolkien's literary accomplishments, and the full scope of the Middle-Earth that is glimpsed in his more famous books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you love J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &amp; &quot;The Lord Of The Rings,&quot; then you absolutely MUST read &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; This book is the Middle-Earth bible, telling the stories of the First Age of Tolkien's mystical land, including the history of the Elves, long before Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf &amp; company came along at the end of the Third Age. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; tells of the creation of the world, followed by the story of the Silmarills, three magic jewels of power that are stolen by the evil lord Morgoth, who was Sauron's predecessor and master, and the attempts by the Elves (and certain Men) to retrieve them. This is then briefly followed by a plot synopsis for &quot;The Lord Of The Rings,&quot; so &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; really does contain all of Middle-Earth's history in a single volume. Also, quite happily, three characters from &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; play major roles here: the evil Sauron, and the high-esteemed Elves Elrond and Galadriel, and it's quite fascinating to read how they all got their starts. Written off &amp; on during his lifetime, but left unedited into a final form at the time of his death, Tolkien's son Christopher bravely took up the task of editing his father's unpublished work into a finished book, and he did an excellent job. Admittedly, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is a very challenging read---no Hobbits anywhere, and LOTS of names of people &amp; places scattered all over, many of them similar-sounding (Turin son of Hurin, Elros brother of Elrond, etc., etc.), which can cause confusion for the reader at first and was one of the reasons why Tolkien was reluctant to have the work published. Fortunately, the book comes with a glossary of all these names and who's who, how to pronounce them, as well as maps of the various lands. But more than that, the book is wonderfully written, containing many great stories of drama &amp; adventure as only Tolkien could write them (a great highlight for me is the story of Beren and Luthien, a marvelous love story AND adventure rolled into one, but there are many other examples).Thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is essential reading for any Tolkien fan who wants to know how all of Middle-Earth began, and what the backstory and history is to the saga of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &amp; &quot;The Lord Of The Rings.&quot; A marvelous book, and highly recommended to the Tolkien enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Martin Shaw is wonderful in this audio version of The Silmarillion. He has a rich voice, and does an excellent job performing the different characters, and changing his tone when warranted. He clearly researched The Silmarillion before performing it; the pronunciations are correct, and the gravity of the book is maintained. If you've never read The Silmarillion, this is a good way to start, and if you're a fan, you should enjoy this version."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The beauty of Tolkien's world, especially that of his elves, surpasses anything I've encountered in fiction. I was surprised to enjoy this more than I did The Lord of the Rings. The lives of Tolkien's elves will leave you breathless. This is, in my mind, the definitive &quot;fantasy&quot; book. LOTR succeeds brilliantly in building the world of men on top of this foundation, but if you want your fantasy pure, this is the ultimate."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are many people who have reviewed the Silmarillion and have given it five stars, calling it one of the best stories ever, and there are people who have given it one star, calling it the most difficult, boring book ever assembled. Neither are right and neither are wrong. Before you either go to read it expecting a masterpiece or discard it as another overrated cult book, let me explain who the Silmarillion is for.The Silmarillion is a book made for readers with a peculiar taste. Not that they have more taste than other people, or that they're more intelligent or philosophically endowed than other people, simply that it is only for people who enjoy the style of prose Tolkien used to craft his masterpiece. Just as one person adores spinach and the other despises it, so the Silmarillion can be equally distasteful or succulent in the hands of the right reader. Is the prose slow, dry, and boring? Well yes. But at the same time it is profound, epic, and exciting. Its style is that of an ancient mode, easily comparable to the Illiad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid (though, as hard as the Silmarillion is to read, the Aeneid still stands as the worst story ever as far as readability goes). It is one man's attempt to create thousands of years of myth for his country in the span of his own lifetime.As such, only a few people will enjoy this book. It is for fans of Tolkien, because it is hard for me to imagine anyone reading it without at first loving Tolkien's works to some degree. But it is not for all Tolkien fans. It is not exclusively for those who are deeply devoted readers, because even many of them cannot enjoy that style of writing. The first time I read it, I was around the ages of 12-13 and I couldn't get past the first 50 pages. I have since read it six times and will continue to do so lovingly now that I've developed the taste that I have. Now that I've read it, I've found it to be the greatest of Tolkien's stories in its epic proportion, its prose, and its themes.I suggest that every Tolkien fan at least attempt to read the Silmarillion. If you are enjoying it by the end of the chapter entitled \\"Of the Darkening of Valinor,\\" then continue reading! I guarantee it is a worthy experience. If, however, by the end of that chapter you still find yourself agonizing over every minute of it, then put it down and let it go. But please do not condemn it. It is simply a book that isn't your taste."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For those who have gobbled up Tolkien's novel \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" and are wondering where to look next, this is the obvious first choice. However, the buyer should be cautioned: this is not a \\"novel\\" in the way that Tolkien's other two books are. Rather, it is more like an extension of the appendices at the end of \\"The Return of the King.\\" If you were bored by those appendices, you probably are not so interested in the pre-history of Middle Earth and maybe you do not want to buy this book. You could turn elsewhere to \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\" instead. However, if you loved all that pre-history, then this book is for you and will open your eyes further to the incredible world and mythology Tolkien created.As to this edition: I would recommend it over the others. It is slightly large and therefore easier to handle than standard trade paperbacks (most of which are too small for my taste), with good thick paper (slightly beige - not that awful shiny white stuff), well bound with an appealing cover and good taste. You will like having this book lying around. Also, it is part of a series edited by Christopher Tolkien, so if you end up buying the other books in the series (I hear they are quite good), then you'll want matching editions. So, it may be worth paying a bit more for this one.What do you get? Well, first you get a story about the creation of Middle Earth, which for the first time clearly lays out the religious underpinnings of Tolkien's mythology. The One God, Eru, and his angels (the Valar) are hanging out. Eru gives them a song to sing, and they sing it, but one bad angel (a Satan-figure) rebels and starts singing his own tune, creating dissonance. Some angels follow him, and soon the song is cacophanous. Eru introduces a new melody, but the bad angels rebel again. Finally Eru says \\"Stop!\\" and it all ends. He then says: \\"What you have sung, you will now see created\\" (I'm paraphrasing horribly), and their song becomes Middle Earth -- the forces of good and evil, etc. Amazing concept.We then get a long narrative about how the Valar came down to Middle Earth, how the first-born (Elves) were created, then the dwarves and Men. How Sauron came out; who the Numenoreans were; what \\"O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!\\" refers to; how Galadriel got to Middle Earth; how Sauron became evil; why the elves go off to the Blessed Realm; how the rings of power were made; etc. If you've wondered about all these questions - the answers are all here (or most of them, anyway). Apart from the opening story about creation, the writing is not easy; it is dense and not very story-like at times. Often it feels like a poorly written history book. But if you survived (and liked) \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", then no doubt you can handle Tolkien's writing and you'll be fine (Believe me - I think he writes beautifully at times, but not always in this book!)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For years I've tried to read The Silmarillion and failed. Oh sure I would read sections dealing with Balrogs, Galadriel, the Istari, Sauron, and the like but as many who've read this book know, it's hard to read. Therefor may I suggest to those of you who want to know what lies within The Silmarillion but have a hard time reading it, GET THIS UNABRIDGED AUDIO VERSION!Martin Shaw reads this book and he does an outstanding job! Not only does he have an excellent reading voice, but his narrating style flows so well that Tolkien's work springs to life within the mind's eye! Of course anyone who can breeze through all of the elvish and drarfish names as easily as Martin does deserves some praise! Whether you get this on CD or cassette, you can't go wrong with this reading of The Silmarillion!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"When I first started reading this book, I had already read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I was really curious about the references that were made about the glorious battles and heroic deeds that were 'history' when mentioned in the Lord of the Rings. Well, I found everything I ever wanted to know about Middle Earth's history in The Silmarillion. The book gives an account of the creation of Middle Earth, and all the history that happened in the first, second, and the third age. The Silmarillion really helped me understand the Lord of the Rings A LOT better, and now that I've re-read the Lord of the Rings, the story seems a lot richer to me because I know the history behind it. The book starts out a little slow because it has to first explain the creation of Middle Earth and how the elves, dwarves, and man came into existence. But after you stick with the book for the first part, the book becomes soooo interesting and I just couldn't put it down! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy read because 90% of the book is told like an account of history that you would find in a textbook and there isn't very much dialogue like there was in Tolkien's other works. But the stories are so rich with emotion and tragedy that it makes it truly a wonderful book! If you've ever wondered what those poems and songs that are in The Lord of the Rings are about, this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It would be absurd for me to feel I could \\"review\\" this monumental achievement. For people not familiar with The Silmarillion, and only familiar with \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" it is worth mentioning a few things though. This book will not take you on a journey, from cover to cover, like Lord of the Rings does. There ARE chapters that are JUST as exciting and story-like though...If not more so. There are also appropriate chapters of long lineage lists and explanations that are textbook-like. What this book does do is brings you into Tolkien's world in a way that is profoundly detailed. It's a dream for a person who LOVED Lord of the Rings, and feels unsatisfied with the details in that story. Who were the Elves? Where are they going? Where did they come from? What is all this 2nd and 3rd age stuff? What are Men and Dwarves? Why was Galadriel so honored, and what makes her different from an elf like Legolas? What WAS that ring on Aragorn's finger? In the extended version of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring, Legolas mentions \\"Morgoth\\" in front of Galadriel. Who was that? What WAS Gandalf? Who was Saruman, and what was all that tension about? Where does Elrond fit into the big picture? How did the earlier relatives of the Elves influence the 3rd age, and where are they? What is a Balrog? What do Balrogs and Gandalf actually have in common?These are questions that are DEEPLY answered in The Silmarillion. There are heroes in The Silmarillion that, dare I say, make our heroes in The Fellowship pale in comparison. There are most definitely wars and war scenes in The Silmarillion that even MORE accurately reflect Tolkien's horrific experiences in the trenches of World War I.Obviously, I highly recommend this book. It is more of a \\"study,\\" than a \\"read.\\" But in this day and age, where we are hit with easily digestible entertainment, if you are a Lord of the Rings fan, look at this book as a mental exercise in enjoyment and mind focus. My dear friend, Eileen in Ireland, once asked me, \\"Why do you put so much time into learning a history that did not exist?\\" I had contemplated this myself. I even asked myself, \\"She's right, why am I not learning French instead of studying The Silmarillion?\\" The simple answer is that this book is empowering, and I like it. If you love myth and believe in the \\"power of myth,\\" this book is at the top of the mountain."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien spent a good portion of his life writing the stories that went into this book, and the level of detail in them is apparent. A warning to anyone who thinks that this book will be along the lines of The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings books - BEWARE. This is a collection of stories compiled by Tolkien's son, and there is no smooth progression through the book. Each \\"Chapter\\" is its own story, start to finish. Also, unless you have a photographic memory, the number of names given in each story is mind blowing. Many of the characters have 2 or 3 names each, depending on the language of the land, and some decide to change their own names halfway through the event being described. A worthwhile read for the backstory to LOTR, but a time consuming book to wade through."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Honestly I first became aware of LoTR after my friend drug me to the theatrical release, but the next day I went to Waldenbooks and picked up the Red Book. Immediately after I wanted to know ALL the backround and I ordered this book along with re-reading the Hobbit (as virtually everybody reads it in elementary school), and acquiring some of the other pieces of Tolkien's work such as Unfinished Tales, The History of Middle-earth and Tales From the Perilous Realm. Above all these, if you're interested in understanding a little more about Middle-earth and its inhabitants, The Silmarillion is definently the place to start.Beginning with its own creation myth taken from several cultures, The Silmarillion describes for the LOTR fan the exact lineage of Aragorn, the mysterious appearance of Stoors (Gollum) and Hobbits, the war and strife of Gondor's past, and the terrific stories of ancient Beleriand; the land to the west of Middle-earth destroyed in an enormous clash of titans. If you're looking for myriad stories of heroes and legends, or simply backround information on how Middle-earth came to be, The Silmarillion is a fantastic read that'll do the job."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This six-star review assumes that you have read The Lord of the Rings. If you haven't, go do that first, and then come back here.Tolkien thought of the Silmarillion as his life's great work. He was right. Even though we have it only in a partial, posthumous form, he was right. Reading it is a very different kind of adventure from reading The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. What is the difference? In Tolkien's own terms, both of those books are taken from the Red Book of Westmarch, which was written by hobbits. Like hobbits, their books were chatty, immediate, easy to get to know, \\"hasty.\\" The works in the Silmarillion, in contrast, are taken from the epic literature of the High Elves. Like genuine epic literature the world over before the novel was invented, the Silmarillion is telegraphic, panoramic, and (though only on a first reading, and only to a modern ear) loftily impersonal. And never hasty. To get the proper good of it, it should be read slowly, no faster than the pace of a singing bard.Most modern readers find Malory's Morte D'Arthur almost impossible to read. That's not because it isn't a great, immortal story. It's because the habit of reading novels has coddled us, so that we want to be shown everything, rather than use our own imaginations to fill in the details in the huge canvas of story that Malory (or in the present case Tolkien) has constructed for us. The epics must be read actively to extract their gold. The Silmarillion, in this regard, is actually much more readable than Tolkien's premodern models, and I don't want to overstate its difficulty. It would be impossible to overstate its rewards.What's difficult about the Silmarillion isn't that it's boring; it's that so very much happens in it. It relates primarily the history of the First Age of Middle Earth (the Silmarillion proper). But it begins with an account of the creation of the world (the most dense and difficult part; just take it slow and easy and keep plowing forward, the going gets smoother), and it also tells about the second age (when Aragorn's line was founded), and the third. The entire three volumes of the Lord of the Rings get summarized in only five pages of this book. It is chock full of other stories that are just as worthy of expansion to their own thousand pages: all you have to add is imagination.It's true that Tolkien was not a very great, perhaps not even a very good, writer. But his world has taken up deep residence in the minds and hearts of millions of people, because he was the twentieth century's greatest co-creator. The Lord of the Rings has thousands of imitators, but no equals. What did it have that they don't have? Samwise could have told us: \\"It's elves, sir.\\" JRRT's epic novel showed the requisite triumph of good over massive evil, but from the beginning what held the reader was not the clash of battle or the exhilaration of victory, but the elegaic sense of a magical world doomed to pass away.That elegaic magical sense belongs to the elves. What the Silmarillion does is to unfold in its full depth the source of the elven melancholy: the sorrow brought on by immortality, which is after all a kind of irreversibility. It's not too much of a spoiler to observe that the Silmarillion begins with a disastrous oath, and that it is the deathlessness of the elves which ensures the oath's curse will be deathless. If you were moved by the partings at the Grey Havens in Lord of the Rings, then the story of the ages-long unfolding of Feanor's oath will tear at your heart, and its intertwining with the jewel-perfect romance of Beren and Tinuviel will break it.The same immortality theme is deepened and freighted with irony in the Akallabeth, the tragedy of the Second Age, in which Morgoth persuades the men of Numenor that human mortality is an injustice, rather than the gift the elves know it to be. Tolkien has single-handedly fashioned a vast tragic cycle as full of meaning and potential as the ones he knew from Greek and Nordic mythology. The elves' world is every bit as doom-haunted as the Norse, but as a devout Roman Catholic Tolkien deliberately left an uninhabited open space, nestled within the mystery of human mortality, inside which a thread of unspoken hope barely glistens. Its glow secretly alters the coloring of Middle Earth's twilight, and makes the Silmarillion unique among all the world's epic literature.Go ahead, read it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;At that time Beren and Luthien yet dwelt in Tol Galen, the Green Isle, in the river Adurant, southernmost of the streams that falling from Ered Lindon flowed down to join with Gelion; and their son Dior Eluchil had a wife Nimloth, kinswoman of Celeborn, prince of Doriath, who was wedded to the Lady Galadriel.&quot;Congratulations! You have just completed a typical sentence from The Silmarillion (p. 290). This hefty book sums up most of the history of Middle-Earth, from before its creation until somewhat after the War of the Rings (skipping the part told in The Lord of the Rings).Now, you can imagine that with so much material to cover, it can't afford all the vivid descriptions, poetry, and dialogue featured in Tolkien's other works. The result is pure, distilled Middle-Earth history. If you imagine The Hobbit as the soft drink of Tolkien, and The Lord of the Rings as maybe the wine, this is the hard liquor.It isn't an easy read. You'll come across the names of so many people and places that it's impossible to remember them all. Even the map isn't too helpful, since the Valar fight several wars in which the entire planet is totally rearranged. However, if you take this in stride, skip over unfamiliar names, and use your imagination where description is lacking, it is well worth it.You'll find the sweet story of Beren and Luthien, two lovers forbidden to marry until Beren completes an impossible quest, epic battles, such as Fingolfin the elf-king fighting the Dark Lord Morgoth, and countless others. My favorite is the poignent, tragic story of Turin Turambar.In short, don't put it down in the first 100 pages. You would regret it!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I used to think that this book was only for people obsessed with LOTR, but I finally got my hands on a copy. It was slow going at first because it goes through the whole creation and mythology, but I kept at it and soon found myself absorbed in the struggles of the elves against themselves and Morgoth. What I loved most about this book is the background it gives for LOTR. Having read this, everything else makes so much sense! For example, Galadriel's starlight vial holds new meaning and the relationship between elves, men, and dwarves all comes clear. This is a must read!!! The illustrated hardcover edition is especially nice because it has a gorgeous colored map inside the cover that doesn't require unfolding! Get this book! You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a epic tale of the first three ages of Middle Earth, before the domination of men. It lays the groundwork for the Lord of the Rings trilogy with an intricate series of tales of love, betrayal, and magic. Chief among these stories is the rise and fall of Melkor and curse of the Silmarils, the priceless jewels that cause nothing but woe to all who wish to possess them. However, the most memorable story is probably the love story of Beren and Luthian, in which love tries to conquer insurmountable odds to survive.The CD version is an excellent way to become acquainted with the Silmarillion. The Silmarillion is not an easy book to read; the prose is sometimes terse, the names of characters confusing, and the story occasionally at odds with itself. The narrator, Martin Shaw, does an admirable job pronouncing all of the names of beings and places consistently.If you you've enjoyed the other Tolkien tales, and craved more about the worlds hinted about in the songs of their heros, the Silmarillion is the place to begin. If you've already read the Silmarillion, and want another approach, the CD version is a viable option."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is, in a single word, a masterpiece. J.R.R. Tolkien writes a mythic and epic story in a very poetic form that is polished lovingly until it glistens. Credit should also be given to Christopher Tolkien for his masterful compilation of his father's notes. This book illuminates some of the great mysteries remaining from the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, describing the early history of Middle-Earth and the people that lived there from the creation of the world to the end of the Third Age. The poignant thing about this book is the feelings of sadness and regret that permeate the later parts of it, a feeling that the world is in an inescapable state of decline without hope of redemption. This book, far from being a let-down, however, actually uplifts the reader, giving one a feeling of being part of an adventure as old as time. This is an amazing book and a wonderful story, and one that everyone that still believes in a bit of magic should read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was made from notes J R R Tolkien wrote before he penned the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings.

This book is a diamond in a tar pit & you should get through the tar to enjoy the last two thirds which is gem. Don't skip the beginning chapters. The things that are legend in LOTR & the things revered are alive in The Silmarillion it is far wider in scope than LOTR but of course lacks the detail of LOTR. Push through the first chapters!! 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a stunningly beautiful classic edition of the pre-quel to the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. It was written over a period of about fifty years by J. R. R. Tolkien and really never finished. This book lays out the foundation of the world as Tolkien visualized it. It's the story of how the jewels were created, how the world worked. In this edition, it is a beautiful book, complete with 48 beautiful paints made by Ted Nasmith, many of which are included for the first time.Along with the Quenta Silmarillion itself are several short pieces that extend and expand the world. One of these is a lengthy letter written by Tolkein in which he explains his vision in his own words. Here an overview of the world as he saw it, as he wanted it published. The four short pieces Ainulindale, Valaquenta, Akallabeth and Of the Rings of Power complete the work. Here are all the rich Tolkein words that describe his dream, his world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After having read lots of stuff (fantasy and not), I think The Silmarillion to be the best book of the genre and probably one of the best works in literature history. The overall feeling is ephos and drama, no dialogues, no characterization, no plot. This is not a novel, this a cronicle of a world and its history. Moreover, two languages have been designed completely and sounds realer than ever. Read it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There is no question that the Silmarillion is the best of Tolkien's works. It, as was mentioned in a previous review, is the quintessential Tolkien work. This was his lifelong dream; these were his real stories. For those of you who do not like the Silmarillion, that is understandable. It is not of the same style as the LoTR and the Hobbit. It was never meant to be; it is not a story of a &quot;fellowship&quot; but rather a story of the history of the world.This book deserves to be read by every Tolkien fan. I commend Christopher Tolkien for assembling and publishing his father's works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is one of the most wonderfully written fantasies ever.I suggest that everyone reads this incisive book because it delves deeply into the problems of greed and lust and how they can affect the future. An example of this in the book was when the Noldor made an oath to regain the Silmarils. It destroyed their people with lies and deception. It also tells of Men's part in the evil plan Morgoth and his evil servants had. It shows that through deceit,lies, and death beauty and light can still prevail against darkness in any form. I loved this book because it is fantasy filled yet relates to life today in many ways."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is simply great. It is Tolkien's genius and imagination put on paper. It is the equivalent of an epic and a mythology, at the same time moving, tragic, enchanting, beautiful and grandiose (I especially love the tales about &quot;the Darkening of Valinor&quot;, &quot;the Flight of the Noldor&quot;, &quot;the Ruin of Beleriand&quot;, &quot;the voyage of Earendil and the War of Wrath&quot;, and &quot;Akallabeth&quot;). Besides from being a great work on its own, the Silmarillion is very informative about the entire history of Middle-Earth, starting from the creation of Arda to the departure of elves from Middle-Earth at the end of the Third Age. We learn, in the Silmarillion, of a world torn between the conflict of good and evil since its creation, of a world where the distinction between good an evil sometimes becomes diffuse and ambiguous (for example, on which &quot;camp&quot; would you place Feanor and his sons?), and of a world where suffering and tragedy never seem to be absent for long. Anyone who wishes to know more about Middle-Earth should absolutely read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is an excellent, excellent read - though probably not for those with limited attention spans. I find that you must read it at least twice through to begin to grasp the larger picture, and the more times thereafter the better it gets. It is also an excellent companion read to The Lord of the Rings. Though not an epic in the same sense as LotR, it is a complete work in its own right and a detailed and interesting history of the elder days of Middle Earth. It is also a must-read for the LotR fan in that it goes into depth about the origins and history of the Elves, which is scarcely covered in LotR, but is fascinating in its own right. Definitely to be read again and again. I only wish that Tolkien had been able to do more towards finishing The Silmarillion as a complete and cohesive work before his death."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are a few people who have said that they found Tolkien's writing style too hard to get through in 'The Silmarillion', but I reckon they've kind of missed the point. Certainly it is difficult, because Tolkien uses a lot of archaisms in his writing style. This was done to give an effect of history and antiquity to the stories, because, after all, Tolkien was writing it as a history, and the style he used had to echo this (and if you don't believe me, check out Geoffrey of Monmouth's 'History of the Kings of Britain' to see the blueprint style). I think it's a shame that this book suffers criticism for its writing style, as, once the difficulties of style are overcome, the book really does reward the errant reader with some cracking stories, such as 'Turin Turambar' and 'The Fall of Numenor', to name a few. All in all, once I got into it, I loved it. So, my advice is to persevere with it; it does get much better. Ohh yes. Much, MUCH, better."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Of all of the works of fantasy, there are some that are stood up as masterpieces. The Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Sword of Truth, and of course, The Lord of the Rings.But the Silmarillion cannot be compared to any of these others. It is not a fantasy book like any other. The Silmarillion is a narrative. It is the best of Tolkien's work because it is truly told in his words, as he recounts the history of the first age.But there is more than that. However outstanding or wonderful the Lord of the Rings is, there is simply nothing in it that is as powerful as the last stand of Hurin Thalion, or the love of Beren and Luthien.The Silmarillion is undoubtebly the finest novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have both read the Silmarillion and listened to the latest audio version. I must categorically disagree with all the things that have been said by some of the other reviewers. This is possibly Tolkien's greatest work. It is a novel in which the full scope of Middle Earth and Tolkien's imagination comes to full fruition and is revealed in all its splendour. The beginning of the world, brought forth by a song, is written with such grace that it could only be the work of a master author such as Tolkien. The history of the elves' struggle against Morgoth is told in high epic style. If any part is a little slow, it would be the last pages regarding the Third Age. The audio version only heightens the sense of majesty as it reminds me of a gathering of a community, waiting to hear the story-teller pass on the history of the world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is very likely the best book I've ever read. It is JRR Tolkien's masterwork, and considering the fact that the man of whom I speak penned Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, that's quite a statement. Nonetheless it is true. Quite simply the Silmarillion is on a higher literary plain; it is an Epic of scope and power unrivaled by other works of modern literature. Very simply the work is Biblical- if we lived in Tolkien's Middle Earth there can be little doubt that men would read from it on pulpits and proclaim it holy writ. People simply do not write like this any more (and I for one think it a shame we don't.) It is the story of a world, of a great religious crusade against a dark lord for the capture of three precious jems. It is a story of a great people, of their folly and heroism, virtue and greed, of the destruction and final redemption. It is a great work, it was indeed Tolkiens life's work, and I think it deserves to be read. If you have read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, I urge you to read this book. If you have not I suggest you to read them both, before tackling this work. It is a challenging read- I started The Silmarillion three times and it was only because of my great love of Lord of the Rings that I managed to complete it. Still by the third reading, it attained a magic and a beauty unrivaled by anything I'd ever read. It is a challenge, but it is well worth the effort. I hope you read it, and enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a compilation of Tolkien's mythology of Middle-Earth. Tolkien had worked on this mythology for much of his life, long before he even considered writing the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Many readers get turned off from the Silmarillion because of Tolkien's archaic style and the sheer number of names. My advice is not to worry about all of the names the first time you read through. Just try to remember a few of the main characters. There is a helpful appendix in the back of the book with the names of all of the characters and places. Moreover, Prof. Corey Olsen has a podcast on iTunes that explains the Silmarillion, which is worth listening to if you really want to appreciate the book.But make no mistake - the effort you put in will pay off. First, it will it enhance your understanding of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy, as the Silmarillion stories form the history for those novels. The Silmarillion goes from the creation of the universe right up to the war of the rings. In the First Age of the world, Men and Elves battle an evil lord that make Sauron look like a clown. Some of the stories, such as the defection of Feanor and the Noldor Elves, are stunning in their emotional power. It's some of the most gripping fantasy fiction ever. My one regret is that Tolkien didn't live long enough to publish this work himself."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The best printed revision of The Silmarillion. It is very hardly can be puchased in Russia, only within Amazon or other internet shops. Otherwise, this edtion is the best quality book \\"The Silmarillion\\" I've even taken - other originals versions and translations had less quality of printing and illustrations. The best choice to buy Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It took me most of my life to really appreciate Tolkien's work (I'm slow I guess). And I have really come love and cherish LOTR. I know of nothing that comes even close to it in so many ways... except for the Silmarillion.The scope and vision of the Silmarillion is so gigantic that if it had not ended before the events described in LOTR, but had included them in a form similar to the rest of the book, as (Middle-)Earth-shaking as they were, they probably would have been covered in a few pages... a chapter at most. Events of the scope and magnitude of LOTR occur over and over in the Silmarillion. It does not cover them all with the detail of LOTR, but the stories are profound and rich and moving. The Silmarillion must have been largely complete in Tolkien's mind when he wrote LOTR because the events of the Silmarillion during ages and centuries before LOTR profoundly (and consistently) influence not only the character and values of most of the characters, but almost every word and action they take. It is as though LOTR was a single delicious fruit and the Silmarillion was the fruit-laden tree which bore it.Taking on the Silmarillion is a commitment. But for those who found LOTR worthwhile, I think they will find the Silmarillion at least equally worthwhile.I agree with others who warn readers against starting with the Silmarillion even though it comes first chronologically.It probably is best to start with the Hobbit, even though it was written with different voice and aimed at a different audience than the other works. Context-wise, it probably is the best place to start.It is probably best to read LOTR next and the Silmarillion last... but having read the Silmarillion, you'll probably want to go back and read LOTR again, equipped with the enriched perspective you will have..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Amazing: the reviews here are now just about as long as The Silmarillion itself!As most everyone here knows, J. R. R. Tolkien was a philologist and professor at Oxford and a great author. But for those wishing to delve deeper into his world, Middle Earth, it is good to know that he was also a devout Catholic convert and that his sincere Christianity breathes true spirituality into his creation.Tolkien set out, as a young man, to create a new mythology for England. Not to actually replace the existing Anglo-Saxon mythos, or to supplant Christianity, but to complement them. Reading The Silmarillion, especially the creation story, and the narrative of the Silmarils themselves, we can appreciate the greatness of his creation. No one in modern times has attempted anything like it in scope; no one could. It took a brilliant professor of languages, a richly gifted storyteller, a poet, and a God-graced and open-minded person to attempt it. In Tolkien all these persons were combined. There will never be another like him nor a literary creation like his.If you wish to explore the worlds of this man and their complex combining, you can easily begin with The Silmarllion. After that, courtesy of his son Christopher, there are many further volumes to explore, but The Silmarillion remains the open gate to Middle Earth. I urge you to enter.Note: after decades of reading and rereading Tolkien's works, I've just been listening to Martin Shaw's reading of The Silmarillion. I'm surprised how much I like it, even given my own inner reading developed over so long. If Shaw can win *me* over, he should be able to win anyone over. Tolkien's words are meant to be read aloud, as their older models, the Eddas, are. If you've had trouble \\"getting into\\" The Silmarillion in print, try Shaw's recordings. (And J. R. R. and Christopher Tolkien's excerpts in the delightful \\"The J. R. R. Tolkien Audio Collection\\".)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The depth of the story was fantastic. Any one who has read or seen the Lord of the Rings will get a wealth of background information from this book. I purchased the Audio version and enjoyed it as I drove to and from work. A word of warning the first portion of the book will make you reread to make sure you get the characters and scene. After that it gets better as you begin to relate to the other writings of Tolkien. Read this book after Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.Hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This review originally was written for the paperback version of \\"The Silmarillion\\" and pertains only to content, not to quality of the hardbook version......I have never been a devotee of the Science Fiction or Fantasy genre, so I missed J.R.R. Tolkien when he was a cult favorite in the 60's. I was only introduced to his works through the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" film of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Since then, I have read, re-read and read again all three books of the LOTR trilogy and \\"The Hobbit\\". Through these readings, I have become thoroughly engrossed and deeply impressed with Tolkien's genius in creating an entire world complete with geography, animals, peoples, cultures, and fantasy languages based on solid linguistic principles. The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy represents not just an adventure epic; it is an introduction to Tolkien's works -- a whetting of an appetite, which can only be sated by reading the works upon which this film trilogy is based.Fundamental to understanding the LOTR trilogy is knowledge of what preceeded it. \\"The Hobbit\\", which directly precedes the LOTR trilogy, is as fundamental to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as the Old Testament is to the New. However, the true breadth and depth of Tolkien's life's work cannot be fully comprehended without also reading \\"The Silmarillion\\". Our Old Testament's Book of Genesis starts with creation, but does little to explain the process of the creation of our real world. The Silmarillion, on the other hand, details the story of the creation of Middle Earth and the creatures that inhabited and departed from it.We owe a great debt of gratitude to Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son, for the diligent work he has done in gathering and editing his father's published and unpublished works and notes. \\"The Silmarillion\\" is billed as \\"...Tolkien's first book and his last.\\" -- a life's work that was published four years after his death. Only through reading (and probably re-reading) this compendium of Tolkien's background work can one truly comprehend not only the history of the deities, elves, dwarves, men and other creatures of Middle Earth but also J.R.R. Tolkien's absolute brilliance in crafting this fantasy world.\\"The Silmarillion\\" is a must-read for those who would wish to fully appreciate Tolkien's work. It is not a light read and requires constant referral to the book's appendices and indices. Although the material mostly predates all of J.R.R. Tolkien's subsequent works, it is not a good introduction to Tolkien. It is best appreciated (and most useful) if read after \\"The Hobbit\\" and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\".Thank you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read this hard on the heels fo LOTR 25 years ago.This is different from LOTR of course. Much grander in scope and style, and ultimately more rewarding. A reviewer said the Hobbit is for the Hobbit in us, LOTR is for the man in us, and Silmarillion is for the Elf in us. Indeed it is a sad and melancholy tale, and after reading, one is filled with the terrible sadness about the travils of the elves.It is of course an epic - in a similar grandiloquent style. Personally, I find the first sections pretty dull, until Feanor appears. OK, it is not just about him, but how mighty the Noldor princes were. Galadriel, one of the top 3 elves in ME in LOTR, merits but a single sentence in Silmarillion. If you ever wonder about Gil-Galad, well, there isn't that much about him in the book, but there are lots more stories about his relatives, some of whom even slayed Balrogs for breakfast. Sauron actually reminded me of Wormtongue, in the sense that he was humiliated by the men of Numenor.The tapestry is fascinating, and the language very moving."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is not for the neophyte or faint of heart. It is the core of the mythological world created by Tolkien. In fact, Tolkien began this work well before he began to weave it into the more familiar Middle Earth of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. He dispaired of its ever being published, and yet desired its publication more than any of his other works. It was not until LOTR achieved greatness that this could be released to an audience already demanding more of Hobbits and the Middle Earth.Few but the most die hard fans are aware of the background of how Tolkien created this world. A philologist, (study of language development) Tolkien took the Elven language he had created as a young boy and teenager and determined that no language could truly develop without a corresponding mythology. The two were inseperable in his understanding.The Silmarilian is that Mythology. It is a labor of love and one, while no doubt influenced by the Norse mythology and life long pursuit of Sir Gawain and the Green Dragon, as well as Beowulf, it is more than that. A work of genius by one of the greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century, it demonstrates the love and attention to detail that have set apart the works of Tolkien from all others in the Genre.Buy it, read it and marvel at the creativity and machinations that most readers are introduced to in the narrative greats of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. You'll come to understand why those stories, monumental as they are, are only the tip of the iceberg waiting to be discovered.After you've read the LOTR and Hobbit and other of Tolkien's smaller works, come to this work and when you've read it, you'll read the other again with greater understanding, appreciation and even a sense of awe that were not there the first time. You'll have the pleasure of reading these great books like you read them the first time!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I disagree with some of the reviews here, there much to like about the Silmarillion. It is hard reading at first, when Tolkien describes the creation of his world and the gods. But once the real heroic stories begin this is a wonderful read. The stories of Feanor, Melkor and others are riveting and have a feel of ancient heroism missing from Lord Of The Rings. My favourite story was that of Elwing going to the great city in th land of the elves and the gods. Bottom line if you've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and feel like you want to know more about Tolkien's world or want to read more this book is ideal. It just requires some persistence to get through the beginning."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Quite simply, the Silamrillion is one of the best books ever written, a tragic story of the first order, if you have the patience to read it. It is a tale of the heroic First Age of Middle Earth, and encompasses material referred to numerous times in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The sheer depth of the history is staggering.If I was forced to make a comparison, the tone and feel of the book are most similar to the ending of the Return of the King and places where the fading of the Elves is mentioned, though The Silmarillion is more distant. It encompasses all of the glory, beauty, and sadness of The Lord of the Rings, distilled to a biting essence. Imagine the bittersweet end of The Lord of the Rings, and its feeling of victory-but-at-what-price-?, magnified many times, to see the glorious history of men and elves come to such a humble end at the Silmarillion's conclusion. In the Silmarillion, the grass is greener, the stars are brighter, the swords are sharper, and the black is blacker than in any other work of fiction.True to the title, the wonderous Silmarils are directly or indirectly the driving force of almost all history in Middle Earth. The Silmarillion covers the entire history of Middle Earth and the greater world in a mix of Norse, Christian, and Greek-style mythologies and stories (roughly in that order, though I'm not an expert), picking and choosing the most glorious and tragic aspects of these. It covers the creation of all of existence, the origin, departure, and triumphant return of Elves to Middle Earth, the Elves' war upon the Great Enemy (Morgoth, of whom Sauron was only a servant), and his terrible breaking of their seige. It then goes on to tell of the The Battle of Unnumbered Tears, the Hidden City of Gondolin (where Bilbo and Frodo's sword Sting was made), Beren and Luthien, and many other stories. The tragedy of the book befalls as the once-magnificent Elves are gradually driven into the ground by a series of treacheries driven partly by the will of Morgoth and partly by their own pride; all the more tragic since these were prophesied. We then learn of the final battle where Morgoth is overthrown, and the Second Age begins.The latter part of the book is just as tragic, though it is not presented in as much detail. The magnificent but proud Numenoreans (men who fought on the side of the Elves) face a similar fate and are eventually crushed by the gods, along with their home in \\"Atlantis\\", for their sins. The faithful survive to populate Middle Earth and create the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. Along with the remaining elves they form the Last Alliance and defeat Sauron, thus beginning the Third Age. There is some description of this age and Sauron's final defeat, as well as the Fourth Age, and the book ends with a brief discussion of the fate of the surviving memembers of the Fellowship (most notably Gimli and Legolas), and a hint of how men can still at times come to the undying lands of Valinor and behold the glory of the Elder Days, before they die.Though I have read the Silmarillion several times, I have never met anyone else (in person) who has read the whole thing through without skimming, and that is including some rabid Lord of the Rings fans. In fact, the first time I read it I took a six-month break at page 56. (If worse comes to worst, skim until about that page and then start reading, because they tone of the story changes a little.) Experience shows that if you read and enjoyed the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, especially the history portions, then The Silmarillion is probably right for you. If you have not read the Appendices or disliked them, then you might not get much from this book (though the Silmarillion is a much better read than the appendices).In regards to this particular edition of the Silmarillion, it is illustrated. I personally feel some of the illustrations are average and some are breathtaking. The pages and general feel of the book are high-quality. The story is the same."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a wonderful tale of mythical proportions. The prequel to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, it begins with the creation of the Valar by Eru, the one, also known as Il&uacute;vatar. It goes on to tell about how all the Valar obeyed Eru except one who was the most powerful of the Valar. Melkor was his name, and when Eru told the Valar to stop the music they were making because it grew awful in sound he at first felt shame but in secret anger began to burn inside him. Then Eru shows them a vision of a world that they must create. It is however a finished vision of the world and the Valar must do the work on their own so that the children of Eru, which are the elves and men, when they become made, may have a place to live. So the Valar begin to create Middle-earth. Melkor however seeks to destroy all that the Valar make and everything that they made such as land, mountains, even plants gets destroyed by Melkor. Melkor also creates a secret fortress where he makes his evil creatures. Eventually the firstborn come, which are the elves, and they are put on Middle-earth. On Middle-earth however there is no light yet, only in Valinor where the Valar live, so the elves that are in the land of Melkor, even though Melkor doesn't yet pay attention to them, have a love for the starlight. Melkor then begins secretly to capture some elves here and there in which the race of the Orcs come of them because he tortures them brutally. Then the Valar make war with Melkor of which the elves weren't in so they don't have any tales or writings of it. Melkor is then sent to prison in the halls of Mandos where no living person can escape not even the Valar. In the time where Melkor is imprisoned, the Valar lead most of the elves to Valinor to stay in light and beauty. The elves that remain create their own kingdoms in Middle-earth. The dwarfs and Ents are created in this time as well. Of the elves that go into Valinor, Fanor, son of the king and the most gifted of the elves, creates the Silmarils. In these jewels the light of the trees of Valinor are in them. When Melkor is unchained and led to the Valinor after so many years they make him serve the elves and the Valar. He now has a secret anger for the elves because the Valar only made war on him because of the elves. So he goes around telling lies about the Valar and their evil. Fanor then preaches on the evil of the Valar in which he is brought before them and sentenced to seven years away from the rest of the elves. Melkor then goes to Fanor and Fanor rejects him because he knows that Melkor is after the Silmarils. So Melkor leaves and reconstructs his fortress which Sauron, his lieutenant still dwells, for the chasms of his fortress were deep and the Valar didn't find them all. Melkor then devises a plan with the help of Ungoliant an evil spider. So when the Valar and the elves are at a time of feasting and celebration he sneaks into Valinor and destroys the trees which are the only things that give light and so there is darkness in Valinor. Fanor is away from his place at this time and so Melkor slaughters his father and steals the Silmarils. Fanor then vows to find the Silmarils and to avenge his father's death a vow that no one can break. Fanor then convinces most of the elves to sail back to Middle-earth. In doing so they slay their own kindred to get sailing vessels and so a curse is laid upon them until they return to Valinor. The Valar try to make the trees regrow with all the strength that they have left and a silver leaf from one tree and a gold fruit from another is all that they can muster. The Valar then place them in the sky and one becomes the Sun and the other the Moon. Men are made in Middle earth at the time of the first sunrise and they are forever drawn into the west because of this. Many battles then take place between Melkor and the elves. Eventually men come out of the east and give aid. Beren, a man, who becomes a wanderer and a friend to animals comes into the realm of the elves and falls in love with L&uacute;thien. Her father doesn't like this and so he demands the Silmiril from Melkor's hand. So Beren sets off on his journey. He gets captured so L&uacute;thien goes to look for him and when she arrives she sets everything asleep. When she finds Beren they go into Melkor's throne room and cut off one of the Silmirils from his crown. They then escape and a wolf chews off Beren's hand that is holding the Silmiril. They go back to her father and he grants them marriage and when Beren dies the Valar gives to any of Beren and L&uacute;thiens offspring the choice of being mortal or immortal and L&uacute;thien chooses to be immortal to join Beren. Beren also asks the Valinor to have mercy on the elves and get rid of Melkor for them and so they start a war and eventually they slay Melkor.What is great about this novel is that even though this is fantasy the people of the story seem real. Everything also is given so much back story and detail that you almost believe that it is real. This book also ties in with The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit because it tells of Galadriel and Elrond and some other people in those stories. It also gives them their history so if you were to read this book then The Hobbit and then The Lord of the Rings you would see how the character acts the way he/she does and the reasons for it. The novel really keeps you on the edge of your seat and it creates a lot of suspense. Some thing about the novel that I didn't like is that it isn't really one story like The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. It is just a bunch of stories thrown together to make a story. The chapters are also about one topic so sometimes Tolkien has to jump backwards in order to tell you something that happened about the same time as the other chapter. I believe that Tolkien's intentions where to set a back-story for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit so that these world would seem real and also he wanted to give more back-story to the characters that he loves so much so that you get to know why they act the way they do in his other stories. However, the good overrides the bad in this book.This book is truly a well-written piece of literature. It has everything that one needs to quench the thirst of adventure within oneself because of all the great and extremely imaginative adventures it has. There is so much detail and back-story that no one else could write anything more about Middle-earth for he covers everything. The epic stories, the vast amount of detail, the amazing places, and wonderful people truly make this book a great one. No one except Tolkien could have thought of these places for they are beautiful and they also seem bigger than one could imagine in ones brain. The people in this story are also so magical and it is a place where you would like to go because of this. Tolkien is one of the best, if not the best, writer of the twentieth century because he explains and imagines a world in so much detail that no one ever has created a world like this or spent as much time on a world. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a great story."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion: Tolkien's true life work, ultimately unfinished though it isIn the Tolkien canon, THE SILMARILLION is the most highly contested of all his works. Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\". And what a mighty work it is, despite its unfinished nature...........---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bonus Content:In November 28, 1999, I released a small review of \\"The Silmarillion\\" on Amazon.com (which is still accessible on the main product listing of this book), and as bonus content to the review proper (which is up above), I am including my original reviewTolkien's Bible, November 28, 1999\\"Hark now to \\"The Silmarillion\\", the Bible of Tolkien's fantasy world.

Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales story). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into THE SILMARILLION. For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says, \\"the work of his heart\\".

Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 SILMARILLION, which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.THE SILMARILLION, the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 SILMARILLION.Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" in MORGOTH'S RING, Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 SILMARILLION). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the Silmarillion again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and lingustics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writng, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work).

Tolkien had worked on this mythology for much of his life, long before he even considered writing the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Many readers get turned off from the Silmarillion because of Tolkien's archaic style and the sheer number of names. My advice is not to worry about all of the names the first time you read through. Just try to remember a few of the main characters. There is a helpful appendix in the back of the book with the names of all of the characters and places. Moreover, Prof. Corey Olsen has a podcast on iTunes that explains the Silmarillion, which is worth listening to if you really want to appreciate the book.But make no mistake - the effort you put in will pay off. First, it will it enhance your understanding of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy, as the Silmarillion stories form the history for those novels. The Silmarillion goes from the creation of the universe right up to the war of the rings. In the First Age of the world, Men and Elves battle an evil lord that make Sauron look like a clown. Some of the stories, such as the defection of Feanor and the Noldor Elves, are stunning in their emotional power. It's some of the most gripping fantasy fiction ever. My one regret is that Tolkien didn't live long enough to publish this work himself."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I loved reading the Silmarillion. Its a wonderful collection of myth like stories outlining the first and second ages of Middle Earth. Its very different from a conventional novel in the sense that there is no consistent character development that goes beyond a select few; in a sense the book functions as a wide angle compendium of Tolkien's world more so than a story showing the lives of Hobbits.I've heard and read many people saying that it is not worth the effort and reads more like some bad piece of Anglo Saxon literature, putting them to sleep with every read. I can't stress how wrong I think they are. I found the Silmarillion engaging, exciting, and beautifully written in a way that made me appreciate Tolkien even more.So, don't be turned away by the first twenty pages showing the creation and introduction to Middle Earth, but give the book a chance to unfold and show itself for what it really is."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The reader has the perfect, strong tone to read a book like the Silmarillion. His voice invokes the image of an orator standing in front of a crowd on a pedestal, telling tales of a time long past.As for the Silmarillion itself, it's a fantastic story from beginning to end. If you're a Tolkien fanatic, this audio book will only help to increase your knowledge of those times long ago when Arda was young."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What makes Tolkien great is that he understands that modernity is a lie; that there was a better world inside of man long ago, and if there wasn't, well then there should have been.It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What splendor!!! I cannot say it enough, for those into the Lord of the Rings (LOR), this is the mythology, biology, and sociology of it all! This is Tolkien's alternate universe, and one that is very possible! This book explains the three eras of middle earth, starting with the creation of Ea (the world and material universe) to the lineages of elves, dwarves, and men, and ultimately the rings of power. It also explains how dark/evil forces had formed starting with the jeolous Melkor (the master of Sauron) and his separation from the Ainur (spirits of power). Furthermore, great emphasis and explanation is provided regarding important characters like Gandolf, Elrond, and Galadriel.Fortunately for those of us who aren't great with attention to detail, there is a very informative index and appendix in the back, filled with definitions, family trees, and maps. Alot of information is given in these densely packed pages and it is easy to get lost if one is not reading intently, therefore the appendix/index is very helpful. One more thing. The composition is a little different than that of the 'LOR.' In some cases, in present tense, references are given to future events. Also, many of the chapters are written as individual stories that are inter-connected with the overall tale (e.g. Of Beren and Luthien, etc...). While this is no Dostoevsky, it is a bit more complex writing than the 'LOR.' However, if one can focus their attention, suspend disbelief, it is a very rewarding read that is a spiritual experience in it's own right. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"i first tried to read this when i was home sick one day and i do admit that i had to try once or twice before actually getting all the way through the book. it is much different from the lord of the rings, but that doesnt make it bad. although it is hard to get through it is very rewarding when you finally finish. if your favorite characters were the elves in LOTR or you just want to know more about some of the things in LOTR (like why the elves are leaving middle earth), then you have to read this book. it is really worth it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"THE SILMARILLION is a wonderful book and provides a rich legacy of information which underlies Tolkien's beloved THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS (LOTR). The author shows the true depth and richness of Middle Earth, creating a beautiful mixture of myth, folklore, and in some respects, scripture.For those who have loved and cherished Tolkien's more famous works, this book will provide great enjoyment. HOWEVER, for the person not familiar with LOTR, the book may be extremely difficult. While beautifully crafted, it may be difficult to follow as it is more reference than story in a sense.I would, as have many others, recommend THE HOBBIT first, followed by LOTR, both masterpieces of storytelling. With sufficient interest and background, THE SILMARILLION can then be truly appreciated for its own great gifts."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"At the core of The Silmarillion, as well as LOTR is a very simple plot, but the characters, environment, and drama Tolkien weaves is truly mind boggling. Tolkien considered The Silmarillion his finest achievement, and I can't agree more. The Silmarillion was released posthumously by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The scope and grandeur of the story behind The Silmarillion is hard to describe. If you're familiar with LOTR, let's just say that the Sauron is a mere sidekick of the big bad guy in The Silmarillion. In fact, Sauron gets his butt kicked big time by a human King, who unfortunately gets brainwashed by him later and invokes the wrath of god-like beings called the Valar. You learn how Sauron was able to escape with his deceits, to come back to Middle Earth. With this book, you come to learn the background on Elves, Dwarves, and Humans. You'll learn about the Undying Lands in the west where the Elves sail to. You will learn Gandalf's past, Sauron's past, how Orcs were once Elves. The tragedy of the love between Beren and Luthien is enough to make a grown man cry. The Silmarillion is biblical and mythical in breadth and really takes your breath away. It can therefore be intimidating to a casual LOTR reader. What I can say is that if you really, really loved LOTR, you will absolutely love The Silmarillion. The Silmarillion can be hard to follow because there are so many different characters with unusual, hard-to-pronounce names. But if you can get over this \\"difficulty\\", the reward is great. It truly is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read in my life. As an aid to reading this book, I used \\"The Complete Guide to Middle Earth\\" by Robert Foster and also read along with an unabridged reading on CD by Martin Shaw (Bantam Double Day). Martin Shaw has a great voice reading along with him was extremely helpful. The CD helped me get past the difficult names of the characters and places, and the Guide was a fantastic reference book. The Silmarillion is by no means casual reading for most people, but if you don't mind putting a little mental effort with remembering names, you will find it extremely enjoyable and rewarding. Recommended to \\"hard-core\\" LOTR fans."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have read that Tolkien considered The Silmarillion his most important work. I agree with that. Upon reading The Silmarillion, my experience with Tolkien's other popular works - The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy - has been GREATLY enhanced.Be aware that The Silmarillion is not a novel and it is a difficult read - its implementation is nothing like that of The Hobbitt or The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is a difficult read only because it is such a complete mythology and reading it is like reading the Bible - you must struggle through the &quot;begats&quot;, wishing they would quickly come to an end. If you push through such (necessary) sections, however, you will find many sections that will absolutely thrill you or bring you to tears and have you wishing you would never reach the end.I cannot imagine an emotion that I did not experience while reading this work. It is truly one of the most sublime works of literature that I have ever encountered.Whether you are interested in Tolkien's other works or not, I highly recommend that you read the Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Two afternoons and two nights, roughly 24 hours later, I finally finished reading The Silmarillion. I was speechless. I had so many thoughts that I didn't know where to start. This is the most challenging and most rewarding book I have ever read! For any fan of LOTR who is intrigued by the ambiguous and tantalizing references in the books or movies, this is a must read. It answers all my questions (for now), for example:* Stories behind the main characters: Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Aragorn, etc.* Origins of the various races in Middle-earth (and their relationships): Elves, Dwarves, Men.* What is Valinor, what is Grey Havens, what is a Valar?* The different fates that await Elves and Men after they die (which explains a lot why the parting between Elrond and Arwen was so painful for them).* How did Sauron become the Enemy?* Why did the Elves need to depart Middle-earth and why were they so sorrowful?But most of all, The Silmarillion is Tolkien's blueprint of the World (Middle-earth and beyond) and chronicles of events that happened from the breaking of the world through the end of the Third Age (in which the Ring story came to pass). It is mainly devoted to the account of the Noldor (a branch of the Elves), who consumed by pride and greed and bound by an evil oath, exiled from Valinor (the Blessed Realm in which Valar and Elves dwelled) to Middle-earth to get back the Silmarils (three mighty jewels wrought by their leader Feanor) that were robbed by Melko, a \\"fallen\\" God (Valar) and \\"The Enemy\\" of the World, and how their fate was intertwined with the fate of Men, their kindred. The rest of the book concerns briefly the rise and fall of Numenoreans (a branch of Men that were blessed by the Valar at first), and the war of the Rings (which developed into the LOTR trilogy).I have never been an avid fan of fantasies, histories, or family sagas. And yet, this book is precisely a hybrid of these three, and I was so absorbed that I was reading it almost nonstop. There is something irresistible about the stories, and the way they were told. As always I was enamored with Tolkien's use of language which possesses a rare beauty and elegance and his ability to describe events and convey emotions potently with few words. The stories are of such emotional power that I writhed my hands in dismay at the flight of the Noldor and the atrocities they committed in pursuit of the Silmarils, I cried at the tragic yet heroic love story between Beren and Luthien (Arwen's choosing mortality seemed so trivial compared to the deeds achieved by Luthien), I cried as Turin slew his friend by mistake and the dark fate that befell him afterwards, and I sighed in sadness as the once valiant Numenoreans fell into madness out of greed and pride, their home utterly destroyed, and all that was divine was forever hidden from Middle-earth.The story corrected my misconception from LOTR about the Elves. I always thought the Elves were a \\"perfect\\" race that defied the common \\"human\\" weaknesses. Alas, was I wrong! The saga of the Noldor could happen to any race in the World, if it were put under the same circumstances. Although with beauty, knowledge and skills, the Elves might not always have sound judgments, and were subject to \\"sins\\" that existed among all living beings. And Men, who craved for everlasting life and ever increasing possessions, also wreaked havoc to the World and brought upon themselves a bitter doom.Compared to LOTR, which turns out to be a most optimistic story despite the many dark moments, The Silmarillion is exceedingly sad and is overshadowed with an ever pervasive sense of doom. By the beginning of the Third Age, although Melkor was vanquished and Sauron fled, the Silmarils fell forever asunder after all the blood that was shed and lives lost for their sake, Numenor along with all its bliss and splendor was destroyed, and Valinor was forever hidden from Men. Even after Sauron was defeated in the Third Age, the Elves had to bid farewell to their beloved land and forever depart Middle-earth, bringing away the last trace of ancient myth, power, and beauty. If LOTR portrays valor, trust, kindness, loyalty, friendship, good counsel, and love in great depth, The Silmarillion is like the other side of the coin, depicting the darkest sides of living beings, their greed, malice, mistrust, hatred, jealousy, treachery, (unchecked) ambition, pride (unaccompanied by wisdom and sound judgment), lies, and lust.I first purchased this book after watching TTT, along with The Hobbit and the LOTR. Although I finished the latter two within a week, I couldn't break through the first 10 pages of this book because the detailed introduction of the World with their extremely similar names made me exhausted and bored. However, once I let go and stopped trying to remember the names, I was immediately enthralled by the stories. And once I checked out the meanings of words in the index for three or four times, I could remember them. For all the other transient names of people and places (that is, names that were mentioned only once or twice), sometimes there is no need to remember or check at all (unless you are a Tolkien scholar), since they hinder little my understanding or appreciation of the stories.One thing readers need to bear in mind is that this is not a \\"novel\\", but a collection with loosely related stories of events that shaped the World and Middle-earth in particular. They are but notes and backgrounds for Tolkien to conceptualize his fantasy world. Most of the stories are more \\"accounts\\" rather than \\"descriptions\\", and sometimes feel rushed and unfinished to readers that crave for more details. However, because of the lack of lavish descriptions the emotional pay-off becomes greater, because somehow you feel as if you had been transported into another world and were witnessing the unfolding of history, which was but a brief moment in the eternity of time. Your own imagination can fill in the blanks and lead you anywhere you want."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read this book because I wanted to know the story of the First Age. I wanted to know who the heck Morgoth and the Valar were. Well, like many reviewers, I agree that the first 10 chapters are &quot;boring, meaningless drivel.&quot; I very nearly destroyed the book. But, out of sheer spite more than anything else, I pushed on, until I finally stumbled on the real story. And I tell you now, if you have the firmness of mind and the intellectual faculties to endure the &quot;glossary chapters,&quot; you will find, at the end of your toil, a window into the soul of Tolkein's world. The people who rate this book badly are mostly people who want LOTR2, people who have an insatiable appetite for Tolkein's unparalleled narrative excellence. That is not to be found here. But what IS to be found here is far more absorbing. I read this book, and I found the characters of legend and their many deeds. I read it twice, and I got all the names straight, and discovered an incredible story. I read it a third time, and beheld the theme of Middle Earth and the Two Kindreds, of the irrevocable marring of the world, and the hope that remains. Marvelous.A bit of clarification: Tolkein didn't have this published in his lifetime because he knew that it didn't read itself to people, and many would find it difficult. However, it was his original, core and absolutely most important, lifetime work. It was, as it were, the &quot;trunk&quot; of JRRT's &quot;branching acquisitive theme,&quot; and was the source from which such epics as LOTR and Hobbit were created. Without this reference, Lord of the Rings would never have had consistency or depth - for that, at least, it deserves respect. For those people who refuse to believe that JRR wrote it and think that it is an embarrassment to him, well, he would be likely to take that as a deep, profound offense. Okay, that was a lot of clarification."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For years I was afraid to read The Silmarillion (a brief glance through some of these reviews will explain the idea that this book is hard-going). Having just re-read The Hobbit &amp; Lord of the Rings, I felt inspired to give it a go.... and I am so glad that I did. If, like me, you devoured the myths &amp; legends of the world as a child, you will feel like you've &quot;come home&quot; at last. Tolkien's language is so beautiful it makes you want to cry - some place inside you simply resonates at the sheer poetry of the writing. This is such an overwhelmingly sad &amp; haunting book. As in all true myths, there is a strong sense of doom - characters are magnificent but flawed, heroic yet doomed. If you expect fully-fleshed-out 3D characters, forget it. This is not written like a modern novel. If you love stories that are timeless &amp; that will stay with you forever, read The Silmarillion. I cannot yet decide whether I prefer it to LOTR, but it doesn't matter - we have both!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book doesn't read like a narrative because it is not a narrative. This is a history book of events that lead up to the Third Age of Middle Earth when the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy takes place.This book has everything, from the dawn of the creation of Middle Earth by Eru - who the elves called Illuvitar, to the creation of the pantheon of gods known as the Valar, and the birth of the Children of Illuvitar - who were the Elves and Men.If you have a taste for great fantasy literature this book is essential. While it reads like a history book you must understand that this format is essential. Consider this - the Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, three books that span basically a year. This single book spans two AGES, as well as the timeless realm before the creation of Middle Earth. We are talking THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS of years, which are nothing to immortal beings like the Elves and the Valar. If this book were a narrative it would be longer than the entire Encyclopedia Brittanica, including the footnotes and bibliography!As a result the reader is required to fill in various things with his/her own imagination. This book uses two pages to describe battles that in a narrative would require two chapters. Once you get used to the style you will discover that this book contains some of the absolute best fantasy literature ever created."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"... and this says it all. This book has touched me as very few have, and I have come to consider the First Age of Middle Earth as part of my own past. I have read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but the Silmarillion surpasses both in sheer beauty. This is more that fiction, it is poetry at its best. Coming from Hellas, a country with an ancient tradition of literature and especially epics &amp; dramas, I don't hesitate to place Tolkien on the same pedestal with Homer of the Iliad &amp; the Odyssey, or even (I know some will hate me for this) Euripides or Aeschylos. A unique literary experience. I suggest the Silmarillion to anyone who dares to dream of magic &amp; love in today's drab world of advertising, &quot;humanitary&quot; wars &amp; the stock exchange."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a very handsome cloth-cover book.The binding, cover, and pape quality are extremely similar to the three volumne TLOR boxed set (ISBN: 0618260587).

I've always been a fan, every since having to read The Hobbit as a kid. After the Rings Trilogy, and the Hobbit, I read Children of Hurin. I figured why not get to the \\"core\\" of this mythos and read the Silmarillion? While it is great to come across the birth/creation of familiar names and places, this book, specifically the language, is very disjointed. I appreciate the fact that Tolkien's son smithed this book together from multiple documents, but I still found myself rereading passages to make sure I knew the who, what, when and where of events. I would nonetheless recommend this to any fan of Tolkien, and frankly anyone interested in creation myth. Irrespective of it's disjointed nature, it still contains incredibly crafted stories."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love Tolkien and have read most works about middle earth.

If you want to know the back story of information about the history of Middle Earth, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have read this book dozens of times over the years. I loved it from the very first time I read it as a teenager. It is one of the most amazing works of fiction I have ever read. Eddings created an amazing world on a grand scale, yet it pales to the Middle Earth created by Tolkien. The Silmarillion transports you to a place of wonder filled with love, honor, treachery, good, evil, courage, faith, spirit and dozens more qualities that define man. Yes, Mr. Tolkien was a devote believer in God and this book reflects it. And because of that, if you give it a chance, it will take you to a place insider yourself that few books other than the Bible can. Could some find it boring? Of course, some also find Lord of the Rings boring. Is it dry? Yes, in parts it is dry. But if you take the time and energy to really read it, you will see a richness that is missing from all but the greatest of books. The stories are so grand and full of goodness I have begun retelling them, after some editing, to my 4 year old daughter. She loves them and can't get enough of them as I put her to bed. I think this shows how universal these stories are. The represent the best and worst of man, but in the end, the good guys win. And isn't that how it should be."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is Tolkien's seminal work. The Hobbit and especially the Lord of the Rings Trilogy have it as their foundation.This one is told, intentionally, in an archaic form as old tales. Tolkien wrote the stories as the Elves lore, the Elves interpretation of history as they knew or understood it. Many of the tales are from long before the Elves came into being. It isn't easy reading - just read it through the first time. You will 'get' so much more with the second read. There is a podcast of college-level lectures from the TolkienProfessor - I subscribed to them on iTunes. You can go to his website for a link, just put a dot com after that. The lectures are a great help and lots of fun for a Tolkien fan!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"An epic backstory to the classic fantasy tales. Mr. Tolkien's vision is apparent throughout and what a vision it was. The tales of the ages before \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are just as massive and even more tragic, which makes the tales within this book so much more powerful. The tale of Beren and Luthien is just as beautiful as any of the great tragic romances. And the way the narrative is constructed adds this feeling of glory and splendor to the elves of old. And the tale of Numenor is awesome too. The only drawback to this book is that it takes a lot of time to get to the good stuff. The beginning isn't unimportant, but it is a little dry. It's not until the rebellion Feanor and the later chapters that it really picks up. No matter what, this is a great pick for any fantasy reader."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit, and some of Tolkien's shorter works. When The Silmarillion came out, I was in a completist mood, got it and read it. Part of the way through, I decided that \\"I really don't want to know anything more about all this.\\" I did force myself to finish it, with most details going in one eye and out the other.A lot of details that obviously fascinate some people and bore others. Having recently entered senior citizenship, I will content myself with the goal of re-reading the Trilogy and The Hobbit. This is a goal I have had for the past 39 years, since I first read it in the summer of 1966."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\`The Silmarillion' is a fictional history by J. R. R. Tolkien of the world of Middle Earth. It was the first of a series of posthumously published volumes, edited from Tolkien's documents by his son, Christopher Tolkien. And, it is the only complete work, as it was probably polished for publication near the time of Tolkien's death.On a personal note, I encountered Tolkien's fiction in 1964 when it was published in paperback for the first time, after being published in hardcover originally between 1954 and 1956. So, I became engulfed in the world of Middle Earth during the second wave of popularity, the third being initiated by the impending release of director Peter Jackson's movie version of \`Lord of the Rings'. This second wave was large, and it was instrumental in launching the popularity of many other \`Sword and Sorcery' works, the greatest being the creation of the \`Dungeons and Dragons' game in, I believe, 1971.Soon after the paperback \`Hobbit' and \`Lord of the Rings' came out, rumors started circulating about Tolkien's writing two more \`trilogies' named \`The Silmarillion' and \`The Akallabeth'. The first was to deal with the tales of the high elves lead by Feanor and of the lost city of Gondolin. The second was to tell the story of Numenor, the great island awarded to the humans who assisted the elves in their war with Morgoth, an evil being who makes Sauron look like a second rate thug. When Tolkien died, the promise of these works stayed alive as it became known that Christopher Tolkien was editing his father's unpublished works. In the mid-1970's I happened to be working for a fellow Tolkien devotee and we both had high hopes for the publication of SOMETHING, while faint promises of a work appeared now and then in the periodicals about books.I can still remember the moment when \`The Silmarillion' reached the bookstores, as I snatched it up as fast as my little VW Beetle wheels could carry me. In all honesty, I was just a little disappointed with what I read. The book is nothing less than a great mythic structure, giving the details of all the great events leading to the War of the Rings we know so well from \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings'.While the physical book is titled with the story of the Silmarils, three jewels created by Feanor, capturing the light of the two trees of Valinor before Morgoth poisoned them, it is really built of at least five different histories.The first is \`Ainulindale', which has roughly the same relation to Tolkien's canon as the book of Genesis has to the Judeo-Christian bible. While it tells of the beginning of the world, it's story is a cross between Judaic and Greek mythology in that the mythology has multiple gods or \`Holy Ones' in addition to \`Eru, the One'. The second is \`Valaquenta', the story of the Valar, very similar to the Olympian gods, with a hint of Norse mythology in that at least one of the Valar has a lot in common with Loki, the evil demiurge who bedeviled Thor and Odin. The third and longest part is \`The Silmarillion' itself. These second and third sections each seem to have a slightly different version of the birth of the world, almost as if the elder Tolkien had written the tales at different times, without a close cross-referencing of his facts. This is not to say there are gross inconsistencies, only that some finer points are in one telling which are missing from the others. The anomaly is more in the overlapping than in any inconsistency.The Fourth section is \`The Akallabeth' which tells of the origins and the ultimate downfall of the line of men who ultimately founded Gondor and who were the ancestors of Aragorn, the King of \`Lord of the Rings'. This tells much of the geography of \`the rest of the world' outside of Middle Earth. The Noldor were given a homeland island named Erissa which lay in sight of the \`undying lands', the home of the Valar. The Edain, men who assisted the Noldor in vanquishing Morgoth for the last time were given another island, Numenor, between Erissa and Middle Earth. Ultimately, Numenor went the way of Atlantis of Greek legend when Sauron corrupted the Numenorean kings. In punishment for their corruption, the Valar sank Numenor and a faction of uncorrupted survivors survived to found the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor on the shores of Middle Earth.The last narrative section, \`The Rings of Power and the Third Age' tells the story of Sauron, a mighty being whom Morgoth corrupted before his banishment from the world. There is a bit of this story in the appendices to \`The Return of the King', but this tells the whole story behind the little poem which summarizes the one ring, the three rings for elves, the seven rings for dwarves, and the nine rings for men. It also tells of the origins of the white tree of Gondor and the seven palantiri, both of which get just the barest look-see in the films.After these narrative sections, there are genealogical tables, notes on elven languages, an index of names with a brief description of the referent of each name, and a map of Beleriand, the location of the action in \`The Silmarillion'. The map is by Christopher, but very much in the style of senior Tolkien's great map of middle earth.The mythology in these sections is simply fantastic and the history leading up to the four main books goes far to enriching one's experience of those tales. The only thing I missed was a good background for Gandalf and the other wizards and my favorite Tom Bombadil. The stories in \`The Silmarillion' fall flat in comparison to the tall tales of the original novels.If you love Tolkien's novels, buy this book. They will make you want to read them again."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book has wonderful illustrations, and was well put together, I waited a long time for a this book in this edition.

This book emcompasses the entire world of Middle Earth. Tolkien is to be compared with Homer in this, the Simarillion and the Lord of the Rings.

The Silmarillion reads at the highest levels of articulation and intellectual style, not found in today's fast paced publications."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Easily one of Tolkien's best work(behind LOTR), The Silmarillion captures the essence of what we have come to love of Tolkien's fantasy world. Though some readers may be turned off by how the story unfolds( I was reminded countless times of the Bible), others will come to embrace the emotions, drama, and compassion as the reader takes on a journey through the first, second, and third age of Middle Earth. From the creation of the earth and the Eldar(Elves), to the unplanned birth of Dwarves, to the first of Men, you will feel the magic and mystique. From the departure of the Elves into Middle Earth, to their Quest to retrieve the Silmarillion, you will grieve over the Eldar's fate. Finally, we come to know the mysteries of the past. Finally, we get to understand the events that led to the final battle between good and evil.I highly recommend this fine piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I tried several times to read The Silmarillion, but usually became bogged down with the names and lost in the various places. However, after listening to Martin Shaw's wonderful melodic voice, the story seemed to fall into place. Hearing the names aloud makes them all the more real, and for any lover of LOTR I highly recommend hearing this tale at some point (but especially for those who've tried to read it and found it wanting!).It's also a great way to get a clearer picture of the fantastic history of Middle Earth ."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is every bit as good as Lord of the Rings and in some ways better. It does take a while for most people to read. But actually, I didn't find it too difficult. The hardest part is just keeping all the names strait, and that's mostly because the book spans several thousands of years. It talks about the creation of Middle Earth by Illuvitar all the way up to a small mention of a hobbit finding the One Ring. Of course if you've read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, you know that hobbit is Bilbo Baggins. It also goes into how the Dwarves were made (they were not part of Illuvitar's plan).One of the things I love about the book is there's a little Elvish-English dictionary in the appendix.This book is great if you want to know more about the history of Middle Earth and what caused everything that's going on in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and wanted to know a little bit more (well, ok, a lot more) about the Elves.There are some parts of the book that I didn't find too interesting, like when Tolkien goes into the geography of Middle Earth in a little too much detail for my taste. But hey, in the version I have, there's maps of Middle Earth in there, so you can just skip that chapter and refer to the map if needed.Definately recommend this one to fantasy and Lord of the Rings/Hobbit fans. I think I'm going to read it again and then read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, just so that I can read them all in the order Tolkien intended them to be read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's use of symbolism in The Silmarillion is exquisite. His use of symbolism really enhanced the book. Because of the added layers of action that the symbolism provided I enjoyed the book much more because of it.The symbolism of The Ring being the source of the problem and also being the source of all evil made the action that more provocative. Also the whole book is a work of symbolism of our very lives. Tolkien being a catholic fashions his work as a symbolic portrayal of our fallen human world. All these things made me enjoy this book allot more than if there hadn't been any type of symbolism to consider.Concerning imagery what Tolkien wrote gave us a beautiful mental picture of his fantasy world. However, sometimes all the descriptions became overwhelming and sometimes confusing. Also when it became overbearing all the clutter took away from the rest of the book.In conclusion The Silmarillion was a fantastic book and I would recommend it to anyone who like to read epic fantasy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've fallen in love with Middle-Earth and all it's interesting places and peoples.

I don't know that I would say it is better than the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings, but they are all on an equal plane of excellency."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Like many readers, I found The Silmarillion difficult to understand at first, but after three failed attempts of reading the novel, I finally finished it, and I loved it. The only reason I can think of that this book is not as good as The Lord of the Rings is that there is so little dialogue, but that is easily overlooked when one sees the beauty Tolkien uses to tell each story."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is the greatest, grandest, noblest, most joyful, most sorrowful fantasy fiction ever written."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As other people have said, the start is very hard to understand (the first 30-70 pages) and also boring. But if you manage to read them, you will be rewarded with the rest of the book.When you finish reading &quot;The Sillmarillion&quot; and you liked it you could try the first bit again but that time you will probably enjoy it: I did!Also if you don't like lots of names or &quot;son of's&quot;(like Turin son of Hurin) you may find this book a bit boring.This my favorite book ever except for &quot;TLOTR&quot; but only by a bit! If &quot;The Sillmarillion&quot; was narated like &quot;TLOTR&quot;, even if it was 20,000 pages long I would probably still read it but enjoy it even more by far than &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;:but then more people would have read it then anyway.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is my next favorite book.I would be pleased if anyone would send me an e-mail but I may not answer for a while because I do not go on the internet much. I don't care if you give me any comments on this:good or bad."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There is nothing quite like this in English literature, nor will there ever be again. Tolkien has crafted a work that sings and hums like the best translation of the Bible...no, it goes beyond the Bible with its more unified visions and greater sense of poetic beauty. The passion and pathos of this epic document of the Elves in the first age of our earth (and let me make that clear -- this is our history, or Earth, not that of a fantasy world) almost overwhelms you. You can say to yourself empirically &quot;I know this is merely a story created by a 20th century linguistics professor&quot; but your heart and spirit will never doubt the tale's truth. That is Tolkien's remarkable achievement: he makes the fantastic more real than your own reality. This isn't &quot;escapism&quot;; if anything, it will draw you closer to the truly beautiful things in our own world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"this is a very beutiful novel but it is not read like a story line like lord of the rings it is like reading the bible. it is also very challenging to read. you really have to concentrate to read this book so if your kids read lord of the ring do not get this book for them. they will not understand it. and they will think it is boring"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Okay, I will admit that I'm only about halfway thru this book, after having read The Hobbit and all 3 LOTR books. Honestly, to me there are too many names, and too many that are too similar. I can't keep straight in my head who is who, who is son of who, who's a Man, who's an Elf, where this place or that place is... I am just confused. I finally got thru the first beginning part where everything and everyone is named and now that there's an actual story happening, I can't follow it- who's that again? Where is that place he's going? And trying to look for the places on the map is a joke- some are written so small you almost don't see them, and then some places have like 3 names each! The people have 3 or 4 names each! How am I supposed to keep track of all this? I am glad that there is an Index of names in the back of the book, but I just don't check it often enough....Just one example of my confusion, the &quot;H&quot; people: Haladin, Haldad, Haldan, Haldar, Haldir, Haleth, Handir, Hareth, Hathaldir, Hathol, Hildor, Himlad, Hithlum, Hurin.... Some of these are places, some are singular people, some are different groups of people...I'm sorry, but this book is confusing me more than anything."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I can hardly add to the more scholarly reviews written about the Silmarillion, so I'll just leave my opinion of the Kindle edition version of the book. Of course, the story is neither embellished nor diminished in its electronic publication, however the paperback version has at least one advantage over the Kindle edition. I am a big fan of the maps that Tolkien included in his books, especially in the Silmarillion, as it helps me to visualize the world he created. When I read the paperback version originally, I found myself referencing the maps, and the genealogical tables rather frequently as the names of places and cast of characters is rather expansive. This task is more cumbersome with the Kindle edition, but not impossible. I would recommend reading the paperback version of the story first, and then deciding if the Kindle edition is worth the $10. Also, the auto-reader function really struggles the pronunciation of Tolkien's writings, as do I."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; takes the reader into a realm that can only be reached by the flight of the imagination.It is told so brilliantly that the reader can see everything in their mind's eye. As the story unfolds they can journey through early life of this world as one of the Ainur and continue on as one of the First Children of Eru, the elves, and on into the beginning of the end as a man.It is a story of undying love and of terrible hate. A story of glorious victory and of miserable defeat.I hope anyone who reads this book thrills in the reading as much as I did"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion provides much of the history that is necessary to fully enjoy the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's mythology, which began as an attempt to provide a setting for the teenage philologist's created languages, is breathtaking in scope. A first time reader might miss much of the power of the work in a struggle with the large number of names, but persistence will pay off. I have re-read &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; more than five times and it continues to reward me. For any who might be intimidated by such a book, fear not! I have read parts of the tale (particularly the story of Beren and Luthien) to my four year old child and he enjoys it immensely. A six year old of my acquaintance sobbed at the end of the story. It is a timeless classic on the order of Homer's epic"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you're reading this review, then you've probably been referred by a Tolkien fan or are a Tolkien fan. If you can get past the first 60 pages of this book (Tolkien throws hundreds of names of people and places and it's hard to keep track), you will find this book to be incredibly rich, powerful, moving, tragic, majestic, and noble. Fans of The Lord of the Rings will love this book. It provides the background for so many of the tales and stories in TLOTR"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy The Silmarillionis a classic in every sense of the word. Thedepth and detail of this book is incredible.Tolkien chronologizes the whole history of Middle Earth,while making up whole cultures to go with it. Theseinclude languages, legends, heroes, and family trees.The book spans a period of perhaps 40,000 years, explainingeverything that happens in Middle Earth that is in any wayrelevant to the story. The Silmarillion and Tolkien's otherbooks represent a life's work, full of devotion andinnovation, making them one of the most popular fantasyof all time."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Another reviewer has said the Silmarillion is \\"the next best thing to the Bible.\\" In my humble opinion, it is much better,and in many ways deeper. From the wonderful creation myth in which the world is SUNG (not just spoken) into existence, and evil is seen literally as a kind of disharmony, to the philosophically brilliant understanding of the human condition by contrasting our human freedom through the \\"gift\\" of death with the Eleve's deathless fate being tied to the world, to the beautiful and spare telling of individual tales, this book continues to bring me delights, tears, and indescribably deep emotions after many readiings. A beautiful and profound meditation on the deep questions of mortality, good and evilI, freedom and fate; I recommend it to anyone who is on the path to becoming more fully human."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this masterpiece soon after my first completion of The Lord of the Rings. When I first started I found the book to be rather boring and I stopped reading it. Three weeks later I picked it up with an open mind and read the book over the course of two weeks. I found this book to be amazing. Tolkien was a profoundly religious man, and The Silmarillion makes it evident. The Silmarillion is his life's work, and it is obvious that he was very passionate about his mythology and his creations. The opening pages are parallel to the book of Genesis, and the overall content is very similiar to that of the Bible. It's similarity to the Bible makes it difficult to understand at times. There are many characters in the book and many different family trees to remember. At times the reading is rather slow, but there are other times in which the content is so exciting that I never wanted it to end. The battles were epic to say the least, and I am very glad that I read this book. I recommend it to anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings and wants to find out about the legends that the characters sing about in their poems and songs. It is difficult sometimes, but in the end you will feel nothing short of satisfaction. That is a gurantee."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I think there is a tendency in the world of Tolkien-worship whereby hardcore fans will always say Silmarillion is better than LotR. I think this is due to the fact that only a hardcore fan can actually walk away from this book and say that its a good piece of literature. Most casual readers never get past page 50. It's a set of myths. It is not a novel. The story is pretty boring. The characters are flat, largely uninteresting, cardboard cut-out typed people. Of course, that's sort of the way it happens in myth/legend. As a made up history for a fantasy world, it does its job about as well as it can, but that does not make this an enjoyable read or a good piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What makes Tolkien great is that he understands that modernity is a lie; that there was a better world inside of man long ago, and if there wasn't, well then there should have been.It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of lose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those that live there. We learn many things as what different names of beings and places mean. This helps add a dimension to the stories that take place there.I would say that it would help to read Lord of the Rings first because it is more comfortable when getting to know the area and characters. Then we can see where they came form; relationships are better understood.Much of The Silmarillion can be taken in small bits and then sit back and contemplate how it could have been.One does not just cut through any cultural history book for light reading and just shelving it. This is a cultural history book and will require rereading.When people talk about the war I think back to which one they are talking about. Or are they just referring to one of the many orc skirmishes.You do not have to be a Tolkien fan to find interest in this collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Bieng a large fan of History ranging from Japanese, Chinese, Norse, English, German, etc. I have thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece. Not a large fan of Fantasy books however I do prefer Historic Fiction. Being a fan of Lord of the Rings (both of book and movie), I bought this for more thirst of Middle-Earth, Elves, Men, and other names and places I had read though did not know. My first read with this book left be utterly speechless at the depth and richness. I soon began a journey of exploring more into Tolkein's works but I was always drawn back to The Silmarillion. It has become a yearly traditry for 5 years now to read it three times a year along with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy for.This book has everything from romance to heroic deeds to despair and saddness to mythology. People complain it's to long and lengthy and thier are to many names to remember which is true but that adds to the rich experience of the storyline. For me, it's like diving into another world that I get engrossed with each time reading the story. Everytime I can feel the love between Beren and L&uacute;thien, I can feel the saddness of the cursed love between T&uacute;rin and N&iacute;niel, and the despair of the Elves and thier wars with Morgoth. This is a deffinent must read for fans who love History, love Lord of the Rings and Tolkein's works, and can endure reading a heifty, dense literary work."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a prequel to The Lord of The Rings. It starts with the creation of Middle Earth and how it came about. It talks about the fall of one of The Valor and the first wars. This book is a must read for any Lord of The Rings fan, it gives you the history and fills in some of the gaps the Lord of The Rings leaves for us. However, as I say in my title the book is touch and go. The book is well developed in some areas and in others you can notice the lack of development. I will not lie this book is poorly written, but this can be attributed to the death of Tolkien before it's completion. I found the book at times hard to follow and it was often slow reading. The ease of reading the Lord of The Rings is not present in this book. The jumps in time or place are often abrupt and jagged, almost irritating. If you are not a patient reader, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Tolkien Trilogy is composed of the following: The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings. (The three parts of the LoTR are not a trilogy, as Tolkien himself insisted.) The Hobbit may be taken as the first chapter of the LoTR - a complete story in itself, related to what follows, and chronologically close to what happens in the big book. The Silmarillion is not at all close chronologically to the other two stories - the story takes place much earlier. It may be considered a sort of prequel. But there are many different stories in this book - a string of related stories, rather than one whole story. It's full of proper names, especially personal names, only some of them recurring in LoTR, or even within The Silmarillion itself. Tolkien intended this to be a sort of \\"record\\" of events, names, and places, as though they really existed. He was trying to create a mythology for England, and thus the chaotic if creative explosion of names. You can't make a mythology realistic without them.This book may be used as a sort of guide to the other two parts of the trilogy. Some of the names recur in the later saga and reading this book, or rather referring to it, helps shed light on these. You can read about Sauron's origins here, for example, who after all is THE eponymous Lord of the Rings himself.This book is really a co-production of Tolkien and his son Christopher. What happened was that Tolkien left behind numerous drafts and revisions of the book, made over half a century, most of them preceding the other two books. The trouble is that these drafts and revisions are self-inconsistent. Tolkien could not make up his mind, and kept making changes. I have the feeling that if he had lived another hundred years he would still not have been able to finalize the book. So, after his death, his son Christopher took what he fancied from the pile of rubble and built a tower out of it, throwing the rest away.It's difficult to know if Tolkien himself would have approved. He kept changing his own mind anyway. After the LoTR, he found many faults with The Hobbit itself, and could have re-written the whole thing! Tolkien may or may not have liked the tower his son built, but he would have recognized the bricks.With the confusing barrage of names, the internal incosistency, the lack of imprimatur from the master, this book is not easy to read except by die-hard Tolkien fanatics. It's still useful as reference tool, for reasons I just mentioned. The last chapter, describing the Rings of Power, is particularly relevant to the other parts of the Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've been reading this tome aloud to my wife, and I'm surprised I love it so much. Having enjoyed The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit since I was a boy, I thought the history of the Silmarils, which is the meaning of the word Silmarillion, would be interesting, if not overly tedious. I confess after the first four chapters, the text bogs down; I skipped ch. 14 all together. But the stories I now understand, the history of certain characters, the doom of the elves, and the full tale of their songs, I wouldn't want to have missed.I love the Ainulindale, the story of creation, where Eru, whom the elves call Iluvatar, sings through the voices of angelic beings to create the world and foretell its history. It's a beautiful spin on the Genesis story. Once the official history of the Simarils begins, the details begin to pile up; but worthy is the reader who perseveres for the tales that follow build in excitement. For Lord of the Rings fans, are you curious about the doom that plagues Elrond and his family? Did you know that Galadriel was hundreds of years older than Elrond and was born in Valinor, the western haven to which the elves go in their white ships? Do you want to know how Sauron become the Dark Lord, and what Gandalf meant by covering the land in a _second_ darkness? All of those answers are in this book.Tolkien gives us a powerfully beautiful world in Middle Earth, and this book magnifies the wonder seen in the Lord of the Rings. Why do Dwarves and Elves distrust each other? It stems from the bloodshed over the Silmarils, jewels crafted by Feanor, the most gifted and most headstrong of any elf who made by God. The jewels captured and radiated the light of the two trees Yavanna planted to give light to the world. They captivated the heart of anyone who saw them, and when one of them was set amid the Dwarf-cut gems of a spectacular necklace and worn by Luthien, the most beautiful elf to ever live, the light of heaven shone radiantly on earth for a short while. That and many more stories await you in this exciting history of elves and men in Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is definately one of my favorite books. The characters are so determined and loyal to their cause, however hopeless it may be. It had me quite depressed for a while because most of the stories are very tragic.The book isn't confusing at all in my opinion, it's just written like the bible. If it wasn't written like that it wouldn't have half the depth and beauty that it had.JRR Tolkien would be proud."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is a masterpiece of epic fantasy. It has arythme of its own that is both deep and beautiful. I suggest reading it aloud; the moving language and many strange (but wonderful) names are a pleasure to speak and hear."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Many people treat the Silmarillion as some sort of followup to Lord of the Rings. I did when I first gave it a stab. It isn't. It is Tolkien's masterpiece, and his life's passion. It serves not only as the foundation to Middle Earth, but it truly is Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings is merely a happy byproduct. It isn't easy reading, but it is evocative and far more powerful then any other Tolkien work. It is no polished novel, but an edited collection. It's only a reflection of what Tolkien might have been able to do if he published it himself, but nevetheless it is high tragedy, and a rare gem. If you like this the History of Middle Earth series also has similar gems scattered about the endless analysis."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is mythology at its best. I have read the rest: The Ilyad, The Odyssee, Le Morte D'Arhtur, and this one is the new halmark. It tells various stories that develop Middle Earth and its history. There is adventure, tragedy and romance. A complete book that leaves you wanting to learn more about the World of Middle Earth. Tolkein weaves a twisted tale of good, evil and everything in between. the stories are remarkably human considering the charactes are not. Very enjoyable as it is mind bending as a truely original piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It might take you a LONG time to read this book, because it is like driving a car through mud. The details are exquisite, and if you miss one, it messes the story up. So, when you read this, make sure you have LOTS &amp; LOTS of time! The time spent is for a lot of info tho, so give it a try!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is an amazing story told in a grand and beautiful style. The lyric &quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;, the painfully beautiful &quot;Beren and Luthien&quot; (my personal favorite-I'm sure I'm not alone) and the grand story of Numenor, hideously glorious, even in its fall are some-but not all-of the highlights. The geneologies are a bit confusing (I'm still not sure how Galadriel is related to Feanor, but I think she is his half-brother's daughter or something)but the characters- Valar, Maiar, Elves, Men, Dwarves, monsters, etc. are truly absorbing. From Feanor's challange in the royal square of Tirion to the fight of Huan and wolf-Sauron to the monumental voyage of Earendil to the awakening of elves at Ciuvienen to the enchantment of Thingol by Melian the Maia...This book is just absolutely full of grand and exciting moments. Don't be put off by the antique style, that is one of the beauties of the book. Also one last piece of advise-don't read about Ungoliant just before going to bed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion consists of a history of Middle Earth from the creation through most of the period before the Lord of the Rings stories take place. It is written as a history, not as a modern novel (unlike Lord of the Rings); and so do not read it expecting a novel. However, if you are very addicted to the Lord of the Rings saga and plan to read it again, the Silmarillion will definitely provide a lot of key historic information that will enhance your enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings. It will help you understand the origins of the races and many of the names and places mentioned in the songs and tales which may have seemed rather obscure the first time around. Think &quot;historic background&quot; and not &quot;exciting prequel&quot; and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"An epic backstory to the classic fantasy tales. Mr. Tolkien's vision is apparent throughout and what a vision it was. The tales of the ages before \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" are just as massive and even more tragic, which makes the tales within this book so much more powerful. The tale of Beren and Luthien is just as beautiful as any of the great tragic romances. And the way the narrative is constructed adds this feeling of glory and splendor to the elves of old. And the tale of Numenor is awesome too. The only drawback to this book is that it takes a lot of time to get to the good stuff. The beginning isn't unimportant, but it is a little dry. It's not until the rebellion Feanor and the later chapters that it really picks up. No matter what, this is a great pick for any fantasy reader."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a J. R. R. Tolkien Fan and have had the pleasure of reading his books this is a great way to enjoy his classic works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"At first glance, one may seemed overwhelmed with the Silmarillion thinking that it is simply too deep/confusing for them, and not what they were looking for. They might have been interested in Tolkien books like The Lord of The Rings, and The Hobbit, but may decide that The Silmarillion is a book of a different sort; not what they were looking for, or one might decide that it was just down right boring. This would be a big mistake!!!! The Silmarillion was an EXCELLENT book, one which will not fail to please any Tolkien fan. It gives a lot of insight into the Elder Days, or the very early stages of Middle-earth (1st Age). The tales are simply very enjoyable, and are put together very well. John Tolkien made no mistake appointing Christopher, his son, as his editorial heir. I can guarantee 99.9% of Tolkien fans would enjoy this book very much, and it would make a great birthday present too (that is, if the Tolkien fan you're thinking of hasn't already bought himself a copy of his own)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Still worth 5 stars. One has to overlook a couple of inconsistencies with LOTR, such as sleeping elves, Orcs attacking during the daylight (and all day long, for that matter), and some inconsistencies of logic, fauna \\"thriving\\" in a lightless middle earth, etc. It also reads like a history book spanning thousands of years (which, of course, it exactly is, fictitiously) and therefore it leaves little room for character development.Despite these problems, which would ruin any other book, the positive aspects more than offset the deficiencies. There are brave heroes with moral dilemmas, epic trials and travails, and above all an imagery and imagination that is other worldly, and on a grand scale and very rich in content. One could well imagine dozens of movies being made from this collection, and all would fall short of the visions this book brings. It is so rich in content, in fact, that unless you're already familiar with Tolkien's Middle-Earth, you may find yourself lost in all the names, times, and places. It would be a very tough read, but ultimately, it would still be very rewarding."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This old book was in excellent condition. Very good seller, I'd buy from again."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A very interesting book to say the least. It recounts most of the history of Middle Earth from before its creation, up to a brief recounting of the events of The Lord of the Rings. It fills in many of the blanks and answers many questions an interested reader may have after completing The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. However, it is a very slow read at times, rather like the Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles in the Bible. Indeed, in many of the stories recounted, at least a shadow of biblical inspiration is hard to deny. Do not expect a pure story, but rather a long recollection of sometimes related, and sometimes not related, events. I gained a renewed respect for the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien through this work, as faithfully published by his son, Christopher, because of the incredible depth it contains. Perhaps my only criticism, beyond what I have already mentioned, is the confusion that can be incurred on the reader by the many and complex names of peoples, lands, locations, cities, and individuals of the various races. Nevertheless, the fact that Tolkien was so precise is a testament to his desire to create a believable world, and for this reason, it is tough to condemn him for giving many people and things two or even three names. If you love Tolkien and are an avid reader, I recommend The Silmarillion. If you casually enjoy the world the Tolkiens have wrought, or just watched the movies, I caution that you vary well may get bogged down in the first 30 pages or fewer."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I think the Silmarillion adds depth to all the other books he's written. I've read most. Although it was unfinished it doesn't affect it's powerful messages. At times I got bogged down and found it dry, but that was a signal to put it down and pick up the book the next night and approach fresh and even reread a few pages before continuing on. If you've read the Lord of the Rings, I think this will give you even more enjoyment. This is a book that you must read word for word, slowly getting used to the character's names."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion, written by Tolkien, covers the history of the world in the ages before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. There are those who say that it is not for everyone. I suggest that, if this book is not in your library, in hardcover, and perused once a year or so, you are not truly a lover of pure fantasy, but are instead hanging on at the edges, and are probably an afficianado of one of fantasy's less prevalent sub-genres. I'm not judging, I'm just saying...The book is written as a condensed history of the ancient world, that wonderfully eroded bedrock upon which stands Middle Earth. It covers the creation of the world, and the advent of the gods and of the various races, including men, but is mostly about that most ascendent of the ancient races; the Eldar, the Elves. It is, in fact, their story, and helps the reader to understand their standing in the world at the time of LOTR.In the Silmarillion, one is introduced to the origins of the main protagonists in LOTR, including Gandolf's people, Aragorn's ancestors, Beren and Luthien, and even Sauron, in his role as the lietenant of Morgoth, the great Ancient Enemy. One also discovers that thread of history that leads to Shelob.I don't believe in spoilers appearing in reviews; but I will say that the description of the High King Fingolfin's challenge of single combat to Morgoth is probably the most thrilling 2-300 words of fiction in the English language.You often hear about \\"must-reads\\", and I agree with many of such assertions, but The Silmarillion must stand at the top of that list."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The book arrived in perfect condition and in just a couple of days after ordering it.

I am getting ready to read all his books over again. Yet this is the book that stands out from the hobbit, the trilogy, or unfinished tales.This book is slightly more complicated to read than the hobbit or trilogy, but it is also better. An army so big that Sauron's army fled. The pact of elves and men that brought Sauron down at the end of the second age. This books allows you to understand the Lord of the Rings Trilogy much better."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I've been a big fan of Tolkien for the last 25 years or so. I just recently read The Silmarillion for the first time. I was moved by Tolkien's ideas and the beauty of his language, however most people would find this book hard to read since there are so many characters (many with more than one name). The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are better, I think, since they have characters and situations we can more easily connect with. Read them first. Then, if you like, go on to The Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion explains all of that mythical history that had me, along with many other readers simply intrigued. The legends and myths found in this book are really facinating.

It recounts the entire mythological history of Middle Earth, from the beginning in Illuvatar's halls, right onto a summary of the Lord of the Rings novels. About as cool as you can get. It's a wonder if in a thousand years, people won't take this book as holy text and start a new religion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have recently finished reading &quot;The Silmarillon&quot;, and I have to say it is one of the best novels I have read.

And now, here is the Silmarillion! With this book, Tolkien proved to the world that he was one of the best (if not, the BEST) writer of the 20th century. This book provides essential Middle-Earth background to any Tolkien fan, BUT it is not for your typical Joe Schmoe reader; &quot;The Simarillion&quot; is a difficult book to read.

This is an audio book that you can listen to again and again and come away with something new each time. It even makes reading the book much more rewarding and easy.

A friend of mine recommended the Silmarillion, and I am very happy I paid eight bucks for it.Tolkien's Silmarillion is an account of the First Age of Middle-earth and Beleriand, beginning with its creation, the fall of Melkor, the coming of the elves, and of course the Silmarills, jewels created by Feanor of singular beauty. My favorite story is the Tale of Beren and Luthien.Let it be noted, however, that this book is arranged differently than his other novels, and is sometimes rather difficult to follow along with the timeline. Many questions from the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are answered,and we hear what characters such as Elrond and Galadriel did during this period.

I asked my brother-in-law and he told me about the Silmarillion and told me it was only for the hardcore fans. I picked it up after I finished LOTR and I guess, no, believe I am hardcore fan then. I loved this book completely. The most comprehensive and real emotion and storytelling I have ever read. The tale of Turin Turambar and all the many characters, so complex and eventful. You begin liking a particular few characters and then you ca switch when you hear what they did to another character you grew to love. Not that you hate any of them but you feel as you read it up that these are great characters and events! Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is not the easiest book to read, but for those addicted to the &quot;truth&quot; of Midddle-Earth and its inhabitants, an absolute necessity. It explains all the history of the beginning, the interludes and the finality of this magnificent universe. It pulls together many histories that were omitted in the recounting of earlier stories. Tolkien's concept of the beginning of the earth surely rivals that of the Bible's Genesis. The only problem found by some readers is that the &quot;accounts&quot; are not necessarily time-sequential; but if you can understand this, the reading will make each reader wizer and more fulfilled by this metaphor of our existance and our dreams."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a journey through the imagination of J. R. R. Tolkien. It begins with the creation of Arda (Middle Earth) and gives us a history of the world up to the Lord of the Rings. The novel is split into four main parts; The creation, The First Age, the Second Age, and the Third Age.The Creation sets the stage of our story by telling the story of how Arda, Elves, Men, Dwarves and all living creatures came to be. We see how the land and sea are formed and we are told of the fallen that bring evil into the world.The First Age tells the story of the many Wars between the Elves and the Evil One (and all of his Orcs/Goblins). We also see the transition between the old world of the past and the new world of Middle Earth from LOTR.The Second Age revolves around Men and their growing influence in the world. The live on an island called Numenor aka Atalante (sound familiar). Here they live and prosper for generations as we read of their exploits. The Second Age ends with tragedy as you can guess from the Numenor's other name.Finally, The Third Age tells stories regarding the Ring of Power. We learn more about the Ring and how it was forged, and we are given insights from the perspectives of various characters concerning the forging of, search for, and destruction of the Ring.All in all, this is a GREAT history of Middle Earth. This is Tolkien's real life's work, as he started writing it in his early teens and worked on it until his death. We are given insights into history and language and we are transported to another world that seems that it could have really existed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is, well, Elvish (duh)- it is &quot;the epic history of the Elves in middle earth&quot;. However, if you are loyal to Legolas only, this book is probably not for you, being as he isn't in here. Galadriel is, and Earendil is, as are Turin, Tuor, Elros and Elrond. Frodo is mentioned on the second-to-last page of the story *grins* , and Sam is indirectly mentioned *cracks knuckles*, but other than that, no hobbits (drat). Includes a rather incomplete Elvish dictionary at the end."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"After reading The Lord of the Rings, I fell in love with Tolkien's fantasy universe that he created. Then, a friend of mine, also a Tolkien fan, told me to read the Silmarillion. It is the best book I have ever read. This epic will make your heart leap and be broken. No other author can fit so much sadness and happiness into one story. You almost feel like a part of the mighty tale when you seige Angband as Fingolfin, die saving Beren as Finrod Felagund, and fall in love with a mortal as Luthien Tinuviel, fairest of all the children of Iluvatar. No other book will make your emotions and mind stir as much as this one. Although the beginning is a little slow, endure and you will be rewarded. If you have read The Lord of the Rings and wish to understand better the creation of Arda and the First Age, read this book. In my opinion, it far out ranks the original trilogy. Those who didn't like this book can be described as nothing else but complete fools. Take my word. Read this book.

Tolkein kept writing this book his whole life which I find amazing. I especially wanted to know the love story of Beren and Luthien being as he called himself Beren and his dear wife Luthien and the names are on their gravestones. Fathomless and wonderful reading in a beautifully illustrated hardback book to keep and pass on to a loved one. What a mind!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"One of my favorite aspects of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings books is the completeness of the world that he created. I never cease to be amazed by the history and lore that infuse those books, such that the reader feels that they must surely be a true history of some people, somewhere. Thus, The Silmarillion came as no surprise to me. For most of his life, Tolkien kept hundreds of notebooks full of his imagined backstory about the inhabitants of Middle Earth, for his own fun and reference while writing, and on the assumption that someday he would pull them into publishable form. After his death, his son, Christopher took on the task.Parts of the beginning of the book read like the \\"begats\\" from the Old Testament of the Bible, listing a mind-blowing profusion of characters and their roles. I would likely have tossed the book aside had it not been the monthly read for the high school club I supervise. Then it would settle into a marvelous tale reminiscent of Nordic myth. Only to stop again with a geographical study of such yawn-inducing detail that you could follow step by step on the kindly included map. Only for my students did I persevere.After throwing so many names and places at you, and you should be so lucky as to only have to learn one name for each character and local-they all have at least two or three (Elves, Dwarves, and humans all give a single entity their own monikers in their own languages-for that matter, even those three races are given numerous names), Tolkien does bring it round to useful purpose in the end. Keep in mind that there are maps, genealogical charts, and a complete list of characters in the back of the book, and press forward without worrying if you can not keep it all straight, because once past those sections, you are in for an adventure through the depths of Tolkien's imagination.The narrative hits its stride about a hundred pages in and carries the reader willingly along through the trials and triumphs of the various races and individuals. Christopher Tolkien did a masterful job of organizing his father's writings; superb editing is apparent because the motivations and shifting allegiances are clearly delineated-despite the massive cast and histories of various peoples, I never felt lost in the shuffle.As you read The Silmarillion another side of Tolkien also takes shape in your mind. In addition to the creator of fantastical worlds and tense plot lines, the theological and philosophical sides of the man become readily apparent within the souls of his characters. I loved seeing the moral and ethical dilemmas into which he plunged his characters and watching how he resolved them, as it spoke volumes about the author's personal thought processes.As difficult as the first third of the book was to get through, I would definitely call it worth it for fans of The Lord of the Rings. I look forward to revisiting those books with a new found knowledge of the \\"history\\" of the characters, as many things which are alluded to in The Ring are explained in The Silmarillion. Fans of the trilogy will begin to recognize many familiar names and places as they near the end of The Silmarillion. And the last two thirds of the book was sheer, epic adventure as only Tolkien can deliver. The writing style was very interesting as well, very much in the style of Scandinavian myth and lore, and quite different from the style in which his other books were written.This is really not a book for those who disliked The Lord of the Rings, but a fun read for fans, or a great starting point for those who have yet to read the other books and would like to begin with a little backstory."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of lose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those that live there. We learn many things as what different names of beings and places mean. This helps add a dimension to the stories that take place there.I would say that it would help to read Lord of the Rings first because it is more comfortable when getting to know the area and characters. Then we can see where they came form; relationships are better understood.Much of The Silmarillion can be taken in small bits and then sit back and contemplate how it could have been.One does not just cut through any cultural history book for light reading and just shelving it. This is a cultural history book and will require rereading.When people talk about the war I think back to which one they are talking about. Or are they just referring to one of the many orc skirmishes.You do not have to be a Tolkien fan to find interest in this collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is much more challenging than the Hobbit!

I agree that it is like reading a historic or scriptural text, but the stories of Beren and Luthien, and Hurin, and Erendil are wonderful. Knowing the history enriches your experience of the Lord of the Rings. I ordered the book on tape because I have eye problems which make reading difficult, but I have also found it a lot easier to 'get through' the dry parts this way.If you are looking for a gripping novel this is NOT the book for you.

There was hardly any dialogue between characters and it was basically just a long and boring narratrion of what once happened. Also, there were way two many names in this book. Even with the index of names i found it hard to remember who was who especially since a lot of the names are simmilar in spelling. I also did not like that tolkein just rambles on an on with names like those of places and the son and grand son and greatgrandson of people or elvs that have no signififcance to the story. In fact, i skipped an entire chapter on the names and characteristics of the land because i couldent bear the thought of reading this. I thought this book was a bore and i kept waiting for something excitting to happen. When something exciting does haappen it is not that excitting due to the banal narration and hardly any dialogue.

R. R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion (Ballantine, 1977)availability: endlessly in printIn the sixties, something changed. Perhaps Mother Church realized that people were turning away from her; perhaps a cadre of teachers decided the younger generation needed to get in touch with its cultural roots; whatever. We ended up with a course in either the religion, literature, or both departments at many universities: The Bible As Literature. Seems they decided that the definition of \\"literature\\" (as it all too often is) is \\"something that's very difficult to read, but should be read by school students because someone, somewhere, has deemed it of great importance.\\" (And thus Charles Dickens continues to be foisted on high school students everywhere.) And under this definition, the Bible-- which most certainly is difficult to read and is considered of great importance by tens of millions the world over, fits. Some would even attach a broader definition to it-- that it contains a bang-up plot, pretty good characterization, an elucidating theme, etc. Problem is, when it boils right down to the soup bone, the Bible is not all that well-written. Certainly, a number of other creation legends are entirely more readable and fun, despite having far fewer buckets of blood splashed across their pages.Wandering into all this is a linguist who wants to create a creation myth for a world he's developed, a word loved by tens of millions the world over. He's already got the second half of the definition, so all he had to do was pen something difficult to read. And he did so, in spades. The Silmarillion is without a doubt, the thickest (language-wise), most obtuse, hardest-to-follow book I've attmpted since I gave up on nineteenth-century authors who were paid by the page for their stuff. I gave it the best shot I could, but it fell by the wayside."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love Tolkein's books, but as a reader, not a student. Therefore, I look at his books as a reader of STORIES, not an intellectual exercise in world building. Therefore, I have to say, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is a boring textbook exercise on documenting the bloodlines that Tolkein wrote about so brilliantly in the Hobbit and Trilogy books.The writing style is documentarian, tinder-box dry and dull. There's not an ounce of emotion in the entire volume. It's more like a thesauraus than a novel.If you want an engrossing story for adults, read &quot;LOTR.&quot; If you are looking for a more childlike adventure, pick up &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; But don't buy &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; unless you'd get excited by looking through a Farmer's Almanac/World Book encyclopedia of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read this book in January, 1978, right after it came out. At the time I was nineteen and had just read _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ the year before for the first time. Like many Middle-Earth readers, I found _The Silmarillion_ to be a difficult read, and not nearly as satisfying as LotR. Now, 25 years later I have just read _The Silmarillion_ for a second time, and I have a completely different response to it.What made me like this book so much better the second time around? I think two things were at work: age and \`commentaries'. Taking the latter first; in all the blizzard of Tolkein hoopla recently, I came across Tom Shippey's books about Tolkein and Middle-Earth. Both books were erudite, yet illuminating about Tolkein's work. While these books focused primarily on LotR, they also each spent considerable space \`commenting' on the Silmarillion. From these books I received a greater understanding of what Tolkein was doing, and also the motivation I needed to revisit the Silmarillion.But I think that age and maturity were really the primary factors in my greater enjoyment the second time through _The Silmarillion_. Even though we all read Shakespeare, Milton and the Greeks in high school and college; most of us don't really appreciate it. Many of us don't yet have the life experience to appreciate and understand tragedy. And I believe that is what made this book inaccessible to me the first time around. This time I found the book fascinating, gripping, and full of heartfelt emotion. I was brought to tears by the rash deeds of the Noldor: the kinslaying at Alqualonde and the burning of the ships at Losgar. And O the story of Turin... I realize now much better than I did 25 years ago, how closely the themes of these stories resemble the reality we live in.So... with a caveat to the reader about accessibility, I heartily recommend this book. Especially if you read it once before years ago, and were disappointed. Revisit it, I urge you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read the LOTR Trilogy, then the Hobbit. When I purchased and skimmed through the Silmarillion I realized that I would never be able to get past all of the similar (to my eyes) names. So I went out on the internet and found the the audio books for the LOTR trilogy and also the audio book for the Silmarillion. What a joy! I first listed to the LOTR trilogy. I figured I would wind up not pay close attention to the audio book but I was wrong. The Audio Book narrated by Rob Ingles is perfect! I was glued to my headset for the exciting battle scenes and enthralled for the dramatic parts. I would have never made it through the Silmarillion if I had only tried to read the book. The narrator for the Silmarillion is another gentleman but he was perfect for it. The names in the Silmarillion became recognizable to me. Now I can pick up the book and comprehend what is going on. I have let friends borrow my audio books and now they are hooked also. I'm an adult and I haven't had anyone read a story to me since I was child. I'm glad I've discovered these audio books. I highly recommend them, especially for the Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The published Silmarillion is not what J.R.R. Tolkien wanted for most of his adult life to be published as the Silmarillion. It's a short compilation of much of his epic-length work, not necessarily the best tellings of any of his stories, that was culled together in the years immediately following his death.The principal problem is that Tolkien crafted beautiful stories, but most of his efforts at writing them as full-length novels ended in failure. The figures of the Silmarillion loom large, but always have a human side to them. I think the Silmarillion's cast of characters is at least as intriguing as that in The Lord of the Rings, but lacks the time for the sheer depth of subtle shading that made LotR a brilliant read.The highlights of the Silmarillion are unquestionably the stories that center around its titanic characters - the clash of egos in Fanor and the theft of the Silmarils, the rapturous love story of Beren and L&uacute;thien, the operatically dark T&uacute;rin Turambar, and the epic Fall of Gondolin all would have made for novels that would blow any other written fantasy out of the water. As it stands, as stories, they are still gripping enough in the Silmarillion that they'll be more than worth reading. Some of the exposition between can get tedious if you're not yet into Tolkien's world, or if you're expecting yet another Lord of the Rings.The Silmarillion, as a whole, is an epic worldbuilding and mythology that no fantasist after Tolkien ever came close to. It has a definite, but by no means simple, view of the world that makes it quite relevant as literature (as opposed to the normal Manichaean dualism that dominates Tolkien-derivative fantasy). The morality of Tolkien is interesting and challenging, and if you really think about it very little fantasy even comes close.Get, read, and enjoy the Silmarillion for what it is: a mythology, complete with great tales. If you hunger for more of these stories afterward, volumes 1-5 and 10 and 11 of the History of Middle-Earth series are dedicated to them - they are more scholarly, but the re-approach to many of the stories can be enlightening and thrilling. I heartily recommend it all to anyone who can't get enough of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien is the godfather of fantasy writing, no doubt about it. If you liked &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and loved &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, you're gonna go crazy about this!This book takes you back before all of Tolkien's other Middle Earth books, right back to the beginning of time, and goes up to right before &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (For those of you who've only seen the movies, this is where they got a lot of the stuff in the prologue to &quot;The Fellowship etc.&quot;).Bare in mind that this is not easy reading and certainly not a children's book like &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. If you're not a big Tolkien-fan, you might find some passages too boring and complicated. But for anyone who loves the Middle Earth universe, this is a must-buy!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is, basically, the summary of Tolkien's mythology, his life's work. It is the story of the cosmology and shaping of the world and its origins in the First Age, the tragic story of the Second Age, and a summary of the Third Age, in which the Lord of the Rings takes place. It is done from a completely Elvish perspective, with men taking something of a secondary role, and with Hobbits being briefly mentioned- that rights, virtually NO HOBBITS.That's right. This is very different in nature from LOTR. This story is generally meant to give the higher level of myth in his world- the stories of the great powers and summaries of ages past by their great events- in addition to some of the lower level stories. Something along the lines of this book is what Tolkien had in mind to compliment stories like the LOTR when he began writing his mythology, as he puts it in his letter to Milton Waldman (prefacing the book, very illuminating in itself), &quot;I had in mind to make a body of... connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story... which I could dedicate simply to: to England...&quot;As for the quality, it is achingly beautiful and piercingly poignant in its greatest moments in a way akin to that of the LOTR, but different, probably because of the Elvish manner, and also because of its larger, cosmological scope.Finally, I think that anyone who is searching for the beauty of the LOTR and the Hobbit but can stand a lack of hobbits or who REALLY wants to understand LOTR (thanks not only to the myth but the handy language reference in the back of the book, since another one of Tolkien's motivations to write it was linguistical) should definitely get this book.(One more thing. The Silmarillion was compiled after J.R.R. Tolkien by his son, Christopher Tolkien, from his J.R.R. Tolkien's incredibly extensive writings on Middle-Earth, and some elements that J.R.R. Tolkien had intended for the included stories, such as the frame-story for the Ainulindale, have been removed, so if you are absolutley in love with Tolkien and can't get enough, you should look into getting the 12 or so big volumes of Tolkien's many writings called the Book of Lost Tales, also complied after J.R.R.'s death.)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"of all tolkiens books , the silmarillion was by far my favorite. After seeing the movie i began reading the series.Once i heard of the silmarillion i was dying to buy it for the elves were so mysterious and i wanted to know of their past and their origins.i was captivated by the tales of the elves never had i thought that their history was so filled with sorrow, war, and happiness.i sort of knew why the elves didnt do anything during lord of the rings, they were simply tired of all the wars that they had suffered that they could now leave behind, and compared to the wars that the elves had endured ,the war of the rings was nothing.i loved hearing of the old elven kingdoms that would rival lothlorien making it seem like a normal forest.i never knew that the elves were such a diverse people.they were divided into so many groups the high races of elves and the lower races of elves all of which were divided into groups themselves.to think of all the ruins that were found in lotr were active places in the silmarillion.well i hope that u enjoyed this book as much as i did and would give this book a chance cause it may have been slow at times but it was well worth it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is the greatest of all Tolkien's works I believe. It is an epic novel that deals with the very shaping of Middle-Earth and life itself. The book begins with the song of anuir and the shaping of the world and Illuvatar's Children (Elves {The Noldor}, and Men {The Edain}). It shows how Melkor became lustful and greedy and fell from his place of high honour.And how he then desired to rule all. And all the while when this was talking place at one point an elf was born, he was named Feanor. And he was the greatest smithy, and the most powerful elf of all time. He created the silmarils. And Melkor (later named Morgoth by Feanor after \\"The Rape Of The Silmarils\\") It talks of the elves exile from valinor and their war with Melkor.This Book I believe is a wonderful book and all people who enjoy this type of mythologic book should read it. I feel though that this book should be read prior to the other works of J.R.R. Tolkien because it gives an history of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This novel is for those who truly believe in Middle Earth. If you are not completely taken with Tolkien's realm and fantasy, then you won't apprectiate the beautiful, stunning technique he uses to descibe the coming of the Valar in the first few chapters. You won't notice the little things that later come into play big time in the LOTR novels(for example, how the Ents come into existance). The Silmarillion is a history, and if one has studied the history of our world then he or she knows that a history book front to back has too much to be absorbed for a single reading. Take your time with this book and appreciate it for what it offers, an insiders look into what the inhabitants of middle earth consider to be the history of their own world."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I will admit that I have had many false starts with the Silmarillion. The causal reader will be put off by all the pages leading up to the part of the awakening of the Elves in Middle Earth, and their journey to the West. That is when things take off.Be warned. The Silmarillion is written like the Bible. It is a distant and sometimes cold narrative of great events in an ancient world. Yet, there is a gripping beauty to it. And anyone that does not shed a tear when reading the tale of Beren and Luthien should have their pulse checked.In many respects, the Silmarillion is a far superior piece of literature than even the Lord of the Rings. Do youself a favor--pick it up, and see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Even though The Silmarillion was published post humously, it was, for the most part, written before the LOTR. It is compiled from JRR's notes and writings on the history of Middle Earth, and just explains so much that went on, leading up to the events of the Third Age that we know so well. Especially interesting, if you ever wanted to know more about the history of the Elves, of Sauron and Morgoth, and of what origin Gandalf is. To me, this book should be read by every person who reads LOTR, as it is a companion. I had to go back to re-read the trilogy again, right after finishing The Silmarillion. And you'll also be happy to know, it's written in the same completely absorbing manner that Tolkein wrote LOTR in."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's more than slightly staggering to consider: the epic fantasy \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to be the tail end of Tolkien's invented history. The \\"Bible\\" of Middle-Earth, the \\"Silmarillion\\" stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the creation of the many Rings of Power -- and the One Ring of Sauron; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; fans of Hobbits or Dwarves will not find as much here. It will also answer some questions that \\"Hobbit\\" and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made -- what is Numenor? Who are the Valar? This includes those things, and much more.The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It's more formal and archaic in tone; Tolkien did not get as \\"into\\" the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.It's clear to see, while reading this, the extent of Tolkien's passion for his invented history. Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened. In a genre clogged with shallow sword'n'sorcery, Tolkien's coherent, carefully-written backstory is truly unique.If you can take the formal prose and mythical style, this is a treasure, and a must-read for anyone who loved LOTR or \\"Hobbit.\\" Only after reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" can readers truly appreciate Tolkien's literary accomplishments, and the full scope of the Middle-Earth that is glimpsed in his more famous books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Since I think most readers considering this edition of The Silmarillion are familiar with the book's contents, I am reviewing here the binding, paper, print, et cetera. If you have not read The Silmarillion, and/or have doubts about whether you'll like it enough to invest in a nice hardcover edition, then you probably should start with a paperback copy (with the up-to-date text).This is certainly the best edition of The Silmarillion so far published in the United States. In the UK, HarperCollins published a 30th anniversary edition in 2007, and a leather/india paper edition in 2001, both of which are marginally higher quality than this one, but both are very difficult to find in the US, and cost three to five times what Amazon charges for this edition. Easton Press also has an edition of The Silmarillion, in full leather with hubbed spine and gilt edges no less, but it is only available as part of a five volume set including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, at a price of nearly $300. The details:*The cloth binding is rugged and attractive, coated with a semi-glossy protectant so that it resembles leather somewhat, but without the texture of leather or leatherette. It is a very sturdy sewn signature binding which will survive multiple readings easily, which is particularly appropriate to The Silmarillion, since most of all of Tolkien's major works readers tend to re-read sections over and over, and use the book somewhat like a reference book. The spine is foil stamped in gold, and the stamping is sharp and good looking.*The paper stock is the same as was used in the 1992 hardcover box set of Lord of the Rings illustrated by Alan Lee (the book's dimensions are the same also). This paper is coated and slightly glossy, and takes ink very well. It also resists permanent staining or marking (dirty fingerprints or other stains easily wipe off with a damp paper towel). The printing itself is dark, clear, and consistent. In the year I've owned this book, even in the humid climate I live in, I have found absolutely NO transference of ink, either from text or the color plates. Given the glossy stock, this is an indicator of very high quality production. The fold out map of Beleriand (and part of Middle-earth) is glued inside the back cover, and is a lovely full color glossy representation, much less prone to tearing than many other maps bound into Tolkien titles.*As for the Ted Nasmith illustrations, they are quite different in style from Alan Lee (and Nasmith's work's here in oil paint, where Lee's LOTR and Hobbit work has been mostly watercolor or tempera), but beautifully evocative, lush in color, and more \\"modern\\" and realistic than Lee's. Like the 1992 (re-issued 2002) boxed-set of LOTR, the illustrations are printed on the obverse (right hand) of the page, and the text continues on the reverse (left hand), so there are no blank page sides, which I think is more attractive. The illustrations are lovely and well complement the text. A few of these plates are new to this edition, and do not appear in the 2001 hardcover of The Silmarillion (ISBN 0618135049; jacket image of elves awaking at Cuivienen). This edition is a larger format than that book, and thus are the illustrations.Lastly, this edition contains a new (1999) preface by Christopher Tolkien, and the famous 1951 Milton Waldman letter in which Tolkien presents one of the most comprehensive and coherent descriptions and explanations he ever made of his conception of his legendarium. The text is technically \\"2nd edition, revised,\\" and thus contains a few corrections not in earlier second edition printings. I highly recommend this edition of The Silmarillion for anyone seeking a copy that is both a beautiful addition to one's library, and one which will stand up to years of reading. It is uncommon to find both qualities in one book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkein expertly combines part history and part mythology to make this brilliant book.Even by itself it is fun to read.It is indispensible to anyone interested in the Lord of the Rings.It answers so many questions such as-what's across the sea-how did all the different peoples of Middle Earth come into being-what's Sauron's story-what's the elves' storyThere are so many seperate adventures and the whole book is so interesting.The only problem is that at times it seems dauntingly unending.But don't quit.The last half of the book is the most fascinating.This book will give you a much deeper and more comprehensible knowledge and appreciation for the Lord of the Rings.If you're going to take the time to go in depth and read the books,then you absolutely have to read this book.It sort of completes the series-like a puzzle."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I purchased a first edition of \\"The Silmarillion\\" the day it was released in 1977, and it has been one of the books I have most cherished and reread throughout my life. The clear, Biblical flavour of Tolkien's language immediately communicates a sense of nobility and respect regarding the archetypal events he recounts, exactly as other primary texts of world mythology do. Indeed, Tolkien has accomplished his mission with this work: he has created a living, complex mythology of Albion, and thereby indirectly of \\"Western\\" civilization, which has a moral as well as historical structure; it is a well of wisdom to which the reader can return again and again, to learn from and refresh our hearts. That such a book exists in our cultural legacy is a priceless gift and truly a privilege to read.\\"The Silmarillion\\" is a challenging, initially intimidating work, but like the best books in one's library it is valuable, redeeming to the reader and inexhaustible in meaning.This hardcover version of the Second Edition, published in 2004 and illustrated by Ted Nasmith, is of high quality and construction, printed on glossy paper and bound exceptionally well. I consider it to be a real bargain and recommend it unconditionally."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkein was said to have been motivated to provide the British with an origins myth, which he felt they did not have. He succeeded admirably with the Silmarillion which tells the story of the creation by Illuvatar (God) and the Valar (supporting \\"gods\\") chief among the latter being Manwe and Melkor. Melkor, said to be the most powerful of the Valar, was vain and selfish from the beginning while Manwe was Illuvater's loyal second. Tolkein's creation myth is truly magical being told with the metaphor of the god's singing the universe into being but with Melkor in discord. Following the creation tale are the stories of the beginnings of the Eldar (Elves), Dwarves, Men, and Orcs. Many of these stories are stirring epics told with Tolkein's matchless language skills, and form the mythical background for LOTR. I had read the Silmarillion before but found that I got even more by listening to a skilled reader recite the tale. I have had much the same experience with Homer. Some stories are better heard than read and the Illiad and Silmarillion are prime choices here. After all, the Illiad was likely developed to be told orally by Bards while Tolkein may well have had a similar model in mind. This is a beautiful recording that is truly delightful to hear again and again. My only very minor complaint is that the reader seems to have devised his own pronunciations of the many unique names. If you want to see more accepted pronunciations (Tolkein was clear about how the names should be spoken) check out \\"The encyclopedia of Arda\\" online."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This novel is famously known as the bible for Tolkien fans, and that is just the most accurate way to describe it. I just cannot believe how one man could create this whole different, world by himself (I do acknowledge the impact of Western mythologies and legends). It's a bible - a complete guide - to a fantasy world written by one man, with the help of his son and editors."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love the Silmarillion because it enriches the Tolkien experience by expanding the history of Middle-earth as alluded to in Lord of the Rings, and I particularly love this edition because of the beautiful illustrations. And yes, I'll go ahead and say it - I love that it's illustrated with care and NOT by the Howe/Lee monopoly on 'serious Tolkien art.' Some really gorgeous scenes in here and some gripping, fascinating, and delightful tales."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is J.R.R. Tolkien's magnum opus, the history of Arda (the world). It is, however, not written in anything like the style of the Hobbit or the Lord of the Rings--it is a book of lore compiled from many different sources (see Christopher Tolkien's Foreword for some insight on this). There are many names, quite a few of which sound very similar. On my first reading I started to get the characters confused for that very reason; however, the Silmarillion is one of those books that improves \\"with age.\\" It is now probably my favorite of all of Tolkien's writings.It is also a book that could not be written (or at least published) by a writer of today. The vast majority of the current generation has been weaned on sound bites and MTV, and this book is the antithesis of that experience. Those few who loved the Lord of the Rings AND are up to this kind of storytelling will probably feel the same way about it as I do. The vast majority, however, won't like it and I certainly understand why. Figure out in which category you fall and that will tell you whether to purchase Tolkien's \\"bible.\\""},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The forward of this book says that Tolkien originally imagined it as being a history of Middle Earth as pieced together from various ancient sources. The sources themselves were of various quality and written in different styles. The first section was written almost as an epic poem, whereas subsequent sections had a more narrative style.I'm not a fan of poetry, so the beginning rather dragged, but the story picked up considerably when it became more historical. Tolkien's style is very straightforward though he often uses archaic words.The good: Tolkien apparently liked painting with a very large brush. This book literally covers thousands of years of history. The scope is enormous. While I found many of the individual's stories very moving, I also felt like the effect was cumulative, like a snow drift. Each little flake was artfully placed to create a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. By the time I finished, I felt like I had read a work as tragic as anything from Shakespeare, as epic as the Divine Comedy, and did a far better job at putting a human face on its history than any \\"real world\\" history I have read.The bad: The book covers thousands of years! The family trees in the back helped keep track of the marriages and bloodlines, but there was still a huge number of people (and elves and dwarves) with often similar names to remember. This work will utterly baffle the casual reader. However, the book has an extensive name index and a dictionary of words in several languages; a great deal of work obviously went into making it useful as a reference book, and some people will be satisfied with it at that level."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Edit: I apologize, I wrote this review about the book. This is actually an audio version.Quite simply, the Silamrillion is one of the best books ever written, a tragic story of the first order, if you have the patience to read it. It is a tale of the heroic First Age of Middle Earth, and encompasses material referred to numerous times in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The sheer depth of the history is staggering.If forced to make a comparison, the tone and feel of the book are most similar to the ending of the Return of the King, and places where the fading and departure of the Elves are mentioned, though The Silmarillion is more distant. It encompasses all of the feelings of glory, beauty, and sadness of The Lord of the Rings, distilled to a biting essence. Imagine the bittersweet feel of the end of LOTR, and the feeling of victory-but-at-what-price-?, magnified ten times, to see the glorious history of men and elves come to such a humble end at the Silmarillion's conclusion. In the Silmarillion, the grass is greener, the stars are brighter, the swords are sharper, and the black is blacker than in any other work of fiction.The Silmarillion covers the entire history of Middle Earth in a combination of Norse, Christian, and Greek-style mythologies (roughly in that order, though I'm not an expert), picking and choosing the most glorious and tragic aspects of these. It covers the creation of existence, the origin, departure, and triumphant return of Elves to Middle Earth, the Elves' war upon the Great Enemy (Morgoth, of whom Sauron was only a servant), and the terrible breaking of the seige. It then goes on to tell of the Hidden City of Gondolin (where Bilbo and Frodo's sword Sting was made), Beren and Luthien, The Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and many other stories. The tagedy of the book befalls as the once-magnificent Elves are gradually driven into the ground by a series of treacheries, driven partly by the will of Morgoth and partly by pride; all the more tragic since this was prophesied. We then learn of the final battle where Morgoth is overthrown, and the Second Age begins.The latter part of the book is just as tragic, though it is not presented in as much detail. The magnificent but proud Numenoreans (men who fought on the side of the Elves) face a similar fate, and are eventually crushed by the gods in their home of \\"Atlantis\\"; with the few survivors populating Middle Earth and creating the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor, thus beginning the Third Age. There is some description of this as well as the Fourth Age, and the book ends with a brief discussion of the fate of the surviving memembers of the Fellowship (most notably Gimli and Legolas), and a hint of how men can still at times come to the undying lands of Valinor and behold the glory of the Elder Days, before they die.Though I have read the Silmarillion several times, I have never met anyone else (in person) who has read the whole thing through without skimming, and that is including some rabid Lord of the Rings fans. In fact, the first time I read it I took a six-month break at page 56. If worse comes to worst, skim until about that page and then start reading because the story becomes more interesting when \\"real\\" characters are introduced. There is a simple test to see if The Silamarillion is right for you: if you read and enjoyed the Appendices to the Lord of the Rings, especially the history portions, then the Silmarillion is right for you. If you have not read the Appendices or disliked them, then you might not get much from this book (though the Silmarillion is a much better read than the appendices)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"People give me a break! Anyone who for at least three minutes sat down and read about what this book is supposed to be would know better than to write reviews that the public can read that so obviously illustrate how much you don't know about the book.First of all Tolkien's son was not some money-grubbing idiot who exploited his father's work. Believe it or not there are those who railed and BEGGED him to release more of his father's notes and letters and working drafts concerning everything to do with Middle Earth. Letters, sketches, anything at all they could get their hands on! And that is exactly what this book is, a \\"history\\" of Middle Earth. I for one wanted exactly this kind of information. My only complaint is that there wasn't more about Gandalf's earlier years, or one of my favorite characters Tom Bombadill.Of course the book reads nothing like The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, it was never intended to!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the back story of the epic Lord of the Rings. Tolkien decribes the sundering of Valinor and the epic battles of the First Age from which come the stories and legends of the Third Age. It is not the easiest read, but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I didn't know Tolkien, or the trilogy LOTR, but the movie introduced me to this magnificent world.The Silmarillion is the &quot;Genesis&quot; of the whole world Tolkien created and loved.The introduction of Il&uacute;vatar, and the creation of Arda, is very similar to the Bible story. &quot;At the beginning there was God&quot;- The Bible, &quot;There was Eru, who in Arda is called Il&uacute;vatar&quot;-Silmarillion.And the rebellion of Melkor, who is also called Morgoth, is similar to the rebellion of Lucifer. Melkor was the mightiest of the Ain&uacute;r and Lucifer was the mightiest of the Angels, and both wanted to rule Ea, and both wanted to be called Lords. Also is mentioned in the Bible that the world was empty in darkness, the same is mentioned about Ea in the Silmarillion.Christopher Tolkien has explained his fathers theological, and philosophical view in a special edition.From this point of view Tolkien develops his universe of Valars, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Olorins and men.These are the best books ever written (except the Bible;)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's easy to see why Tolkien wanted this appended as a prologue to Lord of the Rings and it's equally easy to see why the publisher rejected that idea. If you're a fan of Tolkien's world-building, then this is worthwhile, but it's a slog. The language is very lofty, the litany of names is challenging, and the prose is... turgid.But if you can make it though the muck, you'll find a rich and tragic story about a world that starts in a state of beauty and perfection and slowly slides into despair and destruction. It gives context to the world of Lord of the Rings and enriches some of the themes of sacrifice that run through Tolkien's works."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A popular misconception is that this is the backstory to Lord of the rings and the hobbit but in fact these stories were developed first. When Tolkien was told to write a sequel to the Hobbit which originally had nothing to do with his legendarium, he made Lord of the rings and bridged the works together. The version here, edited together by Christopher Tolkien, is a must read for any fan of Tolkien or indeed anyone interested in mythological works since he conceived the tales to be a sort of mythology for England. I wish he had completed a version to his satisfaction in his lifetime because while this is an amazing read, a finished and proper version would have been amazing. But as it is, the story of the Elves and their war against Morgoth and of the fall of N&uacute;menor are stories that truly open one's imagination to the world. The sheer amount of research that Tolkien did in his work was amazing and almost unheard of today. This wasn't just another fantasy text, this was a mythology."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience with The Silmarillion. So, you might ask, why not give it a perfect rating? Hopefully, I can explain that in the rest of this review.The Silmarillion is a beautifully written book. It is actually a collection of several works of J.R.R. Tolkien edited and combined into one book by his son, Christopher, and published posthumously. The five works combined in this book are Ainulindale, Valaquenta, Quenta Silmarillion, Akallabeth, and Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age. The Ainulindale and Valaquenta are more of a story of creation and come across very Biblical in tone and scope while the other three works combine to give a pretty complete history of the peoples of Middle-Earth. Throughout the book, the language is skillfully crafted into beautiful prose and everything flows together nicely into one fairly cohesive text so that it does not really feel as if you are reading separate works.Overall, the book reads a lot like a very beautifully written history text. The reader is presented a LOT of information about people and events in a relatively short span of pages (for example, the entire events of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is summarized in less than three pages!) There are a lot of names and places to keep track of and to make this even more difficult, some people and places have 2 or more names associated with them. Christopher Tolkien has included a comprehensive name index, maps, family trees and other appendices that aide the reader a lot in sorting these things out, but several times while reading I felt a little lost due to the sheer amount of information presented and this caused me to feel that reading it occasionally became more of a chore than a passion.I think that this is a book that will improve upon further readings. Hopefully, I'll be able to sit down with it in a few years and read through it with less work and even more enjoyment. I love the tale that is told through this presentation of history and I would love to see more of the chapters broken out into novel length versions as with The Children of Hurin."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a compilation of Tolkien's mythology of Middle-Earth. Tolkien had worked on this mythology for much of his life, long before he even considered writing the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Many readers get turned off from the Silmarillion because of Tolkien's archaic style and the sheer number of names. My advice is not to worry about all of the names the first time you read through. Just try to remember a few of the main characters. There is a helpful appendix in the back of the book with the names of all of the characters and places. Moreover, Prof. Corey Olsen has a podcast on iTunes that explains the Silmarillion, which is worth listening to if you really want to appreciate the book.But make no mistake - the effort you put in will pay off. First, it will it enhance your understanding of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy, as the Silmarillion stories form the history for those novels. The Silmarillion goes from the creation of the universe right up to the war of the rings. In the First Age of the world, Men and Elves battle an evil lord that make Sauron look like a clown. Some of the stories, such as the defection of Feanor and the Noldor Elves, are stunning in their emotional power. It's some of the most gripping fantasy fiction ever. My one regret is that Tolkien didn't live long enough to publish this work himself."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was originally published after JRR Tolkien's death and consists of the entire mythology that he created for his world of Middle Earth. He goes back to the beginning of time for his world and explains the deities and demigods that existed there before the world was even made. He shows how evil came to be and how each of the races that were to exist in Middle Earth came to be and how they came to be aligned with one side or the other. There are references to this time in both 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' and here those references are given flesh.Each time I read a Tolkien book, I marvel at the depth of the world he has created. He created languages and histories for all the races. He spent well over 60 years creating these stories and legends. The depth he has created shows the hard work and all the threads he had to tie together to show how they were all interrelated.I would recommend this book to anyone who has read either 'The Hobbit' or 'The Lord Of The Rings' and who wants to hear more about the legends referred to. It is not an easy read, so a younger reader may be turned off by the depth of it, but anyone else will be stunned at its depth and will enjoy a world very different from out own."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of lose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those that live there. We learn many things as what different names of beings and places mean. This helps add a dimension to the stories that take place there.I would say that it would help to read Lord of the Rings first because it is more comfortable when getting to know the area and characters. Then we can see where they came form; relationships are better understood.Much of The Silmarillion can be taken in small bits and then sit back and contemplate how it could have been.One does not just cut through any cultural history book for light reading and just shelving it. This is a cultural history book and will require rereading.When people talk about the war I think back to which one they are talking about. Or are they just referring to one of the many orc skirmishes.You do not have to be a Tolkien fan to find interest in this collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I would definitely say this book is a must have companion to the Lord of the Rings series if your a big fan of the books. As previous reviews have stated, the beginning is a bit hard to get through, but once your past it, its really a good story. A friend of mine once said it read like a text book. He was partially correct. It is very text booky towards the beginning, but it really is handy for deciphering all the background legends in lord of the rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Want to know all about how exactly Middle-Earth, the rings of power, Frodo and all those involved in the LOTR trilogy came about??? READ THIS BOOK! It's an essential read if you've already read the trilogy or watched the movie.Initially i was pretty skeptical reading the synopsis of the book but when i started reading the first few chapters i couldn't put it down.The first chapter (when Eru creates the \\"vision\\" of earth) was kind of hard to comprehend at first, but sooner or later you'll get the picture of what's going on. The first few chapters have a kind of mystical/ spiritual feel about it; talking about Eru Illuvatar (God) and the Valar (his so-called angels or great influential spirits) and how they were sent on a mission to create and design a world fit for the coming of elves and men.And did you know that there was actually a first Dark Lord who also tried to ruin Middle-Earth and take it for himself before Sauron?? Now that really got me interested in the story.Read about how dwarves were created even before the elves came to be, about the Great Eagles, Balrogs, Orcs (who were once elves btw), and the most important piece of information : What exactly lies in the west that the elves of the Third Age are so obsessed about.It helps to have a reference guide like an encyclopedia of Middle-Earth, or just log online to read up more on the characters.... this helps a lot to piece many of the sequences and chain of events together. After reading this book i can now fully appreciate the entire LOTR trilogy. At the end of it you'll almost want to believe that Middle-Earth actually exists."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was a hard read for me. The book is basically the story of the first couple of ages of Middle Earth. I like to think of it as the \\"Elvish Bible.\\" It has a lot of elements of 'Paradise Lost' in it which I admit I'm a sucker for. If you have ever read any religious text such as the Bible, I think you'll find a lot in common with those and this book--like not using proper grammer and stringing complex ideas and concepts in a single paragraph. This book is defining the beliefs of the Elves and most of the other cultures in Middle-Earth. If you start with that mindset it will make the book easier to read.I think it's pretty clear that Tolkien had all of these characters and the universe they live in clear in his mind from the beginning. I think that many times he just doesn't get that across on paper that well. For example, he introduces many concepts, places and characters on a whim right in the middle of a long drawn out sentence. I found myself many times going back to the index to look up definitions so I wouldn't get lost. Thank goddness Tolkien had the foresight to write these sections to help his readers.The great irony of Tolkien's work is that he puts in so much detail about places and characters that everyone who reads it gets a different vision of what it should be. That is the mark of a great writer.I would recommend that you read \\"The Hobbit\\" and all of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" before tackling this book. I think those books are a good introduction to Tolkien's style and will give you a better framework to start from. IMO, those are much better books than this one because there is more of a story line to follow."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien has singlehandedly created a vast and largely consistent mythology that provides a splendid background for the epic Lord of the Rings. I found many of the tales quite gripping and complete in their own right. Some parts of the book though were a bit taxing or even outright boring. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, you should really take the time to read this (and the Hobbit). All the three books are written in very different styles."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I own this particular edition, which I purchased for its amazing illustrations. If you're a Tolkien fan at all, the paperbacks just shouldn't cut it. There are a multitude of amazing editions of the Trilogy and its companion books. I found Ted Nasmuth's illustrations to be simply amazing, and it was worth every penny I paid for it.For those who have not read the Silmarillion, let me say right off the bat- this can be a difficult read. The best comparison I can come up with is the Bible. This book is about history, and it is written as a historical text. I highly recommend trying it though. If you have some trouble, David Day published an encyclopedia on Tolkien, and that can be a great help. Once you understand the characters and the histories, the tales Tolkien puts forth in this book are simply amazing. It's like the trilogy, multiplied by a hundred. All the action, the romance, the amazing places completely fill this book. My favorite story is the Tale of Luthien and Beren (naturally, I'm a total sap when it comes to romance). That story alone is worth the price of the book.If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, pick this up! I'm sure you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is definitely one of the best books in my posession. The Silmarillion is astonishing in its philosophical and theological depth. It should not be labeled as merely &quot;phantasy&quot;.While this book is about all kinds of creatures, it is definitely also a metaphor on the human condition, with all its highs and its many lows. One failure after another of the elves and men trails through the history of middle earth, and once in a while, a hero redeems his or her race by a spectacular act of goodness. Important questions about our mortality and Tolkien's christian ideas about the meaning of our lives are woven into the stories without becoming a lecture.This book is more than a &quot;historical&quot; background for the Lord of the Rings. It could stand alone as a collection of fables in which JRR Tolkien provides more than merely the mythology to the Lord of the Rings.I do not recommend this book to the casual reader, for they will be dissappointed. I had to read this book twice to begin (!) to appreciate it, and as with the Lord of the Rings, I expect I will discover new things, whenever I re-read this book.It should be noted that the Silmarillion is a collection of stories by J.R.R. Tokien, masterfully edited by his son Christopher Tolkien, to approach some semblance of continuity between chapters. As C. Tolkien writes in the foreword, however, the Silmarillion is not one cohesive story, but a collection of several stories, written by J.R.R. Tolkien over many years."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is the book for anyone who read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and wanted to know the background to Tolkien's wonderful world. The Silmarillion provides all the details of the origin of the elves, humans and dwarves as well as some wonderfully told stories along the way. It's not an easy read as it is full of numerous different names and places but it is a must for any true Tolkien fan."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are no words to describe this work of art coming from the Master himself: JRR Tolkien. Since the coming of the Hobbit and the LOR, a whole industry has risen with millions of fantasy fans becoming enthralled to majesty that is &quot;Tolkien&quot;. Through the pages of the Silmarillion, JRR Tolkien sheds light on the history, the culture, and the myths of Middle Earth, the magical world that he created and which became an inspiration to so many worldwide. Considering when it was written, and the impact that it has had worldwide, 5 Stars are just too few for a masterpiece of such magnitude. This book is not easy reading by any means, therefore, it is not recommended for the light-hearted, instead it is much more tuned to the needs/taste of the Middle Earth die-hards (like myself...)In conclusion, it is strongly recommended that in order to receive full enjoyment of the book while avoiding confusion due to the sheer volume of factual material, one should keep in close proximity one of the many Middle Earth guides/encyclopedias that are available for quick reference if the need arises. DON'T MISS IT!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I admit it. I was reluctant to read this book. I thought it would be difficult to read and enjoy (even worse that the first hundred pages of FotR).But it wasn't. It was amazingly smooth and enjoyable reading. Yeah, I wasn't always entirely sure which elf whose name starts with Ea I was reading about, but I still enjoyed it. I could hardly put it down. Not only did it explain a lot about LotR and make my next reading of them deeper, but this mythology was interesting by itself. Although I doubt anyone who hadn't read LotR would be willing to suspend their disbelief enough.One (or two) warnings - this does NOT explain everything. There are big gaps, such as just where Hobbits come from, and who the other Istari are. I don't know if Tolkien ever decided. But then he did have a lot of other things to write about."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read this book in sixth grade. Then, all it did was confuse me. When I had re-read it enough to understand it, I feel in love with it. Tolkien writes so well, I would recommend this book to anyone. The imaginativeness in the book is well-worth the read itself. While I love this book, it is not for one who does not like skipping from story-to-story or the \\"olden\\" type of english. The only thing that I don't like about the book is the many names of some of the characters, when there's at least a hundred. (most likely more)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In the collection of stories about the history and creation of Middle Earth, author J.R.R. Tolkien skillfully uses diction to help describe his different elaborate worlds and uses the diction to help relate the separate stories in the novel to each other as well as to relate the plots to other stories in different novels.Tolkien's diction in the stories helps the reader to understand and identify all of the characters and their relationships with each other. He uses very descriptive word choice throughout the novel, but he describes the differences between the major villain Melkor and the numerous heroes of the novel not only directly in the plot but indirectly through the fact that Tolkien uses more civilized and elegant words to describe the heroes in contrast to the crude and sinister words that Tolkien used to describe all of the evil in the novel. One of the key components in The Silmarillion is the jewels the Silmarils, which are the most valuable and beautiful jewels in Middle Earth. Tolkien describes The Silmarils with different words depending on who possesses the Silmaril at the time, Melkor or a hero.The word choice in The Silmarillion is reflected in the diction of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, with similar, if not the same, words used to describe situations and plot threads that are related in the two stories. The most well-known of this is the love stories of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion, compared to the later story of Aragorn and Arwen in The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien would make Luthien and Arwen both very beautiful with his descriptions, and he would make Beren and Aragorn both willing to do anything so that they would be allowed to love the beautiful Elves.Tolkien's diction is very distinctive and influential in this story as well as in his other novels and it helps to create the depth and believability that has been common and expected of Tolkien's novels."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"To most people, Tolkien is known for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This is his other great work, published after his death and assembled by his son, a history of Middle Earth prior to the Ring books.If the Hobbit is designed to appeal to kids and The Lord of the Rings to appeal to teens and young adults, this one is definitely for an older crowd. I say this not derogatorily, because these works are all great, but the Silmarillion is not an easy read compared to the others.It is the complexity of this book that shows just how skilled Tolkien is. This is a tale of myths and legends, designed almost to be a bible of Middle-Earth. It is not a novel but a collection of stories dealing with the days when the world was young. When you read this book, you realize how deep in detail Middle Earth is, and how comparitively shallow most other fantasy worlds are.Beyond this, although not as simple to read as other Tolkien stories (but still entertainingly readable), the tales in this book are exciting and compelling.This work reaffirms what the general state of the fantasy genre is: .... To truly appreciate what fantasy can be, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien's work - DO NOT miss this!It's a necessity. And for all newcomers to Tolkien's world, it is recommended to read the Silmarillion first.With it, I also recommend the Unfinished Tales, which is a nice companion and can further expand the tales (especially Narn I Hin Hurin - tale of Turin Turambar)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is very interesting and provides much detail about the history of Tolkien's universe. However, it read like a textbook. I highly recommend the unabridged audio version read by Martin Shaw. His voice works very well, and listening removes some of the tedium."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A long time ago in a mystical land far away Iluvatar created 14 valar,those with power. Iluvatar also created his children Elves, immortal, and Men, doomed to die. Of the first the greatest story of Middle-Earth. The Silmarillion is a book filled with adventures of Elves, Men, and Dwarves. A reason this book is so good is because of it's ability to take the reader to a mystical land filled with orcs, dragons, and elves. This book is highly recommended. It is wonderful reading of the early years of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"'The Hobbit' was a bedtime story for his children; 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy was a story to amuse himself and his friends; 'The Silmarillion' was Tolkien's life's work and best-loved heartwork. To read 'The Silmarillion' as if it were just a piece of fiction is to do it an injustice; it is the Bible of Tolkien's world. With a beauty surpassing prose, it is best heard...read aloud, sung or chanted. It is not for everyone. If you are looking for another Rings trilogy, look elsewhere. If you are looking for the innate beauty and sorrow that can only be felt in great spiritual literature such as the King James' version of the Bible, Homer's Iliad, or India's Bhagavad-Gita, then I would say this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion primarily tells the tale of the Elder Days of Middle Earth. In a sweeping, epic fashion, it speaks of angleic and demonic powers, Elves, Dwarves, Men, Dragons and a host of other creatures. The Silmarillion provides background for Tolkien's other books, but stands strongly on it's own. With this hardcover edition we finally see the addition of illustrations, masterfully done by Ted Naismith. Naismith is without doubt the most accurate illustrator of Tolkien's world; he really does his research. As well documented by Tolkien's writings, he depicts the Elves with pointed ears, and he shows the warriors of Middle Earth as being armoured in Chainmail (instead of the plate armour erroneously shown by other artists). His depiction of the race of Balrogs is the most powerful &amp; accurate out of any artist out there. The list of his attention to detail goes on. He combines this with a skill ful blend of colour and emotion in his paintings. This is a book well worth buying and reading, even if you have other editons."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"HelloIf you read the Hobbit , Lord of the rings and wont to dive in to middel- earths history this is the book for you !

If only our own history authors were so vivid! There are times in the reading that I feel as if I'm reading the true accounts of our own country's founding fathers, or that I am reading forgotten tales of Greek mythology. These characters stick clearly in your mind and Tolkien's style always manages to make the unbelievable believable. These characters cry out for devoted material (such as solo novels) as much as Bilbo Baggins."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was in-depth, interesting, intriguing, and all out great book. But i suppose i am just saying that becuase i am a Tolkien Fanatic and i have always wanted to know more about the world he designed. This book gives the full background and recounting of the beginning and designing of Middle Earth, and deals also mainly with the First age--Morgoth, Luthien and Beren, The Silmarils, the Palantir, Numenor,--and all the other things that most people have ever wanted to know about if the have even the slightest interest in the books and their lore. This book is a definite must for anyone wanting to know more. Dont become bored and disappointed with some of the chapters, such as &quot;of Men&quot; and boring stuff like that, because, believe me, it is captivating once you hit the good spots, and there are plenty of those. Great book--buy ASAP!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This mass of complex and (sometimes) excessive detailed stories, is like a a great passage opening to another dimension: the world, and I mean not only the Middle Earth, but the whole conception of Tolkien's own spiritual world. It is a great story that, by narrating you parts of it, leaves you intrigued and desperate to read the next chapter, (I mean, What happens to...?,)It is one of those stories in which by the end of each page you turn to the next because you simply NEED to know. This book, you have to take it carefully and slowly, and if you don't undrstand something reread it again, because only that way you will be able to savour all the richness that lies hidden in the covers. It make take you a year, but when you finish, your mind will be so full of satisfaction you'll plead for Silmarillion 2. It is a MUST read, but only after you've read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Any fan of sci-fi, whether they like the Tolkien wannabe Terry Brooks, the masterful Robert Jordan or even those hideous Star Wars novels, should read this book. Despite what everyone says, this book isn't really that hard to read (I read it in eighth or ninth grade, with little trouble), and the scope is incredible--all of the events of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit are condensed into the last two pages of The Silmarillion. If you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan, you should also buy this book--in the back is a small elven dictionary that can help you create authenic elven names like Elianar (Starfire) or Celeb-Sul (Silverwind).No matter what books you like to read, you should read this one as well. Tolkien is the Beatles of sci-fi, and The Silmarillion is his Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As other people have said, the start is very hard to understand (the first 30-70 pages) and also boring. But if you manage to read them, you will be rewarded with the rest of the book.When you finish reading &quot;The Sillmarillion&quot; and you liked it you could try the first bit again but that time you will probably enjoy it: I did!Also if you don't like lots of names or &quot;son of's&quot;(like Turin son of Hurin) you may find this book a bit boring.This my favorite book ever except for &quot;TLOTR&quot; but only by a bit! If &quot;The Sillmarillion&quot; was narated like &quot;TLOTR&quot;, even if it was 20,000 pages long I would probably still read it but enjoy it even more by far than &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;:but then more people would have read it then anyway.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is my next favorite book.I would be pleased if anyone would send me an e-mail but I may not answer for a while because I do not go on the internet much. I don't care if you give me any comments on this:good or bad."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I think that this book isn't that complicated to read, it's just that there are many names and events mentioned.

But no creation of a world is easy, less when it really starts at the beginning of everything. The story grows with each page, the characters live and die fully sometimes in just one paragraph, and when the gods take away their gaze from the world, life go on by itself.

Since reading the LOTR first, this style of prose was somewhat hard to get used to.Although I re-read LOTR, I have never re-read The Silmarillion. But it did give me more of an understanding of the complete history of Middle Earth (origin of Balrogs, Sauron...)."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I loved Lord of the Rings, but I thought the Silmarillion was even better, and finally it's being published with illustrations to match the grandeur of the saga.

The beauty he describes in the people and the places can only be matched by the horrific creatures he created. This book does not move very fast,though, so for those who bore quickly this is not for you. For those that have ever read LoTR and are willing to delve into his writting and completly immerse themselves, this will be your favorite Tolkien book of all time"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The greatest tragedy of the literary world in the last 100 years is that Tolkien never finished The Silmarillion. Had he done so, it would have eclipsed the Lord of the Rings as his masterpiece. As it is, the book has very little character development and omits large amounts of many of the tales in the book. Nevertheless, it is a gripping story of Wagnerian scope and grandeur and is one of the definitive works of fantasy/fiction of this century. If you enjoy this book, the full versions of many of the tales can be found in the Lost Tales/Unfinished Tales books. I would highly recommend reading these to fill out the characters and plots in the Silmarillion."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are memorable, the story is poignant to say the least, and it will haunt your dreams.Morgoth.Feanor.Beren.Each word brings an instant picture to the mind's eye. Readers of Tolkien's world that yearn for more, people who aren't satisfied with the Lord of the Rings should read The Silmarillion.A word of caution: If you like action, lots of action right up front, this book is not for you. There are so many names in the first few chapters that you will quickly get lost or even bored. It even happened to me. The first time I read this book, I ended up thinking that Melian married Finwe and Gil-galad was somehow Finrod. If you are too confused, put the book down and get a snack, sleep on it and return with a clear mind. Believe me, it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book more or less compresses hundreds of years of history into twenty-four chapters, but that description hardly does it justice. The prose is polished to the point of shimmering and the tales are complex and beautiful. The Silmarillion clears up a lot of mysteries hinted at in the Lord of the Rings as well. It's not an average novel in style or content, but something more. I have read it several times.Definitely an impressive feat of literature, but still it's best to read Tolkien's other books (LOTR, the Hobbit) first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Opulent in imaginative cloth. Perhaps on of J.R.R's best books ever. This book gives a grand look of a wonderful land filled with adventures and peril.

If your looking for sagacious adventurous book you've found it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book, while rather confusing (especially with all the names sounding alike, ie: Manwe, Ingwe, Elwe, Olwe, Finwe, Aule), is a very good look at the history of Middle-Earth. It helps you find out who the people are when they are referred to in LOTR, such as Earendil and Varda. However, as my friend puts it, it is the Bible of Middle-Earth. I like it, but then again, I'm odd."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I believe that the silmarillion was tokien's best work.I'm still trying to finish The Return of the King but I find that so farmuch has happened but wasn't expressed in the best way to make it more appealing to other people.Before i read The Two TOwers though I read the silmarillion, at first it seemed really slow and I had difficulty reading the first couple of chapters.Then it got really interesting for he finally brought the elves into the story who were my favorite race in the series.Even though the story was told like a history lesson, I find it to still be one of my favorite books because i am very fond of history, and the stories telling of all the deeds whether good or bad that the elves had done was just fascinating."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As far as I'm concerned this is the BEST of Tolkien's books. It doesn't get bogged down in detail. It sweeps a much larger range of time than Lord of the Rings. It answers so many questions. Its story is so much more touching and compassionate. It's so much easier to read. I lost my copy...but I'm going to, after so many years, buy it again!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had heard and read a number of reviews of this book. Most seem to agree that the book was dry at times and not as good as the LOTR trilogy. Reading the first few chapters, I would strongly agree. There are a great number of people and places and it soon becomes challenging to keep them all straight. However, have no fear...the rewards are great. The reader soon realizes that this book is more than just a historical supplement for the LOTR trilogy. In fact, Tolkien has created an entire mythos comparable to Greek and Roman mythology of old.Be prepared, for the text reads like mythology. The stories move quickly and there is lots of action but little detail. My favorite story is that of &quot;Beren and Luthien.&quot; Seriously, this is one of the best stories that I have ever read and worth working your way through the beginning of the book to get to it.If you liked the LOTR trilogy, I would strongly recommend this book as it does provide good background and answers most of the commonly asked questions from the series. In addition, there is a handy glossary in the back of the book that helps the reader keep track of all the names in places in the series."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"i am not going to bore you with a huge review. i recently bought this book and WOW!! it is sooo cool! it is extremly hard to understand, but dont let that get You down. i noticed how many people look at the reveiws for this book. i am only 130 pages into it....but it is awsome!! i am only 13 so maybe if you are older you might understand it better. but you NEED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"So vast is the history of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy realm of Middle-Earth, that it spawned over a dozen offshoot volumes editted by Christopher Tolkien from his father's notes. The largest and most acclaimed of these is &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; It is most defineately complete... the scope and detail is utterly astonishing. However, to date I have not been able to complete it. After &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I had expected perhaps a more personal tale with &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; Not so. Unlike the previous two, this is written more like a history novel... entire wars pass by in a few pages, characters come and go in the blink of an eye. This makes for incredibly dry reading... only the devoted Tolkien fan would be able to really enjoy.Still, the scope is perhaps the greatest of all the Tolkien literature, and the detail and richness of his world is really expanded here, fleshing out references made in 'Hobbit' and 'Rings.' If you enjoyed those, you should give this a try."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had already read the Silmarillion before but I never really appreciated how beautifully Tolkien wrote until I heard this book read aloud as an audio book. I usualy don't buy audio books also. It is still dense, bt when you listen to the reading by Martin Shaw, you realize that this is beautiful prose. It is the Old Testament of Middle-earth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you've wondered about all those &quot;historical&quot; references in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you'll like this book. As with LOTR, the prose is sometimes tedious and the scores of names (as many as five per character) bewildering, but the book's editor -- Tolkien's son, Christopher -- does his best to keep it moving with maps, geneaological charts, pronunciation guides, etc."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Let's get this out of the way right away. This is not The Lord of the Rings nor is it The Hobbit. It is not written in the same style. It is not attempting the same goals. Don't go into it expecting more adventures of hobbits, in depth characterizations, or lengthy descriptions of the landscape.This owes more to Herodotus the father of history than to Dunsany. You can tell that Tolkein was fulfilling the scholar within him for this work. It is the result of the compilation of poetry, stories, and songs which he wrote over many years. For perspective, the year or so of adventure in the three books of the Lord of the Rings only take up about twenty-five pages of this book.That being said, one must then notice that if J.R.R. Tolkein had attempted to put the detail of the Lord of the Rings into the other adventures in this book, he would not have been able to finish within his lifetime!This is an overview of many beautiful stories and myths in Elven lore. Their version of the creation of the world. The splitting of the Elves into Light, Dark, and Twilight. The rise of the first Dark Lord, Morgoth and his eventual downfall. Not to mention the creation of the Dwarves, Men, the Ents, the giant Eagles, the spiders, the Dragons, the Balrogs, and just about everything else you encounter in the Lord of the Rings.It is all told in a style reminiscent of the Old Testament fused with elements of Homer, Herodotus, Mallory, Tennyson, and the unknown authors of Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.My personal favorite is the tale of Beren and Luthien Tinuviel. It has elements of classic romance with definite twists, the female lead saves the male at least twice!All in all, a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"a bit hard to read, but the background of its creation was told; they are unfinished tales. however, it's a wider view to the history of LoR and others."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],H={key:0},O={key:1};function x(n,e,r,f,s,a){const c=w("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),i(g,null,y(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(t(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const q=u(E,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-f432960c"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/42.md","filePath":"glossary/42.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/42.md"},N=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,r)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{B as __pageData,N as default};
