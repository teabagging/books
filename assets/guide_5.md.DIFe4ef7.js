Silk is a remarkably multi-faceted character, exhibiting at turns confidence, doubt, fear, compassion, and naivety. Most enjoyable of all, he's more clever than he tends to let on; on several occasions, the reader wants to shout the answer to a puzzle to Silk, only to find out later that he knew it all along.

However, very little work has been done on how to collect spatial data, though experimental design is an old but important subject in Statistics. This book, now in its second edition, makes an excellent start in this emerging area. This reviewer, fortunately, has the chance to participate in a multinational weather experiment in which one of the goals is to collect additional spatial data for improving existing data network and for improving short-time-scale and mesoscale weather forecast. This led to our study of adaptive design for spatial dynamical systems and spatial fields, leading to a 1999 paper on J. of Atmospheric Sciences and a book Chapter in Studies in Atmospheric Sciences published by Springer in 2000. Now, adaptive spatial design, or targeted observations, is an very hot area in meteorology, and many papers have published in meteorology dealing with various aspects of applications. There are good economic reasons also for doing adaptive design, though practical impacts of this approach need to be justified also. After making this unnecessary detour, what do I think of this book? Well, I think it's an excellent supplementary book for a spatial statistics course. This book only covers the classic aspects of spatial design, namely a frequentist approach to static design for standard spatial estimation and prediction, with applications such as in designing monitoring stations. By combining with our more recent work optimal design using Bayesian methods, you probably get a very good coverage of statistical design for spatial or space-time fields, an area which I foresee more developments in the future."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Aidan, a young Irish monk, is one of thirteen brothers chosen for a long pilgrimage to Byzantium where they are to present a costly gift to the emperor. Aidan grew up in the monastery and hasn't been to very many places, so he is happy and excited about this opportunity to see the world. But the journey proves to be a disaster. Sea Wolves attack the monks' ship, and things seem to go from bad to worse after that.The story has too many twists and turns to retell here; besides, I don't want to spoil it for you so I will concentrate on the spiritual part of Aidan's long journey, which, to me, was just as fascinating. At first, Aidan behaves like a perfect monk and a perfect Christian: he faces trials with remarkable patience and endures hunger, captivity, and beatings without a word of complaint. He is fully devoted to God, trusting that there is a purpose in all this, even though he might not understand it himself. But then Aidan's faith is shaken. He still believes in God, but he feels that God has abandoned him in his misery.But a remarkable thing happens. As Aidan's faith declines, that of his new friends Vikings whom he'd been trying to convert before seems to grow. They want to hear more about this god, Jesu, and when Aidan angrily replies that this god is a cruel, uncaring god who is not worth praying to, the Vikings assume that the god must be really good since Aidan wants to keep him to himself (I loved that part!). Nevertheless, Aidan continues his journey faithless. Hate and thirst for revenge now burn in his heart instead. It seems that nothing can turn him around - and you don't blame him as you read on. None of us would wish to have our faith tested that way.I will not tell you how the journey ends, you'll have to read for yourself. I'll just say that this story was a true blessing to me, in many ways."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I thought the book was great. It's a little graphic in a few places.

Please note, that you have to read the entire book to get the beauty of it. This book reminds us that even things that we know for certain, like death, can come about in ways we do not expect."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I read this book twice. Not too many books have I read more than once! The first time I read it as purely a fictional adventure. The second time I read it with an eye to the deeper subject of faith.As purely fiction, it is a fast-paced novel. It is historically feasible, but I don't know how accurate it is.When you read it and touch on the issues of faith does this book start to shine. I am in some doubt about some of the authors theology, but he has a firm grasp on the Christian faith. He presents the major character going thru what many people struggle with prior to their rebirth in Christ (I speak as a born-again Christian). How can a God who calls Himself love allow such seemingly needless suffering?Read the book and find out :)"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Allright, I have read three of Mr Lawhead's &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; and the first of his &quot;Dragon King&quot; books. Aside from MERLIN (a pretty good read), I was not altogether impressed. However, after picking this book up on a whim, I found that I couldn't put it down. The story is rivetting, and characterizations were for the most part fleshed out, neither all good or all evil as was the case in his other books. I see now that those works were merely practice for this awe-inspiring story of faith lost, then found again. I unashamedly give this book a five star review.

This is the type of book you want to read because it is uplifting and hopeful in the midst of tragedy. Try it out, you won't be sad, read the thing.The protagonist encounters all sorts of incredible experiences, from the simple to the incredible, and they all are worth seeing through his eyes. At points he is a worthless observer and at other time he critically siezes the events to help others and the whole time he is beating himself up and doing the best he can.

I was surprised by a few (to say the least). I honestly think Byzantium is Lawhead's best book ever. I loved Avalon, but it still didn't pass Byzantium as my all time favorite. If you like historical fiction or just want an excellent story with extremely well developed characters - this is the book for you. The important thing is to read the book with an open heart for the powerful message that is portrayed. It is a true story of redemption. I think one of the reasons I loved the book so much is I felt a kinship with the main character, Aidan, unlike I have with any other fictional character. After you read this, read the Celtic Crusade books, beginning with The Iron Lance. These continue the story and you'll see what happened to Byzantium a few hundred years later. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"At nearly 900 pages this book is amazing in many ways. First, you read that much in such a short time, for once you have picked it up you will find yourself unable to put it down. This book is a fictional retelling of St. Aidan's life. St. Paul's Cathedral in London, Ontario has a St. Aidan's Chapel that has a beautiful set of tapestries depicting the life of this servant of God. St. Aidan died in 651 after serving at home in Iona, among the Gauls - first as a slave and then as a Bishop, and he even visited Byzantium in his lifetime, and the seat of the Eastern Roman Empire.I was familiar with this church and with the artwork depicting Aidan's life. Yet it was not until almost halfway through the book, that I slapped my forehead and said 'Aidan the monk = St. Aidan'. The book is so craft- fully written that one easily becomes so lost in the story that it did not even click that I knew about this tale.Lawhead is a master wordsmith, who is most know for his Arthurian legend series, or his Celtic series, yet this stand-alone novel is every bit as much worth the time and attention as his other better-known works. This book was a departure for Lawhead, in that it was written from the beginning as a stand-alone. Therefore, if you do not like getting sucked into a series, where you need to read 4 or 5 books to get the whole story, this book is a great starting point in Lawhead's works.The story in this novel is powerful and moving. It is the story of a young man who was taken as a slave and later returned as a Minister, and eventually as a Bishop. It is the story of the spread of Christendom, and the story of service. Once you begin you will not be able to put this book down. So be warned!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This was the first Stephen Lawhead book I'd ever read. How could I not have known about him earlier?&quot;Byzantium&quot; has everything you could want in a story. Suspense, drama, love, heartbreak, despair, elation, and action. The main character is so well developed that it feels like you're experiencing his emotions right along with him.If you enjoy fantasy or any sort of medieval historical fiction, then you MUST read this book. I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Just finished Byzantium by Stephen Lawhead. Near on 900 pages, it reads both more slowly, and much faster that one would think. Lawhead's historical research into ninth-century Europe, Byzantium, and the Muslim Caliphates is deep and full of subtle detail. Lawhead writes of a fictional Irish monk, Aiden mac Cainnech, and his life adventures as he undertakes pilgrimage to Byzantium in company with his fellow monks, to deliver the tribute of a fabulously illuminated bible, the Book of Kells, to the Holy Emperor. Hidden beneath the surface of this holy quest is a political scheme to place the monestaries of Ireland under the authority of the Eastern Church, as there is much friction with the Roman branch of the church. Aiden knows nothing of this scheme until very late, and is in fact truly an innocent.The pilgrimage suffers disaster, in the form of a raiding party of Sea-wolves, and Aiden is carried off as a slave. The story follows Aiden as he journeys through Danemark, then to Constantiople, to Trebizond and Samarra, and back again. Along the way he is enslaved, raised to positions trust, betrayed, rescued, brought into the the courts of the Caliph, freed, and returned to the Golden City. Aiden falls in love and loses it, trusts and has his trust violated, shows deep faith and falls far from grace.While some might argue, with some justice, that the story suffers from more than bit of \\"You Are There,\\" it's really necessary to the story, and it's done in such a manner to not intrude. There are battles, but never gratuitously placed, and in each one you see Aiden's growth from panicked floundering to cool-headed observation. The blood is rendered unsympathetically, with only the necessary minimum of detail. The power politics are much dirtier than the fighting, for all that they're only seen in outline. This story isn't so much about what actually happened in history, as it is about how the history looked to outsiders.The story is so well written and so convincing that I looked-up Aiden to see if this was a fictionalization of a real monk's life. It's not, though there are three different Saint Aidens listed in the Catholic Online database. But this excellent historical fiction is entirely plausible just the same. Read it!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I read Taliesin and Merlin, both by Lawhead well over 10 years ago .. and feel like an idiot that I no longer own those books. I have to admit that 2 things sold this book for me. The cover illustration and the synopsis on the back. Okay, 3 things. I like stories based around historical events or during historical periods. Byzantium. Wow.Portions of this book bring to mind, The Lord of the Rings as well as other epic novels based on that particular genre of storytelling.From the very beginning, we are introduced to the way of life and limited life experience of the Aiden, princeling turned priest. His simple lifestyle may appeal to many of us, even though we outwardly deny the fact. The changes that he goes through as his travels land him in a new situation are wonderful to see. The characters we come into contact with are interesting and as the story progresses, they begin to take on more dimension, which is unfortunately lacking so much in many commercialized stories today, whether in print or on film.The historical references are captivating, from the Irish monastery, Viking society, Byzantine politics, and Islamic culture. Each of these mark a milestone in the metamorphasis of Aiden and ultimately epitomize the awakening most of us go through/never do/or wish we did.This is a book that should some day be brought to the screen. I have to admit that as I came to the final pages, I felt some regret and bittersweet understanding that while the end of the road is near, all things require closure. Adventures reach their conclusion. We each go our own way, some we will never see again. However, there will always be the memory of the experience and in this case you need not look further than your own bookshelf. BUY this book. EXPERIENCE it. And keep it for those times when you wish to rekindle that which once burned brightly, if even only for a moment.Okay. I liked the story."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Which experience is key in \\"Byzantium\\" --life as an Irish monk, as slave to Sea Dogs (Vikings), advisor to the emperor of Byzantium, slave in Arab silver mines, advisor to an Arab leader, betrothed of an Arab woman, or doubter of the faith?What is a monk without faith? How much more is a monk who loses faith and regains it? As the reader travels this incredible journey with Aidan mac Cainnech, she may well question the vagueness of historical timing because there are so many settings. The reader may question the use of multiple subplots with a riot of characters. Ultimately, the question becomes: Is this story possible? Is it credible?These questions were raised by another reviewer on this page. He praised the quality of writing but questioned the omission of a firm time period, raising the very same question for this reviewer. As I read I repeatedly questioned the time period, intending to research it. However, the reader should not need to--such information should be part of the story if its claim is to historical fiction. The reader should not wonder if the time is 500's, 900's (as noted in the Afterword), or 1100's. Just when is it?These comments are in no way critical of the book. In fact, it has become a new favorite and definitely is a page-turner. However, the lack of dates suggests to this reader that perhaps Lawhead wrote with a different thrust in mind: the question of faith. Aidan begins his journey to Byzantium a devout believer, not a fanatic, but a steadfast believer. Fairly early in the story, the Danes become part of the plot. It was during his time with Gunnar as a slave that Aidan has the opportunity to talk about his Savior. The seeds of belief are thus planted in Gunnar's soul. It is through Gunnar that Aidan's faith is re-born late in the novel.The journey through the historical places and people of \\"Byzantium\\" is the framework for faith. Whose faith? Why believe? How is it possible to believe in a world of ugly, brutal, and inhumane acts? The answers indicate a central purpose for this novel: a journey of faith through the experiences of one highly intelligent, unusual monk with a propensity for languages, the wisdom of rational and diplomatic thought and deeds, and luck. Luck? Of course not. In a story of faith, luck is really the supernatural made visible. Is it possible for one man to live all these experiences in a two-year time span? The answer is yes, it is possible.Another important theme is that of universality of humans. Each people group to be introduced has a preceding reputation: the Vikings as brutal creatures, who become among the kindest people in the book; the monks as kind, loving people and remain that way; the emperor and his kingdom, who should be representative of wise decisions but portray as much corruption as found anywhere at any time; Arabs about which little was known to Aidan, only to become what people are everywhere--wise, cruel, corrupt, insane, kind. By novel's end Lawhead has demonstrated that people are more alike in their human traits than they are different because of geographic and religious differences.Stephen R. Lawhead has a winner with \\"Byzantium,\\" for its historical accountings of people groups, for its page-turning suspense and action, for its believable characters that the reader comes to care for or not, and for its central still point of faith."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Unlike his remarkable and profound \\"Pendragon Cycle\\", \\"Byzantium\\" is not another Lawhead fantasy work. Apart from a couple of instances of dreams and omens, it is rather an entry by Lawhead into a different genre: historical fiction. Make that: EPIC historical fiction! In paperback, \\"Byzantium\\" comes close to 900 pages of delightful reading!Set in the tenth century Byzantine empire, the novel traces the life and adventures of a young Irish monk, Aidan. Aidan is selected to join a special envoy on a voyage to Byzantium, and deliver a precious gift - the holy Book of Kells - to the Christian emperor. The journey is an epic one, as Aidan becomes in turn a monk in the solitude of an Irish monastery, a slave of the barbarian Vikings, an ambassador and spy at the forefront of Byzantine political intrigue, a slave in the Caliph's silver mines, a serviceman of a Moslem Saracen prince, and finally again an Irish monk. He becomes a man of many resources - a monk, a sailor, a slave, a warrior, a spy.In many respects \\"Byzantium\\" is strongly reminiscent of \\"The Walking Drum\\", widely regarded as best work produced by the legendary Louis L'Amour. Like \\"The Walking Drum\\", \\"Byzantium\\" is a historical epic of extraordinary magnitude and scope, a grand tour of European life in the Dark Ages which encompasses the ends of a complete empire, a multitude of richly detailed cultures, a tapestry of languages and a complex fabric of religions. Like its L'Amour counterpart, \\"Byzantium\\" features a man who must overcome the odds in a variety of exceedingly harsh circumstances, and spices the tale of this adventurer with a glorious sense of adventure, romance, suspense, history, politics, and religion.My only quibble with Lawhead's effort is an apparent historical inaccuracy: he presents the emperor in Byzantine as emperor of the entire Roman empire, despite the fact that historically at this time the empire was split into East and West, the Irish acknowledging the Western emperor not the Eastern one. But on the whole Lawhead has surpassed L'Amour's historical masterpiece. \\"The Walking Drum\\" is at best educational entertainment, whereas \\"Byzantium\\" is literature. This is true literary fiction with well-rounded characters and a strong message. Although like \\"The Walking Drum\\" the majority of \\"Byzantium\\" is absorbed with a heightened sense of adventure, Lawhead's monk is in the end proves to be markedly superior to L'Amour's one-dimensional superman. Aidan's journey proves to be much more than just a journey of perilous adventures, it is above all a personal journey of faith. The monk who returns from his adventures is a changed man.Having begun his journey as a devout Christian, Aidan's rapid change of fortunes and bitter taste of suffering lead him to reject his faith. He becomes first agnostic, then atheistic, even Moslem. Convinced that God has forsaken him, Aidan forsakes his faith and his God. It is only after he returns home that he is spurred by his former barbarian friend Gunnar to re-examine his faith (p.861-8). Re-evaluating his whole perspective on his pilgrimage, he comes to the recognition that even in his suffering God had not forsaken him. It would be impossible, because Christ was forsaken in the place of the believers, hanging on the cross saying \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" Aidan comes to the startling realization that Christ's forsakenness means that believers will never be forsaken by God. God has not forsaken Aidan, but Aidan has forsaken God. Being a Christian does not mean living without suffering, it means rather having faith in God who truly knows and supports His people in that suffering.This is an encouraging message for believers experiencing sufferings in their own pilgrimage of faith. It makes \\"Byzantium\\" much more than a gripping page-turner, but a stimulating read that will enhance your perspective on life. The beauty of this kind of Christian fiction, is that you share not only in the characters' sufferings and adventures, but also their spiritual growth. Any novel that has the potential stimulate and encourage as well as entertain is a significant achievement indeed, and \\"Byzantium\\" is no exception. A credible, suspenseful and gripping plot, a colourful and vivid historical setting, and a clear and powerful message - Christian historical fiction doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Historical fiction is often a hit or miss affair. When it hits (as it does with Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\"), it takes the reader back to another time while teaching valuable lessons about humanity. When it misses, it ends up looking a lot like Stephen Lawhead's \\"Byzantium.\\" This isn't to say that \\"Byzantium\\" is a bad book; it is certainly entertaining as an action packed yarn with a cast of characters longer than your arm. But \\"Byzantium\\" fails as a historical tale because it really doesn't reflect the time period in which the story takes place.Set in the 10th century during the reign of Byzantine emperor Basil II, \\"Byzantium\\" is a detailed account of the travels of Aidan, an Irish monk charged with delivering a special copy of the New Testament to the city of Constantinople. Aidan sets out with a group of monks on this mission, nervous about discharging his duties but excited about having a chance to see the world. Aidan does get to see the world, and he sees it in ways that he never imagined. Right at the start of the mission, the boat Aidan is sailing on is waylaid by a band of pirates. Aidan is taken prisoner, made a slave, and begins a roundabout trip to Constantinople. Along the way, Aidan falls in with a Viking expedition, travels through Kiev, visits Constantinople for an audience with Basil, acts as a spy for the Byzantines, is captured by Arabs, learns several languages, is almost executed in a slave mine, nearly marries a beautiful woman, and loses his faith (in no particular order).All of these situations are well drawn and fairly exciting (especially the sea battle towards the end of the book, a battle that hums with energy and tension). Throughout each of these situations, Aidan must rely on his wits and various abilities to stay alive and hope to complete the mission he set out on. Lawhead certainly has the ability to create intriguing set pieces, whether it is the inside of a Danish feast hall, an Arab palace, or the city of Constantinople. This makes the book a fun read.Regrettably, Lawhead fails to create convincing connections with the 10th century European world. Outside of a brief encounter with Basil II, this story could easily have been set in any time frame between the 6th and 14th century. The historical elements drop into the background of the story for large sections of the book. In other words, the book just doesn't speak from its time as many other books in the genre do (think about a book such as \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" for instance. That book creates some medieval atmosphere!). Perhaps this comes from a fear of making errors about the time frame, or a lack of hard research into the period. This book should be categorized as action/adventure rather than historical fiction.The character development is lacking as well. It is understandable that all of the characters could not be developed due to the large number of people populating the pages of this story. The problem comes when major characters show a disturbing shallowness. Aidan, the main character and narrator, isn't given much to do beyond observing and surviving his surroundings. His crisis of faith, a clich&eacute; of epic proportions found in almost any book in which a priest is a character, isn't enough to create a memorable character. Other characters are reduced to mere cardboard cutouts.Still, books like \\"Byzantium\\" do serve an important purpose. It is a relaxing book, one that doesn't require much thought to get through. This can be soothing after plowing through literature, history, philosophy, or any other heavy reads. Its length may scare off some, but \\"Byzantium\\" provides a good dose of action for those who crave such things"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"It seems many books with this kind of historical-fiction-epic stories, are about some kind of trip to the Middle-East.

The characterizations left the reader with a few more fictional &quot;friends&quot; to think back upon. The brutality of the age, and the tentativeness of life are prevalent throughout. I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium is an excellent story of a man of faith who loses his faith through test after test. Aidan blames God for the hardships he has to face. Sound depressing? The novel has an awesome ending that will encourage any person to persevere whatever struggle that may come. You see, in the end... just kidding! It's a long book but it never let's you down. If you get mad (like I did) while reading the first half, good! That reaction will make the superb ending all the better. We can all associate with the main character. But enough of my babbling, just read it!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Having read all of Lawhead's books, I thoroughly enjoyed Byzantium. Though not a fast read, it has all the elements that makes Lawhead's works brilliant - superb writing, adventure, and a spiritual message. Byzantium's story line takes you just about everywhere. And what I enjoyed most about the book was how I was able to relate with Aidan (though I've never faced the trials he had to endure!). Byzantium is a faith builder for the believer."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is a great book. Only Lawhead could produce such a great story, with a real person as the main character. This is really one of the best books I have ever read - definitely Lawhead's best. There is really nothing else to say."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"What a great read! First 50 pages are slow, but as soon as the VIKINGs come in it takes off. The story is as amazing as anything you'd find in a sci fi/fantasy novel, but set in real-history."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I picked this book up expecting the type of literary adventure I had discovered in other works of Lawhead's. What I found, however, was so much more. Lawhead, once again, does a wonderful job of working so many facts of history (as well as quite a few suppositions) into a story with so much impact. But this time, he went beyond the action and drama of his previous works. He takes his protagonist through a journey (though sometimes far mor fanciful than historical, it seems) that causes the reader to question the meaning of so many issues of faith. The characters, the action, the places, the tensions, all work together to shape a narrative that not only entertains--it raises fundamental questions for those who really want to know about the relationship between an man and his God."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is a splendid book by a splendid author. Aidan, an enthusiastic monk with whom we can all identify at some point, has a dream which foretells his death in Byzantium. Yet he undertakes a perilous journey there, with a few unplanned stops along the way, and learns quite a lot about himself, his fellow man, and his faith. &quot;Losing faith in a childish understanding of God is not the same thing as losing faith in God;&quot; in the same way, Aidan realizes that his former beliefs weren't wrong, they just didn't go far enough.This is a fabulous book on both an adventurous and a spiritual level, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the time period or in the issues discussed therein."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium is a great book to read. It has non-stop adventure, as a monk from a monestary in England embarks on a journey to Byzantium (now called Istanbul) with a secret quest. Along the way, however, he is separated from his friends and captured by Sea Wolves (Vikings). He spends many years as a personal slave to many Sea Wolves, and eventually moves up in the ranks. He begins to lose his trust in God, thinking God forgot him. He eventually makes it to Byzantium, however, because the Sea Wolves want to capture it for its riches. However, they soon begin to realize that it is impossible to overtake such a large and defended city. The monk is eventually reunited with his friends, but is caught by a traitor and sent to a prison camp where he sees some of his friends die. He is released by a Muslim Prince, who begins to like him. His daughter is liked by this monk, and he decides to give up his faith in Christ to marry the Prince's daughter. However, at the end everything is worked out, he trusts in God again, and brings the whole Sea Wolf fleet to Christ. It is an incredible book with great detail and interesting situations that could only occur ion these unique cultures. It also shows that God will never forsake you, even if you forsake him."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The first time I read this author. It was a very slow start for about 70 pages, sort of stilted style, but then it took off and became downright intriguing, capturing my attention. Very good book. I gave it a 9 because the author's writing style seemed to lack expression in the beginning."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This was not a fast read but so satisfying. When you reflect on all the adventures Aidan experienced you are tempted to say &quot;how incredulous&quot;. Who cares, its exciting and great entertainment. However what makes it really good is the discussion of Aidan's spiritual journey. It's timely and appropriate. Loved it."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I had tried to read his other books with arthurian themes and had thought them wide of the mark, but this book hits the nail on the head. An unusual hero who thrives in all the most facinating places of a facinating time. A terrific depiction of viking hubris and humor."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Stephen Lawhead has don it again! This epic begins with Aidan, a young nobleman monk, dreaming of his destiny. Instantly, you are captivated by the desires of this young monk and his quest to identify his true role in life. As doubt and confusion cloud his way, Aidan begins the most vibrant days of his life on a sacred journey to Byzantium. You cannot put this story down even if you want to! One of the best historical fiction books written in a long time. Aidan's adventures become your own while both you and he search life for direction and truth. Well done."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Stephen Lawhead has written a beautiful book. He has woven an appropriately Byzantine plot around the story of a pilgrimage gone awry. The essential elements of the plot are negligible compared to the wonderful and remarkably realistic characters, settings, and struggles of the characters. The central character, Aidan, struggles mightily with some of the questions of faith and God that sometimes beset all of us. And while the end seems a bit abrupt, it is all telegraphed throughout, so that it is also inevitable. I wish I had a dozen more like this to read every year"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Extremely well written.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well crafted historical fiction"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead is one of my favorite authors &amp; BYZANTIUM is one of his best. He tells the story of Aidan, a scribe from an Irish monastery, who is chosen to go present a manuscript to the Emperor of all Christendom.

His struggles,both physical and spiritual, make for an exciting read that is both realistic and encouraging"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"A rare combination these days: a well written, epic adventure, historical fiction all with spiritual insight. Although the dialogue seems a bit thin at times, Lawhead's depictions of various Middle Age cultures are marvelous. Though one may suspect the conclusion of Aidan's spiritual journey, nevertheless the ending and the epiloge hit one with the force of a sledgehammer. One can only hope this turns into the next Hollywood blockbuster"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Purely becasue I have not checked I am not sure about the accuracy of all that is mentioned in the book but I am sure some research went in to it and the book gives you no reason to doubt it, which is what a good book does. It keeps you captivated and attentive to details but not really concerned about their validity. However, the historical details make this a more interesting story. The story weaves together the different worlds that existed around the same time in different parts of the world through Aedans fantastic journey from Ireland to his captivity by vikings to Byzantium and further yet into the arabic world. It has at times a humours and accepting way to describe differences in culture and lifestyle. I loved this book. It was well written and kept me wanting to pick it up again each time my lunch hour was over and I had to stop until the next day's lunchtime."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is one of the most moving novels I have ever read. Lawhead matches his usual breathtaking style to one of history's great epics, delivering a wondrous work of despair, intrigue, faith and love. A must read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"For an historical novel, Lawhead's Byzantium shows little research. First, the title - Byzantium - the city was known at the time of the novel's setting as Constantinople, having been named for Constantine the Great (r 306 -337 AD), not the emperor Constans, as Lawhead writes. The characters in the story would have referred to it as Constantinople, not Byzantium. Lawhead also has the emperor in Constantinople being the Holy Roman Emperor. Nope, the Holy Roman Emperor is an entirely different office. He seems to think that Ireland somehow recognized the suzerainity of the Byzantine Emperor - again, entirely fanciful. He has Byzantine officials governing Gaul - again, fanciful. He has Roman coins bearing the likeness of the Emperor Theophilus (d 842), who reigned in Constantinople, not Rome, so Roman coins would not have shown him. He refers to the Byzantine emperor, the Basileus (which he gets correctly), as God's Vice-Regent on Earth. No, he was God's Vice-Gerent on Earth.The plot may be fun, but let's not pretend that this novel is an accurate historical portrayal."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Stephen R. Lawhead's BYZANTIUM is historical fiction. You will not be frightened by lethal aliens, or dazzled by futuristic technology. You get plenty of sword, but no sorcery. Does that sound boring? Well if science fiction relied solely on its aliens and futuristic speculation, it would be boring. Likewise with fantasy and its swords and sorcery. And if BYZANTIUM relied only on its historical realism, it too would be boring.Yet BYZANTIUM is far from boring because it displays a powerful lesson on what is fiction's sine qua non (without which nothing).Story!Story!Story!It is of paramount importance.Around 885 AD, the protagonist Aidan joins with twelve of his brethren monks on a pilgrimage from Ireland to Constantinople (the Greeks called it Byzantium). They have a gift for \\"Christ's second regent\\" on Earth, the Holy Emperor. It is a masterpiece of their own making: a Bible of hand-scripted vellum, bound in silver with a jewel-encrusted crucifix. But travel during the Dark Ages is dangerous. Even for warriors. If these monks were not obsessed with faith, they would understand that such a journey is foolish.So before experiencing the splendor of his world's capital, our humble Aidan must experience the nadir of agony. But Lawhead is not a sadist. He does not mire you in endless pages of dark dungeons. Failure is always balanced with victory; twists and turns and surprises abound; the innocent wander into intrigue; and in the end, BYZANTIUM gratifies. Yet if you insist that you NEED aliens and spaceships, or that you NEED at least a little bit of magic, you do yourself injury. BYZANTIUM will fill your needs with story."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"It's a great story and a wonderful tribute to Christian faith. Lawhead well represents the existential crisis of a deeply faithful and thoughtful person confronted with God's apparent lack of regard for humans, especially God's own worshipers. This is accomplished while telling a gripping story of seafaring, battles, conspiracy, slaughter and imperial political intrigue. And the author is respectful of Islam.I am particularly impressed with Lawhead's ability to weave existential and theological insights into his story, because I tried to do the same on a much smaller scale in \\"False Prophet?\\". So, I know some of the difficulties.The story starts out a little slow and Aidan, the main character, seems an uninteresting milksop of a monk. However, as the story builds so does Aidan's character. The character is based on the historical St. Aidan. I don't know how accurate the history is, but it's an awful and magnificent life Aidan leads in the book. He has a great and sweeping adventure and even gets to fall in love and kill the bad guy. Not bad for a milk sop monk.[...]"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This book reminded me a lot of Noah Gordon's \\"The Physician\\" which uses a similar plot device, namely, the adventures of a European into the exotic East during the Dark Ages. Likewise, both novels deal with the protagonist's spiritual pilgrimage which unfolds together with the action sequences. To my mind, Gordon's book succeeds better in this.As to plot, you can't get much more \\"rousing\\" than the epic journey from a tiny monastery in Erie (Ireland)to Constantinople and beyond. The author has done his homework, and the book is chock full of interesting historical details and atmosphere. The action is very fast paced and Lawhead is a master of the \\"cliff hanger\\" chapter endings which keep you reading page after page. We get to meet maurauding Sea Wolves, crooked tradesmen, devious courtiers, Arab amirs and even the Emperor Basil himself - generally believeable portrayals overall.Less successful, however, are Lawhead's forays into his protagonist's soul as he struggles with the loss of his faith as he sees cruelty and injustice at every turn, despite his urgent pleas for Divine intervention in human affairs. When it is not forthcoming, and the suffering of his friends continues, he wanders off into a spiritual wilderness. His crisis of faith becomes a central theme as the novel unfolds. I have no problem with this theme per se, but our monk's crisis of faith is resolved in the space of two pages - a bit precipitous for this reader, and not in the slightest believeable or convincing.Also problematic is our monk's abortive betrothal to the exotic Arab princess. Thankfully, the reader is not subjected to melodramatic scenes of honeyed moonlight kisses as he falls in love, but neither is there ever any sense of real passion or true emotional connection between the two. Initially, the bride-to-be says \\"Allah has decreed\\" that she and the monk are to be wed. What happens to this divine decree when the princess announces that all bets are off? Did Allah slip up here? Bottom line - I am not sure why the romance was even included in the narrative, except that any best seller demands a bit of sexual tension to spice it up. A failure in this case.Overall, I read through this thick adventure at a galloping clip, wanting to see \\"how it turned out.\\" Most loose ends are satisfactorily tied up, but I was left partially unsatisfied by the unconvincing \\"return to faith\\" of the protagonist and felt a bit cheated by the seemingly artificial \\"happy ending.\\" Nonetheless, this is a quick, entertaining read for a summer day. Don't expect more and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The book opens when the fictional Aidan mac Cainnech is about 20 years old, although the story never reveals his exact age or the time period. On the last page of the book, the reader learns that it takes place in the early 900s.This approach confused me at first because, as a fan of historical fiction, I expect actual history to play somewhat of a role - at least as a backdrop to the story. It wasn't until Harald, king of the Danish Sea Wolves, agreed to be a mercenary for the Byzantium emperor that I began to wonder how much of the story was fiction and how much was history.As it turns out, the book is entirely fiction. None of the characters ever lived and none of the events ever took place. However, with some exceptions, including the event of the previous paragraph, the story feels real. This, IMO, is the mark of skilled storyteller.Aidan and his brother monks go on a pilgrimage to Byzantium to deliver a holy book to the emperor. Their journey is an ill-fated one from the start - or so it would appear throughout most of the book. Vikings attack them, and Aidan becomes a slave. Because of his skill with languages, he eventually makes it to Byzantium - as a slave to the Danes.In Byzantium, he encounters treachery, although he doesn't recognize it as such for awhile. He is freed, then enslaved again - this time working silver mines. And on the story goes, with one exciting adventure after another.While subtle threads of Christian belief appear throughout, it isn't until the last 100 pages that the Christian message comes on strong, making this book more Christian fiction than historical fiction, IMO. Had I known this up front, I would not have read it. (Christian fiction just isn't my thing.) But then I would have missed a wonderful story.Highly recommended for those who like a lot of action, a happy ending and an uplifting message."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I read this book a little while ago when I really needed a book that I could read for fun. Following some advice from a good friend of mine, I picked up this book and couldn't put it down. Although the book starts slowly, it picks up pace gradually and by the end, I was holding my breath. Absolutely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is the story of Aidan - a man who was son of a family of rulers in Ireland, who were killed. He was sent to a monastery, where he became a monk. And that's where the story begins.Aidan is chosen to be involved in a long trip with several other monks to Byzantium, where he and his fellows will present a manuscript to the Emperor. However, before long, things get sticky; the monks fight off a group of Vikings (Sea Wolves), their ship sinks, Aidan becomes separated and becomes a slave, a spy, a Viking, even a Sarazen.So much happens to him, in fact, it's nearly impossible for an accurate description. He becomes betrothed to the daughter of the amir of the Arabic peoples. He loses his faith in God - and, very suddenly, the betrothal is cancelled. Just as suddenly, he gains back his faith. He becomes friends with his enemies, enemies with his friends - all in a space of 870 pages.This novel is a true epic. At times, I'll admit, I hated the book - it was far too wordy; I was sick of reading it and wanted so much to read something different. However, at the same time, I loved it. Not a word was wasted and it is truly something that I would recommend to anyone, whether they be Christian, Catholic, Jewish, or whatever. This is my first novel by Stephen R. Lawhead, and trust me: it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I could not put this book down! The story is about this young, motivated Celtic monk that gets selected to go on the journey of a lifetime to Byzantium. When things don't go the way he planned (as they so often happen in real life) he ends up journeying across much of the known world to not only set things right but also to restore his faith. The characters, the plot, the setting . . . it was all there!I especially liked the rich, scenic descriptions Lawhead puts forth. Wherever he takes you, whether it's the deserts of the middle east or the land of the vikings in the north, I never had a problem seeing where he was taking me.From the beginning, this story is based around a mystery that just gets more complex as the plot moves along, and yet I never felt lost. Lawhead allows you to understand the mystery just as the characters understand it, so none of the discoveries really seem contrived or are complete surprises. Definitely a book I would recommend to anyone interested in a book of epic proportions!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I was awake nights reading after I hit two thirds of the way through the book! The adventures get really exciting once they hit Constantinople and through the end. High adventure, blood-stirring action, men fighting bitter battles, a lot of well-written action sequences with good plot development. However, for the protagonists problem with his Lord to wrap up in one page at the end &quot;problem solved&quot; was a bit ridiculous. But I truly enjoyed the book as a whole and highly recommend it to anyone who loves historical fiction and adventure!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium is the first Stephen Lawhead novel I have read...though likely will not be the last. Having discovered this book in the back room of a used book store during a book buying excursion to upstate New York, I decided to give the author a try, though I had never heard of him.Chronicling the 'adventures' of a young monk named Aidan, the story begins in a monastary in Ireland where a group of Aidan's brothers have prepared a gift for the Emporer, a copy of the Book of Kells. Aidan is among the 13 monks chosen to undertake the journey to deliver this gift to the Emporer, though he is plagued by troubling dreams of his own death in the city of their destination, Byzantium. Nevertheless, Aidan answers what he feels is a call from a higher power to undertake this journey, and sets off with his brother monks.There begins a series of events that none could have forseen for Aidan, including himself. Set upon by pirates (here called 'Sea Wolves') and enslaved by them, Aidan learns a different kind of 'service' than previously taught to him in the monastary. Aidan acquiesces to his new surroundings and duties, learning the language of the Danes (the aforementioned Sea Wolves) as well.But this is just the beginning of Aidan's tale...and to try to capture all of the action in this review would certainly overrun the word limit allowed in an Amazon book review. Aidan's incredible journey is well detailed in the pages that follow his initial capture and enslavement, and the story never lacks for action and intrigue.Author Stephen Lawhead has crafted an incredible journey for the young Monk, and delivered an extraordinary novel to delight readers. Full of period detail, descriptions of vivid settings, and colorful characters; Byzantium is an engaging novel and a good introduction to a capable writer. My only criticism with the book lies in the author's very repetitious reminders of Aidan's dream of his own death in Byzantium, and an occasionally 'elementary' way of presenting setting and character, as one might find in a classic comics version of a famous novel. However, the work as a whole overshadows these minor distractions, and is indeed an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is an excellent novel. So many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. The book starts off a little slow but it doesn't take very long and you are hooked into the suspense of dramatic events. Written so well with descriptions that you feel you are experiencing history in the making."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I probably can't add anything that hasn't already been said in other reviews by readers who also loved this book, so I'll just say this: if you like Historical fiction, if you're interested in Church History or the age of Byzantine, or Ireland, or all of the above you'll enjoy this book as much as I did which was tremendously."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium opened my eyes to the historical fiction genre. Never in my mind had I imagined such a tastefully written novel. Stephen Lawhead tells this tale with such intensity that it leaves you dwelling on the scenes long after you have put the book down. My only criticism of this book is that middle way through he stops developing some of his characters and is the only reason I don't give him a full blown 5 star review. I suppose that the book published forced Lawhead to downsize the book and he had to crop out some of the details in the middle section.I'll be looking for more books like this."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is the first Stephen Lawhead book I've read and without a doubt it was an example of fine writing.Through the wonderful pages of this book I was taken on a ride from an Irish monastery , through to being enslaved by vikings then onto ancient Byzantium and beyond.The author was able to create a feeling of empathy for the main character Aiden and I found myself swept away in the pages eagerly following Aidens steps-awaiting the next twist of fait.An absorbing read , totally enjoyable and well worth a place on anyones bookshelf.One of the best books I've read in the last couple of years , along with This thing of darkness by Harry Thompson."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"When I first started reading the book I didn't know whether I would get to the end. It started off slow but once I got through the first 100 pages it began to pick up. After that there was no putting it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure/suspense stories. As soon as I was finished I wanted to pick it up and read it all over again."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is a perfect blend of historical fiction with a slight touch of fantasy. Long but very well written and researched. It will provide a lot of hours of entertainment.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"My journey through the writings of Lawhead has been as varied as that described in \\"Byzantium.\\" I've read my way over soaring peaks, pushed through a few valleys of disappointment, but never stopped believing that each subsequent book may be a triumph.\\"Byzantium\\" proved to be the epic I had been waiting for. I would almost lament the time it's taken me to get to this fantastic novel, except that I believe it was for a reason. Indeed, Aidan's journey of faith through the course of the story mirrors my own in many ways. It was a tale I needed to experience at this very point in my life.Without getting into matters of historical veracity (since they can be explored ad nauseum on the author's site and other places), let me say that the details of the era rang true as I devoured the narrative. Not only do the sights, colors, sounds, and smells take on a life of their own, but even the sentence structure and vocabulary polish and heighten the richness of the text.Starting with a straightforward task, a group of monks leave Ireland with the Book of Kells, to be given as a gift to the ruler of Christendom in Constantinople. Their travels lead them through dangers and triumphs, friendships and betrayals, faith and overwhelming doubt. There is beauty and love to be discovered, as well as violence and slavery. Told through the eyes of Aidan, the plot is paced to perfection, in regards to both the physical and spiritual toils encountered.Lawhead writes this story with the bittersweet understanding of a man who has faced inner struggles similar to his protagonist. His ability to put these feelings to paper, through the thoughts of a monk living in an era removed from ours by over a thousand years, is the mark of a gifted novelist. And, truly, \\"Byzantium\\" is a gift of a novel."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"An incredible adventure! And before you read the ignorant comments stating that Lawhead doesn't accurately portray the life of St. Aidan in Byzantium, know that this story is about a, \\"composite character, whose life mirrors the kinds of priestly activities and political intrigues of his day.(stephenlawhead.com)\\"This book could easily be made into a big screen movie that would give the LOTR trilogy a run for the money!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Having earlier read Lawhead's Song of Albion trilogy, I approached this book with high expectations. I was not disappointed. I can echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers. There were several minor occasions when I wanted the book to be finished, but I had to chastise myself for thinking so, for in so doing, I was demonstrating not the book's weakness, but rather my own. I read the book with a dictionary, because Lawhead's breadth of linguistic aptitude is likely beyond most modern people. I learned many new words, and I love that in a book. The story is an epic, in the classical sense, and the sense of wonder and adventure Lawhead cultivates is impressive. I could not help daydreaming later of some of the events and places, picturing myself there. Lawhead is an extremely descriptive writer, painstakingly painting a face or a scene. Significant encounters are so emotionally and visually loaded, that you are helplessly drawn into them. An earlier reviewer mentioned that some folks may be offended by discussion of God, Jesus, etc. For those folks, I would simply say, welcome to historical-fiction...nay history! The religious elements are arguably central to the story, for the path of Aidan within the book is not over Skania, Gaul, and Anatolia, per se. They are simply the physical context in which the soul-wrenching travel takes place. Since Lawhead is writing as Aidan in the 1st-person, the introspection and soul-searching are brutally honest and utterly realistic. If only we were all so honest with ourselves! The philosophical presence of the \\"God in a world of evil\\" debate is undeniable. What Aidan sees and does is ubiquitous throughout history, and the anguish he experiences, the questions he asks, are the very questions that have occupied the greatest souls and minds in all of history. The novel is not easy to read, given the more diverse vocabulary and complex plot, but it is well worth your effort to press through, and do so in front of a mirror...as so much can resonate with the human soul, if we are only willing to allow it."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Don't believe the bad hype! This epic is great! Those who think that this book is hard on the protagonist are right! Those who think that each chapter leaves us hanging are right! And I wouldn't have it any other way! Maybe those that want a more realistic book should start reading non-fiction and leave the fiction to those of us who enjoy it! Who wouldn't want a character to visit interesting people? This book is for anyone who can take it, you'll be on the edge of your seat all the way! I was glad when I finished reading it and I'll be even gladder when I get my hands on his next book, The Iron Lance!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The most shocking part of this engrossing tale is the epilogue... when you discover that it's a TRUE STORY! It reads like a fantastic adventure novel, full of graphic, full-colored narratives that let you breathe the spice of Byzantium's open market, feel the parching wind of the Saudi desert, and hear the thrum and cry of battle. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Easily one of the best books this decade, I'd have a difficult time choosing between _Byzantium_ and the _Song of Albion_ cycle as my favourite among Lawhead's works. His descriptions of the mystical aspects of the Christian faith are uncanny, equal to his historical detail. But the thing that never ceases to amaze me about Lawhead is how he can put what seems like a message just for me, in between the lines of every book he writes, and it's not always what I'd have expected. I'd like to see Gunnar appear in another book someday - what a combination of wisdom and simplicity!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"That says it all... Historically accurate, engrossing characters with struggles we can empathize with. Well Done."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Sometimes I find it hard to believe that the professional reviewers quoted at this site actually read the same book that I did. This is my absolute favorite book. Aidan is an incredibly human character forced to face obstacles to his faith greater than any man ever should. Or perhaps we should all face such obstacles; if we could come through them with our faith still intact, we would know that our faith is worth hanging on to. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Having read the Pendragon series from Lawhead, and having enjoyed them, I thought that Byzantium would be equally as entertaining... I was wrong! This book was better in every way than the books of the Pendragon series. Byzantium is to historical fiction, what the Hobbit was to fantasy. Lawhead really shows a lot in this novel.

The result is disturbing. The main character's crisis of faith and its resolution are interesting and would be believable--were he not an intelligent and educated Catholic monk. In effect, Lawhead's monk regards faith as would a 20th century Evangelical Protestant. The book reflects a complete lack of awareness of Catholic sacramental theology in general and of the Eucharist in particular. The sacraments, especially the Eucharist, are and always have been at the heart of Catholic worship. This is especially true in monastic communities. According to Catholics, the sacraments are the primary means by which God freely infuses grace into his creatures. And yet the main character--a priest and a monk--did not perform a single mass through the entire 850 pages. Nor did he attend mass when he had the opportunity (when in Constantinople). This omission would have been monumental, absolutely enormous, in the mind of any once devout Catholic--especially a priest. Faith is sustained by the sacraments, yet Lawhead's monk doesn't show any awareness that the sacraments exist! This makes the \\"historical\\" part of the fiction disturbingly dishonest.Lawhead also seems as ignorant of the relationship between secular authority and the Church in the 10th century as he is of the sacramental life of the Church. While the emperor would have been able to practically intervene in the actual practices of the Apostolic See, he would not have been in any way considered the \\"Supreme Head of the Church.\\" He was considered a secular ruler and in this subordinate even to common priests: et ideo nos a vobis recte judicamur."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Had Lawhead wrote &quot;&quot;Byzantium&quot; as a serious book, I do not think that its target audience would be waxing over it with superlatives. The general reader will find much interesting historical detail in this text and might develop an appreciation for the richness and complexity of life in a time that we smugly refer to as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; (as if we are living in the Days of Light). The daily round of life in an Irish monastery is lovingly described, as are the lives of the pagan Danes and civilized Arabs of the time. This type of historical detail is much to the novel's favor, and Lawhead deserves credit for bringing long-forgotten times into the mainstream with care and attention to detail.However, I found the story contrived and sort of dull. The protagonist goes from peril to peril like a monastic Pauline, and each chapter leaves us hanging. Perhaps that is the nature of such books, but I found it tiresome. In the effort to paint the tapestry of the times, Lawhead's poor protagonist never has a moment's rest, neither does the poor reader. Think about it: how likely it is that a person would have met two Holy Roman Emperors, as well as the Caliph of the Arabs, also managing to save the King of the Danes from slavery in the silver mines? Lawhead's overwrought description of the protagonist's character development also leaves much to be desired, but this author is not aiming for subtlety.This might be a good summer read for high school students, or for those who ought to be high school students. It is a marginal book with some interesting historical details, but that is about it.I was glad when I finished reading it."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead makes you part of the adventure and you feel as if you are part of the crew. Highly recommended to all types of readers."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"If there is any problem with this book it is its size. I had a hard time getting through it. I am not counting of because this is as much my fault (if not more) than the book's. When finished and after about two years to think about it. IT seems to me to be a grand historic epic in the tradition of War and Peace. It improved my reading skills immensly."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Stephen Lawhead has hit a flat note with &quot;Byzantium.&quot; The details as always are vivid; however, the plot is slow and lackluster. The characters are also dull and predictable. The novel was still a great idea, and all in all, not a bad fantasy/adventure. But just too tedious, deliberate, and contrived."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The story told in &quot;Byzantium&quot; is perhaps the stuff of a TV miniseries, but as a novel it is over-long (at 872 pages!), far-fetched and unbelievable, and in the end, not very gratifying. The prose is pedestrian and pedantic, and the author's attempts at descriptive language often go astray. For example, between pages 682 and 703, the main character, Aidan, has his stomach&quot;squirm&quot;, has something someone said &quot;squirm&quot; in his head, and has his mind \\"squirm\\". It would appear that poor Aidan, and the poor reader, are in trouble. The novel has Aidan travelling through so many lands and so many adventures, the tale becomes a laundry list of &quot;what else can I have him do now?&quot; rather than a coherent narative. The novel also does injustice to the real, historical St. Aidan who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 635. St. Aidan predated the Book of Kells (c. late seventh, early eighth century) and was never engaged to an Arab princess!!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"If you are looking for a good book, than Byzantium, by Stephen R. Lawhead, would be a good start. This story is great because you can relate to what the main character is going through, unlike other novels I've read.But for a pre-cation before you choose to read this book is you should be a Cathlic or any other religion who believes in God. Since the main character is an Irish monk and lives in a Cathlic monestary there's a lot of talk about God and Jesus and might be disturbing for some people.Like I said, you can relate to the character and what he is thinking. Lawhead writes this story in the character's point of view so you know what he is thinking, and he also does alot of thinking!What is fascinating about this book is that the author mixes different cultures together, like celt, arabain, and viking through Aidan's, the main character's, journey.Though the only problem with this story, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars, is some of the events are alot like other stories and are highly banal. That is also the same with the plot, the same as other stories. But if this story is not appealing enough, than try reading some of Stephen R. Lawhead's other series like: The Empyrion Saga, the Pendragon Cycle, or the Song of Ablion series."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I used to like fantasy novels, but now I'm beginning to realize how flat and uninspired many are. Byzantium is no exception. Perhaps with a better author, it could have been made into something. As it is however, Byzantium wears out anyone with a curious, discerning mind. Stephen R. Lawhead appears to have hit a glass ceiling with his character descriptions: try as he might, they never become real, flesh and blood individuals. Instead they, and the world they travel through, remain two-dimensional and uninvolving. The writing style is inconsistent, and the ending was not well thought through; the author simply does not have the writing prowess to lift his novels to a higher level. Byzantium is a readily forgotten, slow read, indistinguishable from the multitudes of cheap, unbelievable fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The writing was plastic, the story told with out any emotion, the characters were thinner than a piece of paper. The book is light summer reading at best. I was disappointed and found the lack of depth in all areas of the book. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Read Lonesome Dove if you want a real adventure or read Byzantium by Norwich if you want to learn something about the place. But don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"As a Lawhead fan I loved the book. It was truly hard for me to put the book down once I began. I loved the constant change. You never knew from one page to the next what might happen. BUT, my only complaint is that it took Aiden years to take his journey AND THEN THE WHOLE BOOK ENDS IN THE LAST PAGE!!!!!!! I was very displeased with having read the whole book only to find the ending crammed into one page. I loved the book but hated the ending."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"You've gotta love those Vikings, eh? Lawhead takes us through some of the most fascinating places of a fascinating time and there are long stretches that flow with intrigue/fun/adventure/whatever. However, when he needs to make a developmental step forward, the story leaps or &quot;jerks&quot; onto a whole new premise. Things start to get a bit sluggish, then WHAM! something happens or someone's attitude changes inexplicably. The central tangle, Aidan's faith and sudden bitterness towards God, took me by surprise, and not pleasantly. I was perplexed as to his sudden change of heart with subsequent bile, and this was never explained... I enjoyed the places Lawhead took me, but he needed to work more on the transitions, not to mention the ending. Most of them seemed too-sudden."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I have read all or part of most of Lawhead's books. I usuallyreach a certain point and get disappointed with his craft. But with&quot;Byzantium&quot; he has written something far above all his other efforts. It is a thing of beauty. Truly Lawhead's writing has reached the level of brilliance that it hints at in his other books.I've read many of the books that are supposed to be good Christian fiction. Let's face it, it's mostly junk. I can say that because I'm a Christian author. And a reader of Christian fiction. I read Peretti's &quot;The Oath&quot; and liked it (I'd give it a 7), but it's nothing close to this epic story.&quot;Byzantium&quot; beguiles from start to finish. I never once correctly predicted how the story would flow. Completely enjoyable. Without doubt, &quot;Byzantium&quot; is the best Christian fiction out there. I aspire to write like Lawhead did in this book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I love this kind of stuff &amp; grabbed the book eagerly as soon as I saw it in the stores. Shouldn't have bothered. The concept is intriguing and some of the writing seemed very fresh but the tale is told badly via a plot which is unwieldy, full of unlikely coincidences, &amp; strained credulity to the utmost as our hero, on a journey to deliver a precious church manuscript to the Emperor of Byzantium, gets kidnapped by vikings, becomes their slave &amp; friend, travels w/them via Russia's rivers (the Varangian Way) to Byzantium afterall, etc. Confronted by the immensity of that ancient city, the vikings decide to sign on w/the Emperor rather than undertake a sacking of the town (wise move) , only to be sucked into a &quot;byzantine&quot; plot to precipitate a crisis between the Byzantines &amp; the Arab Caliphate. Our hero &amp; his viking friends get betrayed &amp; enslaved in an Arab silver mine, but the little monk is serendipitously rescued &amp; becomes the favorite &amp; confidante of a noble emir. Losing his faith, our hero @ last finds it again after the disillusionment of his ordeal &amp; the temptations of the flesh which follow. The vikings seem just too good hearted, the Byzantines &amp; their city too unrealized, and the Arabs too noble &amp; too evil by turns. The monks themselves never come to life either. I don't see how this book merited the good reviews shown elsewhere on this page. It is a real laggard among historical novels, so far as I can tell. --- Stuart W. Mirsk"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium tells the story of Aidan, a young Irish monk chosen to undertake a pilgrimage with twelve other monks to Byzantium in order to present the Emperor with a priceless Bible. On the way he is taken slave by Vikings, then eventually taken into the service of the Emperor, and then taken slave by Arabs...Despite the flagrant historical infractions perpetrated by the author, I found the book entertaining. The history was not necessary to understand the book, and the author used a good deal of license to fit the story, which is his right and I think he did this quite well. However the book is painfully slow to start, with endless descriptions of food and frankly very little is done to make you care about the main character. He is a reactionary character until the last third of the book, and despite the description he at no point becomes a warrior. If you have the time and patience for such an undertaking I suggest this book, however it is by no means a quick read and certain parts of it will try your patience. If you are interested in reading a book about faith and how it differs in the Medieval heart of the known world during the 10th century, I would very much suggest this book. It brings together aspects of history and culture which are interesting to view side by side."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium is a page turner.

The era seems to be my interest lately and I've alway like mysteries.

This book is also slow while Lawhead lays the groundwork and has the reader join with an enterprising group of 13 monks from Ireland and Britain that head off for a pilgrimage to Constantinople.Like a roller coaster, once this book finally gets moving (around page 90 or so) the pace never stops and the reader is drawn into a wonderful world and is exposed to four cultures (Irish, Viking, Byzantine, Arab), is taken into slavery, lives the life of luxury, suffers from religious doubt, climbs to the heights of faith, fights corruption, is betrayed and travels the world in a whirlwind fashion.This wonderful story, based on a composite of Irish monks (check out Lawhead's website for more info) from the 9th and 10th centuries, is a joy to read.Bravo.This is my first Lawhead book but it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Life doesn't perfect a person, it unravels a person. The thought that a point of \\"arrival\\" is achieved is a myth. The inner and outer conflict of the human journey doesn't work together to create evolutionary leaps, but a seeming digression, a loss of our humanity, a lessening of our humanity. \\"The outer man perishes\\" is the way St. Paul put it. Life isn't a process made to perfect, but to humble.During the confirmation process of Chief Justice John Roberts one of the arguments I read made against his confirmation wasn't the fact that he had made egregious blunders that would work against him, but, rather he hadn't made any mistakes. He wasn't marred enough. He was too perfect. That is an impossibility.Byzantium is an historical novel about the journeys of an Irish monk from the 9th century named Aidan. Not based on the actual life of one person, it's an amalgamation of the type of adventures pilgrims would endure around this time.The story begins when he is chosen, along with two others from their monastery, to deliver a hand written book to the emperor, Basil I, of the Holy Roman Empire.Before the pilgrim party leaves Aidan has a dream which he interprets to be a vision of his impending death upon reaching Byzantium. This vision drives Aidan's interpretation of events and relationship with God.When Aidan reaches Byzantium (apart from his fellow monks) and leaves Byzantium with his life intact, he assumes God has abandoned him. Through the bulk of the book a slow erosion of Aidan's faith is seen. It's probably the erosion that happens in the lives of many who start out in steps of faith and end up way off course. It's the daily veering (just a degree) imperceptible to the eye, though noticeable in the heart.A sub-story is between Aidan and a Viking raider named Gunnar. The ironic interplay is how similar events have opposite effect upon the two. In God's upside-down kingdom, a pillaging pagan provides Christ's example to the monastic-made man.IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK AND EVER WANT TO READ THIS BOOK SKIP DOWN TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH SO I DON'T RUIN THE STORY.There were so many layers of this story which I enjoyed. The balance between Aidan's own choices and divine intervention. Aidan's and his companion's suffering moved me and put into perspective my troubles. The insight into other people. Personalities from many nationalities are developed: Celtic, Dane, Byzantine, Arab. The common humanity we all share surfaces, though, despite cultural idiosyncrasies.The moral of the story, so to speak, is the redemption God works for the pillaging Vikings and the rededication that takes place in Aidan's life. This comes to a head after Aidan has returned from the pilgrimage and been back at the monastery for a short time and has decided to leave the priesthood. It's at this point that the Vikings return to entreat Aidan to return to their land and teach them of the \\"hanging god,\\" Jesu. This sparks another vision parallel to his first vision of death in Byzantium. As Aidan comes out of his vision-trance, and in Job 38 fashion, he enters into this soliloquy:\\"Everyone dies, Gunnar had said. All flesh is grass, said Cadoc. What did you expect, Aidan?\\"Did you really think that Christ would blunt the spear points, deflect the lash, cause the chains to melt away when they touched your skin? Did you ex- pect to walk in sunlight and not feel the heat, or to go without water and notgrow thirsty? Did you think that all the hatred would turn to brotherly love themoment you strode into view? Did you think both storms and tempers wouldcalm because of the tonsure on your head?\\"Did you believe God would shield you forever from the hurt and pain of this sin-riven world? That you would be spared the injustice and strife others were forced to endure? That disease would no longer afflict you, that youwould live forever untouched by the tribulations of common humanity?\\"I think this way at times. I'm shocked by trouble. I sink into a downward spiral when my feelings don't match my sunshine outlook. How vain, how foolish.Now, the questions end and the admonition begins:\\"Fool! All these things Christ suffered, and more. Aidan, you have been blind. You have beheld the truth, stared long upon it, yet failed to perceive so muchas the smallest glimpse of all that was shown you. Sure, this is the heart of thegreat mystery: that God became man, shouldering the weight of suffering sothat on the final day none could say, \`Who are you to judge the world? What doyou know of injustice? What do you know of torture, sickness, poverty? Howdare you call yourself a righteous God! What do you know of death?'\\"He knows, Aidan, he knows!\\"Gunnar, untutored barbarian that he was, had discerned this central truth,while I, for all my monkish learning, had forever failed to grasp it. In Gunnar,this understanding had kindled hope and faith, even as my lack ofunderstanding had brought me to hopelessness.\\"At this point Aidan renews his priestly vows and in the epilogue we're told in condensed form the ministry of Aidan's later life.This is a wonderful (literally wonder-full) journey of a person who loses them-self, but becomes in the process someone greater for good and for God. It's about destiny, goodness, suffering, and redemption.

Than once it got going, could not put it down. Great insight into Islam.I could relate to the main character.I gave it to a friend to read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium is a story of a man's faith, its failings, and its resurrection. It is set in a real history, which - like any historical fiction - has been molded to the author's needs. The specifics may be flawed (as are we all), but the flavor is exquisite.High excitement: marauding vikings, nomadic arabs, opulent Byzantine cathedrals, byzantine politics, and humble Irish monks on an ecclesiastical quest. Does the hero live or die? Will he regain his faith or not? Will they all make it back to Ireland?I was deeply moved by the depth and feelings portrayed in the hero's struggle with the burdens of a belief in God and the attendant burdens of faith.What is the point of the book? It is the portrait of a man's faith in God, and the reality that even the saints, martyrs, and holy men of the great ages past were human.Complaints about this book seem to revolve primarily arround historical inaccuracies of fact/language - if you want a history book, I suggest you look somewhere other than the &quot;fiction&quot; section of a bookstore."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"At nearly 900 pages, this is a monumental work. Having read earlier Lawhead works (Arthur series, Endless Knot series), and been very impressed, I was still dubious of this work initially. After all, I found Pendragon (book 4 of the Arthur series) to be rather, well, average.Fear Not!From beginning to end, Byzantium is Lawhead's single most consummate book. Aidan, the protagonist, is enthralling. If the book has a weakness, it is the rush with which it ends.Considering the excellence of the proceeding 800 (or so) pages, this is a trite complaint."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Sometimes Lawhead gets a little wordy . . . he adds two or three or four or five more adventures when in fact the storyline needs to move forward. And we could have wished that Aiden's spiritual angst was done with a little more nuance. And having only one major female character (who is also drop-deal gorgeous, or course) suggests another lack, though the tale is such a swashbuckling one, we can forgive that. It is about monks, after all, so we know from the start that women may be in short supply.But if these are flaws, they all can be forgiven with the fine characterization. Aiden and Dugal are so likeable, Caddoch is a truly godly man, and the Danes . . . they steal the show. I love the Danes, with their mix of childlikeness and macho. Long after one has forgotten the finer points of this book, the charm of the Danes' attempted sacking of Byzantium remains.I can highly recommend this book. The plot is delightfully complex, the setting gives one a chance to live in the tenth century for awhile . . . but the Danes are the best. If King Harald had a fan club on Facebook, I'd be a charter member."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I've got a little bit of an author crush on him O_o. I haven't read a bad Lawhead book yet, so it's well deserved. Byzantium is no different. I did have a little bit harder time getting into this book than previous Lawhead books I've read, because it's a bunch of guys mostly, the whole story. I love stories about girls, I love a little romance. Not Harlequin romance, but natural, understated, everyday, romance. This book doesn't have it. What it does have is a good story, amazing characters, history, settings, everything you could want, just not romance.I am always amazed at how simply and profoundly he tells a message, without preaching or seeming to make the story all about the message. I don't read Lawhead for his Christian message, I read it for the story, but he sneaks up on you and before you realize what happened you're almost in tears because of the wonderful message.This book happens to be about a bunch of monks who set off to deliver the book of Kells to the Emperor at Byzantium, so the Christian theme is obviously a bit stronger (if it wasn't it wouldn't be very believable). Of course everything goes horribly wrong and Aedan (our monk) ends up a slave of Vikings, then a spy, and many other things. One of my favorite parts in the book is when Aedan is trying to tell the story of the crucifixion of Christ to the Vikings in a way they would understand.A must read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Wow! Where to start!Given the number of reviews, and the fact that others have already outlined the plot, allow me to tell you what you want to know. This book IS epic in scope. The adventure is constant, and the chapters all end with a cliff-hanger that you keeps you turning the pages late into the night. The best part about this book is that it is actually plausible, yet, amazing in plot scope. The language nuances used by the author to create tone are just ingenious.I believe that people enjoy character adventures because they want to live it themselves. This is that kind of book. It will become a part of you. You will have fought Vikings, dined on sumptuous fare in Byzantine restaurants, visited places that are lost in time, and places that are still standing today, and you will have felt everything happen from the first person point of view.There are many extremely touching scenes in this books; here's one of many:Watch for Aiden's telling the Danes about Jesu and the fisherfolk and their subsequent conversation over ol. Yes, ol. One of the best scenes of the book....and it does pick up from there, believed it or not.If I sound overly excited about this book or as if I have nothing negative to say, that is because it is true. I read about 50 books a year, and this one is in my number 1 spot for 2009 by far.Get it. Live it. Love it."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is by far the best historical fiction book I have ever read. The author created characters who you actually grow to care about as you read, which is something rare in books today. None of the majore characters in the book are black and white. While the Vikings are bloodthirsty marauders motivated by greed and belief that death in battle will grant them access to a warrior's paradise, they also have deep convictions about honor, and once Aidan, the main character gains their respect, they would give their lives to defend him, even though he was their slave not long before. Aidan is a monk, but like all men, he is not perfect. He experiences a crisis of faith and has to search his soul to find out what his life truly means.The book starts rather slow, which made me shelf it for a couple of years, but once I got past the beginning, I couldn't stop reading. This story will take you to all points from Ireland to Asia Minor, and introduce you to all the various peoples who inhabited those regions at the time. You'll see the devoted religious life of an Irish monastery, the raucous environment of a Viking longship and the workings of Viking government (such as there was), Primitive Russia along the Dnieper River, the glory that was the Eastern Roman Empire and Constantinople, and the intrigue and religion of the newly Islamic Middle East. The adventure that the characters embark upon is equal to the Odyssey.Some people have complained that this book is not historically accurate because the Book of Kells didn't exist yet, etc. This is historical fiction, the author is allowed to take some liberties in the interest of entertainment, as long as they're minor, and the liberties taken in this book ARE minor. Overall, this book is an accurate portrayal of the world or Dark Age Europe, and it's highly entertaining as well. You won't find that in many other books. \\"Byzantium,\\" by Stephen R.

A great read, especially for Christians who have found themselves in the same state of mind as Aiden; that God has turned away from them. What a re-affirmation of faith! I found myself saying, no, you're wrong!I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Although the author seems uninterested in our knowing it, this book is the story of Saint Aidan, a ninth century Irish monk who spread Christianity to Scandanavia. The author never says when the story takes place until about two-thirds of the way through the book when he indicates that the Emperor of Byzantium, Basil, died in 879AD.I liked the book immensely. Once you get past the first 100 pages or so, it's a real page turner with the description of the Vikings especially compelling. They are the most memorable characters in the book with their irrespressable enthusiasm, overt love of wealth, and overall ability to take life as it comes and really enjoy themselves"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"A beautifully written book. So powerful in language and structure that it is as if each paragraph becomes a verse in a poem drawing the reader into the emotions and wonder of the book, intertwining him with Aidan's experiences. Lawhead presents to us a journey of a boy to a man, naivety to understanding,despair to hope, doubt to faith, suffering to redemption. In short death to LIFE. His prose is so well crafted, it is reminiscent of Eco's The Name of the Rose, as well as great philosophical writers such as Augustine and Aquinas. Entertaining, instructive, enchanting and real. One of best books I have read( and I read alot). I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I found this wonderful writer through the music I listen to.Jeff Johnson and Brian Dunning have four CD's that are inspired by Lawhead books. There titles are, Byzantium, Patrick, The Enduring Story and Songs from Albion II.

Seeing as the views of these others seem to be so uniform, I felt obliged to return &amp; add my comments one more time so there would @ least be some variety here. By the way, let me just say that I respect the many below who have been moved by the religious message the author has apparently intended to convey through his book &amp; in no way mean to comment negatively on those opinions here. Although I must admit the allegedly spiritual experience our young monk, Aiden, supposedly experiences through his journeys never really hits home for me. There's lots of talk about what he realizes &amp; experiences but you don't &quot;see&quot; or feel it -- which is what a work of fiction is supposed to provide us with, isn't it? The book as a novel regrettably leaves much to be desired. No sense recounting the events of the plot since they are adequately summarized by the other entries elsewhere on this page. Suffice it to say, however, that this tale, while nicely told in places, particularly in its presentation of those almost loveable rogues, the vikings, is largely unsuccessful in its efforts to construct a believable &amp; compelling tale. The vikings are actually too humanized -- you almost gotta love these guys sitting around the campfire barbecuing &amp; drinking beer as they dispute events from the latest battle, plan for the next &amp; struggle w/the metaphysical notions of God &amp; eternity. At the same time, the city of Byzantium, the heart of this tale, is rather flatly realized (barely more than a Potemkin village, unfortunately) and the Arabs are too good &amp; evil by turns. Even the monks are too simple to be believed. In the end, the story, for all its attempts at adventure &amp; &quot;byzantine&quot; intrigue, doesn't resonate unless you are here for the message, in which case who cares how fully realized the character! s are? Or convincing the action? This is a book well-suited for those already predisposed to it. But it's not particularly good for a work out there in the wider world of literature. (For a really compelling tale of Christian men &amp; women in the Middle Ages I'd recommend The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz, recounting the epic struggle between two Christian princes, Harold Godwinson &amp; William the Bastard of Normandy, for the throne of England in 1066. Next to Muntz' work this, and most other historical fiction, pales by comparison.)"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium plunged the reader into a very realistic, adventure-filled Europe. This is for the modern-day novel lover. I couldn't get into even though I love medieval and fantasy stuff (that's why I picked this book up). I am spoiled from the classics. Aidan was an round character, but not profound enough to carry us through 800 pages. The plot drove me crazy; I couldn't help but slug through his detour as a captive of a scandanavian viking. It is a great tour de Europe in the middle ages, but if your looking for profound reading, looke to the classics. Lawhead is a great writer though."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead has been a favorite of mine for awhile, but the sheer size of \\"Byzantium\\" has daunted me ever since I headed off to college seven years ago. Where in the hustle of a student schedule could a person find the time to ingest so much fiction (barring, of course, the literature students)? As it turned out, my fears were groundless. I should have read the book years ago.\\"Byzantium\\" is a stand-alone story with ties to other Lawhead works, from what I understand. It won't leave you hanging. And it covers a period of history that is very intriguing at the moment, given the recent release of Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\" on the silver screen. Still, from what I can tell, Lawhead's work is based on more in-depth research from documents that have not been established as fraudulent by a court of law. That should make it even more intriguing.If you enjoy this book, check out Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle. He's a great but little-known author. And for you library idolaters like me who like to own good looking good books, I'd recommend the hardback version; it will add one more to that shelf full of intriguing volumes that you dote over multiple times daily.ALong"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead is best known for fantasy series, but here has written a historical stand-alone. \\"Byzantium\\" tells the adventures of Aidan Mac Cainnech, a real historical figure of the eighth and ninth centuries, on a fictional pilgrimmage to Constantinople, in the course of which he is captured by Vikings and finds himself drawn into intrigues in the courts of both the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid caliphate.Lawhead has done a good job of recreating four very distinct cultures as backdrops to Aidan's travels: the monasteries of Ireland, the Vikings of Denmark, the subtle, wealthy, and corrupt city of Constantinople, and the sophisticated culture of Islam at the peak of the Baghdad caliphate's power. All are seen through Aidan's eyes in a first person narrative. Some story lines, such as Aidan's romance with an Arab princess and his meeting with the Emperor on his first day in Byzantium, are rather implausible, but most readers will prefer a good story to strict historical accuracy.One interesting thing about this book is that it is ultimately about faith, a relatively unusual topic in speculative fiction. Aidan starts out with the unquestioning faith of a youth, has his belief shattered by the struggles and adventures of his pilgrimmage, and ultimately discovers a more mature faith. I think this is what the book is truly about, although it can be read and enjoyed as a series of colorful and interesting adventures. Actually, the adventure tale is probably more successful than the story of spiritual redemption, leading to a somewhat uneven book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Byzantium has a lot going for it: Good character development, an engaging plot, an interesting historical setting,a lot of characters I really cared about, and a bittersweet ending. One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Like the other reviewers I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This was the first Lawhead book I read and I was very pleasantly surprised by it.The story is incredible with epic scope and marvelous detail. I was especially impressed with how Lawhead takes the protagonist, a humble monk and slave, through a series of incredible adventures and intrigue.I had a few complaints with the story. I found the concept of a small war band of hardened vikings attempting to sack a fortifted city as large as Byzantium a bit absurd. Surely these wily veterans would have realized the impossibility of their task, especially once they saw the extent of the Byzantium fortress and military might. I also thought that Lawhead relied a little too much on coincidences. Characters pop in and out of the story a bit too conveniently. While Aiden's spiritual struggle was important to the story, I found that in describing his feelings the author seemed to reiterate the same idea using similar language. I found this tiresome and skimmed many of those repetative sections.All in all though, it was a fantastic historical novel and a great summer read."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This book is a treasure. I don't think it was originally published in hardback, but it is one of my all-time favorites. I read it when it came out in the 90's. It was time to enjoy it again."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Don't listen to the rather boring old fart below. BYZANTIUM is one of the greatest books of our time, and should be considered among the top of the list of historical fiction and fantasy. Even just Fiction! You won't be disappointed by this fabulous read. Even if he was the Vice-Gerent and not Vice-Regent. Sheesh! Semantics!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Lawhead's narrative has always impressed me. Contrary to what has been written here, at no point did the writing seem jerky; in fact, events flow very smoothly from one to the next, with Lawhead striking precisely the right balance between telegraphed, satisfying events and surprising plot twists. The ending is not too abrupt, for it attacks the reader as suddenly as the light of truth which dawns on Aidan. Very effective. My only concern was that some of the characters were undeveloped, especially the Arab princess; she entered the story too late and was quite unlikeable compared with the familiar and pleasant-natured Vikings. Still, another triumph for SRL."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I have found the reading of this book at the same time gripping, instructive about the past and about the topic of faith. Lawhead uses his storytelling skills to ask deep philosophical questions, about faith, the presence of evil in the world, and the part God has to play in our lives. The devout faith of the Irish monks contrasts with the childlike life of the Norsemen and the legalistic life of the Arabs, as well as with the corruption that accompanies positions of power in the Roman empire. However, I find his judgments quick and his conclusion so below the level of the book that it left a sour note. It looks like he didn't know where he was going with the book, following wonderfully his inspiration and talent, but it went wrong when he realized he had to end the book. I would have preferred an aporetical end to this easy dismissal."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"The historical fiction regular reader will know at once what kind of story this is. Similar to Aztec, The physician, Pillars of the Earth. However, Lawhead's style is slower and lacks a bit of action. Sometimes the plot seems to be crawling endlessly to nowhere, the passages are obvious and the reader just doesn't care about the characters.Aidan is the irish monk who is sent to Byzantium to deliver a gift to the Emperor Basil. There are other reasons for this trip, but since the story is given on first-person basis, what Aidan doesn't know the reader won't know either. Aidan is a character whose propension to doing good is so huge that sometimes it's irritating. Lawhead tried to add some depth to his character, making him loose his faith in God, but this part of Aidan's story was very poorly developed. Even some love scenes are thrown in in the middle of the book (between an irish monk and an arab female!), but they are tedious, even embarassing.Byzantium is, to conclude, an interesting book that must not be taken too seriously. And don't be scared by the size of the book, it is a very fast reading."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Okay, I've read Stephen Lawhead's books before. I've liked them, even. That's why I got Byzantium. While reading it, I thought it was pretty good, if somewhat slow. As I neared the ending, I was wondering, &quot;How is he going to finish this up? There's not enough room!&quot; I was right. The book wasn't too bad, but it seems Lawhead realized his deadline was the next day and just threw something down to finish it at eleven that night."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This book was readable but fairly unintelligent. Many others have already discussed the abounding historical inaccuracies so I will just skip that information. It was a lot like a poorly written fantasy book. There were cool warrior barbarians, sophisticated Eastern peoples, and dilluted, greedy, all-powerful bad guys. The uber-pansy, ultra smart, yet naive main character somehow survives countless hazardous situations and traverses most of the known world at the time starting as a simple monk in Ireland. There is even a contrived love story with an exotic woman. It was amazing how everyone somehow allowed the main character to live. The plot was unbelievable and there was really no character development. The changes in the main character were sudden and inexplicable. Aidan, the monk, also did not behave or think like a 10th century monk. Many of the characters did not seem to fit their roles and the religions used to advance the plot were misinforming. It was slightly interesting and not a bore to read, hence the two stars."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This review won't be any help...Byzantium is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite reads, but the problem is, I can't exactly put my finger on why.I guess this book had it all: a superb sense of adventure, discovery, awe, dread, great characters that were real enough that I felt I personally knew them, a prose easy that is to read yet absorbing and gripping...800+ pages went by in flash leaving a desire for more.Well done Lawhead, well done."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"i had to read this as a class project and was just blown away. i hadn't read a book for a long long time, and never read a novel, but this epic tale, really inspired me. it showes the resilience of human spirit put into very trying situations."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Vividly written but with very flat characters and a story that is highly predictable, somewhat unfocused and rarely compelling, this adventure hovers in the average range throughout its long narrative unravelling. It is the tale of a young Irish monk, Aidan, who is tapped, much to his own surprise, to deliver a precious manuscript from his monastic retreat in medieval Ireland to the Emperor of Byzantium as part of a mysterious embassy whose full purpose he is not completely apprised of. Kidnapped en route by marauding vikings, he does a stint in Scandinavian slavery where he befriends, and is befriended by, his viking captors who eventually drag him down with them to Byzantium (his original destination!) in an abortive raid on a city they are not really prepared to deal with. Falling in with the Byzantine bureaucracy, Aidan and his newfound Norse friends are tapped for a further mission to the Middle East where Islam holds sway and there our young monk is sorely tested and must experience degradations of slavery which make his Scandinavian sojourn a veritable Roman holiday. Unfortunately, the allegedly spiritual experience of our young monk never really hit home for me. There's lots of talk about what he realizes and experiences through his harsh servitude, and afterwards in his encounters with Muslim and Byzantine betrayals, but I never \\"saw\\" or felt any of this in the unfolding tale. And that, really, is what a work of fiction is supposed to provide us with, isn't it? The book, as a novel, regrettably leaves much to be desired. No sense recounting much more of the plot here since the events have been adequately summarized by others. Suffice it to say, however, that this tale, while nicely told in places, particularly in its presentation of those almost loveable rogues, the vikings, is largely unsuccessful in its efforts to construct a believable and compelling tale. The vikings come across as too humanized . . . you gotta love these guys while they're sitting around the campfire barbecuing and drinking beer as they dispute events from the latest battle, plan for the next and struggle with the metaphysical notions of God and eternity! Of course vikings were like that though somehow we never realized it from the literature of the period, right? At the same time, the city of Byzantium, the real heart of this tale, is rather flimsily realized (barely more than a Potemkin village, unfortunately) while the Arabs are too good and evil by turns. Even the monks are too simple to be believed. In the end, the story, for all its attempts at adventure and \\"byzantine\\" intrigue, didn't resonate for me. Three stars because the prose is clear and fresh but the rest of the \\"telling\\" just drags the book down. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I've read 5 of Mr. Lawhead's books...really enjoyed the Pendragon cycle with an actual Christian/Celtic take on the Arthurian story.This book, while very engaging at times, really goes downhill during the last third of the book. From an editorial viewpoint, the story has too many plot lines spread throughout 600 pages that become problematic to draw together into any kind of satisfactory end.The return to Byzantium to bring Nikos' treachery to light is wholly unsatisfactory and surreal...almost like an excuse to get the protagonist (Aidan) to commit murder and make him a man who has truly experienced (and done) everything that period in history had to offer. The buildup to romance and the cheesy \\"breakup\\" of Kazimain and Aidan were simply terrible against some of the brilliant work of this novel.Then, at the end, the work of the entire novel (causing Aidan to question his faith) is reversed in a couple of pages. Sorry - but this is a very disappointing plot completion tactic complete with a \\"wrap-up\\" of historical \\"truth\\" given in the amalgamatic fiction presented as the epilogue.The historical research and work done to correctly render names and places is what warrants a rating of 3 stars here - the story, unfortunately, falls apart in the last 200 pages of the book."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Byzantium&quot;. It was so good, I could barely stand to put it down. It's refreshingly accurate in its history, although the characters are fictional. There was a real St. Aidan of Eire, but as far as I know, he never left the British Isles.I found this book both humorous and serious at once! Lawhead is a clever master of dialogue and description. The passages in which the Danes encounter Byzantium and intend to plunder it had me laughing out loud, while at the same time, I knew they were being serious ...This is a very well written book (a few misplaced commas, but those can be forgiven), and I recommend it highly! It definitely got me thinking about my own faith."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This book was excellent.

And then loving them all the same. My heart breaking along with the monks with their precious gift gone. I felt as though I suffered with all of them when they were imprisioned. I felt as though I had grown to know and love them all. And what an ending! You'll just have to read to find out. And believe me it is well worth your time.

I have to read many technical books constantly for my job so I enjoy some fiction from time to time. I particularly enjoy historical fiction. This book is one of the best I have read about Medieval times. It was a book that one could become totally engrosed in. I also was impressed how this writer can write some very tense scenes and not have to use objectional language. I have recommended this book and lent my copy to many friends and they have all thanked me. Read this book and you will be glad you did. I have since read 7 other Lawhead books and even though this is the best one so far I have enjoyed all the others."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is the best novel I have ever read.This epic takes you from Ireland to the sands of Bagdad, and many places in between. It takes the main character from monastery to slavery, and then from Emperor's spy back to slavery again, from being a prince of Arabia to at last returning to monastery. It is much like Ben-Hur in that it changes venue many times.What I liked best was the message of faith at the end of the story. The way the author makes the characters come alive and seem so real is amazing. You become emotionally involved with characters, to the point that you feel their pain."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This was the first Stephen lawhead book I ever read.

It is overall a joyful read, without resorting to the usual themes of sex such as authors like Terry Goodkind."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"War and Peace, Ben-Hur, Spartacus, BYZANTIUM.These four belong together.

That doesn't matter, if you read this book, you will have found the publishing industries best kept seceret!"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"First of all I must say that I really, really liked this book until about page 560. Then everything just sort of went downhill from there. The ending simply wasn't very satisfying. I also really hated the way that Lawhead would write about someone or something that sounds very important and then just forget about them/it.For example: the dream that Aidan has about the amir cutting his(aidan's) tongue out. What was the meaning of writing about that? I kept expecting the amir to betray Adian and start cutting, but he never does.But all of that aside, the story is very exciting and has a good mix of action, romance, intrigue, fantasy, and moral messages. And unlike some of Lawhead's other novels (namely Taliesin), this is fast paced and hard to put down.So I must conclude that although it has it's flaws, Byzantium is an example of truly great epic storytelling."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"IM on my fourth copy. 1 worn out. 2 borrowed, never to be returned. Cant say I blame them though. Smart, perfectly paced and you dont want to put it down."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Aside from Michael Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels,\\" this is the finest piece of historical fiction I have ever read. Stephen Lawhead takes you into the world of the 9th Century. His research into this period is obvious, as he shows the reader what life was like in such diverse places as an Irish monastery, Viking-controlled Scandinavia, primitive Kiev, the halls of power in the might city of Constantinople, and even the early Muslim world.Even more than that, Lawhead tells a very riveting tale of a naive young monk who sees far more of the world than his contemporaries did. Chosen to go as part of a select mission to Constantinople, Aidan learns that things are not always as they seem: while the Byzantine Empire had all of the trappings of Christianity, its leaders were variously at each other's throats. When Aidan realizes this is how things really are, he is devastated, and experiences a loss of innocence that for a time turns into bitterness (will he recover? I won't answer, as I do not wish to spoil the ending).Lawhead does a wonderful job in bringing these complex emotions out, and in showing how Aidan has to quickly grow up if he is to survive in such a hostile world.For these reasons, \\"Byzantium\\" is a wonderful book. Its conclusion is satisfying, which is not an easy thing to do given that it is 900 pages in length. In short, anyone who can write a book this long and leave his/her readers wanting more has written a very good book. Such is the case with \\"Byzantium,\\" and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"Though Lawhead's usual slow start is still a challenge, it isn't as difficult to start this book as some of his older works. Aidan is a very well developed character that you will root for, get frustrated with, and ultimately be grateful for. Lawhead weaves a story that is a classic journey, filled with lots of detours on the road to true faith. However, readers who are skeptical of a Christian auhtor will be pleasantly surprised. None of this book is a cheap sermon. The cloistered world of the monestary runs head long into the corruption that comes with power and wealth. Corruption and heriosm runs across the worlds of Christendom and the Califates. Perhaps the most charming parts of the novel are Aidan's interactions with very believable Islamic characters. If you enjoyed any of Lawhead's works, this will be no different. If you liked some of his earlier works, but were frustrated by slow developing plots and an abrupt ending, this will be an improvement plus all of the middle of the plot strengths and historical aspects he brings to his work."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"fantastic book i was unable to put it down even for a day one of the best book i've ever read thrilling adventure"},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This is the story of St Aidan, written with Lawhead's usual talent for evoking a real feeling for the age and a love for the characters. Aidan and a group of other monks travel from Ireland to Byzantium to hand deliver an exquisitely illuminated manuscript to the emperor - the famous book of Kells. But disaster overtakes them and Aidan is captured by vikings and taken into slavery.Lawhead describes the various people's well. He does not romanticise the vikings, for instance, but paints them with all their barbarity as seen through the eyes of the Irish monk. And yet as the book progresses, these characters become some of the most wonderful that Lawhead has written, and you feel regret to wave them good bye at the end of this story.Lawhead's research into his novels is extensive, but usually there are areas where experts on the subject would tell us that things were not quite the way they are set out. This is a fictional work, and sometimes the facts of history are massaged a little to make a better tale. But even with this in mind, this story is a wonderful historical narrative too, and most readers must surely come away with a better feel for the period than they had before they started.All in all I think this is perhaps one of the author's best works, and thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"I bought this book after reading a library copy.

I somewhat reluctantly picked up his \\"Song of Albion\\" series (probably because I was tired of weaving through the summertime crush of people). Well, what a great read! Oh, to be in Scotland!I was expecting more or less of the same with \\"Byzantium\\" and debated passing Lawhead by for awhile. However, \\"Byzantium\\" slowly hooked me and then intrigued me as it became clear this intelligent story was certainly about heroes, warriors and cowards--but the heart of the book is something much more and extraordinarily authentic--an agonizing, gut wrenching journey of faith.It seems to me Mr. Lawhead's very name implies what people yearn for--to speak truthfully from the head and the heart. Well done."},{"Title":"Byzantium: Library Edition","review":"This book narrates completely fictitious events that took place in AD 886 and AD 887, the last year of the reign of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian and the first year of the reign of Emperor Leo VI the Wise. The only real historical personages in this book are the two Emperors. Everyone else is just fiction, including the main hero, one Aeddan Mac Cainnech, an Irish monk of the Cele De (an Irish Christian Brotherhood).Harald Bull-Roar, one of the main characters in the book, King of the Danes, is a fictitious character too. At that time, the King of the Danes was in fact Godfrid (not Godfrid Haraldsson) a vassal of the Frankish King Charles the Fat.Some reviewer mentioned the fact that a Danish King serving as mercenary for the Emperor made them suspect the book is actually fiction, but actually there have been no less than two (2) Norwegian Kings who served in the Byzantine Varangian Guard, namely Harald III \\"Hardrda\\" Sigurdsson and Sigurd I \\"Jorsalfare\\" Magnusson. The latter brought to the Varangian Guard, no less than 6,000 (six thousand) Norwegians and Danes. Harald Bull-Roar in the book was probably named after King Harald Hardrda.Also, there are many sagas about Scandinavians serving in the Varangian Guard, most notably the Laxdoela Saga, Njals Saga, and of course the famous Heimskringla that narrates the life of King Harald Hardrda.There are some more historical inaccuracies in this book, one of them being that the word \\"viking\\" is used to denote \\"plundering\\" and \\"raiding\\" and \\"piracy\\" while in fact in Skandinavisk it just means \\"fjord\\" and \\"viking\\" just means \\"fjordman\\".What follows is a short account of the (completely fictitious) novel:Aeddan Mac Cainnech, an Irish Monk, undertakes a pilgrimage to Constantinople but is seized en route and made slave by Danish Sea Raiders. He lives with the Danes for a short time and then is ordered to accompany Harald Bull Roar, the Danish King, as an interpreter in a raid to plunder Constantinople. When in Constantinople, they finally enter the service of Emperor Basil I, and uncover a secret plot against the life of the Emperor, which will cause many reverses in the life of Aeddan and will even bring him at the court of a Saracen Emir and a Saracen Caliph.I wholeheartedly recommend this book. It will make an enjoyable read, but just please be aware that almost everything that you will read in it is just fiction."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"The Sunlight Dialogues_ is truly John Gardner's magnum opus, equaling and perhaps overshadowing _Grendel_, the book for which he is best known.Grossly over-simplified, it is about the tide of discontent and change that came about in the 1960s, exemplified in the stories of a handful of people who live in the small New York town of Batavia. All of these characters' stories occur at roughly the same moment, and to a certain degree overlap each other; they all come into contact with one another at some point during the novel, and may even influence each other, but every member of the book's huge cast has his or her own story and denouement.The primary one of these stories is the one that concerns Police Chief Fred Clumly and a haggard, maniacal drifter known as &quot;the Sunlight Man&quot;, and the happenings of this particular storyline are the catalysts for the rest of the stories. &quot;The Sunlight Man&quot;, whom we later find out is Taggert Hodge, the black sheep of the wealthy and powerful family the members of whom comprise roughly half the other characters in the novel, is the one who sets all of these denouements into motion with his seminal return to his hometown as a magician, hippie, murderer, and poet. His has been a life of disillusionment, loss, betrayal and unattainable wants, and he returns to Batavia to set into motion a sort of romantically juvenile plot to take revenge on the world and to mewl out his disappointment with the way things are, the latter of which he does through Fred Clumly(thus is the origin of the title.)Gardner is remarkably adept at character development; Taggert Hodge, Walter Benson and Fred Clumly are among the best painted characters of fiction I know of. The author has a gift for articulating neuroses and flaws of characters, from miniscule ticks in their everyday behavior to major personality faults. And with a cast of roughly eleven major characters, making each and every one entirely unique in their drives and hamartias is no task to be scoffed at. However, the ability of John Gardner's I perhaps envy the most is that of taking a very normal, even pretty environmental setting, and turning it nightmarish and haunting. In the novel, the dense forests and century-old barns of Batavia are made into artifacts and ruins of an almost Lovecraftian caliber of queerness, and yet it does not serve to displace the small New York town from the realm of believable reality, but rather forces you to evaluate your reality on the same dark and weird basis as his authorial voice.The sheer scope of the novel (that of several stories cycloning around a unifying theme and plot catalyst) at times threatens to tear it apart, however; the reader at times is left wondering why the author has switched point of views when the scenario he was describing previously had yet to be resolved. This is a mere annoyance, however, and is not really something for which I believe the novel should be faulted, for the rewards of its pages are vast ones.Due perhaps to its relatively young age, it has yet to receive the proper \\"classic\\" status it so rightly deserves, and, sadly, it may never, for \\"Grendel\\" seems to be John Gardner's only remembered and widely read work, and is perpetually overshadowing the rest of the author's material, most of which are just as powerful and memorable as tale of Beowulf's tragic nemesis. In fact, some may even be better, as I propose The Sunlight Dialogues is, but until the higher-ups at Norton and the like get around to looking at this master of fiction as a master should, I advise any and all of the people reading this to purchase this book from whatever obscure publisher it has currently been tossed to."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"John Gardner wrote many good works, the Sunlight Dialogues being by far the best. In it he captures the range of hope and anxiety that made the 1960s such a thrilling and tormenting time to be alive. Using the small town of Batavia, New York, Gardner plunges the reader into the life of a prodigal son of the most prestigious family in town and that of the dedicated police chief. And do the intellectural sparks fly! The illustrations by John Napper are reminescent of those from the Yellow Book in the 1890s, by Aubrey Beardsley. There is a lot of subtle humor (&quot;take a gun of, say, x caliber...&quot;) as well as dead-on observation of what makes people do outrageous things for perfectly logical reasons.It's a roller coaster of a novel, so hang on and enjoy the ride. You might even want to go back for a second trip. I did."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"Back in the 70s, I became fascinated with John Gardner, starting with The Wreckage of Agathon and Grendel. When The Sunlight Dialogues came out, I was hooked. I picked up a paperback copy and just fell into the story. After that, each new Gardner was purchased in hardcover, which I could ill afford back then.About 10 years ago, I tracked down a fine condition copy of TSG and re-read it. Bad move, though, donating the paperback to the library.I welcomed the arrival of a new trade paperback edition of the novel, and of one or two others by Gardner until I actually had the opportunity to hold them. The reprints were done without the original illustrations, which are integral to the books. Unbelievable!For old times sake, I bought a used Ballantine paperback copy and am re-reading it.

The invisible assumptions commonly held about the nature of law, society, and morality are brought into the light of day and ruthlessly exmained. Anyone with a philosphical bent should be interetsed in the debate, and Gardner's style renders the confilct very readbable. Eventually, the sunlight man is shown to be the product of too much love for mankind and an uncompromising adherence to ideals in an imperfect world. The ending can only be described as tragic, so make sure youre plenty ready for a moody conclusion if you pick this book up...it is engaging enough that the huindreds of pages will take only a little while to plow through, and you WILL become sympathetic to the main characters of the book.

The invisible assumptions commonly held about the nature of law, society, and morality are brought into the light of day and ruthlessly exmained. Anyone with a philosphical bent should be interetsed in the debate, and Gardner's style renders the confilct very readbable. Eventually, the sunlight man is shown to be the product of too much love for mankind and an uncompromising adherence to ideals in an imperfect world. The ending can only be described as tragic, so make sure youre plenty ready for a moody conclusion if you pick this book up...it is engaging enough that the huindreds of pages will take only a little while to plow through, and you WILL become sympathetic to the main characters of the book. One of Gardner's best works, on the same level as _Grendel_."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"Only book of Gardner I liked. No reason to be sad: few writers can reach this height of imaginative writing, even Gardnerhimself."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"I'm astounded, reading this book again after 40 years, at how contemporary it seems.

The chapter begins mid-sentence. To my knowledge, Gardener never engaged in such prose trickery more suited to James \\"riverrun\\" Joyce.

His philosophical insights into human motivation had me hooked. It was after this novel, I picked up Grendel. Wasn't sure what he was about, at first, but then after reading an essay on Grendel by Segedy, I got the point. Too bad Gardner isn't more popular, and what a shame he had an untimely death."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"John Gardner writes very capably, yet cold. The best part are the dialogues between a &quot;Law and Order&quot; police chief who is fascinated with this anarchic madman. The book turns too literary for me at points (opposite of happy endings, bad things always happening) Lots of intriguing ideas. Gardner captures Batavia, NY (small town in Western New York farm countr.)"},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"I have wrestled with John Gardner as a writer since I was an undergraduate. I started just about all his books and failed to finish every one, with the exception of Grendel, still probably his most fully realized work. I decided, recently, to give Gardner another whirl, with The Sunlight Dialogues.Gardner is indeed a wonderful writer. His sentences can be terrific, and he has a fine eye for detail, which may be part of the difficulty I have with him. He keeps going overboard with description. He's good at it, yes. But now and then he might have let up. TSD is too long. It needs to be shorter, and some of the peripheral characters should have turned up missing.Ultimately, the book is baggy. It means to be profound, a comment on the human condition, yet for reasons not entirely clear to me, it rarely, if ever, rises to the occasion. If Gardner is aiming to be another Melville, Faulkner, or Hawthorne he fails, and by a considerable margin. TSD won't stway with me. It really isn't that substantial a novel, alas."},{"Title":"Sunlight Dialogues","review":"I recently met a recent graduate of the State University of New York: Binghamton, an English major.

Not only could I not finish it, I couldn't really start it. Overall the book group didn't like it either."},{"Title":"Yes to Peace: Sermons on the Shalom of God","review":"I am grateful to Dr. Colglazier for gathering this collection of sermons.I also am troubled that a previous reviewer portrayed Dr. Colglazier by quoting only a small portion of one of his columns. In order to set the record straight, here is the entire column:I have nothing to say. Nothing to say about Jesus, or the church, the virgin birth, Mary and Joseph, Bethlehem or Jerusalem. Nothing to say about Matthew and Luke, about angels or magi, or the lowly stable. Nothing to say about Christmas or Christianity, world peace, global hunger, or the war in Iraq. Nothing to say about the pandemic of AIDS, the presidential election, or who is going to win what bowl game on New Year's Day. Nothing.I'm sitting in my office surrounded by thousands of books. (I now have a library of nearly 3,000 volumes.) I estimate that in one way or another, half of them are about Jesus of Nazareth, the Jesus whose birth is remembered and celebrated this coming week. Even if you're not a Christian, Christmas has a way of becoming part of a cultural celebration. (As one friend said to me not long ago, \\"We don't really believe much of it, but we sure like the gifts once a year!\\") Nevertheless, in spite of all the books, words, sentences and pompous ideas, it seems like none of them are adequate for explaining Christmas.Maybe having nothing to say is a good thing.When I contemplate the first Christmas, I tend to think of it as an event where very little was said. Can you begin to imagine that night, that silent night of Jesus' birth? Mary and Joseph are traveling, and he is quiet, worrying about where they will spend the night. As for Mary, her ankles are swollen, her belly heavy with child, and, truth be told, she doesn't feel like talking to anyone. The birth happens in a barn -- dark, quiet and cavernous. A cow bellows every once in a while, and occasionally, a horse offers a wet, mucousy snort. But, for the most part, it is a night of silence.I see Mary's eyes becoming large and dark, like the eyes of a pony. They are dilated with adrenaline, and she is breathing hard, eventually panting and pushing. Then there is that brief sound of suction, of life coming out of the hollow of her body, and yes, a baby squirming into the world. A tender slap is administered to his skin and Jesus (at this moment a baby like any other baby) sucks down the sweetness of oxygen. He is wrapped in cotton cloths and gently placed upon the chest of his mother. She breathes. The baby breathes. And then more silence.Perhaps this is the truth of Christmas: It is only when we have nothing to say that we discover what we need to hear. Christmas is not so much explained as it is waited upon; it is a mystery gently revealed.When our losses are beyond words, we finally begin to feel the hand of a neighbor upon our shoulder. When our disappointments are unspeakable, we hear the deepest voices of love. When our failures are inexcusable, perhaps then and only then do we hear the true voices of acceptance. And when we're so homesick that no words can begin to capture it, a letter arrives and we read it as if each word were a puff of fresh air.Some of us want words and explanation all the time. But spiritual transformation happens only when we are willing (and sometimes forced) to pause and listen to the deepest voice of all, the voice of God within each of us. Christmas offers a gift to the world. It's the opportunity for us to listen again to the divine vibrato pulsing through the universe. It's a voice that says, \\"You are loved and have a place in the world.\\" It's a voice that says, \\"I still have a purpose for you, regardless of how long your winter has become.\\" And it's a voice that says, \\"No matter what happens, I will never leave you.\\"Often, at least in my experience, such a voice is heard only when we finally have nothing to say, suggesting, of course, that we don't grasp Christmas, it grasps us -- and it happens when we are willing to risk a little silence. Or in the words of T.S. Eliot, it happens when we are willing to \\"wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought; so the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.\\"That's it. Christmas is the stillness that speaks; it is the emptiness that is always full."},{"Title":"Gentleness","review":"\\"Gentleness\\" is part of the \\"Fruit of the Spirit series\\" which I've studied in Bible Study.

His phone number (as well as his email address) is provided in the book. When I called him, he was only too willing to talk about my project on the phone.

It compels the reader to examine his or her own reasons for conforming to religious Dogma."},{"Title":"Myth and Christianity;: An inquiry into the possibility of religion without myth,","review":"Modernity was a troubling thing for those who had to live through it. Pure, objective, unassailable science was quickly supplanting religious ideas, and paring those ideas down to what they were - mere myths perpetrated on us by those who wanted to exert social and cultural control. Or at least this was the conclusion reached by many who, with the advent of a new way of approaching universal truth, now wanted nothing to do with that old-time religion. But not everyone felt the same way. This very short book introduces the thought of Rudolph Bultmann, one of the leading German theologians of the early twentieth century and proponent of \\"demythologization,\\" and Karl Jaspers, the well-known German existentialist and philosopher. First, there is a very capable introduction by R. Joseph Hoffmann, followed by an opening statement by Jaspers, a reply by Bultmann, and then a closing reply by Jaspers. Jaspers and Bultmann both being dyed-in-the-wool Heideggerians, it is interesting to read about their intellectual justifications regarding the respective virtues and weaknesses of hermeneutics as applied to religious myth.As I mentioned earlier, toward the latter part of Bultmann's career, he started to talk about something called demythologization, in which he attempts to divest religious meaning and intent from the original myths in which they are couched. For Bultmann, the Ascension and the Virgin Birth (just to name two highly representative religious myths) mean something, but the fact that the religious content is ensconced in the language of the miraculous is a serious stumbling block for the modern man whose mind has come to see the miracle as ridiculous and impossible. Therefore, these myths need to be reconfigured - divested - of their Biblical form and given a structure which is makes getting at their meaning and significance possible for someone living in the twentieth century.Jaspers, however, sees the element of myth as indispensable from the content of religious belief itself. Jaspers claims that \\"reading\\" these myths without their mythical structures is impossible. He rejects the idea that any religion can be understood apart from its mythical origins. The topology of the origins themselves, he argues, is essential to our understanding. Religious myths are not there to provide us with a decoding project; their cutting away cannot happen without the simultaneous disappearance of any possibility of a religious message. Myth is, for Jaspers, das Umgreifende (the Great Encompassing) by and through which we can escape the worn dualities of subjectivity and objectivity, and achieve a sort of transcendence.Jaspers saw Bultmann's project of demythologization as a sanitizing one, one that failed to understand myth as an essential vehicle for apprehending and describing the transcendent. Jaspers comes close to the one that Northrop Frye constructs in \\"The Great Code: The Bible and Literature,\\" in which he suggests that modern attempts to read the Bible are often foiled because we no longer read and write in the mythical; rather, he thinks, following Vico's tripartite theory of language, that our system of writing has since taken on empirical, positivistic concerns. While Frye thinks that one cannot read the Bible without myth since it is written in myth, Jaspers respects the mythic, and asserts that the religious person must come to terms with it. Jaspers accuses Bultmann of a scientism which sees itself as being responsible for not be accused of foolish mythologies.I would like to include a word about the construction and editing of the book itself. It has a wonderful introduction by R. Joseph Hoffmann which provides one of the greatest contexts and explanations of the rise of liberal theology in the nineteenth century. However, Jaspers' first parry in the conversation includes a lot of material from his Existenzphilosophie which is completely unnecessarily for the overall understanding of the text and the content of the argument at hand. This part of the text includes explanation the reader could have done without, like \\"We cannot think unless something becomes an object for us. To be conscious means to live in that clarity which is made possible by the split between I and the object. But it also means to live within the walls constituted by the split between the I and something known to be an object.\\" And so on. If this language had been excised, the book would have made its argument in tighter, more cogent terms. Also, of the 88 pages devoted to the back-and-forth of Bultmann and Jaspers, Bultmann is allotted a grand total of 12 pages, which makes me think the editor may have had a slight bias. In any case, the substance of the debate is fascinating, but these weak points to detract from the overall rating. I would recommend a close examination of these ideas for anyone interested in the shapes and trends of liberal theology in the twentieth century, but one can probably find another publication whose editor is less clumsy in communicating them."},{"Title":"Myth and Christianity;: An inquiry into the possibility of religion without myth,","review":"Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was a German theologian and professor of New Testament at the University of Marburg. He was the author of many influential books, such asThe History of the Synoptic Tradition,Jesus and the Word, etc. Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) was a German psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher, who wrote many important books such asPhilosophy of Existence (Works in Continental Philosophy),Way to Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy, Second Edition (Yale Nota Bene), etc.The translator notes, \\"The essay 'Myth and Religion' by Dr. Jaspers ... was later published (in 1953)... Bultmann's reply first appeared (in 1954)... Dr. Jaspers' rejoinder was first published in an open letter...\\"Jaspers argues, \\"It we forget that myth is also a code language, a cipher, it loses all reference to transcendence, it becomes mere tangible presence.\\" (Pg. 14) He suggests that Bultmann \\"alternates between empirical, philological exegesis and a theological appropriation of religion. The two opposing goals, which are the historical investigation of religion and the primary comprehension of faith, do not add up to a convincing statement, but rather collapse for lack of tension and clarity.\\" (Pg. 28)Bultmann replied, \\"(Jaspers) is as convinced as I am that a corpse cannot come back to life or rise from the grave, that there are no demons and no magic causality. But how am I, in my capacity as pastor, to explain, in my sermons and classes, texts dealing with the Resurrection of Jesus in the flesh, with demons, or with magic causality? And how am I, in my capacity as theological scholar, to guide the pastor in his task by my interpretation?... When (Jaspers) says that the redemptive history... must 'be tested existentially and judged on the basis of ... the truth that arises from it in the reality of life,' I can only reply to such a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\" (Pg. 60-61)Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\"you do not go far enough... I assay the differences between us in terms of the opposition between liberalism and orthodoxy, and I conclude that your position can be defined as orthodox. The actual meaning of my lecture, however, was to asert the rights of philosophy.\\" (Pg. 72) He concludes, \\"The greatness of Protestantism... achieves reality only in exceptional individuals... who translate into action the great moral earnestness... inherent in this faith... I see hope in the liberal faith... which as such is capable of transforming the Biblical faith in all its manifestations.\\" (Pg. 114-115)Although one suspects that the two protagonists are often missing the other's point, this still a fascinating interplay between these two thinkers."},{"Title":"Ceramic Art of the Malibu Potteries, 1962-1932","review":"This book is a must have reference for all potters, interior designers, tile makers and setters, graphic artists and color lovers.

It is filled with truths from the Bible and quotes from myriad sources. Consider, for example, this quote from George Mueller, &quot;Be assured, if you walk with Him and expect help from Him, He will never fail you.&quot; A similar quote from C. G. Trumbull, who wrote of Dr. John Douglas Adam that, &quot;I learned from him that what he counted his greatest spiritual asset was his unvarying consciousness of the actual presence of Jesus.&quot;She writes much about character development and overcoming obstacles. Perserverance is a theme of this book. She reminds us &quot;Power is developed by resistance.&quot; A quote from Ruskin tells us, &quot;Not without design does God write the music of our live.&quot;This review has not done justice to this book.

Table of Contents: from the Kindle Menu button, it appears there is no Table of Contents included, but that's only partially true. If you press \\"Go to Beginning\\", it will take you to the cover shot, and then after a few \\"next page\\" clicks you'll reach a page with month-by-month listings; click on any of these to go to the first day of that month.2. At first, I thought I'd have to scroll through the month, page-by-page, to get to whatever day I wanted to read, but no...once you've opened to any particular month or date page, from the Menu button select \\"Search This Book\\", and just type in the month and date (e.g., \\"may 13\\" - no quotes; all lower case is fine); then toggle right, and click \\"find\\". That takes you to a new page, where all you do is push down the toggle button, which takes you to another new page; now just hit your Next Page button, and there you are, at the start of the date you wanted.I know that sounds like a lot of work, but once you get the hang of it, it only takes about 20 seconds to do it; and besides, if you're not missing too many days between readings, the Kindle's ability to store your last-visited page will probably make it unnecessary anyway!By the way, I tried \\"Go to Location\\", but it wouldn't let me type in anything except \\"numbers\\", which would take you to a \\"location\\", but those numbers aren't understandable to me...so I'd use the \\"Search This Book\\" option.3. Cool feature report: you know how each day starts with a bible quote? Well, if you turn on your Wireless connection (from the Menu button), you can click on the partial verse at the top, and it will link you to the complete verse, which is shown in the KJV only; it indicates you could also choose to read it in the NKJV, NASB, and NLT, but those links don't seem to work.Just remember to turn off your Wireless when your done, so you don't drain your battery unnecessarily.In closing, let me urge anyone not familiar with this very helpful book to purchase it without hesitation - and with its availability (in this great edition!) on Kindle, those of us who know its worth now have even less excuse for not letting it's marvelous wisdom enrich our lives.

Watching a graduate student proceed in this way, I felt validated in my own process of learning by exploring and stumbling around.The author of this book, Bruce Newman, has certainly achieved a higher level of experience and understanding in the Dharma. For thirty years, he has been living the life that most other Dharma students have only day-dreamed about: living as a nearly full-time yogi, with continual guidance from his teachers, both in and out of retreats, in the East and in the West. As a result of his efforts, he has been given authorization, encouragement and continuing support by two highly regarded teachers in the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages to introduce Western students into the Vajrayana and to train them in its meditation.After teaching other Western students for a decade, and reflecting on his own process of coming to terms with and progressing in the Vajrayana, he has now written a guide to Tibetan Buddhism that explores the issues that arise for Westerners encountering this rather complex system. He is able to explain, in a very down-to-earth way, some of the central issues that we confront: how to deal with the lama most straightforwardly, how to relate to the ritualistic aspects, sexuality (what is \\"tantric\\" and what is not?), dealing with other students, fitting practice into your life, and so on. He discusses the detailed relationships among the different types of Vajrayana techniques, why they are done in a certain order, and what they are designed to do; and also some of the difficulties that are likely to arise while doing them.One of the most important points he makes is that Westerners often have a difficult time with their relationship with the guru: They tend to believe that the lama is somehow aware of all of their issues and confusions, without their being discussed. This attitude leads to a lack of communication on meditational experiences that makes it difficult for the lama to point out the nature of the mind to the student in a definitive way.He also explores the conceptual difficulties that arise for Westerners: Some of these come from cultural differences with Tibetans, but some are intrinsic to Buddhist thought. Westerners often come to the Dharma with the general idea that Buddhism is a form of super-logic, a kind of science with added spiritual insight; there is then the tendency to disregard aspects that don't fit into this picture. The author explains in specific detail how this conceptual view can limit one's understanding of how the Vajrayana actually works, and therefore one's experience.The author mentions in general terms, but does not go into detail about, his own experiential phenomena during his career in meditation: This is probably in good taste, as practitioners' phenomena are individual and shouldn't be imitated; but it also means that this book will never serve as the basis for a movie script. He is honest about acknowledging in many cases his own lack of attainment of the lofty goals of the Dharma. (Of course, in the Mahayana tradition, of which Vajrayana is a part, there is, notoriously, no \\"attainment\\": It is really the quality of one's \\"non-attainment\\" that counts.)One nit that I would pick: There is a useful discussion near the end of the book concerning the difference between the Western concepts of ego and the ego that Buddhists are always trying to get rid of. They're not the same. I believe this crucial point should be explained much earlier.Overall, I believe that even for many Dharma students who have been around for awhile, this book, written in an informal style by someone a bit ahead on the path, will shed some light: validating some intuitions on how to proceed in the Dharma, while disabusing one of others. For newer students, it could be an eye-opener that can save years of orientation to a very complex system of spiritual development."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism: Notes from a Practitioner's Journey","review":"The following review is written by Jan and Linda Derksen.Tibetan Buddhism has a steep learning curve. In this thoughtful, intelligent introduction, Bruce Newman's years of experience as a lama, serious practitioner, and Dharma teacher help us recognize and avoid many of the pitfalls that Western practitioners commonly stumble into.His book is a gem for any newcomer who feels intimidated and overwhelmed by the multitude of details that we need to sift through when we set out on this path.The book is equally helpful to practitioners with years of experience who are confronting increasingly subtle difficulties that are hard to uproot or even to recognize.Bruce's book is not like other books about Buddhism available today. He assumes we have some interest in Buddhism and will seek out lectures or read books about Buddha's life and teachings. He focuses his attention on guiding us through the practical considerations that Western students confront.Let's say we are serious enough to want to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings. Now what? Do we really need a Guru? How can devotion and trust function in the heart and mind of a well educated, scientifically minded Westerner? At the university Bruce's field of study was theoretical chemistry and quantum mechanics. Thus, we can relate to his tough-minded scientific mind and the effort he had to put into learning about devotion and trust first hand with Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche in Nepal and Gyatrul Rinpoche in California. Over the years Bruce also learned about devotion and trust by answering questions from his students. His book gives us many of the details as well as a broad perspective on the Guru-devotion discussion so that if we follow his advice, we won't get hurt, and neither will our Guru.Without the proper understanding, doing 100,000 prostrations looks like an enormous waste of time. Or, what exactly are we trying to do when we sit on our cushions and meditate? Bruce warns us about perfecting our outward performance and entirely missing out on the emotion-changing heart of the practice. He also cautions us about the dangers of getting competitive with our Dharma brothers and sisters.Lets say we've taken the step of volunteering at a Dharma Center and feel like tearing our hair out because our fellow volunteers are so annoying. Bruce spends an entire chapter on all the emotional ups and downs that are inevitable when we practice in a pressured situation with many people, and he shows us how to use the difficulties as part of our spiritual training.Bruce is the only author we've found who thoroughly and clearly explains the various lineages and stages one encounters. For example, he explains that Nyingma style practice has the following stages: (1.) Pointing-out Instructions-&gt;Ngondro-&gt;Deity Practice-&gt;Tsalung-&gt;Dzogchen/Mahamudra/Formless Practice, or the alternate possibility (2.) Pointing-out Instructions -&gt;Ngondro-&gt;Shinay-&gt;Lhagtong-&gt;Dzogchen/Mahamudra/Formless Practice.Bruce's honest, sometimes painful, self-revelations, especially about drugs, are there to help us confront our own emotional baggage. How does one go about removing the obscurations? Sometimes it can feel like we have all 84,000 of them at once, and life can get pretty discouraging. Other times we can fool ourselves by serenely shoving them aside and finding comfort in quiet meditation while our obscurations quietly fester and make our lives needlessly complicated. It's easy to spend years on the wrong track if we don't recognize what it is we're doing wrong.No matter what level of practice we're at, troubles will arise, and with this book we have the comfort of a spiritual friend who's been there and his genuine, heart-felt guidance about how best to proceed. We can be very grateful to Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche for insisting that Bruce write this book for us all.---Jan and Linda Derksen"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism: Notes from a Practitioner's Journey","review":"The earlier reviews of the book are written by people who have been practicing Tibetan Buddhism for several years. I read this book after studying Zen for several years. I read it to prepare for a journey to Dharamsala, India, to attend a teaching by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.Much of the difficulty in understanding all of Buddhism is its interlocking structure, and this book reflects it. To a newcomer to Tibetan Buddhism, this book does not offer a straightforward explanation of what to expect or to know. Admittedly, it would be difficult to provide one. However, the book was difficult to understand, and only after visiting Dharamsala and immersing myself in the Tibetan environment could I start to make sense of it.If you're approaching Buddhism for the first time, Zen can be more attractive because it's much more stripped down, while there is much more complexity (and in the long run, I believe, more richness) to Tibetan Buddhism. The best western analogy I can think of is comparing Presbyterianism (probably the most straightforward Christian sect) vs. Roman Catholicism (with its saints and rituals and intensive symbolism). If you were new to Christianity, Presbyterianism would be probably easier to start with, but the volume of information available to a practitioner (regardless of the philosophy behind it) is greater in Catholicism. Now imagine trying to explain hundreds of years of Catholicism in a single 200-page book, including all of the mystic traditions, history, artwork, differences in monastic traditions, etc.! In this book, that's what Newman is trying to do with Tibetan Buddhism, and it's a difficult task at best.If you're just starting to learn about Buddhism, I can't say I'd recommend this book; it's rather technical to start with. But if you've stuck your big toe in the water for a while and need some clarification, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism: Notes from a Practitioner's Journey","review":"I haven't yet picked up a book on Buddhism that I found anything other than helpful, as it seems that anyone who writes a book on the subject has their heart in the right place, if that makes sense. The same goes for this book, but the title is woefully misleading, which is problematic for the unaware reader.Bruce Newman writes in the introduction that he wrote this book to help bridge the gap between Buddhist ideas and Western practitioners, as Westerners sometimes have problems assimiliating Buddhist concepts due to the culture and language gap. This is an admirable idea for a book, but not a book for beginners.When I picked the book off the shelf and skimmed it, I saw some charts on lineages, and I thought it would be a primer on the different sects and an introduction, in as much as that is possible, to the basics of Tibetan Buddhism. However, Newman assumes a shared, deep knowledge of the subject and so he cherry picks his ideas, frequently writing something along the lines of: \\"I know you're all familiar with these ideas, so I am going to talk about the specific points that I want to focus on.\\" Again, that would be fine in a book that wasn't labelled \\"For Beginners,\\" as the beginners (like me) will have no idea of the context in which the material fits.Additionally, be prepared to read about the author's very specific point of view. There are multiple lineages in Buddhism, and Newman talks almost exclusively about the one in which he practices. Also, he takes for granted that the reader is about to get, or already has, a teacher or guru. Again, if you're a beginner, you are probably nowhere near that point.Lastly, and this may be considered a petty point when compared to the depth of the subject (as well as being the fault of the publisher, not the writer) but this book is riddled with a ludicrous amount of obvious, almost laughable, printing mistakes. It's kind of hard to take the information seriously when it's clear that no one at the publishing office even bothered to read through the manuscript before approving the printing run. At one point, the author writes something and then, in parentheses, questions his own writing, and answers his question. Basically, the author's notes made it into the final printing of the book! Another obvious mistake occurs at the beginning of a chapter. You know how the first letter of a chapter is sometimes enlarged, or embellished? In one of the chapters, the first, enlarged letter is a \\"W,\\" but the first word of the sentence is \\"By.\\" No one bothered to update the first letter so the sentence reads: \\"Wy this time, we should have...\\" Because the \\"W\\" is so large, it made me laugh out loud. Other than those two, there are countless dropped words, doubled words, plurality mistakes, etc. Again, it might be considered snobbish or petty, but I find it really hard to take the writing seriously in the midst of all these mistakes.I get the feeling that I will come back to some of the ideas in this book once I have a lot more grounding in the subject, but for now, it is simply too advanced for me. And there's a good chance that I'm a bit further along in reading on the subject than some other people who might pick up a book by this title.If it had been named something more accurate, like \\"Explaining Vajrayana Practice: An Integration Guide for Western Buddhists,\\" I would have known that it wasn't the right book for me at this time, but would have kept it in mind for later. And it would stand out to Vajrayanists, which is who it should appeal to, really: those who are interested in immersing themselves further in that particular lineage with the help of a Westerner who wants them to have greater access to, and benefits from, the Eastern texts and gurus."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism: Notes from a Practitioner's Journey","review":"I have been practicing Tibetan Buddhism for over eighteen years. I have found Bruce's frank discussion of the cultural clash most western dharma students face when seriously practicing Tibetan Buddhism to be delightful. His honesty does not put me off at all. Finally, someone has the courage to honestly share his experience of the path with me. He's brave enough to discuss everything in this book. I say, \\"Bravo!\\"If you are a new, younger female student, be sure to read the chapter on Dzogrim and the Body. It discusses one of the most important issues facing women lay practitioners. How do we relate to the sexual imagery of tantra? What do we do when older dharma students or lamas hit on us? It could save you a lot of grief to read this chapter carefully if you are seriously interested in dharma practice.I disagree with one reviewer who says the author's lama should've written about Tibetan Buddhism, with the author just sharing his experiences in anecdotal form. This isn't a translation of dharma material. It's an overview of the path for new students. It's a chance for older students to realize that we aren't the only ones who've faced these difficulties when attempting to practice Tibetan Buddhism. Sure, it would have been better if there weren't any typos, but hey, why not cut the author some slack? It's the meaning that is most important, not the words, right?I want to thank the author for writing this wonderful book. It finally discusses in an honest way, many of the problems I've faced over the years. The chapter on ritual is also very important. It cautions western students to not dismiss any aspect of these practices, simply because we consider them unfamiliar and peculiar to Tibetan Buddhism.I can't recommend this book enough. It is a unique and practical guide that is a must read for anyone seriously considering devoting themselves to the path of Tibetan Buddhism."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Tibetan Buddhism: Notes from a Practitioner's Journey","review":"I'm sure in the future I will appreciate the content of this book and the effort placed into it, but this is not a book for me as a \\"Beginner\\".

Why architecture is important and what makes it so is the subject matter here, brought to us by a very competent writer. Delightfully so, in fact, as Rybczynski has the storyteller's ability to weft and weave.The stories he has chosen here are a mixed bunch and we are asked to think about such diverse constructions as the American bungalow, the Grow Home and public buildings like the Canadian Centre for Architecture. He has stories to tell about all of them, the people who live in or use them and the odd trends which are sometimes responsible for a particular design. As he points out, although we use architecture every day of our lives and are clearly affected by it (whether we know it or not), we are more than prone to take it for granted. Should we not be more aware of what's around us, in general? This book offers up some thoughtful ideas on the subject."},{"Title":"Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture","review":"I am a big fan of architecture critic Witold Rybczynski. If you haven't read his books HOME, or WAITING FOR THE WEEKEND, or CITY LIFE, this book is a good way to get familiar with many of the themes he has addressed time and again over his long and prolific career (e.g., the place of houses in people's lives, living smaller, the role of architects, the legacy of modernism, the place and meaning of ornament, the intrusion of fashion into the world of architecture, and the importance of the Vitruvian values of commodity, firmness and beauty in identifying \\"good\\" architecture). Many of these pieces were previously published in magazines and journals. Some are more thoughtful, well-researched, and even polemical; others read like Sunday magazine fluff pieces (not too many of these, though). Like many of Rybczynski's books, there are no illustrations. If you're like me, you'll find youself going to the Internet often to get images of some of the buildings, places, and people he mentions. It slows down the reading, but is necessary, it seems, to get the full impact of what Rybczynski is saying."},{"Title":"Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture","review":"Planning on building a house, I was especially interested in Rybczynski's thoughts and insights about homes and what they should look like. From the start I was captivated. Wanting to be sleek and modern, I thought an architect would quickly confirm my ideas. Instead, at the start of the book Rybczynski, with reasoning, brings the reader back to the traditional home and approves of it; and makes me want to build one... and live in a lovely little neighborhood.He moves beyond the house and Looking Around takes us into the cities and towns to look at public buildings like art museums. The history and progression that he packs into this book is very insightful.He says, \\"I am not arguing for a historical style as much as for a historical attitude- deja-vu, as opposed to avant-garde. An awareness of history- of the successes and failures of the past should inform architectural design to a greater degree than it now does.\\""},{"Title":"Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture","review":"If there is a theme to this book, it's \\"Pay Attention.\\" Rybczynski encourages us to look around as we go around. He wants us to look at the buildings and look at our houses. It's so easy to walk the streets of our cities and towns and never even notice the buildings. He wants us to understand what makes some places special (or not). He wants us to see the art in the architecture. Rybczynski has written more than fifteen books and countless articles on architecture. He is an architect himself and has learned to look around.This book is very approachable for those of us outside of the architecture intelligentsia. He references many examples to describe the historical context and impact of buildings. Many of the buildings he describes are famous enough to be familiar to most people and many are not so famous. He encourages us to think about our own houses, the architecture we've chosen as the setting for our lives. For example, do you live in a \\"period\\" home or one that has been made to look like a period home? Victorian? Modern? Postmodern? This book will be a lot of help as you set off to think about your surroundings. BTW, I found it very helpful to have Google Images close at hand so that I to look up the buildings and homes as I read about them.

Even tough I am not what you'd call a lay-man on architectural issues, Witold's book really made me see that's possible to write about architecture without being too academic or technical.

The other books are also collections of those newspaper columns, and again pleasant, positive readings, but not half as instructional as Sermon on the Mount."},{"Title":"The Emmet Fox Treasury--Five Spiritual Classics: Around the Year With Emmet Fox, Find & Use Your Inner Power, The Ten Commandments, The Sermon on the Mount, Power Through Constructive Thinking","review":"I'm not able to review the books that I ordered and paid for because they weren't sent.

Another smart, sexy, savvy book in The Bridesmaid Chronicles, FIRST DANCE revolves around the third bridesmaid in the upcoming wedding of Julia Spinelli and Roman Sonntag.In this installment, Manhattan divorce attorney Vivien Shelton is already amazed that she's a bridesmaid in a wedding. The irony doesn't escape her. What she can't figure out is why she's having such a hard time convincing the bride, Julia, to sign a pre-nuptial agreement before the wedding. After all, Vivien knows that love rarely lasts. She sees everyday the way former couples can destroy each other, and she doesn't want to see the same thing happen to her friend. And besides, Roman gave Julia a cubic zirconia ring, for goodness sake! An ironclad pre-nup sounds like the best wedding present she could ever give her best friend. So she's off to Fredericksburg , Texas , to make sure her friend doesn't bite off more than she can chew.For J.B. Anglin, the best man, protecting his best friend Roman's best interests is the most important thing. Being the Sonntag family lawyer has its responsibilities, and making sure Roman isn't sucked into an unfair pre-nuptial agreement is at the top of his list. Imagine his surprise when he discovers that the lawyer pushing for the agreement is none other than hot-shot divorce attorney Vivien, a woman known for her cynical views on love and marriage-and also the woman he had a sizzling one-night-stand with three years ago after a battle in court. Their relationship hadn't worked out back then, with J.B. in Texas and Vivien in Manhattan , and he's still stung over the way things ended. Now, when they're battling over the interests of their two best friends, seems like the perfect time to have it out, once and for all.I loved FIRST DANCE. Wonderful characters, unforgettable dialogue, and plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes make this a perfect addition to The Bridesmaid Chronicles. The way Vivien and J.B. fight and love is reminiscent of numerous couples I know, and kept me in stitches. This book is a great way to spend a relaxing evening, laughing at the antics of two people who just can't figure out that if they'd ever stop arguing, they'd find a love worth fighting for."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Chronicles: First Dance (Bridesmaids Chronicles)","review":"When New Jersey nouveau riche Julia Spinelli and Texas Brahmin Roman Sonntag met and fell in love, neither expected their respective families and friends to revolt. That is what seems to have happened as everyone discounts the feelings of the duo and insists they know what is best for either Julie or Roman. Now the third bridesmaid New York divorce attorney Vivien Shelton does not trust the Italian speaking Texan that she never met. Their whirlwind courtship has their families in an uproar. She draws up the perfect present for her best friend Julia, a prenup with no loopholes though she has to do that in between migraine causing clients. She leaves her five greyhounds behind to go to Texas to rescue her best friend.Roman's pal attorney J.B. Anglin is reminded by Roman's nuptial of the New York lawyer who bested him in a divorce case, Vivien Shelton. When they meet again to discuss prenups, he is cold towards her while she is cynical about relationships and marriage. As they fight, they fall in love, but she is Manhattan and he is Texas but more important neither seems to trust one another though they are good in bed together.The third entry of this series (and the final one starring the bridesmaids) is a terrific tale as the two combatants battle every moment until both realizes that love has snuck into their relationship. The story line is amusing as the lead couple argue over everything as he is cattle and she is greyhound. This dueling duo makes for a fine entry that sets up the final march down the aisle of Julia and Roman in FIRST LOVEHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Chronicles: First Dance (Bridesmaids Chronicles)","review":"Tough NY divorce attorney goes to TX for her friend's wedding.

Heroine tries to be emotionally distant with him like she was 3 yrs before but finds it harder to do so. Hero won't let her hide from him again & his ex-wife's constant presence in his life brings out feelings she can't ignore.This was a well-written lighthearted romance with some depth. It was emotionally-involving & engagingl, which made it a quick read. Romance, sexual chemistry,& sex scenes were good. The characters were interesting & the secondary characters didn't distract from the main romance. I liked heroine's toughness with issues & people she cares about. She goes the distance to protect them, even though she herself had an emotionally-neglectful childhood & still has difficulty being emotionally-vulnerable to others. She didn't act like a victim but tended to over-compensate on being a savior to the neglected. Hero was an honorable man, even with his ex-wife. He values marriage & family & won't move out of town to take care of his mom. He was also sexy, humorous, & hard-working. I liked that Hero didn't sleep around, turning down opportunities.

After representing too many women, in too many divorces, Vivian is decidedly cynical about love and marriage. When her best-friend Julia asks her to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, Vivian reluctantly agrees. But Julia's whirlwind romance to cash-strapped Roman Sonntag sends Vivian from the courtroom to the wide-open spaces of Texas, determined to persuade Julia to at least sign a prenuptial agreement to protect her fortune. Vivian's only previous experience with anything Texan is when she represented Kiki Sonntag's ex-husband in their divorce. During the divorce of Kiki and Walter the Wanker, as Vivian calls him, Viv tangled with Kiki's Texas attorney, and not just in the courtroom. After a night of heated passion, Vivian kicked the cowboy out of her bed, and out of her mind, but now, it seems, she's going to have to go toe to toe with sexy lawyer J.B. Anglin, again.J.B. Anglin is a man who keeps his word and believes in forever; unfortunately, his ex-wife didn't share those beliefs, and the only woman he's been interested in since his divorce is a tough-girl attorney from Manhattan, only she kicked him out of bed before the sheets were cold. But now Vivian Shelton is on his turf, and he plans to get a little revenge.From the moment Vivian and J.B. appear together, the sparks fly. The humor, sarcasm and banter between the two are a complete delight. Their interaction with other characters is limited, but adds a lot of insight and humor to the story. Vivian is a hard as nails woman on the outside, but inside she is so vulnerable it's nearly painful. She thought her life was just the way she wanted it, but it's obvious to the reader that she's on a fast course to being a lonely and angry woman if she doesn't learn to trust. J.B. seems to be a carefree, well-adjusted man with a positive outlook on life, but even he has issues and pain buried deep that make him vulnerable, and sometimes angry. Watching the interaction between J.B. and Vivian is a riot. They are passionate about each other, but believe they are complete opposites. It will take patience, understanding, and courage for these two to make a life together.Fast-paced, flirty, fun and fabulous aptly describe Karen Kendall's FIRST DANCE. For a novel that will entertain, make you laugh and sniff back a few tears, I highly recommend FIRST DANCE. I can't wait to read Julia's story coming out in September, FIRST LOVE by Julie Kenner.Terrie Figueroa"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Chronicles: First Dance (Bridesmaids Chronicles)","review":"Karen Kendall's 3rd book in The Bridesmaid Chronicles is superb! I read it in record time because I just didn't want to put it down. If you read Karen's first book in this series, you will absolutely love First Dance.In First Dance, Manhattan's top female divorce attorney, Vivien, heads to Texas in the hopes of getting her bride-to-be best friend to sign a pre-nup (her idea of a great wedding present). But, she soon finds out that one of the groomsmen (also a lawyer) is deadset against a pre-nup, plus he is itching for a fight, in particular one with Vivien.

After all, a man who gives a CZ engagement ring can't be in it for the long haul. However, the best man is also a lawyer, and less of a cynic than Viv. He also has a history with the tough as nails lady. They shared one night of passion, after which J.B. found himself summarily dismissed. From the moment he gets a second chance to tangle with Vivian, he's out to avenge his pride, until his heart gets in the way.*** Sharp banter contrasts with the soft side of these two intelligent protagonists to create an intricate romance. Especially of interest is the information Ms. Kendall slips in on canine rescues. There is one scene in particular, with a woman divorcing a chimp, that makes the book priceless. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Fumblerules (The Intrepid Linguist Library)","review":"Safire definitely knows what he's talking about-and he isn't afraid to tell it to your face, either. I love the cocky attitude of this handbook, and I doubt I'll ever have as much fun learning about grammar and rules again-unless I read another of his books! I've read this book twice-and plan to read it again soon-and it reads like a joke book. It's laugh out loud funny, and his humor is right up my alley (avoid clich&eacute;s like the plague).At the beginning of the book, he bluntly tells you to \`do as I say, not as I do' which it would behoove you to take notice of, as every chapter title is in itself a grammatical error. (And behoove seems to be his favorite word) For example, the chapter on double negatives is called: Don't use no double negatives. From run-on sentences to using negative statements, this book has it all.With colorful phrases like, \`blond enough to make a bishop kick a hole through a stained glass window' and painfully demonstrative examples, this book is for anyone looking for an educational laugh.

I do not always agree with the author's conclusions but gladly echo her sentiments and appreciate her insights. For anyone who is repelled by the Old Testament's picture of God or offended by Israel's election or the presence of violence in the Old Testament, this book is an necessary read.

After a year I succumbed to Amazon's marketing acumen and purchased the darn thing, mostly because it seemed like I had read every other piece of historical fiction dealing with the Roman legions that I could find. I put off purchasing this book for two reasons. One was that it was written quite a while back and the other is that it dealt with two Gauls and not with the legions themselves.I suspect many of you reading this are looking at this book for much the same reason as I have, so let me assure you that this is a truly good book and I enjoyed it. It was historically immersive, culturally accurate, and you get to tromp through ancient Rome environs, from Gaul to Scythia, with protagonists who are interesting, believable, and who tell a fascinating story. This was a winner and a fine addition to my collection and I recommend it. I will certainly be purchasing more novels from this author; it will help with the waiting for the next Simon Scarrow installment! For those interested in more great fiction books dealing with Rome and her legions I have compiled a listmania list, but I am not sure how you navigate to it. Good luck, and good reading."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"My first encounter with Duggan was the purchase of a used copy of the novel \\"Family Favourites\\", which is about the Roman Emperor Elgalabulus. It was so good that I could not wait to read his other works. Recently, Winter Quarters and another novel, Three's Company, have come back into print. Apparently, many of his novels will be reprinted over the next few years. (You can check Amazon's UK website for details) I purchased both and read Winter Quarters first. The book description above is fairly accurate. The story involves two Gauls, Acco and Camul, who join up with Ceasar's legions after they are forced to leave home due to a confrontation with \\"The Goddess\\". The story is told from Camul's point of view. The story opens with Camul on a Parthian border outpost. He then tells another warrior his tale, hence the story of Winter Quarters. Camul and Acco wind up attached to Crassus's son and wind up joining him on his invasion of Parthia. I look forward to reading Duggan's other novels. If you enjoy reading ancient historical fiction, I highly recommend Duggan."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Winter Quarters tells a familiar tale from an unfamiliar point of view. With so much research and interpretations of late-Republic Rome, this book recalls the Rome of Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus, from the point of view of minor noble Gauls Acco and Camul. In their home village, Acco's love Grane is mauled to death by a bear in the woods, and Acco then kills the bear. From the warning of an old woman who witnessed it, he believes \\"The Goddess\\", whose name is almost never used, has cursed him for slaying her bear.To avoid her wrath, Acco and Camul go to join the Romans, with whom their tribe is at peace with, and join Caesar on his campaign against the other tribes. From there, they join Publius Licinius Crassus, and his father Marcus's campaign east to attack the Parthians.The text is very plain and humble, without Pressfield-esque literary richness, or McCullough-esque description of politics, people, and history. The narrator, Camul, is very optimistic, relatively untouched by traumas of hard marches and fierce battles, with only honor and pride in his head and heart.Despite this lack of lush writing or historical density, the book is far from dry, as the story holds enough interest to keep one reading through all its 234 pages, from the distant Gallic tribe bordering Iberia they come from, to the deserts of Syria and the battlefield of Carrhae, and to the barren Sea of Grass in the middle of Asia, where the narrator's story ends.Not a phenom of a novel, but an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"Ancient Rome is a very popular subject for fans of historical fiction. Witness the recent efforts by Conn Iggulden, Simon Scarrow and Michael Curtis Ford, to name a few, none of which are all that great, but all of which apparently sold pretty well. Lately, publishers have been looking to the past for something to reprint, such as Wallace Breem's Eagle in the Snow, and now this one, Winter Quarters. Neither of these are all that hot either.In Winter Quarters the twist is that the story is narrated by a Gaul. He joins the Roman army--at the time occupying his country--so that he can accompany a friend of his who is told to take a hike after offending a local earth goddess. They are taken under the wing of the scion of one of the Roman triumvirate, and subsequently get to visit Rome, Greece, and Syria before taking part in the historical, ill-fated campaign against Parthia in 54 B. C.It would seem to have all the ingredients but unfortunately the narration reads like a travelogue and the narrator is vanilla-bland with little style or wit. In his novels, Steven Pressfield has exhibited a problem with narration as well, but at least with him you get an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of ancient warfare and customs. With Mr. Duggan, you don't even get that.But it is not without some good stuff. The narrator and his friend have a fervent interest in religion so we get a lot of discussion about religious practices, rites and temples in the areas through which they travel. They even make a stop in Jerusalem and get to comment about that as well, remarking quizzically about the, \\"one God\\" of the Jews, and how jealous he is of other gods. Of interest is the fact that they take these religions on their own terms, never belittling or even questioning them in light of their own strongly held beliefs.Nothing much really happens plotwise, though. There's a minor adventure with the daughter of a family that befriends them and how she becomes a priestess in some kind of a debauched temple, but this is not nearly intriguing as it could have been. Early on there is a skirmish with a German tribe and the narrator feels a little ashamed that he and his mates are given the task of wiping out the women and children, a task they perform with relish. This also blows by in a hurry with little detail or commentary.Finally there is the great battle against the Parthians which the novel has been foreshadowing with a sense of doom throughout, and sure enough, the Romans take a thrashing. But again, there is little of the gritty detail and observation that great historical fiction exhibits. In McCarthy's Blood Meridian, the hero, dazed in the midst of a cavalry charge, notes a pony darting by, snapping at him with its teeth. In Pressfield's Last of the Amazons, the hero jams his shield against the stony ground and huddles behind it, fearfully enduring the arrows and stones being flung against it. These are the kind of exhilarating, exciting, heart-pounding moments historical fiction aficionados yearn for, but here, they barely exist. Our guy charges into the Parthian horse, he watches his friend and his leader get killed, he manages to break through the line, and he runs like the dickens back to his own line. There's not much more to it than that.Which brings up kind of a weird subplot going on in here, too, having to do with the narrator's lack of fortitude. In nearly every engagement in which he participates, he routinely takes the easy way out. For example, after fleeing ignominiously at the last battle, he states, \\"I served the Romans for pay and I thought our charge had been enough.\\" It is not clear what the author is trying to show by this. Is it supposed to be a comment on Gallic honor? Or on Roman mercenaries? Or is it on the narrator individually? It's hard to tell and isn't explored enough to know one way or the other.This is not a bad book. It moves along pretty well and there is a little depth, anyway. But if great historical fiction can be defined as having great characters, a great plot, and great detail, this one is thoroughly average in all three respects."},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"War is business. It's a basic theme to Alfred Duggan's epic tale called \\"Winter Quarters.\\" I had been looking for a shorter book to read in the interim before I moved onto something longer, and I came across Alfred Duggan, and this book came in highly recommended, and it was the perfect length, so how could I resist? Well, temptation is the hand of the devil, and I must say that I was extremely impressed!Taking place during the time of Caesar, Caesar is waring in Gaul, and soon moving eastwards towards the Germanic tribe area. However, our story is not about Caesar, but of 2 Gaul nobels, Camul and Acco. On one particular day, Acco was off hunting when Camul saw him running down the mountain in a terrible freight! Acco had killed the bear of the goddess Pyrene! After talk amongst the nobels and family, it is decided that Camul is going to leave and join the Roman army, and Acco will follow. They will leave their home while the wrath of the goddess dies down, before returning.Over the next few years, we read about how Camul and Acco join up with Caesar, the cavarly, and eventually move into \\"The City,\\" aka Rome. Through their eyes, we see how roman lifestyle was like, the desire for blood, but only blood that was well deserved. And how the romans went to war not so much to defend themselves, but more because it was business. They simply invaded a country which was not hostile, because it would better suite roman needs.We see how Camul and Acco travel from Rome, out to the Middle East, through Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem. They give an incredible retelling of what life was like all across their journeys.Winter Quarters was a fantastic book. One of the points which captured me first, was how the book opened at \\"present times,\\" and one evening Camul has his friend write down his telling of how he came to be where he was. I really felt what life was like during these times, and the pain and pleasures that these men went through, and experienced during their odyssey. We see how their cultures are different, how politics are played, and how the Gaul lifestyle is much older, than the new roman ways.I plan on continuing reading Alfred Duggan's novels, and I would recommend this book for people who enjoy historical fiction, and need something light. This book is not very deep, or difficult to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Winter Quarters","review":"I won't reiterate other reviews here.

The characters and context are likewise thoroughly undeveloped--no immersion at all in the world of Gauls, Romans, or Parthians.

Special sessions were set aside for her to autograph the book, &quot;Shibori.&quot; The reception given by the artists attending is recommendation enough.I second the comments of the other reviewers about the quality of the writing and illustrations. Yoshiko Wada is a vibrant and astute advocate for fabric arts and shibori techniques. The text serves as a wookbook for designers, artists, teachers and collector/buyers.Among the dozens of exhibitions of fabric art throughout the city was one by Cara Boelts, a 2003 graduate of the KC Art Institute and chosen by the faculty as one of the students worthy to be featured during the Conference. She has developed an innovation in shibori dying that includes not only patina but burn out. Her exhibition of approximately a dozen wall hangings was visited by 100s of conferees and drew praise almost universally. The ultimate compliment, major Kansas City artists and many conferees bought half or more of the pieces exhibited.Yoshiko Wada found it to be a new technique in shibori and said she would include a description of it in any future editions of 'Shibori.'During the conference the book was sold at the KC Art Institute, but also at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, whic has one of the world class collections of oriental art. 'Shibori' is still available in its bookstore/gift shop.An excellent book.Paul Williams, North Kansas City MO"},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","review":"This is an invaluable resource for any textile arts student.

However, the very pleasant surprise was all the history of shibori! It would be fascinating even if I wasn't intending to learn the technique. The instructions are very clearly presented. I have already tried a couple of the techniques with very good results and I'm only a beginner!"},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","review":"This book covers a wide variety of ways in which cloth can be bound - stitching, clamping and tying - and explains regional variations appearing in the result.Note that this is NOT primarily a dyeing book. In just a few pages, it explains techniques using natural dyes that would require a separate text to do justice. Also, because traditional Japanese kimono fabrics are very narrow, the results I've achieved in the short space of time since getting the book reflect the difference in using 40+\\" wide fabrics.Great photographs in both black and white and not enough in color are a good source of inspiration; there's enough material in this book to keep me busy experimenting for years."},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","review":"This is an excellent book both in image and instruction.

I also have a PhD in art history. This is a wonderful combination of a how-to-book, a collection of contemporary shibori creations, and a scholarly research publication. I was blown away by the careful research details on the history of Japanese shibori. The book is amply illustrated (mostly black and white photos and drawings) with examples of historic patterned fabric and Japanese kimonos. These images clearly demonstrate the precision details possible with pole-wrapping, stitching, folding, and binding, and the variations are incredible. While the final dyed fabric examples are impressive, the author includes enough instructions that you can replicate the results. All of this was worth the price for me."},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","review":"This book struck me as being on the price-y side, so I had put off getting it, even though I tend to buy textile books rather indiscriminately. Besides, even though I've been known to teach tie-dyeing, my own focus is loom-controlled shibori, which is not a traditional shibori technique, and is not covered by this book.However, when I finally saw this book in real life, I knew I had to have it, and even the full retail price seemed like a bargain. It is rare to find a book that thoroughly covers equipment and techniques (there's even instructions for an indigo vat in the appendix), and also is unabashed eye candy. The authors/publishers managed costs intelligently; there are plenty of color photos, but no gratuitous or distracting color. Many patterns in the gallery are shown in black-and-white, which helps the reader focus on the important aspects of design in addition to keeping the price of the book reasonable. There is a short section on history; large sections on each of the basic techniques; a gallery section showing even more examples (even though the discussions of the individual techniques are amply illustrated); and a discussion, mostly in photos, of modern textile-art pieces along with artists' statements. There's even a handy glossary.A must-have for fiber artists!"},{"Title":"Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition Techniques Innovation","review":"This is an essential tool and starting point for any shibori artist.

Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart's humorous and idiosyncratic story of whisky presents a time capsule of Scotland that only two generations still living can relate to, but it evokes a common experience, that of hard work and adversity, of faith and of loyalty, that all can enjoy.Buy this book if you want to learn facts about whisky that no one else will know. Buy this book if you love stories about the men who founded great whisky empires, like Thomas Dewar, John Haig, Alexander and John Walker and William Grant. Buy this book if you love hearing about smugglers and gaugers, kings and conquerors, and if you are curious about what Thomas Jefferson, Rudyard Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson all said about whisky.In terms of style, do not look for tables, charts or scores. Just pretend you are sitting by a log fire in a crumbling stone Bed and Breakfast in Balmenach, by the foot of the Cromdale Hills in Scotland. As you rest your weary legs after a long day on the hills, you hear an old man tell stories to his family about whisky. You can't help but fall into a trance as you hear him tell stories of romance and legend, and you have an unquenchable desire to drink each whisky as he tells its story.Here are some sample sentences from the book that illustrates the author's unique and sometimes irreverent approach to whisky. \\"Distilleries sought to enhance the value of their own whisky by giving it the name of Glenlivet, the glen watered by the Livet. Such was the wide abuse of the name that Glenlivet became known sarcastically as the longest glen in Scotland.\\" Of the Glenfiddich distillery, Lockhart tells a story of an Inland Revenue visit by the taxman, who was perplexed by all the \\"latin and mathematical text books lying all over the distillery. On asking to whom they belonged, he was told they were the property of the stillman, the maltman and the tunroom man.\\" All three were the sons of William Grant who went on to found their own distilleries.Thanks to this jewel of a book, I know how to make the classic hot toddy. I know why whisky was used for last rites on battlefields and who used whisky successfully to treat infants with smallpox. Yes, sometimes the author gets caught up in the intricacies of pricing and taxing, and yes there are moments of sentimentality, but this is more than made up for by the passion of his sheer love of whisky and the country that makes it."},{"Title":"Scotch, the Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story","review":"Being a fine Scotsman, the author discusses the history of scotch whiskey from the early days as the drink of the people in the Highlands of Scotland, where if not everybody, at least every town had someone distilling the aqua vitae beloved the world over. He chronicles the times of repression and taxation, when stills were hidden and whiskey was smuggled all over the country. With the invention of the patent still (allowing a more industrial production) and the popularity of blended whiskeys, the 1800s saw the rise of popularity of scotch whiskey outside Scotland. Initially it was promoted in England and then to the rest of the world. The rise of the \\"big five\\" distillers (Dewars, Walkers, Buchanans, Haigs, and Mackies) is chronicled with charming details. The impact of consolidation in the Distillers Company Limited (which the big five managed to avoid) is described along with various conflicts over what should count as whiskey. The author clearly favors \\"Scotch malt whisky which is distilled in Scotland in a simple pot-still from a mash consisting entirely of malted barley.\\" [p. 3]The 20th century history is also chronicled, with the impacts of two world wars and American prohibition being the main events. The book was written in the 1950s, so much of the recent history is not covered."},{"Title":"Scotch, the Whisky of Scotland in Fact and Story","review":"This book was not only very informative about Scotch, but also Scottish heritage in general. I will look for more books by Lockhart. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"THE DRAMATIZED OLD TESTAMENT - Two Volume Set - the Old Testament in Drama and Narrative - New International Version","review":"Many people believe that the stories of the Bible were meant to be acted out in skits and plays around ancient campfires and ancient communities. The argument is that most of the Bible can be best interpreted as if it were written as stage dialogue.This book takes the Bible and sets it in stage dialogue and stage direction. It is a unique approach that provides a Bible reader with a new perspective on the ancient words of the Bible. It is also useful for role playing or acting out portions of the Bible in various ministry settings."},{"Title":"Simple Thoughts That Can Change Your Life","review":"I actually purchased this book several years ago, & I just recently got it out again to re-read - and I'm really glad I did.This book is jam packed with excellent insights designed to help you achieve the joyful life you've always wanted. It also includes step-by-step instructions on how to get the most from what is offered.The idea behind this book seems to be that we need to change our thoughts before we can change our lives. I've read many books now on this topic, and I have to say that it makes quite a lot of sense when you take the time to look back on your life and ponder how you got into certain situations, and can realize why your life is how it is today.Each insight in this book is very short - about 1 sentence in length - so it's quite easy to memorize the \\"thought of the day\\" and meditate/ponder on it whenever you get the chance.Once you've come to the realization that your thoughts are greatly impacting your life, this book can be of assistance by providing you with new ways to look at things - ways that can assist you in creating the life of your dreams.I would suggest reading \\"Love is Letting Go of Fear\\" - by this same author, as well as \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Wayne Dyer for more info. on the power of our thoughts, and how to go about changing them so that you're creating the life you want, instead of attracting those things/experiences that you'd really rather avoid."},{"Title":"Simple Thoughts That Can Change Your Life","review":"One of the best books I've ever had, given for gifts often. thank you, excellent service"},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Deck: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"Wow. What a fab deck. I just knew it was going to be beautiful and ordered without even doing my usual hunt on the net to get sneak advance peaks! (Silly of me really, as there is a site called fairytaletarot.com where you can see loads of cards and read the foreword by Rachel Pollack too!)Anyway, the artwork is gorgeous, detailed and beautifully coloured. The colours are perfect - it's not bright, like the inner child cards - nor pastelly - but neither is it dark. The book gives the tale behind each card - there are some I knew, and many I didn't. I recommend buying the kit, as the tales give more to the meanings of the cards.Is this a Rider-Waite clone? I have no idea. You'd need to visit one of the many tarot review websites to get their more professional opinion - I'm just a collector of cards with beautiful artwork - not an expert.The cards are made nicely too - reversible backs, nice stock which should stand up to use. And the book has an illustration of each card at the beginning of the relevant story, which is a plus for me.Note: This is definitely not for use with children, like Inner Child and the other fairytale deck by I can't quite remember who. It is a deck for adults, as the fairytales here are the real versions, not the expurgated ones normally found in kids's books - and thus much more interesting!Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Deck: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"(Note: While this deck is gorgeous on its own, I feel that the Boxed Set version with Ms. Mahony's paperback book (ISBN: 095450075X) is much better. Many of the fairy tales may be unfamiliar to you, so getting the box set with the paperback will not only provide you with the tales themselves, but also the hows and whys of both the tale choices and their correlation to the RWS. Thus, when I comment about the \\"companion book\\", I'm referring to ISBN: 095450075X, the box set.)\\"Fairy stories open out a parallel and hidden world in our own minds-and therein lies their power and fascination, and their great potential as a partner for tarot. Because after all, isn't tarot at its best, also a form of story?\\" - From The Fairytale Tarot companion bookLike the tarot, fairy tales weave layers of shadow and light, with interpretation often in the eye of the beholder. Containing brutality and beauty, the obvious and the ambiguous, the complexity of fairy tales seemed a suitable partnership to the tarot in the mind of Karen Mahony. The designer of The Fairytale Tarot, she and Alex Ukolov (illustrator) and Irena Triskova (artist) have created an exquisite set of 78 cards reflecting mostly European tales-in addition to several Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern stories.Rather than merely grafting fairytales to fit Rider-Waite-Smith iconography, the Magic Realist Press team selected stories and designed images that are congruent with acceptable card meaning, yet expand these correlations into something more: a deck that is fresh, thought provoking, and potentially transformative.Blending the transcendent and the ordinary, fairy tales have captured the imagination of children around the world for centuries. However, The Fairytale Tarot doesn't \\"Disney-fy\\" the stories, making this deck decidedly adult. For example, the stepsisters hacking parts off their feet to fit into the glass slipper in Cinderella (The Empress) preserves the vision of the Brothers Grimm. Hans Christian Anderson's tale of The Little Mermaid (Nine of Swords) finds the mermaid permitting the sea witch to take her singing voice by cutting out her tongue in exchange for \\"legs...that felt like walking on knife blades.\\"Like life itself, both fairy tales and tarot reflect sorrow, sacrifice, betrayal, and loss-as well as the happier themes of marriage, recovery, justice, and fortune. As is often the case, some stories lack satisfactory resolution-and Ms. Mahony is sure to include several of these untidy tales which stir the imagination and beg for a closer look. However, even the well-known stories that are chosen-The Ugly Duckling (Ace of Cups), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (10 of Wands), and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Judgement) offer new, intriguing insights into the cards. This is in large part to the magnificent prose of Ms. Mahony, whose astute observations make the companion book a treasure in itself. But when these tales-many unfamiliar-are coupled with the exquisite artwork and illustration of Mr. Ukolov and Ms. Triskova, the result is truly magical.The Fairytale Tarot uses the suits of Swords (Air), Cups (Water), Wands (Fire) and Coins (Earth), with the Court cards following the Page, Knight, Queen, and King designation. Cards measure approximately 5 x 3 inches, and although the card stock is flexible, they appear to hold up acceptably. Nevertheless, I've noticed a few of the edges beginning to turn up, so you may want to take extra care with this deck. At first glance, the backs appear fully reversible, but upon closer inspection, they are not. However, since the design is rather intricate and filigreed, you'd only notice the position if you paid particular attention to the four corners.As previously mentioned, the Fairytale Tarot comes with a companion book: 232 glossy pages that feature a smaller version of the card image, corresponding fairy tale, keywords and phrases, Ms. Mahony's adept commentary, and additional artwork. Several spreads, with interpretations, are also included, as is some historical background and a bibliography. A unique addition to the companion book is a tale created for the 10 of Coins by Rachel Pollack. Ms. Pollack did not know the original tale and used the picture to suggest a fresh story culled from her own imagination-The Girl Who Was Too Shy. In the book proper, Ms. Mahony provides the actual tale for the 10 of Coins-The Goose Girl by the Brothers Grimm.As a professional Tarot reader, I've used The Fairytale Tarot the last several weeks with great success-especially with a 3-card Life Purpose spread using a \\"separated\\" deck (dividing the deck up in Majors, Courts, and Minors). My clients report amazing accuracy, and reading with this deck has been a joy. The expressiveness of the images lends itself to personal intuitive interpretation, and the tales themselves add depth to readings. There are many symbolic \\"jump off points\\" in the Fairytale Tarot!I thoroughly enjoyed reading the companion book, especially discovering new tales and gaining fresh insights into several tarot cards. Some of the tales-such as The Nightingale and the Rose (3 of Swords) and The Constant Tin Solider (10 of Swords) were positively heartbreaking. Other stories-such as The Emperor and the Nightingale (The Emperor) and Water and Salt (Temperance) seem ordinary at first (as far as fairytales go!), but their lessons add depth and breadth to these two Majors. I look forward to re-reading the tales and working further with the Fairytale Tarot. Kudos goes to Ms. Mahony, Mr. Ukolov, and Ms. Triskova for creating a most delightful deck! It may not be a good deck for beginners, but for those who enjoy the complexity of fairytales, it is a very readable, very engaging deck.(To see 10 images from The Fairytale Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])"},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Deck: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"I am very impressed with these cards - I have 2 sets as I don't feel they are very good quality though the ones who make them quarantee they are, they are flimsy & I didn't want to be without so I bought a second set, I contacted the makers first and as I mentioned they quarantee they are of high quality personally I have over a hundred decks & I find it hard to believe these would stand the test of time compared to other cards, I certainly wouldn't buy 2 decks and spend all that money otherwise.

I was had high hopes for this deck but have to admit that I'm dissappointed. The art is okay and I know the vintage illustration look the artist was going for, but for me it just seems a bit too stilted and forced. There are some nice cards, but one the whole I found the illustrations dissappointing. I could probably still read with it, but it does not draw me in.Another big issue is that while I was flipping through it, I noticed that I had 2 of one of the cards. After checking through it carefully I realized that one was missing. I asked around and found that this has been a problem with the initial printing of the deck. Lucky me! :( I don't want to hurt my friend's feeling so will probably just hang on to the deck, but any thoughts of reading with it are now gone.It's not a bad tarot deck, but I think it could have been done better.

Add a self-righteous Archdeacon, there to report on the conduct of Father Geoffrey Jolliffe, who is conducting the service, and you have the ingredients for a smart, subversive dark comedy revolving around the question of \\"What did he die of?\\"To supply the answer would spoil the story.

His personal style--wry, self-effacing--shades his writing, which manages to be delicate, ironic, and hysterically funny all at once. The title story is destined to be a classic, and if you loved \\"The Clothes They Stood Up In,\\" it's sure to be something you read and reread. It's genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, and it's quite astonishing how a seemingly lightweight take about the death of an ambisexual masseur can hone in on people's hopes and fears without ever becoming less than a breathtaking feat. The second, also more a novella than a shirt story, is less impressive but still very funny, sexy, and also sweet. The last is the least compelling--the prat of a protagonist makes it rough going--but this is the shortest of the lot by far. And the first take alone is well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Laying on of Hands","review":"I was very pleased with this collection of short stories.

They make some very forceful points but they provide all the evidence needed to back them up.The chapter on Voter Fraud in particular is now quite timely. They point out that voter fraud is rampant throughout the U.S., but somehow the media rarely talks about it. Now everyone is shocked about the goings-on in the Presidential election in Florida, but if more people had acted on the findings in Dirty Little Secrets perhaps we'd have reformed things by now."},{"Title":"Dirty Little Secrets : The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics","review":"This book has an accurate title and inaccurate subtitle. It deals with dirty politics, not corruption. Innuendo that your opponent is a child molester is despicable and unethical, but it's not \\"corrupt.\\" Buying and selling votes is \\"corrupt.\\"Why do I insist on the distinction? It's important because it affects how we think about reforming the system. Reforms addressing the role of money in politics are different than reforms addressing sleazy campaigns.Though the authors wrongly mix corruption and dirty tricks throughout their book, their last chapter on reforms does a much better job distinguishing the two. It presents a pretty clear analysis of causes and effects, and the recommendations are pretty sensible.The book rests on a series of stories about candidates Jones or Smith behaving badly. It must be admitted that these candidates and their staffs do behave badly indeed. But how typical are these examples? The book has no evidence that they are widespread, other than the fact that their interviewees said, \\"Everybody does it.\\" Well, I am sure that not *everybody* does it, and even Sabato and Williams interviewed some people who don't do it. Any reformer might start with the honest politicians and think about how we can make more of them, rather than trying to make fewer dishonest politicians.Why do candidates and staffs engage in dirty tricks? Sabato and Williams say that these tricks help them win. Do they? Sabato and Williams have no evidence other than the beliefs of their interviewees.What does that tell us about our ethical heroes who refuse to engage in dirty tricks? Presumably, they do it because not doing dirty tricks help *them* win. Does ethical probity help a candidate win? Perhaps. Do the answers to these questions matter - - a lot - - for how we think about reforming the system? Almost certainly.As these comments suggest, I found much of the book unsatisfactory in analytical terms. However, it's built on a great litany of dirty tricks. Chapter after chapter tells stories about both corruption and dirty tricks, and it's a real eye-opener despite my objections above.Finally, the authors make much of the fact that the book is written by a journalist and a political scientist, presumably gaining from the strengths of each approach. However, the book reads like straight journalism, so it's not clear what, if anything, \\"political science\\" contributed. Not that there's anything wrong with that."},{"Title":"Dirty Little Secrets : The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics","review":"Dirty Little Secrets, Larry J. SabatoThe \`Foreword' notes that fewer people trust the national government than in 1964. Who has a problem with the fact that people are less naive and more politically aware? There is no mention of the Corporate Powers behind the stagnant wages and the decline in living standards (p.x). Are they asking people to forget the history of the past fifty years? Electoral politics is a struggle over control of the government, like a civil war without military actions. Dirty tricks work because the average voter doesn't know much about the candidates (pp.4-5). Opposition research is valid when it provides true information on candidates who have something to hide. Misleading statements are part of politics, as it is in advertising and newspaper reports. They are protected by the First Amendment and common sense, unless they break laws against libel or fraud (p.6).Was that Democratic candidate \\"exceptionally weak\\" or was it the corporate media's propaganda (p.14)? [George McGovern saw action in WW II, unlike his opponent.] Did the US Supreme Court create more corruption in 1976 (p.15)? [The Supreme Court supports corporate power since the early 19th century.] One problem in this book is its definition of corruption on page 18: the \\"abuse of power\\", which is not defined. Is he claiming that human choices are corrupt (p.19)? Is he making the rules as he goes along (p.20)? This 1996 book analyzes the 1994 election where Republicans won control of the House (not unusual for a change in mid-term elections). This book concentrated on Gingrich. [But in a few years his own party would dump his leadership, and Gingrich would never regain his powers. You can't fool all of the people all of the time.] Those five realignments on page 84 seem inexact. The true measure is the obsolescence of the losing political party: Federalist after 1814, Whigs before 1860. That hasn't happened since the rise of the Republican Party in 1860.There is no mention of the economic factors that affect elections. The 1920 census showed more people now lived in cities than in rural areas. Part II tells about \\"Bipartisan Corruption\\". Major parties research their opposition. [Don't businesses and governments do this?] Why do so many talented citizens refuse to run for public office (p.170)? Reading these chapters is tiresome for their many details and useless criticisms. Sabato criticized the franking privilege (around since 1775!). Charging Congress for postage would mean higher costs and taxes for this necessary information. [It is too important to be left to the corporate media.] Sabato's bias would let the corporate media control or censor their messages!Chapter 9 discusses \\"push polling\\", a method to spread lies, rumors, and innuendo about candidates. Such lies and rumors are part of everyday gossip. Just hang up the phone when this happens to you (p.246)! Sabato claims that vote fraud in increasing (Chapter 10). In a close election absentee ballots can make a difference (p.280). Chapter 11 offers reforms, but ignores corporate power and its control of national and state governments! \\"Corruption\\" is the activities that allow the rich to continue to rule over ordinary people and oppress them. Politicians abuse their power to stay in control and profit from their offices. One book is not going to change this! Can the corporate-controlled press become activists (p.309)? Suggestions by academics have faults (p.325). A little-read book will have no effect unless some great scandal erupts to create support doe changes. Then a law may be passed that really doesn't solve the problem."},{"Title":"Dirty Little Secrets : The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics","review":"I read this book about five years ago and am now reading it again. It's well-written, well-documented and as enjoyable the second time as it was the first. From vote fraud, to how they keep getting re-elected, it's all in this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fathers of the Fallen","review":"I was impressed with how well written this book is. Douglas Dean has written a fiction novel that contains quite a bit of truth in it. The spiritual abuse that is happening to the characters is a reflection of a growing trend in the church today. He somehow manages to expose the un-Biblical nature of the 'spiritual fatherhood' doctrine without making the book preachy or predictable. And while his money hungry Pastor ('spiritual father') is a cold-hearted man, he is not portrayed one-dimensionally. It's easy to believe there are men like him who can stand in the pulpit every Sunday with a Bible in their hand, but without the Word of God in their heart.He does a superb job in capturing the character's fear of rocking the religious boat that he's in. His Pastor's greed and control made me uncomfortable when I realized that this is something that's really happening in America today. I was surprised by some of the plot twists along the way, and satisfied by the suspenseful moments. It was exhilarating to see the difference between the 2 churches in the book, but terrifying to see the battle that both men faced. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in seeing truth prevail, bondage ended, and the wicked brought low.As a side note - if you have a friend or family member who is in a church that teaches cultic doctrine such as spiritual fatherhood, being a cursed Christian, prosperity only through tithing to the point of your own poverty, shunning those who leave for another church - then please give them a copy of this book. It might be just what they need to question their leaders and make room for God to lift the veil of spiritual blindness from their eyes."},{"Title":"You're Smarter Than You Look: Uncomplicating Relationships in Complicated Times","review":"It was a gift for a friend who loves anything by Judge Judy, and the price was right"},{"Title":"You're Smarter Than You Look: Uncomplicating Relationships in Complicated Times","review":"In her characteristic sarcastic wit and dry humor style, Judge Judy addresses some serious topics with this entertaining book.

Co-authors Jeff Welsch and George P. Edmonston Jr. have done a wonderful job of bringing to light some of the lesser-known moments in the OSU heritage, but they've also managed to make some of the more familiar legends (such as the fabled \\"Giant Killers\\" OSU football team of 1967) seem fresh.Another excellent aspect of the volume is that the authors have sought to portray the total spectrum of athletics over the past century-plus on the Corvallis campus. Even though the basketball and football programs have gained the most fame, there's also plenty in here about wrestling, baseball, women's sports, track and field, and more.As is always the case, the best sports stories are human stories. In this volume, you will become better acquainted with legendary coaches like Slats Gill, Dee Andros, Ralph Miller and Knute Rockne. (Yes, Rockne. Read the book and you will learn why Rockne was a member of OSU's summer faculty for three years). You will also get to know outstanding players and some very faithful fans.This book is an absolute must for Beaver fans, and should be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the history of college athletics.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Tales from Oregon State Sports","review":"If you're a Beaver sports fan, this is a great book to own. Great stories and information about various OSU sports events and occurrences that you may not know about. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Aircraft Carrier","review":"This book is essentially the author's diary of his service on the Yorktown from February 4 through April 30, 1945. This period ended only four months prior to the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945. The Yorktown was part of a task group assigned to take the war to the shores of Japan.This was a very dangerous time for the sailors on US warships as the Japanese had initiated kamikaze missions that proved to be extremely deadly.I was drawn to this book by a recommendation from an acquaintance who served in the Navy in WWII. He quoted a small part from this passage in the book. After reading it, I was hooked. Here is nearly all of the passage: \\"In the afternoon,the gunnery department worked out on a sleeve towed by a TBM. My God, how I hate those 5 inch guns! If I had the choice of standing on the bridge of a battleship during a 16-inch broadside, or on a carrier's bridge while the five-inchers were firing, I'd take the 16-inchers every time. Their concussion (16-inchers) is tremendous but it builds up. It's like being hit by a slow truck wrapped in soft cushions. The five-inchers, damn them, hit you like a plank.\\"...\\"when your're on flag bridge. There, when Number 2 mount trains abeam, the muzzles are only 25 feet away, and the blast jolts your teeth loose.\\"His straightforward capture of the daily life (and death) on the Yorktown was spellbinding for me. No one, other than those who were there, can truly tell a story like this was told....J Bryan III, does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Aircraft Carrier","review":"This is one of the most thrilling moments in a life time: to be in a operational aircrft carrier during a real war. This book make us live those moments, sharing the fear, the boredom and the fun experienced by the author. Easy reading, and makes you prone to read it again! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Life Is A Mirror","review":"This book is an aid for students of A COURSE IN MIRACLES and is authored by a person who was fortunate enough to have access to the \\"Foundation for A Course In Miracles\\" when it was still headquartered in Roscoe, New York (\\"FACIM\\" is a teaching organization for A COURSE IN MIRACLES, as well as the Course's copyright holder). In fact, the author notes that the inspiration for this book came from two classes she attended at the Foundation, as well as from two tape series by Kenneth Wapnick PhD, President of \\"Foundation for A Course In Miracles.\\" The two tape series are: CLIMBING THE LADDER HOME and SEPARATION AND FORGIVENESS: THE FOUR SPLITS AND THEIR UNDOING. The classes that influenced this book were: 1) a two week long class on the Course's view of death, and, 2) a two week long class about international relations and the Arab Israeli conflict, from the Course's perspective.But this book also includes the author's reflections on the works of Jung, Freud, the Dalai Lama, and Gloria Wapnick (faculty member of FACIM, as well as wife of Kenneth Wapnick). Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr, and Mahatma Gandhi are also mentioned. So, this book is very well-rounded and has a lot to say. I must comment that it is perhaps the first non-Wapnick book based on A COURSE IN MIRACLES that does not compromise the non-duality of Course theory. A COURSE IN MIRACLES teaches that this world is an illusion not made by God, but made by the ego as an attack *on* God. This is a teaching that is so terrifying for us that most who read A COURSE IN MIRACLES and who write books based on A COURSE IN MIRACLES seem not to take it into account. Often, people make the mistake of believing the Course is saying that only the \\"bad\\" things in the world are illusions and are \\"attacks on God.\\" No, the Course says the entire physical world - the very existance of a physical world - is an attack on God. Thankfully, Catherine Ricchetti understands this aspect of Course theory, and she integrates it into this book. This book is therefore a great surprise for the serious Course student, as many of us have become accustomed to seeing Course theory misinterpreted and taken out of context.On a personal note: I really enjoyed this book, and I like that it gave me a feeling of having been a part of \\"Foundation for A Course In Miracles\\" while it was still housed in Roscoe, New York (it is now located in Temecula, CA). In Roscoe the Foundation had a retreat center housed in a former hotel building, that was situated on 90 beautiful acres overlooking Tennanah Lake. It seemed idealic, and I had dreamed that one day I could attend classes there (they had the capability to allow students to stay in residence for up to a year). Unfortunately, I will never know the Roscoe facilities or be a part of the community they had there. But thanks to this book, I feel as though I can vicariously live through the author's good fortune in having known the Catskills location."},{"Title":"Life Is A Mirror","review":"A spiritual psychology expressed in terms a layman can understand. Bravo Ms. Ricchetti! In this book Ms. Ricchetti demonstrates how to use the &quot;other&quot; in our lives as a reflection of the thoughts in our minds. The book gives a clear path for getting out from under the thoughts of being a victim of people or circumstances. The reader is shown how to experience the relief and happiness that comes from releasing others and ourselves from guilt and fear.I especially liked Ms. Ricchetti's honesty as she uses examples from her own life to demonstrate that freedom from the bondage of fear, anger and guilt is absolutely possible.

I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a little religious and or self awareness."},{"Title":"Numerical Methods","review":"I had previously sat in on a Numerical Analysis class, and I have to say that this book was much better than the one that we were forced to use. The examples were clear, and the text focused much less on proofs and more on how to do problems and calculate their error. The sample programs on disk were also thorough, and included in several different languages (c, fortran, pascal, maple, mathematica, &amp; matlab)."},{"Title":"Numerical Methods","review":"In my never-ending quest for the best textbook for each of my courses, I examine a large number of math and computer books. The current book used in my numerical analysis class is \\"Elementary Numerical Analysis\\" by Atkinson and Han. My standard criterion for changing is that the new book must be significantly better than my current favorite. By significantly better, I mean that the cost to me when changing is more than offset by the advantages that the new book gives the students.While I consider this book on a par with the Atkinson book and maybe even a bit better, it doesn't quite cross the threshold. The coverage is what is ordinarily considered that of a one-semester course in numerical analysis, so in that regard it is still in the pack. A broad spectrum of exercises appears at the ends of the sections and solutions to the odd-numbered ones appear in an appendix.I consider this book to be slightly more readable than some of the others that I have seen. Maple is used as the symbolic mathematics package used to illustrate the examples and a CD containing the code used to generate the examples is included. This book is good enough to tempt me to make the switch but not good enough to make me do it."},{"Title":"Cults","review":"Wonderful overview of the history of cults around America. Cohen seeks to inform! His skeptal approach to the histeria and myths of cults is refreshing. He trys (I think sucessfully) to explain, &quot;what is a cult?&quot;, &quot;who joins a cult and why?&quot;. He discusses witchs, satanic cults, mind control and brainwashing. This book was written in easy to understand language, not a book for theologens but for the everyday person hoping to understand the history and psycholocy of cults."},{"Title":"Cults","review":"I liked the book. Although listed as &quot;young adult&quot; I found it to have sufficient substance to be satisfying fare...even though I am far from &quot;young&quot;.I was particularly fond of his treatment (OK, his opinions) of occult and witchcraft. Those two subjects make fantastic newpaper copy and the stories throw long shadows.I think the book would be much stronger with a slightly different organization. As a parent, I am particularly interested in &quot;cult-proofing&quot; my children. Unfortunately, that material is sprinkled over many chapters.I strongly encourage Mr. Cohen to develop a &quot;quick test&quot; that young adults can use as a litmus test when approached by possible Branch Davidians. The test (list) would not require absolute accuracy. The objective of the test is to separate wolves from sheep, not to identify sub-species of wolf."},{"Title":"Three Women","review":"This was a fascinating book, one that I have reread many times. In the three stories you can see the personal growth and writing ability of the author evolve. The first story deals with the WWII era and the heroine is a plucky, independent (but careful not to be too independent) young woman. The story reflects the situation of women of the time - marry and raise a family, no career. The second story, written I would guess in 70's, involves a woman with a career, who ends up with a guy who's going to be head of the family and major decision-maker with her as handy dandy, qualified helper-but-not-quite-equal partner. The 3rd story (written in late 70's or early 80's I would guess)is of a emotionally-abused wife, now divorced, with 2 teenagers, who goes to Ireland. She's more independent than the 1st two and becomes more independent still in Ireland but still able to make the story into a romantic novel (with a real plot I must add!). If you find it, buy it and send! ! me another copy too! Linda Zoldoske"},{"Title":"Three Women","review":"Three Women is three separate stories written by Anne McCaffrey quite a while ago. All three of the stories are markedly different, but all are very well written and quite engaging.Ring of Fear is about Nialla Dunn, a young woman who has been on the run ever since she found her horse-trainer father murdered and she was raped by her father's ex-employer. She has disguised her looks and stays on the move by traveling from horse show to horse show to compete. Her only friends are her two horses Orfeo and Phi Bete and her cat Dice. Falling in love with handsome, mysterious Rafe Clery is the last thing she has planned...The Mark of Merlin takes place during World War II and is the story of Carla and her big german shepherd, Merlin. James Carlylse \\"Carla\\" Murdock threw herself into her studies when she received the news of her father's death in combat. When she fell desperately ill, she was sent off to stay with her guardian, Major Laird, whom she had never met. Unfortunately, Major Laird had no idea that \\"James\\" was a girl. He also had no idea about how stubborn she was and how vengeful she would be when she discovered that her father was murdered in Europe...The Kilternan Legacy is the story of Irene \\"Rene\\" Teasey, a recent divorcee with two hilarious twins, Snow and Simon. Rene is ready for a change when she hears that she inherited some property from an unknown great aunt in Ireland. Little does Rene know that she is going to have a major battle on her hands as real estate agents, sleazy land developers and her own family battle it out for her new property. Rene feels that she can deal with this, but she cannot understand why her great aunt hated Shay Kerrigan because she is beginning to fall in love with him...Of the three stories, I enjoyed Ring of Fear the most and feel that this one is worth buying the book for. I also enjoyed the Kilternan Legacy, although there isn't really a lot of romance in that story, per se. I didn't care for The Mark of Merlin, but it was okay. All three stories are well written and have nicely developed characters and a clear plot. None of the stories are very long and they are all currently available in reprint editions, but you have to buy them separately, which gets to be pretty expensive. If you keep watch for a little while, you should be able to find a used copy of Three Women that isn't too expensive and this book is worth your time, especially if you have enjoyed any other McCaffrey books!"},{"Title":"Three Women","review":"I, like many, am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan. I've read almost every book she's ever written. Thinking this was a new book, I checked this out here on Amazon.com. Reading through the other reviews, I realized that this is an omnibus of three novels Anne has recently re-released.Ring of Fear is a mystery, romance, and horse story about a young woman in the horse show business. Various catastrophes throughout the book all link back to her father's murder, which changed her life forever. She meets up with Rafe Cleary, who helps her to deal with all her problems, and plenty more happens before the book is done.The Mark of Merlin is about a college student during WWII whose father (a colonel) was killed in questionable circumstances. Her father's will appoints Major Regan Laird her guardian, but Carla is eighteen years old and wonders why her father appointed the twenty-something and very aggravating Regan her guardian. Together with her dog Merlin, various army friends of her father's, and the Major, Carla has to puzzle out the mystery of her father's death and break a war-time crime ring.The Kilternan Legacy is the only one of the three I haven't read (yet), but from the various summaries I saw it's about a recently divorced woman who moves to Ireland and finds love.Anyway, you can find all of these novels separately on Amazon.com, so without having to go through the misery of finding a used copy of this, you can get everything that's included separately.

Marianna Csoti's, 'Contentious Issues - Discussion Stories for Young People,' offers a sturdy platform from which to begin. The book cleverly introduces fictional but true-to-life events that deal with topics such as ethnicity, racism, sexism and stereotypes.Aimed at 11-18 year olds, Csoti's book challenges young adults to discuss, debate and resolve complicated situations that a youngster has faced or might face as they progress towards adulthood. The adult heading the discussions acts as the 'leader' - the person that oversees discussions, keeps them on track and in general, offers several viewpoints for youngsters to comment upon. To assist him with this task, leader sheets are contained within the book that urge him to guide presenting neither answers nor agreeing/disagreeing with viewpoints tendered. Rather he is asked to offer alternatives or more challenging viewpoints.The book is separated into three sections. Section 1 accommodates 11-14 year olds; section 2 caters to 12-15 year olds and section 3 is aimed at the young adult - the16-18 year old. The stories contained within each section are read aloud to the group in question setting the scene and topic for discussion. Quite often the stories progress in a given order utilizing the same characters within the stories and promoting the book's effectiveness. As the characters involved become familiar and the consequences of certain actions are brought into play, the issues at hand can be yet further explored.While the early section of the book deals with viewpoints for discussion, section 2 contains one story that includes role-playing. 'I'm a Person Too,' tackles the issue of teenage and parental rights and suggests that two people, one who takes the role of the mother and one who takes the role of a teenage girl, read the story in question. This one story can effectively bring the situation to life for many youngsters while section 3 differs again by offering hands-on tasks that allow young adults to be the decision makers, and to individualize problems for themselves.This comprehensive book incorporates many situations and instances related to the every day life of a youth. It would prove a valuable resource for professionals, including councilors and teachers that work with young adults on society related issues. Although the book works best in a group environment, parents could easily adapt its contents for one-on-one discussion.The book concludes with a selection of useful contacts that pertain to the issues contained within. While these contacts are all based within the UK, many have website addresses that could prove valuable as a starting point for further help and assistance.Marianna Costi's book is effective. It is effective because it doesn't judge and we can reach a young adult without criticism and without imposing our views. Too often we dictate, too often we decide the viewpoints for our children and too often we force morality on them without explaining why. Again, this book is effective. Why? Because it gives young adults the greatest gift of all - it allows them their own point of view."},{"Title":"Jesus in the Gospels","review":"Dr. Sweeley has been able to introduce both the lay reader and the student of scripture to the historical Jesus.

I identified with Joey's fanatical behavior when his funding source pulled his grant, but the events that unfloded afterward could have only happened in NYC. Nersesian's quick wit and dark satire weave a fantastic story about what can happen when we try too hard to believe everything we think we see. Without question, I recommend this book as a welcome relief from the familiar ennui of graduate studies."},{"Title":"Manhattan Loverboy","review":"Neresian has the talent to create tales which are easy to swallow in a few sittings but are surprisingly loaded with character depth and strange twists and turns. This novel, like his previous works, does the same: by taking an under achiever-below avegerage character and putting them into extraordinary circumstances. It's very hard to even explore these stories without giving away some of the plot devices which make them so addictive."},{"Title":"Manhattan Loverboy","review":"Nersesian's narrator Joey Aeiou embodies the perfect paranoia found only in Manhattan, where overcrowding, vanity, and extreme economic imbalalance breed fear and grandiosity on a large scale.

Plan to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Manhattan Loverboy","review":"With great imaginative wit and flair, Nersessian draws us into a life that feels both surreal and yet quotidian, with its unhappy accidents, its cruelties and its expansive beauty.

The reader will quickly find him/herself laughing at the utter insanity of this story's events. The best part about this is that you'll never want to put it down. However, while the narrator/main character can be easily likable for some, he can be just as easily loathesome for others. Either way, everyone will get a good laugh. While some may find Manhattan Loverboy to be simply entertaining though, I find it to be a little bit more. The conflict of this tale is both hilarious as well as mysterious; it is left up to the reader to choose which or welcome both. Arthur Nersesian is definitely an excellent writer who picks at the foibles of us all; pick this one up and enjoy a good read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Loverboy","review":"arthur nersesian's manhattan loverboy is a quick, intoxicating read, shows you how messed up people can be, and digs into the roots of human nature on an evil spree.

I bought it based purely on the five-star reviews here on amazon. Coming to the last page was the one pleasure this work of fiction delivered.The main character, Joseph Aeiou, was so depraved and disgusting I could barely keep going. My negative opinion of this book solidified somewhere around page 30 where Joseph is found sitting in his filthy living room with his pants down eating a brick of cream cheese.This novel was like a joke that is supposed to be funny but just doesn't work. Or it was sad but I disliked the main character so much i just didn't care what kind of problems he submerged himself in."},{"Title":"Manhattan Loverboy","review":"I really don't know how this book got a five star rating.

There is nothing out there quite like it, and would easily garner 5 stars from me simply for having such a variety of listings and ratings if it were fully up-to-date with their reviews (www.tastings.com). You will find that your tastes likely diverge from their ratings, but they do offer some excellent advice nonetheless. They rate the drinks on a 100 point scale, and anything above about 85 will likley be a good choice for sampling or buying.Having said that, you should keep in mind that in the liquor world, things are always changing, new brands or bottlings are being introduced or discontinued, formulas are being altered, prices fluctuate (usually upwards in the realm of premium spirits!) and indeed the taste of the reviewers are changing as well. If you look at the societies website, you will see with their latest up-to-date ratings, some spirits have risen and others fallen. In some cases, if they were to update the book with a new edition, the ratings lists would look very different. The example of American Bourbons show almost all of the above 90 spirits have fallen to high 80's and low 90's on the website - which appears to me to be mostly the addition of a bunch of new high quality entries requiring a re-scaling rather than indications of a fall in quality.Still, this is an excellent starting point, and a good example of what should br a periodic publication from the BTI!"},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"Henry Bettenson and Chris Maunder have done a great job of collecting some of the most important documents of the Christian religion from the beginning until today. Almost every major controversy in the universal Church is represented by a document or two. For instance, Arianism, Montanism, Sabellianism, etc, are all covered. Sometimes the writings of the heretics are thrown in for a more balanced perspective. As the authors move past the Reformation, the book becomes less useful. Since there are so many documents from various denominations, it becomes impossible to fit all of them in one small book. The Church of England is heavily represented, as are other religious movements in England. The documents of the Roman Catholic Church are represented, including documents of Trent and Vatican II. Luther's entire \`95 Theses' are included. Some of the modern documents relate to issues of women's ordination, black theology, social justice, homosexuality, ecumenical relations, and AIDS. These are useful because they give documents from our own time.Overall this is a good collection. However, for every document included, there were 20 more that could have been added. This is just the nature of the book. The editors did a great job of choosing relevant documents. So it's a good collection that will scratch the surface, acting as an introduction, but is by no means the only book someone studying Christian thought in-depth would need. However, the book provides original texts, which many people rarely get to read, so that is quite a treat. While the book is small, the print is tiny, so they manage to squeeze in a lot of material in 461 pages! As a collection of primary texts, this is one of the best introductions to the thought of the Church from its birth until today."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"If you want to know more about the history of the church, and you want to read the original documents, this is the book. This book will take you deeper into doctrine origination and debate throughout the history of the church. There are many typed of documents represented from Augustine to more modern documents on Jesuits. I appreciate the fact they do some limited notes for you to help you understand dates, but otherwise leave you to figure out for yourself what these documents mean, and if they are valid or not. It leaves it up to you, not someone telling you what they think. Good compilation &amp; scholarship.Joseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"There are several ways that one may study history. Firstly, one may read secondary sources: books about a particular period or event. Secondly, one may buy volumes of primary sources, using copious amounts of time to painstakingly go through each volume. Thirdly, one may read a one-volume collection of texts that are considered to represent the major trends in the historical period they represent. This book falls into the third category.Documents of the Christian Church is wonderfully organized: thematically by historical period. Hence, one reads the early Christian apologists of the 2nd century and then immediately after that one reads of the theologies of martyrdom; one reads of the disputes over the incarnation of Christ before one reads about debates over tansubstantiation; one reads Vatican II documents before one reads liberation theologies. The writings of saints and heretics, Doctors and others, popes, councils and relevant non-Christian writers all appear between the covers of this book.Of course, it ought to be noted that the excerpts are sometimes tremendously short - only a few lines or so. However, each reference is cited so that the curious reader who wants to go and read volumes of primary texts can do so; for those less inclined to do so, this book is an excellent first-hand introduction to the development/s of Christian thought.However, the documents are largely confined to the Western church. The documentary history of the Eastern churches is largely absent for almost 1000 years: between 1054 (the Great Schism between the Eastern and the Western church) and the beginning of the ecumenical movement in the 20th century. So, if the reader wants to learn about the Palamite controversy or the Hesychast revival or the monastic influence of the Russian Orthodox monks, one will have to look elsewhere (although, I confess, I do not know where).Nonetheless, this is an excellent compilation. The reader will learn plenty about recent theological developments, including various perspectives on sexuality, sex and gender, social work, feminist theology and liberation theology. How many of these more recent theological movements and trends will prove to be of long-lasting import remains to be seen, but since they are relevant now, it is important for the reader to be somewhat familiar with them.All things considered, this is a wonderful collection."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"You'll be amazed at how much is provided in just over 450 pages. A vast amount of the essential writings of Western Christianity are collected here: early church fathers, heretics, synods, councils, popes, eucharistic treatises, various dogmas, monastic rites, scholasticism, reformers, etc. As I noted, this is largely focused on Western Christianity with little on Eastern Orthodoxy...which is good because if Eastern Orthodoxy were included, then much material would have to be sacrificed. Bettenson was the Bishop of London, which explains the great amount of Anglican writings included; however, Catholics and Protestants (mainly Lutherans, Calvinists, Baptists, and Methodists) are well covered. The 3rd edition includes contemporary issues such as ecumenism, feminist theology, liberation theology, and contraception. Even though feminist theology has become largely irrelevant and liberation theology has proven useless, they are still important to understand as products (relics?) of the 20th century, although feminist theology will surely become even more radicalized and continue in a cultish fashion among the academic \\"elite.\\"All in all, this is an essential reference book of primary sources for those studying the history of Christian doctrines. This, of course, should be supplemented with secondary sources such as Robert Louis Wilken (Roman Catholic), Jaroslav Pelikan (Greek Orthodox), and Henry Chadwick (Anglican)...the big three of early church studies."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics.

There is information in this book you don't even know that you are missing, so look at it this way: church histories are necessary and very important, but wouldn't you like to read the same documents the historians are reading, and draw your own conclusions? An essential tool for professors, students, pastors, and educated Westerners of all stripes."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"Good collection of the most important writings from Church history. Although it is not intended to give a statement of every denominational affiliation, it is an excellent resource for those interested in primary source documents."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics. Galaxy edition)","review":"This is one of those standard books that ministers, historians, theologians, seminarians and graduate students in any number of disciplines related to the above should have as part of their libraries. The book's task is an ambitious one - to bring together in one volume the key documents of the church through two thousand years of history.This book is not a simple collection of documents, but rather arranges them thematically and chronologically. Bettenson in the early editions put together the documents with an overarching essay in each section which helps set the context, the controversies, the personalities and the impact of the primary documents. Bettenson was prepared early for the charge of selectivity, as every enterprise of this sort must needs be selective. 'It is unlikely that any two persons could be found who should agree on what should be included in such a book and what omitted; nor would agreement more easily be found on the arrangement to be imposed on the material once selected.'The first section deals with the early church up to the Fourth Ecumenical Council, setting definitions and key terms from which much of later Christianity either derives or rebels. During this period, there were also persecutions of the church and differing levels of tolerance and acceptance of Christians in parts of the empire. The one downside of this section is that it doesn't include pieces from traditions that vary from what became normative Christianity. It does include in some good detail the workings of church and state from the different philosophical and practical writings of the times.The second major section is on Creeds; chronologically, this begins back in the period covered by the first section, but thematically presents itself well as a whole unit. The third section includes a few early references to gospel texts. Beginning with the fourth section and proceeding through to the tenth section, documents are arranged dealing with doctrinal issues arising from the early documents - Christology, Ecclesiology, the Nature of Humanity, the Nature of Sin - all of the major themes found in systematic theology are here present. Bettenson ends this part with a collection of Christian inscriptions.The second major part traces Christian documentary history from the Chalcedon council to the present in essentially chronological order - the East/West split, the Holy Roman Empire, Monastic developments, the Concilliar Movement, Scholasticism, and the many elements of the Reformation (most of which get their own section, but there is a decided advantage to the English history). Some documents are decided obscure (the Bonn Agreement between Old Catholic and Anglican churches in 1931, and the Jansenist 'Five Propositions' being a few examples), whereas others are well-known (Luther's Ninety-Five Theses). The final sections of the later editions have expanded to include documentary examples of peace and justice forms of theological development - Feminist theology and women's ordination, Black theology, Liberation theology. It also includes various pieces on interfaith dialogue and relationship efforts of the past generation. These later sections are primarily the work of Chris Maunder, co-editor of the publication in its later editions.This is an important collection to have handy. Quite often, histories, commentaries and theological works will reference these documents, but not print them in their entirety (or sometimes not even in part) on the assumption that such documents can be readily found elsewhere - an assumption that is true enough, but it is helpful for the student to actually have the book!That this book has been through many editions speaks to its ongoing value and importance."},{"Title":"Documents of the Christian church (World's classics.

Also, the use of primary sources, which is a hallmark of the classical school movement, allows you to examine the actual words of a document rather than having it filtered through someone else's point of view. I realize not every document could be included, but I was disappointed that Urban II's speech calling for the Crusades was not included as it has relevance to world politics today. Also, some longer works, such as The Rule of St. Benedict, have been ellipted so one must still look elsewhere to get the complete work.

Why was there not room for both?Also, a great deal of attention is given to 20th Century documents, but nowhere do I see &quot;The Fundamentals,&quot; which is, after all, the basis of Fundamentalism.

Most are notably less than satisfactory. In my opinion, Babitsky and Mangraviti have tackled one of the most difficult aspects about being an \\"expert,\\" that of writing a defensible report. The messages in their treatise are quite clear. \\"Don't commit something to paper unless you can support it with documentation!\\" \\"Write the report when you feel you fully understand the issue and not when the attorney says you are ready!\\" And perhaps more important, \\"Leave the adverbs and adjectives for your next novel!\\"I found their writing style somewhat pendantic and their cross-examination illustrations somewhat contrived. And I was disappointed that more than a-third (actually 36%) of the book was \\"model reports,\\" or, if you wish, case studies. The authors do not provide the reader with a copy or even a synopsis of \\"Standard Practice for Reporting Opinions of Technical Experts,\\" although said practice is cited twice in the book (pg. 241, pg. 248). Although a large number of examples are medical issues, this probably mirrors real life. I found one major area that is not covered - that of expert opinion on patent issues.Probably the two scariest aspects for any expert today are known as the \\"Markman\\" and the \\"Daubert.\\" The first renders the expert interpretation of less value than that of common, everyday usage. Babitsky and Mangraviti do not address \\"Markman.\\" They do address \\"Daubert\\" however. And correctly put the \\"fear of God\\" in every expert's heart on this issue.

This fits the bill. A lot of the material seems obvious to me, but I write professionally, and somebody for whom grinding out a report at work is hard would be well advised to take Mr. Babitsky's advice about getting a proofreader. The chapter on formatting is well worth the price of the book: I was muddling along trying to just state the facts and conclusions in an orderly way, but Mr. Babitsky's outline makes the product easier both to read and to defend in court.There are many examples drawn from actual court cases, and a clear review of statutes for federal cases that must be known if you will be producing reports for one of them.I plan to keep this book on the shelf and refer to it almost every time I review a case. While my perspective is that of a medical doctor, the principles are applicable to other specialties as well."},{"Title":"Writing and Defending Your Expert Report: The Step-by-Step Guide with Models","review":"This is another great book that is offered by SEAK. They produce many reference books in this area of expertise. I own most of the books they offer and find them all to be beneficial."},{"Title":"Writing and Defending Your Expert Report: The Step-by-Step Guide with Models","review":"I never give a product a top rating. Too many unknowns only a month or two after the purchase. I have several other books from this author and all of them are slanted to some extent towards the needs of medical doctors. This observation is strictly selfish on my part since I am not a doctor. I have also found this tendency in the one seminar of theirs that I attended. The book contains model expert reports but none of them involve my area of expertise. Perhaps they could put out a book or some type of publication that contains a much larger number of model reports. Since I have not read the entire book I cannot tell if this will be a problem or not. So far I don't believe it will be. I have gone over the table of contents thoroughly and have read portions of each section and I believe the book will be an asset when the time comes for me to write my first report. I am in the process of reading the entire book. From a report organization standpoint I believe it will be priceless; but only time and experience will tell. Unless you are a professional writer I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Writing and Defending Your Expert Report: The Step-by-Step Guide with Models","review":"Writing an expert report is different. It's not creative writing, or technical writing, or a thesis, or a novel. Expert reports stand uniquely alone due to the legal context, and the report makes or breaks the expert. This book guides the expert on what to do, what not to do, what to watch out for, and the need for extreme attention to detail. Whether you're about to write your 1st expert report or your 101st, this text is invaluable."},{"Title":"Kaplan SAT Score-Raising Dictionary","review":"SAT Dictionary.This is the easiest and most efficient way to learn vocabulary words on the New SAT. Its way better to learn the vocabulary words than those enormous phonebook-sized SAT preps. I carried the Dictionary in my pocket almost all the time. When ever I had my spare moments, I flipped a page and Bam! (I'm learning new words.) Flashcards do not have the time-saving ability that this versatile SAT Dictionary offers. Furthermore, the characters depicted in the book are very intriguing. My favorite characters are Josh and Timmy. The sentences involving them made me laugh a few times and helped me retain words through laughter. Paul is pretty cool too. You'll meet them once you buy the book :).In addition, I took the January 28th SAT test. In the 19 sentence completions of the test, I saw many vocabulary words that were on the Dictionary.For example: prosaic, ambivalence,tenacious,voracious, facile, and vociferous to name a few. The rest of the vocabulary words which I saw were also on the Dictionary but I could not retain their full meaning because I (procrastinated) and failed to remember a high percentage of words.Don't procrastinate! If you have at least 3 months until the test. As an experienced SAT taker, my word of advice is: study NOW. Sacrifice video games,TV,Chess,Runescape and all your time-consuming activities for the SAT. Because those months will go flying, time will go so fast that you won't even realize that have you a few weeks left.Also remember: if you have achieved to learn all or at least a high percentage of these 1,000 most frequently tested SAT words. Give yourself 200+ on the Critical Reading Section. The 19 sentence completions are about 200-260 points."},{"Title":"Kaplan SAT Score-Raising Dictionary","review":"Probably the primary reason that something is easy to learn is because it's interesting.

My daughter really likes using it for her weekly (homeschooled) vocabulary lessons."},{"Title":"Kaplan SAT Score-Raising Dictionary","review":"There is an example sentence for each of the vocabulary words. It appears that the authors wanted the content of the sentences to be \\"cool\\" in order to appeal to teenagers. Unfortunately, many of these sentences have just the opposite effect. In addition, they are often clumsy uses of the actual vocabulary words. Here are some examples from the first few pages of the book (for the words accord, adorned, aesthetic, alacrity, and assiduous):\\"The bully told Timmy to give him his lunch money or he'd accord him a supersonic wedgie.\\"\\"Derek adorned the walls of his room with posters of hot girls in bikinis, despite his mother's objections.\\"\\"Chantalle's mom tried to convince Chantalle that the brown paisley shirt she'd bought was aesthetic, but Chantalle thought the print was totally outdated.\\"\\"Shanna's sister agreed with alacrity to cover Shanna after curfew, because Shanna said she'd pay her twenty bucks to do so.\\"\\"Timmy was so assiduous about looking good for his date that he applied zit cream five times a day until the big event.\\""},{"Title":"Kaplan SAT Score-Raising Dictionary","review":"I bought this for my daughter and what I found in it is that it is just a bunch of random words, their meanings and an example sentence. I dont see how this is fun. There are no mnemonics or roots or origins or anything. It is just a glorified filtered dictionary with only the good words. If that is what you are looking for, then this is fine. I was looking for something where my daughter can get hooked on to because it doesnt feel like she is having to memorize these words but still learns them through other fun activity. During the SAT preparation, there are other more fun ways to learn, but if you run out of those and you got down to learning the remaining words, then this may help you.

Boreham's Heavenly Octave on my shelf for years and never read it. After reading The Luggage of Life I have pulled it from the shelf and am now half way through it. Shame on me!There are many things I like about Boreham's writing but what I like most is how he takes everyday situations and expressions and re-casts them in a new and fresh light. He extracts deep spiritual meaning from the simple things of life and is able to create in the reader's mind a world that is alive with messages from our heavenly Father. Part One chapter one,The Luggage of Life, had me hooked and there was no stopping after that.For me it really set the tone for everything that followed. I found myself saying,\\"Why didn't I see that?\\" The length of the chapters made it convenient to lay the book down and come back to it without the need for a review.It has pushed me in the direction of looking more closely at everyday things and then looking again to see what is beyond the obvious.You can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"The Luggage of Life","review":"I really like how this book takes some of the hard things do life and shows how God uses them to define and shape us."},{"Title":"The Luggage of Life","review":"F.

He was one of the last students to pass through Spurgeon's ministerial school and was a missionary to Australia. You will not be disappointed with Boreham.

Yet the poems are hardly (merely) historical. Hill uses Offa as a name to conjure with, and goes off in several directions, including reminisces of his own childhood, explorations of the nature of worldly power, and the history of the British Midlands. The language is so creative, the diction so startling at times, and the poetry so real and immediate, that few will be untouched. Although Hill remains obscure today (this will change in time), Mercian Hymns has received much critical acclaim from scholars and poets.No other poet can meld sounds like Hill, or make obscure words new again. No other poet in the 20th century has given so much to the English language. This is one of his masterpieces, and a masterpiece of English poetry -- read, enjoy, learn."},{"Title":"The Trotsky Reappraisal","review":"This is not a book for the Russian history novice. If the names Rykov and Preobrazhensky mean nothing to you, then put this one back on the shelf. Every essay in this collection assumes that the reader already has an intimate knowledge of the Bolshevik Revolution - which makes sense, since all of the essays were originally presented at an academic Trotsky symposium in 1990.The essays themselves range from the provocative (e.g., George Klines &quot;The Defence of Terrorism&quot;) to the pointless (Richard Day's comparison of Trotsky's and Hegel's views to that of somebody named Habermas; only an academic who hasn't stepped foot out of his musty office in decades could care). There are some well-known heavyweights here like Richard Daniels, and several Russian, Italian, and German scholars largely unknown the American laity. Topics include Trotsky's relations, his famous train, his alienation from the Bolshevik party, his views on culture, revolution, and just about everything in between.If you're looking to find out just who this Trotsky guy was, you should turn to the classic three-volume biography by Isaac Deutscher. Fifty years after it was written, nobody has been able to match it. It truly ranks as one of the greatest biographies of all time, for its style, scope, and subject. After you've had your fill of Deutscher, pick up the Trotsky Reappraisal as an after-dinner aperitif."},{"Title":"Handbook for the First Year Teacher: A Comprehensive Guide to Survival","review":"It doesn't matter where you teach or what population student you work with: Hughes and Vlahos write a humorous yet applicable resource from which beginning (and even experienced!) teachers from all areas can learn from and relate to.

Sorry Maria and Heidi; all schools are NOT the same, all teachers are not the same, and your cookie-cutter solutions won't work most of the time or in most places.

The authors' use of humor while sharing their experiences really creates a down-to-earth, user friendly book. Their advice is real. They call it like it is. The book is organized sequentially by events that occur during the school year so it is easy to reference as needs arise. However, unlike other new teacher books, this one is actually a fun read -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about a text/teacher book!

However, I was disappointed to find that it sometimes glossed over important details, such as suggestions for wording invitations to a second wedding, and a list of suggested floral pieces, saying &quot;You already know this&quot;. For some of us, it has been quite some time since the frantic flurry of first-time wedding planning, so we do NOT remember this. Also lists a lot of quotes and commercial sources from businesses, which seemed a bit odd.

What happens if the groom is getting married for the first time and he wants the big wedding with all the trimming?

How can she see this other than experiencing it first hand? Losing a good friend is not easy, and reading this put a warm quilt blanket around my shoulders and said,- yes, it's alright and this is how it is.

When Ruth was diagnosed with breast cancer, Annie learns the meaning of love and letting go while Ruth handles her dying with grace and humor.This is a book I would definitely recommend for friends to give to one another. Elizabeth Berg knows how to write about women ~~ how they talk, eat, live and gossip among themselves. This is a treasure about friendship. Men don't understand the connection women feel for one another ~~ how we need to laugh and cry during life's most stormiest times, and how we need our friends' love and friendship as well. Berg does a wonderful job drawing the readers into the private lives of the characters ~~ and you don't feel that you are standing on the outside either. You're drawn to Annie because of her nurturing, caretaker nature, and you're drawn to Ruth like a moth to a flame ~~ full of life and laughter.If you haven't read this book yet, I would suggest you do so soon. Breast cancer is still the number one killer among women and though this book doesn't really talk about cancer itself, it does talk about love, friendship, survival and death. It is a book to treasure ~~ to pass on between friends, mothers and daughters."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews, I must wonder if the reviewers have ever lost a close friend to cancer. I lost a close friend two years ago to breast cancer. She was 43. This book, which I read about the time Sally, and another friend, were diagnosed help me so much during the time I, and other friends rallied around to support and help her.What helped me the most about this book was the different reactions and ways that the different friends wanted, and could, help. Not everyone who cared for Sally could do the same thing, but we all loved her, and wanted to help her. We all had varied opinions of her progress, prognosis, what she should and shouldn't do about her family, etc. This book help me to realize that it is okay for people to feel differently about supporting and caring for a sick friend.I suggested this book to many of my friends who were affected by Sally's illness. I gently mentioned several times during our discussions about Sally (we still have Sally get togethers to talk about her)that it is okay to feel differently about the things Sally, and we, were going through. That no one person was right or wrong, and that we all have the right to our ideas about how to deal with this devastating issue.I am thankful to Elizabeth Berg for writing a moving story of friends dealing with a good friend's illness and death. I appreciate that some of the characters were not likable because, truly, that is the reality of humans. And, as her book shows us, sometimes we are unlikable because we are hurting, and in emotional or physical pain.Just like Ann's family, my family too lost my care and attention at times. My times with Sally were sacred to me, and I changed my schedule to suit hers. But, this sacrifice is a real one many of us would make, and our own families can cope just fine."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"From the diagnosis, to the denial, to the intimidating medical lingo, to the fear and unknown of dying, &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; is one of the most realistic pieces of fiction that I have ever read.Beautiful, glowing, take-no-prisoners Ruth lives to the fullest. And then the unthinkable -- breast cancer, surgery, chemo and the exhausting fight to survive, a war waged not only by Ruth, but by her friends, Ann, Sarah, L.D., and Helen. Told through Ann, we see Ruth slowly deteriorate as the cancer spreads and she must face death head-on. This is a soul searching book that asks questions we would all benefit from considering. The questions go beyond the theological into the realm of self-examination. How have I lived? What would I do differently? How do I want to die? Am I living every moment? Ruth's pain is well expressed, but so is the pain borne by her friends. We see the agony and denial, the reality and the fear that the four women who love Ruth the most must endure as they try to support and ease Ruth in her final days.This book is not just a depressing look at a painful death. It is a celebration of a beautiful woman who enjoyed life and squeezed what she could from it to the very end. It's also about the legacy and the spirit we leave behind. I confess I cried, something only two other books have been able to cause.Very well done!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Ann is slowly watching her best friend Ruth face the most harrowing days of her all to shortened life. Ruth has been diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to her lungs and has only a few weeks to live as the book opens.The dialogue between the women is intuitive, intense and succinct like only Berg can write. Her portrayal of the oncoming death and the friends that sit in wait with utter dismay, grabbing at every glimmer of hope, is moving beyond words.I really don't believe this author is capable of writing a bad book. You can't go wrong with any of her titles. ...END"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I have read many of Elizabeth Berg's books but I must say that this one by far is the best. This is the love story between two women, not as lovers, but as friends sharing a special bond that only two women could have with each other. Ruth,one of the two main characters has been diagnosed with and is dying from breast cancer. Ann is her supportive, loving best friend. Berg writes in such a manner that the reader feels like she is in Ruth's house with Ruth and Ann, part of their exclusive friendship. The reader can imagine being on the jaunts with Ruth and Ann that they reflect upon throughout much of the story. Supporting characters are well-developed and integrated into the story in a believable manner. L.D. the somewhat &quot;butch&quot; friend has a strong, outgoing personality and says what's on her mind, but we are treated to the soft side of her soul when she rocks Ruth on her lap in a rocking chair because Ruth is too weak to sit up alone. Sarah, Ruth's boss is a sweetly feminine friend who is woven into the story probably to contrast with L.D, but who nevertheless holds her own as a supporting character. Finally, there is Ann. Who wouldn't want a friend like her? Though at times she seems a bit like a martyr, giving up time with her family (her young daughter Meggie and her husband Joe)to be with Ruth, Ann becomes a hero and the best friend we all yearn to have. The reader feels Ann's anguish over losing her best friend, her soulmate. This novel was so touching that I thought about it all day after I finished it. Elizabeth Berg writes from a very sensitive, caring, understanding viewpoint about a subject that usually we don't want to discuss. Berg allows us to feel and think what it must be like to know your days are numbered."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Truly wonderful short novel about two best friends, one of whom is dying of breast cancer and is near the end of her life when the story begins. This is a look not only at what it's like for the patient, but at how hard it is for someone to watch a loved one leave this world -- and not be able to do ANYTHING to stop it. All the feelings are here -- the guilt, the fear, the frustration, and the sorrow -- and they are so eloquently described that by the end of the book, you will be exhausted. As exhausted as the characters themselves. And this is what made me love this book so much -- it's so sad, it's so hard to read, but when was the last time a book moved me like this?Berg says in the foreward that this book is actually based on her own experience as a friend watching a friend die from breast cancer and I believe it. Only someone who'd really been through it could make the rest of us feel like we had too. But this book isn't all about death and sorrow -- it's also about how bright someone's light can be, even in the face of extraordinary darkness. This book made me laugh out loud. And then it made me cry myself to sleep. How wonderful is that? Answer: darn wonderful."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I heard about this book from a friend who belonged to a book club whose members were all Hospice nurses. After reading it, I recommended it to all my friends. I've since read all of Elizabeth Berg's books, but this one is still my favorite. The characters and their reactions to a terminal illness are so real. This is one book you don't want to end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about women, their friendships, and how they cope with loss and change."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Ann's best friend Ruth is dying of cancer. First it was found in her breast, then her lungs, then her bones and her brain. This brave story is about the courage of friends and how to assist someone you love, prepare to leave you.Ruth gathers her friends about her, friends that leap off the page with their emotions and coping levels. I admired these women for their courage, for their ability to say the words that need to be said, to be able to drive their friend to cemetaries to pick the right one, without falling apart.This book is beautifully written, so tender it had me in tears for so many of the pages, and for a long time after. Little innocent things like Ann looking at her daughter's shoes and realising that Ruth had helped pick them out with her, and she wouldn't be able to do that anymore. How huge the car felt after she dropped Ruth off at the airport.A truly beautiful book about girl friends, how they support each other and how they can be jealous of each other. I recommend also reading &quot;The Saving Graces&quot; by Patrical Gaffney, and &quot;What Girls Learn&quot; by Karin Cook, which are both very memorable also."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The problem some are going to have with this book is the fact that they'll forget it's actually fiction. Berg's prose is so clear and real that this book is unnerving, but in a good way. I've read where other reviews have called this &quot;gripping&quot; and that's certainly the case. If you have to read any book this year, please make it this one. I would also recommend another great read, though it's totally different from this (why would you want to read the same thing in a row?). It's called &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and it's very shocking and funny. Guaranteed to be like nothing else you've come across. Also try &quot;The Art of Mending.&quot;"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"A friend presented me with the audio version after the death of a very dear friend from cancer. I experienced all of these feelings while assisting in her care. We shared some funny times and hard times. The lobster dinner reminded me so much of a meal I prepared for her. Many times I would prepare several different things because I never knew what she could or would eat. Often times she asked &quot;who in the hell is going to eat all this food?&quot; I cried and laughed all the way through the tape. Now I want to get the unabridged version of the book and/or tape to read and/or hear again. It is a wonderful story. Also, her range of friends reminded me of the different types of close friends that my friend had. And, yes, I even experienced a little bit of jealousy for a time, because I considered her my best friend and she often told me I was her best friend."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I liked this book. It's poignant about a scary subject, and insightful in the importance of female friends."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This was a very quick, however, moving read from Elizabeth Berg. While I have been fortunate enough to not have experienced a death of a loved one from cancer, I feel that Berg did a wonderful job of portraying a very deep and meaningful friendship between Ann and Ruth. Berg truly has a gift for tapping into human emotions, and her eye for detail is amazing. My one gripe was the very stereotypical character of L.D., a sarcastic, rough lesbian with unshaved legs. It's a character that has been written so many times over, and Berg's imagination seems to have been lacking in that respect. However, I'd definitely recommend this as a heartfelt novel."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This is a very good book dealing w/a woman dying of breast cancer and a very dear friendship that must travel down this sad path.I highly recommend it as it is a well written book; the storyline is well done and it is not cheesey etc. but very touching and uplifting."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This was a wonderfully heartbreaking story about female friends dealing with cancer. It made me sob but I loved it. Don't buy it for a long plane journey though - I read mine in the first 3 hours of a 10 hour stint, couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Elizabeth Berg is my favorite author, and this is my favorite book by her. She has written a love story so tender that I find myself weeping every time I read it. It is the story of friendship and mutual support among a group of friends as one of them is facing death. It is a story of courage, laughter, profound empathy, and faith, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever had or needed or will need that kind of loving friendships."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"In \`Talk Before Sleep' Elizabeth Berg displays the dynamics of the female friendship in such a moving and realistic way that this could be a true story, only it's not. Berg explains that she wrote the story to help sort out her experiences during her own friend's death, and this connection between herself and her characters keeps them real and alive. You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple. Though she toys with the idea of \`curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to. But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home. While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of. While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book. One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters. Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"As the book opens, Ann prepares to leave for the home of her best friend, Ruth, who has breast cancer. By the time the book begins, Ruth has already been through treatment and there is nothing more that the doctors can do for her, but through flashbacks, we discover not only the story of Ruth's diagnosis but also the development of Ann and Ruth's amazing friendship. The story is told from Ann's perspective, but the book also features several of Ruth's other friends, which gives the reader a window into how a group of diverse women might react to a friend's illness: Ann, confused by unfailingly loyal and supportive; LD., the tough one who refuses to believe that Ruth's situation is hopeless; Sarah, the practical one who takes flack from the others; and Helen, Ruth's childhood friend. The characters are very real, and the various aspects of the story ring true, from Ruth's confusion over her marriage to the reactions of Ann's school-age daughter. An enjoyable book about love, loss, and--most importantly--women's friendships."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Do you have an author that you continually go back to, like an old friend or comfort food...somebody who makes you feel good, even when the subject matter is about divorce, dying, or sickness.For me, that author is Elizabeth Berg.\\"Talk Before Sleep\\" is about girlfriends loving one another, even when the situation is intolerable, unbearable, unspeakable.Ruth is diagnosed w/cancer and her friends gather around her like lionesses protecting their cub...comforting her, laughing with her, feeding her chocolate.Berg writes as if she is sitting across the table from you at dinner, and we are nodding yes, yes. We understand. Because we have girl-friends like the characters in her books. We have girl-friends that we would dread not to have in our lives, to love and pour our souls out to.\\"I will miss you.\\" Ann crys.\\"You will feel me near an open window,\\" Ruth says. \\"I will be the breeze that brushes against your face.\\" ---Talk Before Sleep---I keep going back to Berg because her words taste good...I know her characters. They are people I know. They are me."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Talk Before Sleep captures the essence and depth of women's friendships like few books I've ever read. The cast of extremely diverse women make a beautiful ensemble to help their dying friend. If you love true stories of deep friendship, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Being such a fan of Elizabeth Berg's, I have hesitated until now to write a review of any of her works, worrying that I won't do her justice. But I just recently purchased the audio version of &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; and enjoyed it immensley. Unfortunately I could only get my hands on the abridgement, but it was definitely worth the purchase! Beth Fowler does a wonderful job. She captures the feeling perfectly. The women's voices sound true as when you read the story. Fowler slightly alters her tone or pitch with the different characters, but the effort isn't overdone and therefor not distracting or false-sounding. The abridgement is well done too. None of the gems have been taken out of the story. I've listened to the production about 5 times now, mostly while in the bath. (I've got great hot water here, it's hard to get out of the tub!) Do yourself a favor and track down these tapes!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This author tells a good story. Her characters are well developed and the twists and turns in the story keep a reader interested to the end."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Berg has a way of writing so that you feel you are standing next to each character throughout the entire story. You can almost taste the foods, see the raw emotion on the characters faces, smell the scents described, and view the scenery. This book is nothing short of perfection. The story of friendship, love and loss. Told in a candid, truthful manner, you feel as though you are going through the motions with each character. I laughed (and cried) outloud. Applause for Berg!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Even so I read the book in two days and was touched by it, I have to say that Elizabetz Berg has done better. Unlike in 'Range of motion' or her 'Katie-books' for example, the dramatic moments in this one often feel forced and tasteless. The character of the nurse remains flat and lifeless, the other characters often seem very exaggerated. It almost feels as if Berg tried to fill the story with life by adding different stereotypes, like Sarah, the efficient, pretty, petit businesswoman and L.D., the baseball cap wearing, bulky lesbian with a crew cut.So all in all it was a disappointing book, especially since one is spoiled by Berg's previous excellent work."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This story will make you think about a subject we really don't like to. Solely because of its subject matter, the story is sad but the strength of the bond of friendship is inspiring. The writer present a well composed piece of work, easy to read in its structure. Worth reading!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"While in the middle of reading this moving book, I had to pick up the phone and call my best friend who lives 300 miles away and tell her again how much she means to me and that I love her. Of course she already knew these things, but this book makes you take a look at your friendships and appreciate them a bit more and realize how blessed you are to have those around you who &quot;understand&quot; you and love you just the way you are. What would you do with her or say to her if you knew your time together was limited? Elizabeth Berg is a great author who can make you laugh and cry and always make you glad you chose her book to pick up and pass the time. I have read several of her books and have yet to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I wasn't in the mood for a depressing book. When I first started it and realized the subject matter I thought of putting it aside. However, I hung in there and boy am I glad I did. I just love Berg's character development. I felt that I knew each of these characters. They were all wonderful yet flawed, just like real life. I didn't find this depressing. I found that it made me appreciate life even more."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"What a book! I loved it, but it was so sad. Berg manages to pull you into her stories, characters, they are so easy to read.You can set aside several hours &amp; sit down with one of her books...you'll be a fan."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was given this book by one of my girlfriends, and it has become a treasure. It touched me deep in my soul all while honoring friendship. I also give it a five-tissue box rating."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It is a beautifully written story - I highly recommend it to anyone who has lost someone close to cancer."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Elizabeth Berg tells the story of true friendship between two women Ruth and Ann. Ruth is dying from Breast Cancer and she is being taken care of by Ann and some of her other friends LD, Sarah, and Helen. I really liked the character of LD who wouldn't give up hope until the end no matter how much they told her that Ruth's death was inevitable. But the best part of the story is the friendship shared between Ruth and Ann, a friendship that strong is very rare to find today. I truly enjoyed reading this book and has to be one of Ms. Berg's best."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Elizabeth Berg is a writer that understands women and is able to capture that connection women have with each other as friends, mothers, wives perfectly. This book is a testament to that as it is a story of two best friends. Ann and Ruth and what they endure when Ruth is diagnosed with breast cancer.I felt like I was reading a memoir in Talk Before Sleep. Ms. Berg delves deeply into the feelings, experiences and connections women have when a friend has cancer. It made me stop and think about what it would feel like to have a close friend with cancer as I have not experienced that. I am in my 40's and know it will happen and this story gave me an opportunity to understand what that experience may be like. This is a beautifully written story even though it is sad."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I'll give this one three stars because, like all Berg's books, they keep my interest and have some moments of elegant description and lovely imagery. In \\"Talk Before Sleep\\", I knew that Ruth, who has cancer, was going to die, but I couldn't really care. Ruth was basically a self-indulgent person who for some unknown reason evoked feelings of undying loyalty in her friends. Ann, the narrator, is a flat character who doesn't seem to appreciate the husband, daughter, and good health that have been given to her. It seems like many of Berg's protagonists are women who seem to have too much time on their hands, so they spend time contemplating how bored they are in their marriages and how the life they have chosen makes them feel dead inside. For Berg's best work, read the Katie trilogy that starts with \\"Durable Goods.\\""},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This story is unforgettable, one minute your laughing the next your crying. It was a story about friendship between women. One who was dying of breast cancer and one best friend who learns so much from her dying friends' courage and out look of life. The bond between the two of them is very moving. I laughed and cried because I too had a best friend who died of breast cancer. We did everything together, so for me this book was so close to home. I didn't want it to end, but knew it had to, Because as in life it has a beginning and an end . Read this book and pass it on to your friends , they will thank you."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Nothing puts a friendship to the test like being the one dying of cancer, or, for that matter, feeling guilty for being the one left to live on.This is a Berg triumph - the dialogue is realistic - heart-wrenching at times, crazy fun at times, but always REAL, leaving you hoping that your friends will be there for you, on whatever side of the cancer/terminal hardship coin that we all might land.Will it offend some? Yes. Is it realistic of women friends? Completely. Read it. You won't be sorry - you'll be a better person for having this first-person feeling view of how to be the best friend you can be."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This is a novel about friends who gather around their beloved friend as she is dying of breast cancer. The book is about their love, grief, fun together and depth of connection. It is about the joy and grief of life lived fully from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Anyone who's ever loved someone with breast cancer should read this book. It's a novel about friendship, foremost, and what makes life so important to be shared with friends and family. I couldn't put this book down, and it moved me in a profound way. I sobbed for awhile after I was done, but I loved this story. This is the book that had me searching for more family/friendship dynamic stories by Ms. Berg."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I really, really loved this book. And I read ALOT of books. My sister gave it to me after she read it. She had pre-menopausal breast cancer, was cured - and 15 yrs. later developed bone cancer. It's in remission... and we're able to talk about death - and life - and this book reminds me again that we all need to ENJOY life. We're ALL dying. Sometimes it takes being given that \\"death sentence\\" to really do what you want, to be yourself, to live each day like we all should be doing - but usually dont. Its a book about female friendship, love in marriage, and different types of women.To reviewers who said the characters didnt develop - the book was not that long; but i thought they were developed well, and if you know women you can imagine them and know how they are. To the reviewers who said they ate too much junk food!? She was dying. There was no cure. Dont feed me bean sprouts when i KNOW im going within months! (Also, this was a fictional story.)I read the book in a day and a half. I would recommend it to women for sure.

I bought this book and tried to read it at one point, but one got through one chapter and then shelved this one.A few months ago, I pulled it back out and started reading. I could not put this book down! Berg develops her characters so beautifully, realistically. The description, and \\"everyday\\" doings are true to life, which is why I almost always enjoy her books.This book devastated me, made me sob, but was not a cheesy story in any way. I would recommend this book. It's a quick read, and totally worth it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This was a really heartwrenching story of the death of one woman's dear friend.

I thought the story was very good, the writing was amazing and the reading was effortless."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was recommended this book by my book club as being the &quot;best one by Berg&quot;. So when I ran across it at my local bookstore, I had to give it a try. I started and finished it in 3 days, which is very fast considering my busy college schedule. I couldnt put it down. I thought the storyline would be too depressing for me, and I wouldn't like it or be able to stay interested. I was wrong, this was a very good book. Berg tells the story beautifully, and pulls you into it with her writing.B+"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was expecting blockbuster prose based upon the customer reviews I read. I was not bowled over by this book, and I wonder if perhaps I just expected too much. I did appreciate the focus on the emotions and thoughts, as opposed to attempting to paint a picture of the surroundings. The end tries too hard to jerk tears, however, and I felt that it was a bit of overkill."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book is just way too pretentious and makes too much of an effort to be wise and poignant to actually BE wise and poignant, or make any real observations about life, or convey any real emotion. It's so pro-female that it's sexist, anti-male, as though men are a lesser creature instead of an equal partner here on earth. I want a book that can make you cry, make you think, make you feel like you are going through an experience with someone, but this book does none of that - the author WANTS to convey something, but it all feels very artificial. The characters were weak - Ruth was self-centered, cynical and narrow-minded and Anne was a pushover and had such low self-confidence and inability to see the good in her life you hardly have hope for her at all. Overall, it was really quite mediocre."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Anyone who has a best friend that has been with them through thick and thin will love this book! I would hope that if my best friend or I ever went through such an ordeal that we would be like Ruth and Ann, supporting each other and crying together. My sister has the book now and there is a line waiting after her. I can't wait to read the rest of Elizabeth Berg's books."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book touched me deeply. A wonderful book that describes very well the last days of cancer. The friendships surrounding Ruth during her illness and the support she recieves from her best friend Ann are true and heartfelt. It is written with touching sadness and just enough humor to get you through to the next page. A must read for anyone who is fortunate enough to have a best friend."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was assigned this book in a women &amp; literature class and it was my favorite of all that we read. What a moving story about the purity of friendship."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"&quot;Talk Before Sleep,&quot; is a book that you would want to share with your female friends. It is a story of a woman in her forties, named Ruth, who is diagnosed with breast cancer. Luckily, she had friends like Ann, Helen, L.D., and Sarah who were there to care for her till end. A lot of emotions are shown about life, men, and friends which made the book interesting. There are certain parts of the book that made me laugh, and there are parts that made me cry. If you are interested with drama, then &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; is a good book for you to try and read."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Given the subject matter of &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; this book could have been a maudlin account of death through breast cancer. However, Elizabeth Berg's prose creates a most insightful tale that touches the very heart strings of the reader. It is witty. It is gritty. It is prolific. It is truthful without too much clinical detail. Mostly, it is loving. The loving friendship of two friends, bound together through thick and thin. A wise story, the book leaves you uplifted even with the inevitable ending. Yes, tears spilled from my eyes, but they were in profound respect for Berg's well written characters, and the exquisite beauty of her words. I was so genuinely moved by this read, I wrote my dearest friend an email emoting how much I loved her. Well done prose affects it's readers, and that, to me, is the crux of good writing. This was very good writing!!!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Sorry to spoil the party, but this was an unsatisfying book. Major flaw: The poorly developed characters (men bad/women good), and the first person narrator and cancer victim were both unsympathetic. Neither the situations, nor the friendship, nor the dialogue, nor anything rang true to me. I am amazed that this book was a success on any level. It already seems very dated, with women who are unemployed or marginally employed whining about not being understood by the hard working husbands who support them. They are presumed to be in the wrong simply for being male. The book opens with one of those &quot;sensual&quot; descriptions they give you as an opening exercise in creative writing class. The tedious description says nothing about the narrator, her mother, anything that will lead us anywhere plot-wise or take us anywhere in the book, thematically. Then the descriptions of the friends -- just their physical characteristics, in cartoon stereotypical simplicity, nothing about the real people or the essence behind the physical forms. I didn't know who these characters were by the end of the book. I'm sure there is a great novel out there about women and breast cancer, possibly in the unread slushpile. This is definitely not it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book is, hands down, the best book that Elizabeth Berg has ever written!

I read this book right after its first release and finished it last night for the 5th time. For me, it is like comfort food for my brain, where I can curl up and surround myself with these wonderful characters. Each time I read it, I find another gem of a passage that becomes a part of my soul.I especially encourage men to read it so they can get a sense of what a true female friendship is like, warts and all."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I truely believe that no matter how many books I have read or will read later on, this book will always be that special place which I run to in search for comfort and understanding. I love the easy flowing style, the realistic confrontations, fears and feelings. Most of all, I found an exact, but clearer, image of my own thoughts and doubts in the &quot;human&quot; dialogue which was so surprisingly REAL and wise in its own special way. I have read this book 3 times now, from cover to cover, but from now and then I open it and read a few lines to myself. &quot;Myself&quot; listens and smiles. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"A fabulous way to spend an evening is to read Berg's story of women and their connection to one another. Though at first sight it may seem to be a depressing novel about a woman with breast cancer, it's really quite a treat. It made me wish that I had such close friends to be near me whenever I die. Warning: Be sure to have a full box of Kleenex near you when you read the book."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"E. Berg conveys the depth and unwavering solidity of good female friendships better than any author I have previously read. The storyline could have been depressing, but instead, Ms. Berg created a poignent, humorous, and enriching experience. This was my first EB read. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to start reading &quot;Range of Motion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book was the best book that I've read in a long long time and I constantly found myself openly expressing emmotions. One minute I'd be laughing and a few minutes later crying. This is the best book when it comes to feminine friendships. I've recommended this book to several of my friends already and think that every woman should read it. I think Elizabeth Berg is a splendid writer I love all of her work."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This is one of those &quot;give it to all your girlfriends&quot; books, in all likelihood because one of us will someday fight cancer. This story of friendship in the face of cancer is wonderful candid, realistic, dear, and tear-jerking. I highly recommend that you read it before the diagnosis, as afterwards it would probably hurt too much."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was searching for &quot;something around the house to read&quot;. I picked up this used book,reluctantly, because it looked depressing. My mother had died 6 months ago from Cancer. Once I started reading it, I couldnt put it down. It is an amazing story of reality and love and what really is important: sharing love. I immediately took this book over to my sister to read. I was hoping she would be as enthusiastic about it as I was. I called her the next day and she had been up all night reading it..and crying.She loved it! I mailed it to my other sister right away. She also could not put it down, even with her busy schedule. She says she wished she had read it before our Mom died. I plan to take it to Barbados next month for my other sister to read. This would make a wonderful movie! It's relevant and heart-warming, very human."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"As a man I envy the open and intimate friendships that women often have for other women. Elizabeth Berg portrays the strength and sorrow of such a relationship when one of a group of women friends is slowly dying of cancer. The group provides constant emotional support to their stricken member, and EB shows the unique pain that each is going through as death approaches.The author does not burden us with a novel of unmitigated sadness, however. Ruth has reached the point of accepting death (a status not yet achieved by all of her friends), and she faces the end with remarkable humor. As the Charlotte Observer noted in its review, &quot;One minute you're laughing, the next you're crying.&quot;If, like me, you have reached the age where you no longer consider yourself immortal, you may like this well told tale of that final adventure that we all face."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book jsut makes you want to spend every waking min with your BFF and knwo that you all love and care for each and never leave sour words between.

Although it was sad in parts, it was really funny in others.It is one of those books that ties sisterhood together. I read this book in 2 days. The author does an excellent job detailing day to day what the characters in the book go through.A must read for every female - I recommend it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The friendship presented in this book is as real as it gets. The author is obviously the kind of friend that I would want to have in my corner if the storyline were real life.Breast cancer is the antagonist and is presented as real as any character description. This is a sensitive portrayal that makes the reader care about the characters. The author is obviously one who knows the menace that cancer continues to be. The effects of the disease are presented with greater sensitivity.This book is a must read for all women."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I did not cry-- I felt depressed after reading this book. The women, especially Ruth, seemed to all have self-indulgent lives. Their lives could have been ennobled through the heart-wrenching struggle of letting someone go who is fighting cancer. Yet they bicker, they debase one another while idealizing a life (Ruth's) which has been wasted in her own self pursuits. The dialogue is offensive though it might seem realistic to many women. I read this book as a favor to a dear friend, but I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Elizabeth Berg's TALK BEFORE SLEEP is the story of a friendship. Ruth is dying from cancer, and her best friend Ann is trying to cope. We see things mostly through the eyes of Ann. Through flashbacks we find out how they met, how they felt about each other and what brought them together.Both are married and both have a child, but each of them are like night and day. Ruth lived life to the fullest and always took risks. Ann seemed to be the more conservative of the two, but that didn't stop them from being friends.The book was about how Ann and Ruth's other closest friends helped Ruth and each other prepare for her death. Be prepared for a lot of tears, especially by the end of the book. I felt that this was probably one of my favorite Elizabeth Berg books, and as usual, I was not let down."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"If someone had told me beforehand that this story is &quot;a book about how a group of friends deals with one of them dying from breast cancer,&quot; I would not have read it--that's just not the type of book I usually read. I'm happy I didn't know that though, because I think this is the best book I've ever read! It's funny and sad at the same time. It made me think about my relationships. The characters creep into your heart and refuse to let go, requiring you to look at their loves and their difficulties to the point of evaluating your own. But you are glad of it! The author is very talented and her writing style is wonderfully readable. I plan to read everything that Elizabeth Berg ever writes!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I loved this book! The bond between the women resonated from the page. Ruth's stoic outlook on her malady and the way Berg gave her qualities that we all wished we had made me look at my own life and wonder if I could ever be so brave. Additionally, the rallying around Ruth that the friends diplayed was both touching and vivid. Again, I felt the longing for such a bond--for friends who would carry me if I could not walk and bring me french fries and lobster when death looked me in the face. Berg's style is amazing!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The fact that one of the two main characters is dying of breast cancer doesn't set the tone of this book by prolific Elizabeth Berg; it just puts the friendship between these women in sharp focus and makes us prize them even more. Although in the hands of another author, the dissimilar characters of Talk Before Sleep might become stereotypical caricatures, Berg does not succumb to this pitfall. All the characters have realistically sympathetic as well as irritating qualities.Although lovers, husbands, and children are important elements that receive their fair share of page time, it is the supreme depth of friendship between women that is honored in this lovely book. It's a quality that men rarely experience, share, or even understand. Read this book - and then make a donation to breast cancer research."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Judging by the praise heaped on by the other reviews, I obviously didn't like this book as much as most people. I read Berg's more recent &quot;Open House&quot; first, and I enjoyed the sunny writing style and humor. For me, however, &quot;Talk&quot; bogged down somewhere in the middle. With the exception of Ruth, who is dying of cancer, most of the women seemed to be sketchily drawn. The narrator, with whom we are meant to empathize, is similarly sketchy. One questions, too, how easily she seems to balance her home life with caring for her dying friend.Despite the adulation, this book just isn't up to par with &quot;Open House.&quot; The subject is compelling, and Ruth is somewhat compelling as a character, but the book is too long and too sketchy to be compelling as a whole."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"&quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; celebrates women's friendship with some of the most poetic and touching language you'll ever read! In each scene as Ruth, Ann, and assorted other women friends gather for Ruth's final weeks, you'll laugh, fight, and ache along with each of them. When the inevitable does come, you'll cry for Ruth as you would for any of the women you hold dear in your &quot;real life.&quot; This is a truly moving story, made even more satisfying by Berg's exceptional writing. It will dare you to think about possibilities you'd never have imagined before, and as a result, you'll appreciate your friends, your sisters, your mother SO much more after reading it. Gift-giving was easy last Christmas: I gave a copy of this book to every woman I know!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I didn't care for this book nearly as much as I like some of Bergs' others. I didn't like Ruth. She is a user and likes to use all her friends, both male and female. Also, she likes to be the center of everyone's attention. She sees waitpersons as blow up dolls, but then she feels everyone is there for her need and convenience.Ann is a doormat who feels inferior to many. She neglects her husband and only to child to dance attendance on Ruth. She becomes involved in Ruth's life and does whatever pleasures Ruth to do and becomes less involved in her husbands' and daughters' lives. But Ruth did introduce Ann to other pleasures in life.Ruth leaves her husband. She wants her own space and wants it the way she wants it. However, she leaves her only child, teenaged Michael, with this man she considers a boor and a bore. She leaves her child wih a man she dislikes. But she says she loves her son. But to leave him with his father?Then she gets sick. She has a group of women waiting on her. She loses her hair and her friends shave theirs. The ladies bring food, of all kinds to stimulate her appetite. She enjoys the food and the attention. There is much talk of food and eating.Well, the book ends. Ruth doesn't die. She goes to her brothers' home in Florida to die."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"\\"Talk Before Sleep\\" tells the story of five friends, one of whom, Ruth, is dying of cancer. Her best friend, Ann, puts her own family on hold and stays with Ruth both day and night. This book had particular meaning to me since I, too, am living with cancer.The story is told in a light-hearted, comical manner about a subject that is far from humorous. Each of us could use a group of devoted friends like Ruth's. They make Ruth's last days bearable, in spite of her pain, sharing past memories, good times, laughs, tears, and enough ice cream to turn them all into the size of elephants! The ending of the book takes a twist that proves painful for the friends who stood by Ruth until her last days.The strengths in \\"Talk Before Sleep\\" are the lessons it teaches us about living each day for the moment and enjoying the camaraderie of friendships. The one weakness of the book is the fact Ann left the reader feeling she had abandoned her responsibilities to her own family to be with her friend - a vary noble gesture, but were her priorities in the right place? That is a matter of the reader's opinion. Overall, I enjoy many of Elizabeth Berg's books and this one is no exception."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book demonstrates what real girlfriends are all about. Berg explores the bitter with the sweet and explores the complex dynamics that make the beautiful bond of girlfriends. The strength of friendship along with the tenderness and toughness of being a woman amidst the frailties and inconsistencies of life make this book a true treasure. Simply stated, I loved this book."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"&quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; has to be one of the best books I've ever read!!!

Ann, her closest friend, doesn't see things quite the same."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"A wonderful book about friendship, love, and death. The tears just rolled as i read it.

It depicts the beauty and resilience of a woman and her close friends as she struggles through breast cancer. You will both laugh and cry as you read this warm, intelligent book"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Dishonest portrayal of cancer death.Ruth's (43y/o cancer patient) friends, Ann (the narrator), and L.D., rang false.Ann and LD were obsessive beyond all reason. Ann forsakes her own nine year old daughter and husband for Ruth whom she really hasn't known all that long. Anyway, Ann treats her wonderful husband like dirt, attacking him when ever he opens his mouth.Ann and L.D.s inability to let Ruth go and die where she wished, with her brother, Andrew and their hatred of Andrew was too weird. Burg makes Ann and L.D. too extreme to be believed. Selfish.The cancer part: I've personally had friends die of cancer and am currently taking care of my Father (colon, bladder, skin and now bone cancer). And all of them became skeletons. They all lose their appetites and seem to burn off calories ten times faster than the norm (my dad lost 28lbs in 9 day in the hospital). My Dad's down to 140lbs from 174. Ruth tho eats and eats and eats. Always hungry. Food is a major happening in this book. Lobsters to go, MacDs french fries, hot ice cream sundaes, pancakes.....My cousin (40y/o) prior to finding out she had a tiny cancerous tumor in her lower rectum was sick for almost a year...couldn't eat without getting sick and constipated. Ruth on the other hand has the worst cancer you can get and it's everywhere... in her lungs, her liver, spine, breast, even her brain but she's portrayed as hardly ever sick. She continues to ride her bike during chemo. Right. My Dad can't even drive a car any longer, the brake and accelerator pedals are too much for him. He can barely walk.The character of L.D. was embarrassing. She was a bull dike. \\"football-player-sized\\" only wore \\"checked flannel shirts and bib overalls--even on hot summer days. Her only variation is in caps --John Deere for dress up, sports teams for everyday\\" I worked in the construction trades in S.F, and lived in the SFBayArea for 34 yrs. and never met a bull dike such as L.D. tho I'm sure they exist but not in the circles in which these women, Ann, Ruth Sarah, Helen ran. Burg stuck her in the story for reasons I can't figure.I've never known one lesbian who hated men like L.D. and didn't in fact prefer male company. They do tho try to project or emulate the medias stereotypical worst elements of the male persona - cool, cold blooded unaffected which is why I don't care for em. It's so obviously an act because it's all the same act...no individuality. Imo, maybe ten percent of homosexuality is genetic.Ruth's begging her ex husband (a real nasty cold fish) to take her back, even going so far as to sneak into his place while he's with his 20 y/o fianc&eacute;e was pathetic and completely out of the character Burg had created for her.The whole story comes off as a sham. Like Burg knew nothing about the subjects and didn't bother inquiring. A fairy tale death. Should of been listed as fantasy."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"My bookclub read this book and of the 10 women, only one enjoyed it. This truly is a sappy unrealistic book. What women would desert her child and husband for a dying, unlikeable, self-centered &quot;friend&quot;? Most of the men were written to be the enemy, and the women were stereotypical emotion binging, male bashing whiners.It is amazing to me to see that most of the people gave this book 5 stars when this book really is not literature...it could never be a classic. It is a memorable book in only one respect--it is on my list of the worst 5 books that I've ever read."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This throwback to my college womens studies classes was trite and corny. OK, maybe well written and imaginative in parts, but resorts to the same old male bashing,lesbian elevating stuff I've read before.The men were too evil or thinly written in charicatures, and the women were stereotypical food binging, emotion binging, weak downtrodden whiners. Sorry, didn't like it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Talk Before Sleep appeared to be a touching story about women and the sanctity of the frindships;however after chapter one I realized that was only the cover story. Who actually behaves like this? We don't all fantasize about leaving our husbands, passionatley kiss our so-called \\"best friend,\\" and use profanity freely. By all means I am no prude, but I don't know any friends, neighbors, or colleagues who would act like Ruth, Ann, or L.D. Thank goodness my pals are a bit more mature and settled. And couldn't the lesbian have enjoyed the music of someone other than K.D. Lang? Predictable, trite, and an ill attempt at a tribute to all who have past away from breast cancer. The premise was intriguing, the execution of the storyline lacking. Why did I insist on finishing this sleeper?"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end.

Ann and Ruth met at a party soon they became best friends. Not long after, Ruth found out that she had cancer. Ruth was determined to make the most out of the time she lad left. Ann couldn't see how Ruth could be so strong and never be sad, she admired Ruth a great deal for this. When it became necessary Ann moved into Ruth's house to take care of her, leaving her husband and daughter at home. Ann and Ruth had as much fun as they could, they would give each other makeovers and go see a \\"sappy love story\\" movie. Ruth also had several other friends who liked to come over to her house and have dinner or go to the movies. As Time went on Ruth began to think that her time was coming. Ruth decided that she needed to go live with her brother Andrew. Ruth feels like she needs to spend the rest of her life with him. Shortly after Ruth moves away Ann gets a phone call from Andrew. Ann knew what had happened because Andrew had never called her before. Andrew was calling to tell her that Ruth had died. On a sheet of paper Ann wrote down the time 3:37 on a small sheet of paper so she could remember what time Ruth died. At Ruth's funeral her closest friends all wore things that Ruth thought they should, they all told her goodbye for the last time under the tree in the cemetery that Ruth told them that she wanted to be in after she died.Ann and Ruth were the only \\"round\\" characters in the novel. They were both fun loving, even though Ann was a little more responsible than Ruth. There were several \\"flat\\" characters in the novel, Ruth's friends Helen, L.D. and Sarah. Ann's husband, Joe, and her daughter Maggie, are also \\"flat\\" characters. I think the theme of the novel is that you should always make the most out of the time you have, even when you know your time is limited.I thought that the Author did an excellent job of expressing how strong Ruth is, and how much her friends respect her for that. I would recommend Talk Before Sleep to any woman who ever had a best friend."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I was given this book for Christmas 2002 by my best friend who is indeed actually dying of heart disease. I really wanted to like this book a lot, but it fell terribly short. (My friend agrees with me in this, by the way.)It was a junk food book - quick and easy to read, it left me with an icky taste in my mouth. The worst problem is that the characters are completely flat. The author tried to make them adorable and loveable in a bitchy kind of way, but I just thought they were all bitchy and permanently PMSing.The author obviously couldn't figure out how to do the final death scene, either. There's a horribly sentimental scene earlier in the book (p 179, paperback) involving a friend in a rocking chair, cradling the dying woman in an antique quilt, some groaning, brushing hair from her face, instructions to \\"think of whiteness, think of stillness\\", slight sexual imagery, then - FAKEOUT!!! she didn't really die, she just fell asleep. Was this an attempt at a death scene that didn't quite make the grade, but was too good to actually scrap? (She ends up dying offscene, at her brother's house in a city a long plane flight away. No death scene, just a phone notification.)By the way - being really sick is really expensive, but you wouldn't know from this book. The dying woman is divorced, an artist living alone. There is not a single mention of money, health insurance, prescription costs... and they're buying takeout lobster for 8 people at the drop of a pin. Her apartment is perfect and beautiful and artistic, and no one has to find the rent money, even though Ruth has been off work for a very long time.Bottom line - fake, sentimental, annoying, moderately entertaining.If you want to read a really good book about someone coping with the death of a best friend, read \\"Operating Instructions\\" by Anne Lamott."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"not the best book, not the worst either. may try another book by this author- may not."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This was a great read.

I've read the books recommended by Oprah, and it's no wonder \\"Talk Before Sleep\\" is not on her list.This book is like being trapped in a room with a relative you do not like and has bad breath. The characters are truly annoying. The only thing that kept me reading the book was the fact that the main character had breast cancer, and that me chucking the book would somehow be cold and nasty. But chuck it I did! The characters seem like charictures of whiny, pathetic women. Am I to believe that women really act like the ones in this book, even when faced with cancer? I find them all hard to believe. Maybe this is how the self-absorbed generation faces death. I literally could not stand reading about these characters. Each was annoying in her own way. None could have functioned in the real world built as Elizabeth Berg made them.Books are to be uplifting and inspirational; even when facing death.

Most of us, however, spend our days juggling work and family, and our friendships with other women never get a chance to develop the same level of intimacy. &quot;Talk before Sleep&quot; brought home the fact that we should not neglect our friendships"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The movie, &quot;Beaches,&quot; would take a back seat to this funny and sob-making story.Two friends and one is dying.

You MUST read this"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"It is not often that a book will teach you a life lesson but this one does. Talk Before Sleep is a wonderful story centered around 2 friends, one of whom is dying of breast cancer. Have you ever wondered what you would do if you knew you were dying? That is what the characters face as they know the end is near. The book makes us stop and be grateful that we have today and thankful for all the people in our lives, especially good friends who are there to help us not only to die, but to live."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Talk Before Sleep\\" is the story of Ann and Ruth and their friendship, told from the point-of-view of Ann. We learn right from the start of the story that Ruth has been diagnosed with breast cancer, that there is nothing else that can be done for her, and that she is dying. The book shows the development of the womens' friendship from the time they meet, and more than anything else, I think the author tries to show the strong bonds of love and friendship that exist between the women and how special and unique a \\"best friendship\\" can be. Much of the time, it almost feels as if the novel is nonfiction, and Berg admits in an author's note that she lost a friend to breast cancer and wanted to write about that experience.The novel is short, around 200 pages, and I finished reading it in only a few hours. I have to admit that I found the story very difficult to read--not because it was badly written, but because it was so tragic and sad. It did make me a cry (a lot), but the tears didn't feel cathartic. I hate to sound so dramatic, but I felt depressed and grief-stricken by the time I reached the end."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"All I can say is this was a wonderful book.I listened to it on audio and now Im thinking that I may purchase the book so I can read it also.You feel as tho you know the charectars in this book by the end and you do not want to leave any of them.This story is beautiful..."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"My own best friend recently passed away (albeit not from cancer), so the premise of this book intrigued me. I confess it brought a tear to my eye more than once so the author must have gotten some things right. I would have prefered a more in-depth look at the friendship between Ann and Ruth, I often felt that the author was just scratching the surface. The cast of &quot;supporting&quot; friends almost seemed unnecessary to the storyline, they just didn't add much and often seemed like an afterthought. That said I did enjoy this book, but because of it's brevity I can only give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"Berg never ceases to amaze me....'Talk Before Sleep' is like having a conversation as you read. You are drawn into the book believing you are just one of Ruth's friends who is there to support her through until the end. Ruth has terminal breast cancer.Ann, Ruth's best friend and former nurse, has resolved that she is going to beside her friend until she dies. Ann and Ruth are nothing alike but are drawn to one another because of their differences. Sarah is there to keep a level head and make sure all 'final' arrangements get made. She takes her task seriously and in doing so sometimes alienates herself from the others, particularly L.D.. L.D. is Ruths friend who refuses to believe Ruth is dying and in doing so has Ruth trying every non conventional treatment she can find, all the while getting on everyone nerves who is trying to come to terms with reality. Then there is Helen who has known Ruth since childhood and is just a sweet gentle soul wanting just to be there for Ruth.This book drew from all of my emotions, I laughed out loud, I cried, and got angry. It is a good read that can pull on all of those emotions and when you close the book you are so glad you have shared the experiece with Ruth, Sarah, L.D., and Helen."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book taps you on the shoulder and reminds you what true friendship is. Every woman can identify some of her &quot;girl friends&quot; between the lines. I have only heard of one friend who &quot;didn't care&quot; for the book and I think it was because she was dealing too closely with a friend struggling with breast cancer. A powerful read from start to finish. You will need tissues in the final chapters and your phone bill will likely rise as the need to reach out to those &quot;girlfriends&quot; takes hold."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The first time I read _Talk Before Sleep_, it was just because I intended to read every Elizabeth Berg book, in publication order. I liked it, but it didn't really touch my heart. This time, upon re-reading, I had a friend dying in exactly the same way the woman in the book was dying: From Stage IV lung cancer, metastasized from breast cancer. It was interesting to me to read about how each of her friends coped, how they came together to help their friend die as well as possible, and how dying does not have to be an enormous tragedy. I took from it, this time, ideas that I could use to help my own friend. And I bought not only a copy for my Kindle, but a paper copy to send to my dying friend so that she could read and perhaps draw comfort in planning a good death for herself. Berg's writing is dismissed by many as mere &#34;chick lit&#34;, but it is comforting soul food that will soothe both the worried friend and the cancer patient, as well. Top recommendation."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"As always, I enjoy the intimacy of Mds Berg's writing. With her elegant prose she lets the reader get to the insides of her characters who are all loved even if one doesn't agree with their moral choices or actions. Very important, there are no vampires in this novel, just the real stuff that good writing is made of. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The book was very good however there apparently are 2 authors named Elizabeth Berg, this was not the Chicago author I thought I was buying but still a very good book. Okay now as I am looking at the jacket perhaps it is just a younger Ms. Berg who was living in Conneticut at the time. Sorry for the confusion."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"...Slightly less unreadable than some of the garbage that gets published these days. Take it with you on the airplane. Throw it in the garbage as soon as you land. Schlocky, manipulative, hackish--Yet not, it seems, forgettable. The best thing I can say is that ten years after reading it, I remember it well enough that it still annoys me.The stupid, bland narrator is annoying as hell; her friend is OK."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"This book has an interesting storyline. It's about a group of women who rally around a friend who is dying of breast cancer. Some parts of the book were very well written. I felt Ruth's pain. Other times it seemed that she was an idiot who had extra-marital affairs under the assumption that she would never get caught. After she becomes ill, Ann, one of Ruth's devoted friends, spends all of her time caring for her, sometimes to the neglect of her family. Ann is \\"taken\\" with Ruth. She's in awe of her brazen approach to life. There were also a number of interesting supporting characters, which made for enjoyable banter that was unpredictable and fun to read. But the whole thing seemed a little shallow. I couldn't relate to Ruth's perspective on life. I also couldn't relate to the author's portrayal of death, mainly because my own experience with grief has been different. I'd recommend this book to those who enjoy women's fiction. It's an easy, quick read. However, sensitive readers may want to pass."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"The only way to get me to read a sad book is to tell me there's levity in it, too. That's the case with this book, which deals with a friendship forever changed by a cancer diagnosis. Elizabeth Berg writes so beautifully and managed to make me laugh amidst the drama. This is the way things can be in real life and so much rang true for me, as I had a good friend who died from cancer. Such a wonderful and emotional book and so worth reading! I cried for a half hour after I finished it. So touching!"},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"In this novel, Elizabeth Berg does an amazing job giving us a view into a friendship of two best friends. Ruth is dying from breast cancer and Ann is constantly by her side. You get a true sense of what it is like traveling this road from both women's perspective; the person dying and the one left behind, it is so difficult for both to face life and death without the other. This novel is wrought with emotion; deep despair, fear, hope, laughter, and above all love."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Being in my late thirties, I could completely relate to these women's friendship(s) - Every conversation and nuance is very real - sometimes laugh out loud funny - sometimes heartbreaking. The author's insights to life and death are poignant, and touching.It was easy to visualize Ann and Ruth, their surroundings, and the events of their friendship, and I truly sympathized with Ann's loss - you feel that part of her soul has died - and she is so giving and dedicated to her dying friend.This book was nearly impossible to put down. It is a sweet story that reminds me of the importance of the people we love - that life is much more simple than we make it."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"If someone told you that this book is basically about the depressing topic of slowly dying with cancer, he or she would be right. If someone told you that this book is basically about women idly speaking about their foibles in escaping their respective dislike for marriage or the men in their marriages, he or she would be right. If someone told you that this book is basically about an attempt to focus on the relationship between lost middle aged female souls which are kindled by a newfound sisterhood, he or she would be right.In short, this is a book about women, written for women. It is the closest thing to being a \\"chick book\\", without any iota (or very little) of romance or the other staples which make certain genres of literature be deemed \\"for women only.\\"Neither Elizabeth Berg nor her marketing directors would admit the book's topic(s) require or want a male audience. The worshiped dying Ruth, who has her heterosexual fun and conquests, admits to liking the sexual pleasures with men, but does not necessarily like men. She tells her good friend and narrator Ann near the end of the book, \\"Be nice to Joe. He's not bad, for a man.\\"Ruth's own husband is painted as the idyllic loser. Someone who has the gall to have sexual relations with other women, after Ruth packs her bags, moves into another apartment, and continues to sleep with various other married men in their community. Ruth is a femme fatale. But, the men are the bad people. Ruth is the book's hero.Amid the sisterhood of eclectic characters who nurse Ruth during her slow regression are other married women, a latent lesbian and, of course, Ann. They take turns watching over Ruth, cleaning house and ordering in Chinese. During these mundane events, the book's interest increases as the bonding between these women furnicularly increases as Ruth's health decreases.This is a quick read where the chapters are short and the length is also short. In its brevity, this book's gender-discriminatory passages quickly slide away to the novel's stronger aspects: dialogue. It is not this reader's favorite, but far from the this reader's least favorite."},{"Title":"Talk Before Sleep","review":"If you want to overhaul your heart, read everything by Elizabeth Berg - simply everything. EVERYTHING Elizabeth Berg writes is a marvelous work of Love! Each time a read a new book (to me) by her, I am surprised all over again! Every Single Time!"},{"Title":"Sportsman's Guide to Game Fish","review":"I have a used copy of this book and I have owned it for years. About the size and weight of a Peterson Field Guide, SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE TO GAME FISH by Byron Dalrymple is as good as any of the modern field guide to fishes as an aid in identifying the many fish species (it only lags slightly, perhaps, in the quality of its color plates). It especially excels in presenting detailed knowledge of each fish species in a way particularly useful to the angler, such as their habits, food preferences, seasonal character, and weight ranges.SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE TO GAME FISH presents detailed suggestions on tackle, lures, and bait to use on each species and in every condition the angler is likely to find them. Similar species of fish are painstakingly described by Dalrymple so that any fisherman in possession of this guide can feel confident in the identification of every fish on his hook. This guide covers the 138 freshwater and 190 saltwater species most desired by the sport fisherman today, and its size fits nicely in the bottom of your tackle box.Jeremy W. Forstadt"},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"I almost gave this book 5-stars, but hesitated because the locale is in my home town of Rochester, Minnesota--so I may be upwardly biased in my ratings. To be honest, it was hard NOT to enjoy references to local culture and hot-spots, including the wonderful pie and ice cream store in Whalan, Minnesota on the Root River Bike Trail. But all that aside, Gunn has written a very good detective novel. She is especially adept at police procedures and forensic reconstruction. There is some romantic interlude to spark interest, but she doesn't have enough time to really flesh out her characters in a complete manner. In my mind, this is fine. I don't read mysteries for a &quot;Great Literature&quot; experience. Her plot is complex enough to keep the reader guessing almost to the end, and there is a real surprise regarding the puppet-master of crime which is flooding fair Rutherford. It was a quick read that kept my interest from the start, and left me satisfied enough to be looking forward to the next Jake Hines mystery. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"Elizabeth Gunn knows how to tell a story and she creates believable, interesting characters. Her books are truly page turners. I highly recommend Par Four and the first book in the series as well, Triple Play. I am looking forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"Elizabeth Gunn has the touch of Elmore Leonard's earlier books -- great characters, great progression of the story line, and so natural that you feel you are Jake Hines. A wonderful balance of reality and make-believe."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"After Jake Hines' incredible performance on his last case (see TRIPLE PLAY), he has been rewarded with a promotion to the Rutherford, Minnesota Chief of Detectives. He does not expect the job to be much of a headache, but discovers quite the opposite when he is forced to explain a previous case during a Critical Incident Debriefing. Jake is an action type guy and hates these touchy feely things that are expected of him by his superior and the staff psychiatrist.His boss orders him to attend a meeting that becomes symbolic of overload and craziness caused by being the person ultimately responsible for the apprehension of criminals. Jake frets over how a heist of a small bar and grill turned into a double homicide and how the killings then link to a child abduction case. Many a law enforcement official would have an ulcer with this type of workload, but not Jake, who thrives on the adrenaline of a crisis like the one he confronted with right now.Elizabeth Gunn is a definite talent who scribes a clever who-done-it filled with numerous off-shoots of a typical police procedural. Readers will simply be unable to put the novel down until after they finish the final page.

The romantic relationship amongst the escelating crime seemed like an after thought initially. However, the author did a good job weaving it through the larger plot.The mystery behind the strange crimes kept me guessing. I had to keep reading. As the relationships between seemingly unrelated crimes becomes clear, you will still never guess who is responsible. The mystery was well-developed--the best mystery I've read in a while. It's worth your time."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"I like the Jake Hines books - the characters are everyday people, well described, and the story is well written and interesting, also I learn a bit about police procedure which is well documented.

Elizabeth Gunn writes a well paced, exciting story and weaves personal details into the narrative with well judged timing and detail."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"This is the first novel I've read in the Jake Hines series, and I was a little disappointed. Maybe it's because I didn't read the previous ones, but I thought the characters lacked development. I also thought the ending was a bit too neat, if not far-fetched. The book started out well, but the suspense never really seemed to build. It felt more like a series of crimes that the author needed to tie together to wrap up the book before it got too long-winded. It wasn't a book I felt compelled to read all the way through without stopping."},{"Title":"Par Four","review":"After Jake Hines' incredible performance on his last case (see TRIPLE PLAY), he has been rewarded with a promotion to the Rutherford, Minnesota Chief of Detectives.

The protagonist is a believable character who is as unlucky at choosing women as he is with business associates. The author's definitions of the title at the beginning grab your attention and set the mood for the entire book. The first few chapters set a fast pace and put you on the protagonist's team. As he faces hardships, disappointments, and crises (some of the &quot;storms&quot;), you will be routing for him. Although I routinely can predict the plots of many movies/novels, Storm Keeper has many unexpected twists as the story and the characters develop, right up to the last chapter. The scene of Jake's farewell to Kristina was especially moving, and the introduction of new characters throughout the book adds depth to the storyline. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop and I am anxiously awaiting the author's next novel."},{"Title":"Seasons of the Witch Weekly 2005","review":"I've enjoyed being published in this weekly calendar during the years 2003-2005...

This is a pretty good one. It's value to me was Washington as a colonial officer under British generals during the French-Indian War. It is essential as this was the making of the man &amp; frames everything that comes after.A stupid blunder, of so many by the British after defeating the French was the denial of Washington a generalship in the regular British military establishment. It was the one thing that he wanted or ever would want more in his whole life. Mr. Alden explains why Washington or any colonial could not hope for a career in the regular army. It chilled me to think of the course of American history &amp; world history if Washington had remained a loyal British subject. Our history without Washington is hard to imagine. There was no one even close to his stature in America. So he did become a general after all. The rest of the book is well done. Good reading for someone not too familiar with the first president, with a little revolutionary era history thrown in."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"A book I downloaded to my Kindle, because a) it was for free, b) I like biographies and c) I didn't know anything about George Washington except for that he was the first President of the United States of America.William Roscoe Thayer wrote this biography in 1922, and the reason for him to do that is stated in the preface, in his own words:\\"I was interested to discover, if I could, the human residue which I felt sure must persist in Washington after all was said. Owing to the pernicious drivel of the Reverend Weems no other great man in history has had to live down such a mass of absurdities and deliberate false inventions.\\"The author also feels he should\\"...warn the reader that this book aims only at giving a sketch of George Washington's life and acts.\\"Well, he succeeded in this, and I did enjoy reading it, also because of the style and language used. There were many words I had to look up, not being at all familiar with military terms (furlough? That certainly wasn't part of the curriculum when I learnt English at school several decades ago!), and Mr. Thayer must have done a lot of research; there are footnotes on almost every page, and an extensive source register makes up the last 10 % of the book.What he did not manage to do, at least not for me, is to convey a clearer picture of George Washington as a person. Yes, his character, his habits (apparently, he was very fastidious with his clothes), his looks and his way of dealing with problems are thoroughly described, as are the military campaigns and political events he was part of. But if I had to sum up in one word what I feel is lacking here, that word would have to be \\"atmosphere\\".You know when you can really delve into a book, into a story, the characters becoming real for you, the places being conjured up in front of your inner eye, complete with sounds and scents? That did not happen for me here, and I certainly do not blame the author; he probably never intended to create something so personal and atmospheric - after all, he said it himself, the book was supposed to be a sketch.And at that, it is very good."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"Poorly organized. Sometimes there is no distinction as to the writer's words and those of quotes of Washington's from another source.

Unfortunate in that with one or two sentences you would know what he is talking about rather than having to research it in wiki or google. Worth a read even with that criticism."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"&quot;The true moral, if any, to be drawn from [Washington's] life, is that one should dress as magnificently as possible and indulge in every luxury available, including the dance, the theatre, the ballroom, hunting, fishing, racing, drinking and gambling, observing in all of them temperance, justice, honesty and pride, while avoiding excess and loss of dignity. And a fine code it is.&quot; - Rupert Hughes.Despite my general admiration for the Founding Fathers, George Washington is not a figure of whom I would have contemplated reading a multi-volume biography, at least not until I had already done the same for Jefferson and Madison, to whom I feel much closer in temperament, and had plenty of time to spare. I thought Richard Brookhiser's informative but unexceptional biography of him (*Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington*) contained everything I would ever want to know about the man.But then, while reading Kenneth Roberts' literary autobiography, *I Wanted to Write*, I came across the following remark, extracted from the August 22, 1931 entry of his diary: &quot;Read from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. in Volume 2 of Rupert Hughes's *George Washington*- history at its best and most brilliant.&quot;Given the scantiness of Roberts' praise of historians, and my own steady admiration for him, this was enough to make me order the three volumes of Hughes' biography right away.It is composed of three volumes, covering the first five decades of Washington's life and leaving out the last two, which include his presidency. They are titled respectively: &quot;The Human Being and the Hero, 1732-1762&quot;, &quot;The Rebel and the Patriot 1762-1777&quot; and &quot;The Savior of the States 1777-1781&quot;. So far, I have only read Volume 1, but it is enough to make me second Roberts' verdict about the book: not only is it well-researched and reliable, but it goes beyond those virtues of small books and rises to the level of great literature, rich with the kind of wisdom that makes you feel you are going to return to it again and again for more than just facts.Hughes himself was a friend of Roberts. They first met at MI-4 during World War I. As Roberts writes in his autobiography: &quot;It was my great good fortune to have as a commanding officer Major Rupert Hughes... If Major Hughes could have been given as free a hand with Military Intelligence as General Donovan was later given with O.S.S., the United States would long ago have had a genuine Intelligence Section.&quot; One also learns that at that time, Hughes was deaf, the father of two children, and &quot;working furiously on galley proofs of a novel.&quot; Later on, he introduced Roberts to the man who would become his lifelong best friend, Booth Tarkington, and helped him out with his historical novels of the Revolutionary War by lending him volumes from his own well-endowed library.Actually, Hughes has authored exactly the same kind of biography of Washington that Roberts would have written had ever ventured into this area, hence the latter's admiration: like Roberts in *Trending Into Maine* or *The Battle of Cowpens*, Hughes often prefers to let source documents speak for themselves; he has a writer's eye for the telling detail, for factual consistency and for the complexity of the human soul; and he is particularly brilliant at debunking myths and rescuing the truth from a jungle of misapprehensions and outright fabrications.I was also particularly seduced by his personal philosophy, the benevolence of which is evinced by his view of business and money-making. But for its ambivalence, the following passage would sound almost Randian: &quot;It has been overlong the custom to assume that epic poetry flies out of the window the moment business comes in at the door. We should realize the truer truth that all great business men and business triumphs have been, when understood, epic in virtues, epic in sins, aglow with poetic imaginations both of horror and beauty, tragedy and triumph.&quot;Hughes' biography of Washington is a brilliant portrait of a multi-faceted man - military commander, land speculator, slave owner, lover and bon vivant. In addition to its richly detailed depictions of military life and military campaigns, it contains a very enlightening annex about Washington's religious fervour (or lack thereof) and a haunting treatment of his enduring passion for Sally Fairfax, the married woman he was more ardently in love with than he ever was with his own wife."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"This D'Aulaire book is both beautiful and engaging.

Yes, in school way back when, I would have found this more interesting and helpful than the trash we were given to read in our history books. I would say, read it. It gives you a lot, let's you ask questions about history in a good way. It does show the harshness of war and the sentiment of the times in a shortened form.

Alden touches on most every event and aspect concerning the subject: from Shay's Rebellion to Martha's disposition, from the Hamilton-Jefferson Feud to his agricultural experiments. It is objective without trying to debunk a great man. Only the cursory discussion on slavery does the junvenile yankee condescention surface (Whose ships were involved in the slave trade even after the Virginians pushed through its ban via the Constitution? Yankees ie the Great Hypocrites of All Time.) It is, however, a thorough and interesting biography and highly recommended."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"This book came highly recommended by a homeschooling website, so I was looking forward to reading it with my children. The text gave an interesting and unique narrative of George Washington's life, but the illustrations were quite offensive. In the depiction of Washington's wedding, the reader looks through the window of the estate to see the newlyweds dancing, while outside the black children gaze longingly at the scene. Martha's son winks at them from inside. On the next page the text states, \\"George Washington was everywhere, and his hundreds of slaves and servants kept everything spick and span and in beautiful order.\\" The accompanying illustration shows the wealthy Washington and his family dressed in their finery and ambling happily along in front of a golden field of wheat. The field is peppered with the ambiguous forms of slaves, shirtless and without faces.I realize that this book was written in the 1930's and that Washington had slaves. I am not trying to argue that this fact should not be acknowledged, but the matter is presented in a very insensitive and Anglo-centric fashion. This may have been accepted in the 30's, but I think modern parents and teachers can do better."},{"Title":"George Washington","review":"This book is an awesomely epic text in description of the man George Washington. Written in 1908, it is superior to modern writings tainted with the falsity of equal rights. Men are men is this text, and women do NOT compare, NOR are even considered to being, NOR having anything to do with the actual building of America. In 1908, women were MUCH more in their natural subservient God-given places. Therefore, U.S.A.'s women didn't have a chance to cloud the mind of the writer with equal rights polution. For this reason, this text is more accurate in reality."},{"Title":"In the Shade of the Koran: v. 30","review":"I bought this book thinking it was the complete work.

She's a well loved only child who has always received a great deal of attention from her parents and Babci (grandmother). Donna's smart, and very talented at playing the accordion. In fact, her dream is to have an all-girl polka band. She's her father's pride and joy and her life is just about perfect. Then along comes Betty, and everything in Donna's life changes.

She now has the responsibility of a little sister who came out of no where to take over the Milewski home. She likes Betty well enough and does try her best to treat her well, but in Donna's heart she feels that when everything settles down, she will again regain her status as favorite child.

As a child Donna was the apple of her father's eye. When her parents adopt a young cousin from Poland Donna's place in the family is eclipsed by younger, more Polish Betty. An unfortunate car accident cements this. Donna is blamed for the accident, and her new sister Betty becomes everyone's favorite. While Betty prospers Donna fades, and stews about her broken family.Adulthood finds Betty in medical school and Donna working in a tampon factory, unable to create any kind of lasting relationship with a man. To find her way out Donna has to return to one of her childhood loves: polka music.Parts of this book seemed overdone. By the end of the narrative Betty's accomplishments start to seem ridiculous. She doesn't quite cure cancer or create world peace, but she comes close. Donna has a tendency to get annoying at times. In fact, there were times I wanted to smack her. The book's strength is definitely in its vibrant description of a Polish-American community. I had no idea that polka music was still so prominent anywhere. The tensions between those born in Poland and those born in the US was were intriguing.

Most of them were poverty related. Sometimes the best of intentions turned out wrong, sometimes they had great endings. Hoopi Shoopi is an outstanding story with one of these twists! The tragedy is realistic and the joys are great. It is a story about a good father making judgments on his emotions and blocking out the truth. This book made me laugh, it also made me cry, (and I'm in my fifties). I could smell the food, feel the pain, relate to the people and hear the music. If you know any Polish-American families you should read this book. You won't be able to understand them better but you will appreciate some of the heritage.

It was selected for my book club and I was not surprised to learn that only 3 of the 6 of us finished the slow reading novel. I will NOT recommending this book to anyone, for several reasons. It is muddled in minutiae that is too time consuming to read and causes the reader to lose interest and focus. The book is choppy and does not flow well, partially caused by too many characters that are superfluous. Donna, the main character, is frustrating. Although she has her share of challenges, the reader never learn enough details about her and why she makes the poor choices she makes. As a result, this entire book was frustrating and didn't leave much for our book club to discuss: no one enjoyed it. On a positive note, I did enjoy the authors humor and great insight into the musical and polka world."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"I've just begun this book, but I find the author's use of long sentences (sometimes a page long), difficult to read.

You will mostly likely find references to towns nearby or remember Polish words/phrases from your childhood. I may end up loving this book, but the writing style is difficult to read."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"I was knocked out by how wonderful this book was. I literally could not stop reading it until I finished it. Suzanne Shea has a wonderful feel for 2d and 3rd generation Polish-Americans (of which I am one) and it makes for a delightfully original setting.

Found it on a clearance shelf in a local drugstore and was attracted by the title and cover. What a great find! It was written with the kind of humor I enjoy. Just a daily take on everday life and relationships. I found the Polish family traditions interesting but the relationships were &quot;every family.&quot; Donna's thoughts were so honest, even though she admitted herself they were not always kind. She knew she was being unpleasant at times but felt it was her right. Boy, I've felt that many times!I am in a book club in my area and can't wait for my turn to host and choose the book... as I already know my selection. This definitely needs to be discussed with others.The only adverse thing I can think of is my sympathy for the nice guys who always got dumped led me to being very frustrated with Donna.

But when a poor little cousin from Poland, Betty, is adopted by the family, Donna begins to lose the attention and affection of her father.A misunderstanding causes a dreadful split that Donna never recovers from. She becomes the selfish teenager while Betty becomes the selfless victim. Donna, once high achieving and dutiful becomes mediocre (working as a quality inspector in a tampon factory--love it!) and estranged as Betty thrives and flourishes from her father's love.Reconciliation comes late--but not too late for Donna. Through music and the polka, the music of the accordian, she finds forgiveness.While I found the ending confusing (why did Donna drop Joseph Angello even when she knew he hadn't lied to her?), it did cause me to think. It wasn't a pat ending."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Donna reminds me of so many girls that I grew up with, including myself.

If you liked 'She's Come Undone' or 'Emma Who Saved My Life', you'll like 'Hoopi Shoopi Donna'."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna is a nice little tale about Polish American Donna Mileweski who finds her personal redemption through, what else, polka music. This is a nice read that will have special appeal to readers of Polish ethnicity.Author Susan Strempek Shea began her Polish American novels with \\"Selling the Lite of Heaven\\" (1994) followed by \\"Hoopi Shoopi Donna\\" (1997) and \\"Lily of the Valley\\" (2000). There are so few novels about Polish American characters who are connected with their ethnic heritage that Strempek Shea became somewhat of a celebrity in Polonia. Critics even began proclaiming her the \\"Polish Amy Tan.\\" It's not clear if Shea took offense at being pigeon-holed but she's steared clear of novels about Polish Americans for quite some time."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"Being of Polish descent and a lifelong New England resident myself, I could relate to the joys and traumas of Donna's life all too well. It's hard being the first American, when your parents stubbornly insist on keeping one foot in old-country ways.Nonetheless, young Donna's life is happy enough, especially with her loving grandmother, Babci, living just next door in the family's duplex. Then her father decides to bring his little niece, Betty, over from Poland, and Donna's life changes forever.No longer the apple of her parents' eye, Donna is resentful of the attention little Betty garners. Then tragedy strikes, and Donna finds herself a permanent outcast in her own family, with Betty there to pick up the slack.Because of that fateful day, the two girls' lives are permanently set. Beloved Betty goes on to become successful in every aspect of her life, while Donna, existing in the shadows, is subjected to a mediocre existence. As the years pass, Donna realizes that the events of that long-ago day don't define who she is as a person, and what she needs and deserves from life. It's up to her to strike out into the world, and make things right.This was the first book of Suzanne Strempek Shea's that I had ever read, and it made me instantly fall in love with her writing. Since then, I have read several others, and I feel they all maintain that same level of literary brilliance.To read one of Shea's books is to step fully into the universe she has depicted, and to walk among new friends and faces."},{"Title":"Hoopi Shoopi Donna","review":"After reading all of the reviews on Hoopi Shoopi Donna, I figured it would be a quick and easy read (since so many everyday people had seemed to enjoy it). Unfortunately, my hypothesis was quickly proven wrong after only two chapters. The book was slow moving and incredibly frustrating. Reading the book took so long that I found myself constantly falling asleep midsentence. Not only that, but when I rarely was able to stay awake, I often found myelf having to go back and reread entire pages to understand what I had just read. The Polish words and traditions offered help, while the impossible circumstances and events crushed the books believablity, and the author's credibility. If this book hadn't been chosen by my group to read for my high school Comtemporary Literature class, there is no way that I would have finished it. The book was frustrating and the characters caused me to hate the book even more than the slow pace. Their actions and reasoning were so unbelievably frustrating that it made reading the book feel more like a chore than a choice. After finally finishing Hoopi Shoopi Donna, I came to the conclusion that I will NOT be recommending this book to anyone unless they've been having trouble at night, and are looking for a guaranteed sleep aid."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"In this world of criticism, there are two ways to go. You can either offer an objective take on the work you are criticizing or you can conform to the wishes of your editor and offer up a puff piece. Some critics will go for the puff piece. Lester Bangs never did. And neither has Jim Derogatis,Derogatis, music critic for the Chicago Sun Times and frequent contributor to many music/entertainment related periodicals, is one of the most honest and objective music writers out there today. And he's one of the most entertaining as well as Milk It: Collected Musing On The Alternative Music Explosion Of The 90s proves. The 410-page book, a collection of his pieces from that era, positions Derogatis as the heir to Bangs throne.Derogatis divides the book into 14 different sections. Each section is devoted to a particular band (Nirvana, REM) or a particular topic (Britpop, Women In Rock). The sections consist of various reviews, interviews and other essays. In other words, it's a rummage sale of recycled material. But as far as single author collections of works of criticism go, it's one of the better ones out there.As I said earlier, Derogatis doesn't hesitate to call it as he sees it. There are two articles of Courtney Love quotes contained here. Unaltered quotes that portray Ms. Love as interesting and rather psychotic. The Smashing Pumpkins section cheers on the band for its success. But some of the portrayals of Billy Corgan are none too flattering.In the intro to his women in rock section, Derogatis criticizes the music scene and industry observers for treating women in rock special, instead of as they would treat all other (non-female) bands. He seems to feel that this is demeaning in a way and he makes his point well for this being correct.That's the good thing about this book, even in the case of artist he admires, Derogatis never falls victim to hero-worship. In one of the articles in the REM section, he questions the wisdom of their charging excessively high ticket prices. Although guitarist Peter Buck acknowledges that the $50 price tag was too high, bassist Mike Mills defends the high prices.One thing that Derogatis has in common with Bangs is the fact that he too got fired from Rolling Stone. Bangs got the ax for writing negative comments on James Taylor albums. Derogatis devotes a whole section to his experience at the venerable RS, entitling the section \\"Hootiegate\\". The incident that earned Derogatis the wrath of RS publisher Jann Wenner was the release of Hootie And The Blowfish's second album. Derogatis wrote a very negative review of the album and awarded it two stars on the 4 star RS scale. The review interfered with Wenner's peace and love views of rock and roll and journalism and so it was yanked from the magazine. When Derogatis went public with the whole matter, Wenner sent him packing. The aforementioned review is included.One area of the book that I recommend for particular study by fellow Epinioners is the section entitled \\"Unrepentant Hypes And Fabulous Frauds\\". Here he rips on easy targets like Bush (the band) and Britney of course. But he also goes after certain sacred cows. He offers up a negative review of NWA's N!ggaz4life album on the grounds of the album's miserable content of misogyny. He questions Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello about his former band's support of the Shining Path, a group of Peruvian Guerrillas that have murdered innocent people. And there is a hilarious interview with Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind. Jenkins did not like Derogatis review of his band's concert and so he takes Derogatis to task. At the end of the review, he tells Derogatis that the only thing ham-fisted is \\"your writing\\". Of course, Jenkins has managed to make himself look like a fool in the process. The skewering here is priceless.So yes, Derogatis' work is a good example of how good music writing should be done. The only real drawback is that some of his viewpoints are a little overly simplistic. For instance, in one piece he simply dismisses the Counting Crows as a bogus Van Morrison rip-off. While that topic is worthy of debate, he doesn't really bring anything else to the issue. However, a good many of his opinions are right on the money (especially his ripping of Nickelback and Creed). His writing style is more straightforward and less gonzo than Bangs.Milk It is an excellent book for all music fans to read as well as all those who are looking to write good music criticism. Don't miss this great book! Another terrific Amazon quick pick I love is THE LOSERS CLUB by Richard Perez -- a great novel about the New York City music scene during the '90s"},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"Jim DeRogatis attempts to sum up the music of the 1990s (with an emphasis on the first half of the decade) by reprinting ten years' worth of articles. The articles come from a dozen different publications.The result is admirable but unsatisfying. He's critical of the bands, which is good. His articles on REM, for example, reveal their careful manipulation of the media. He lets Courtney Love bury herself in outbursts, he slams NWA for selling hate, and he attempts to portray Rage Against the Machine's guitarist as some sort of socialist dupe. That's the kind of entertainment journalism we need --- something skeptical, not the usual fawning over celebrities and rock stars.The problem is, the book isn't focused. The articles should have been re-written, expanded, and combined into longer essays. Too many of them are so short, you wonder why he bothered to include them. (Maybe to make the book longer.) DeRogatis trivializes his own point of view by touching on each band too lightly. This book is worth reading but not worth buying. I'd gladly read a sequel, a complete review of music in the 1990s, written from scratch. Hopefully, he'll make this flawed but interesting book an introduction to a better one."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"'Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosions of the '90s' is both trite and unwarranted. For a man who seemingly wants to be so controversial, why does he devote the bulk of his attacks on bands that even mainstream audiences do not pay attention to anymore? Was bashing Hootie and the Blowfish and Third Eye Blind ever controversial? Even among non-music critics, taking Britney Spears and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to task are fabulous wastes of time.Worse is when he reveals his puzzling ignorance of musicians and bands, here stating that Blind Melon were like \\"the Grateful Allman Brothers\\" and there suggesting that Nine Inch Nails were part of the electronica scene that was hyped circa 96/97. If you're like me, you'll find yourself mystified by the bands included in here (has anybody ever given a sh*t about Redd Kross?!) and frustrated with who he leaves out (sure, the book is hopelessly biased toward the first 5 years of the decade, but how do you call yourself a critic of the 90s and not include a single article that does more than mention Pavement, Radiohead, and Beck in passing?)If you need more reason to dislike Jim DeRogatis, I recommend 'Turn On Your Mind!: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock.' Just like 'Milk It!', it's an ill-informed tome of idiocy. (See the part where he insults the Grateful Dead! Oooo!) Not only that, it somehow manages to make psychedelic rock boring and comes off as one giant handjob to P.M. Dawn, surely one of the stupidest and most forgettable bands of the 90s.Jim DeRogatis is a man who badly wants to matter, idolizing Lester Bangs and Wire enough to write a book about the former and start a cover band of the latter. The problem? He's not a good writer, he picks easy targets, and his controversial opinions are (though I shudder to use the term) retarded. Further proof? He likes Sinead O' Connor and dismisses Guided By Voices as being like NRBQ(!)."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"Jim DeRogatis has written some pretty neat articles. He's also written some self-indulgent hogswill. That's all part of the fun in being paid to write about stuff that you truly love. And believe me, as a former paid rock writer and radio programmer, it's easy to get thoroughly wrapped up in the waves of emotion that feed the profit machine...and the profit machine wants you emotional, because that keeps you from expecting much for compensation. It is what makes the best rock writers so hilariously dramatic (like DeRogatis' hero, Lester Bangs) and often makes their writing pointlessly dorky (like DeRogatis bashing of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).\\"Milk It\\" (the title copped from Nirvana) is a collection of JD's columns for numerous papers and magazines he's contributed to, and attempts to expound of what was great about music in the 90's. Which is centered mostly into pre and post Kurt Cobain, sometimes maddeningly so. There is WAY too much here that focuses on Cobain, Courtney and the general notion that Nirvana was the focus of all things in the decade. Which may be true, but a little pruning would have been to \\"Milk It's\\" benefit, or even a little updating/rewriting of some of the columns. But you do get one of the finest of the Nirvana articles to focus on the aftermath, the great Spin story of \\"The Nirvana Wars\\" in which all parties get to rip at each other with abandon.The other good moments are when DeRogatis takes on the R.E.M. hype machine around the time of \\"New Adventures In High-Fi,\\" verbally spars with Third Eye Blind's Stephen Jenkins, and exposes the hypocrisy surrounding many writers' defense of N.W.A.'s hate-for-cash scum-scam. But his venom is also his weakness, as too much ink is wasted on his feud with Steve Albini, and upon a typical rock crit's downfall, thinking your favorite obscurities are godhead. In addition, we need to face it up to the fact that trashing Brittany Spears is like shooting fish in a barrel.Had someone taken the time to winnow this book from its bloated near 400 pages down to a more concise 250, \\"Milk It\\" might have been the kind of the decade defining volume that DeRogatis intended it to be. And his hilarious tale of his brief tenure at Rolling Stone not withstanding, there's too much Jim and not enough rock here. I found myself racing to the end of the book, not because I wanted to find out where the DeRogatis was headed, but because I was getting bored. In rock writing, that's cardinal sin."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"I have to agree with the prevailing sentiment of my fellow \\"Milk It!\\" reviewers. While it's not a bad read as a whole, this book is still loaded with obvious filler material that, more often than not, will have you skipping around searching for the good stuff, of which there is thankfully plenty to be found.One of the great things about this book is that everyone who reads it will find something in it that will cause them to throw the book across the room. For the most part, Jim DeRogatis smacks the truth squarely on the head, but when he's wrong about something, he's generally SPECTACULARLY wrong about it (his frequent statements on his \\"Sound Opinions\\" radio show that \\"the Pixies suck\\" immediately comes to mind), which needless to say, is completely infuriating.In that regard however, he does an excellent job as a music reviewer, because his unpredictability (though it sometimes borders on inconsistency) is what keeps his writing from devolving into Limbaugh or Hannity-esque demagoguery. He has an uncanny knack for making you think he's a complete moron (such as his obvious inability to discern the \\"Fabulous Fraud\\" that is Courtney Love and her entire musical canon), yet quickly regains your respect by rightfully slaughtering sacred cows that other mainstream music reviewers simply don't have the balls to tackle themselves. This is a man who was FIRED by Jann Wenner at Rolling Stone for writing--at the height of their commercial success--a scathing review of a trio of records (perfectly entitled \\"American Blandstand\\", which is included in this book) by faux alterna-pop snooze-meisters Hootie & the Blowfish, Dave Matthews Band and The Spin Doctors. If for nothing else, DeRogatis should be respected for this.But of course, there is a lot more to admire about DeRogatis and \\"Milk It!\\". The \\"Unrepentant Hypes and Fabulous Frauds\\" section--where the entrails of numerous music-crit darlings such as Guided By Voices, Wesley Willis and Rage Against the Machine are strewn all over the place by Jim's unmerciful pen--is worth more than the price of the book itself.This section also contains the pinnacle of \\"Milk It!\\", which is DeRogatis' contentious (and unintentionally hilarious) interview with Third Eye Blind front man, Stephan Jenkins. At one point, Jenkins unbelievably tries to convince DeRogatis that Third Eye Blind \\"has been, if not the most DIY next to Fugazi, then number two or three.\\" If you didn't know any better, you'd think that this exchange was ripped from the pages of \\"The Onion\\", but it's all very shockingly real. And that's only one of several instances where DeRogatis never lets you forget just how shallow and deceitful the corporate \\"alternative music\\" industry (read: major label wolves in \\"indie\\" sheep's clothing) really is.Despite its flaws, \\"Milk It!\\" is still a good compendium of writing by one of the most important music writers in mainstream media today. You know that a man who gets vitriolic voice-mail messages from people like Billy Corgan and Ryan Adams MUST be doing something right."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"I first read this book right after it came out, and I still remember little facts and snippets: The Jesus & Mary Chain getting roughed up by Ice Cube's posse at Woodstock '94, Hootiegate, Kurt Cobain purposely playing a terrible show in Brazil because he was upset by how another band had been treated by the crowd, Billy Corgan banning DeRo from a show only for DeRo to see the show anyway through the big glass front of the venue. A lot of good stuff in this book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"I enjoyed this compendium of Mr. Derogatis' music columns from the 1990s. It provides an excellent look into the music critique business (not that I am a regular reader, but Rolling Stone will never be the same for me again), as well as some of the bands that I spent time listening to back then (and some I still listen to). Especially interesting were the columns exploring the \\"rock music as business\\" issues, which became more interesting yet when the discussions involved bands that had trouble adhering to their early standards of musicianship after becoming big. On the minus side is the necessary inclusion of interviews with bands/people that I had little or no interest in. But even those occasionally migrated into relationships with the people I am interested in."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"Problems with Mr. DeRogatis' Book---------------------------------1. Far too frequent use of the word &quot;nadir&quot;.2. Little on Pavement.3. Little on the Pixies (writing a book on alternative without at least an article on the Pixies is unforgivable).That being said, Mr. DeRogatis' certainly has balls and is not afraid to insult some of the most critically acclaimed bands. Overall, a decent write-up of the alternative era before it became a mockery of itself."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"Ok...I bought this book because it had a cool cover and featured stories on some of my favourite bands. But each article was so shallow and boring, I got absolutely nothing out of it. There was no in depth analysis or probing interviews. I totally understand why Billy Corgan hates this guy, his writing style is so bland and vanilla. Derogatis also has such a negative spin on so many cool bands, and champions fakers such as Courtney Love. And he also reckons Ride's &quot;Carnival of Light&quot; and the Pumpkin's last album were among their best ...uh...hello...these albums were sooo derivitive and lacked ideas...listen to both band's earlier wall of sound influenced albums for some true inspiration. But I guess this sums up Derogatis' musical tastes in a nutshell...he champions the bland music from this era, criticizes much of the truely innovative stuff, and puts you to sleep with his boring writing style. At least he gave the Flaming Lips a good plug. Approach this book with extreme caution, unless you know nothing about the genre and want a beginners guide to it."},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"Critics enjoy listening to themselves whine, and this book is the height of their craft. Derogatis should be persona non-gratis. A wanabee rock star who gets his kicks by tearing apart great bands.If the guy would at least label what he likes about a few bands, he could be considered balanced. But he's an ego-maniac looking to pop the ego he sees in Rock stars of the past and present ...The guy has trashed bands/albums as diverse and good as The Beatles \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and U2's \\"Atomic Bomb\\""},{"Title":"Milk It: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s","review":"I'll make this quick. I bought the book because it's the first I've seen to focus solely on the \\"Alternative\\" rock I came of age with in the early 90's. The next day, after reading far more than I should have, I returned it to the local corporate bookstore and reallocated the money to a couple tabloid magazines and a cup of coffee. What Paris Hilton is currently wearing is far more interesting than this book, which boils down to Derogatis trying to overcompensate for his inherent uncoolness. He has made a name for himself in the world of rock criticism by taking critically and commercially successful bands to task while at the same time trumpeting the greatness of some of the worst crap the decade produced while ignoring some of the best that came out of the time period. There's a reason why you can buy this tripe brand new for a mere $2.50 on this site."},{"Title":"The World and Africa","review":"DuBois' work is a seminal accomplishment. This is a wonderful survey of the important, nay, vital role that Afrika and Afrikan people have played in world history. DuBois gives the reader an intricate and thoroughgoing glimpse at how Afrika and all of her resources - mineral, human, land - have shaped the destiny and laid the foundation for the modern world. A must read for the novice or specialist in Afrikan history and geopolitics. Further, the author shows how European economies have been bolstered at the expense of Afrikan people. In one chapter, &quot;The Rape of Africa,&quot; the reader is given a chance to see how the colonial powers partitioned the continent to satisfy their own hegemonic and dastardly needs. This is an important work that should, no doubt, be a cornerstone of any Black Studies, Political Science, or World History class."},{"Title":"The World and Africa","review":"This book further highlights the brilliance of W.E.B. DuBois. He masterfully articulates the contributions of Africa to the world, contributions that most people are not aware of. This is not the type of book that some people might classify as just another attempt to put a black face on history. To think that is not to know Dr. Dubois. This book is scholarship.DuBois was the first African-American to receive a PhD. from Harvard University. His other education came from some of the best schools in the United States and Europe. His methods of research were more of a scientist than a historian or surveyor. It was through his meticulous methodolory that we have much of what we now call sociology. (His dissertation was entitled \\"The Suppression of the African Slave Trade\\", also in print.)Being of mixed heritage, DuBois experienced privilege and discrimination, all making him very critical of oppression and racism.This book takes the reader back to some of the first encounters between Africa and Europe, highlighting many consequences of those encounters. He looked at the beginnings of civilization (in Ethiopia and the along the Nile Valley) and the inner workings of the slave trade. Kusha and Nubia are given a place in world history, as well as the kingdoms of Ghana, Mali and Songhai.As a sociologist, DuBois laid out the results of free labor and the products that gave wealth to Europe and America. One chapter is entitled \\"The Rape of Africa\\", where he looked at the resources that were taken from Africa like labor and diamonds among other things. You even get a look at the Pan-African Movement, the need to bring Africans in the Diaspora together for a common cause. You actually begin to see how DuBois and Booker T. Washington clashed on isssues and how DuBois starts to pick up some of the ideas of nationalist Marcus Garvey. There is a statement he makes on p. 310 ending an address to the people of Ghana on the future of Africa in 1958 at age 90 where he says, \\" You have nothing to lose but your chains! You have a continent to regain! You have freedom and human dignity to attain!\\" Quite different from the integrationist that history so vividly spotlights.I personally found the end of the book most interesting. DuBois wrote of the effects of capitalism on the world. His analysis brought forth the idea that the desire for personal gain justified the treatment of others that were differents. There are copies of speeches that he gave while in his 90's, still showing his intellectual prowess and his disdain for the conditions that effected African-Americans and the African continent (this is during the 1960s). He spoke to the importance of having an independent African continent and relationships with China and the Soviet Union.I'm glad that these parts are at the end because DuBois' communist reputation would taint the brilliance of the book. The end is were it becomes evident that he has socialist views. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to make some real connections between some of the world's current situations and the past. Dr. DuBois gives us insight on World Wars I and II, the beginnings of the Pan-African Movement (and if you read between the lines, he plants some seeds of the Niagra Movement and the NAACP) and African Independence Movement of the 1960's (led by Kwame Nkrumah).The closest we have seen to this type of critial thinking and reflection on European dominance of the world is Dr. Cornel West. WEB DuBois is one of greatest minds the United States has produced, in the catagory of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Yet he will never get his just due because he was a registered Communist and America has no sympathy for Communists."},{"Title":"The World and Africa","review":"A wonderful overview of the monumental role African people have played in history before the slave trade.Some of the topics in this book include Black Ancient Egypt, how the Greeks and the Romans revered Blacks and held black africans in such a positive light, Black African(MOORS) conquest of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the medieval West African kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay who were world renown for their tremendous wealth and military power, and various other pertinent topics in African history.I especially like the \\"Rape of Africa\\" chapter, as Du Bois provides a thorough explanation as to the devastating impact the slave trade had on Western and Central African civilizations/societies. He also discusses how the slave trade catapulted Europe ahead of the rest of the world in terms of wealth and power. They dont seem to teach this information in high schools.For those who want an introduction to Black African history and why people of African descent are struggling in the world today, this book is for you. This is probably the best introduction to Black African history book that I have ever read. Another book to read along with this book is J.A Roger's \\"Nature Knows no Color\\", a book that discusses many the same things that Du Bois addresses but provides better background information of each topic. We need to have both of these books read to all black people!"},{"Title":"The World and Africa","review":"This book is well worth, your time and a must read for anyone that wants to understand Africa and it's contribution to the world."},{"Title":"The World and Africa","review":"The World And Africa - The Book EVERY Black Person Must Read.

This guide was very well written and helpful to those planning to move here or even just visiting. Even if you know the city very well, you'll most likely not be let down by some glaring omissions which have so far been demonstrated in other reviews to be non-existent. What you may find are some interesting things that some residents didn't even know about. This book does a wonderful job of exposing the reader to what this city has to offer. I have only one gripe with this book. Please, please, please, don't put \\"Ohio\\" after Columbus on the cover/side for the next edition. I'm certain we won't have to worry about Columbus, GA warranting its own guidebook anytime soon.

She neglects the entirety of the area known as Olde Towne East. She neglects historic Livingston Park. She neglects the entirety of the Gay Community.

It is difficult feeling your way around a new territory- especially when many of your friends and colleagues are in the same boat. One of the first things I looked for was information about parks and bike trails- and was pleased with the overall information. A previous review states the absence of Inniswood Gardens, but I beg to differ- it's one of my favroite retreats and I was very excited to see it included. In fact, there are five pages dedicated to the city's MetroParks (pgs. 151-156) and there is even a helpful insiders' tip about Inniswood (pg 154). One thing I did notice, is the index does not include several places that are discussed in the book- such as Inniswood. The indexer seems to have overlooked quite a few things, but it's not to say it isn't in there. As a critical, but conscientious reader I suggest not expecting the index to be a definitive listing of everything in this guide. What I like particularly is how the author manages to spread information across the various chapters. Random restaurants, stores and history pop up in unrelated chapters, keeping it interesting for those of us who do read the book. Like someone else wrote earlier- this isn't a boring book of lists and it isn't arranged as such. The Insiders Guide to Columbus is receiving this positive review by a very thankful grad student. --DJM"},{"Title":"Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio (Insiders' Guide Series)","review":"As a resident of Columbus for over 38 years, I was curious to see what info one could glean from Ms. Kelley's book. After spending a few hours sifting through the chapters, I was amazed at how little I actually knew about my own city. Particularly helpful were the obvious efforts by the author to visit the establishments about which she wrote. I now have a desire to visit some places in Columbus that I had written off in the past. Although Columbus is not quite New York City, it is a growing, vibrant town with plenty to see and do. I think the author does an excellent job of highlighting the best our city has to offer.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in visiting or relocating."},{"Title":"Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio (Insiders' Guide Series)","review":"Being a life-long resident of this great city of ours, I began to realize the tough job it had to of been in writing this book, with the ever changing facets in our city.

Ms. Kelley definitely takes into account many different places and perspectives from all over the city- and there are a lot of them! It seems to me she touched on a little bit of everything. Like a previous reviewer commented, it is a selective guide book and not a comprehensive directory to every little corner of the city. I am a fan!"},{"Title":"Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio (Insiders' Guide Series)","review":"I think it's appropriate to say that Ms. Kelley can call Columbus her \\"hometown\\" after living here for nearly 10 years. She is not a native to the city, but has made her mark in Columbus just the same. I'd like to think that one native would not scold someone else for feeling at home in their much loved city. How long must one live somewhere to call it home?Gays fight to be viewed as equal and not to be singled out, therefore the community as a whole was not singled out. Gay and lesbian information is clearly integrated into the book, especially the dining, pubs and nightlife chapter. Old Towne East is covered on page 267- no more or no less than other parts of the downtown area. Please take the time to read through the book closely.Please remember - this is a travel guide. Not a phone book. This guide, like any other guide, is not meant to be an exhaustive listing of everything in the city, rather a selective sampling of what the city has to offer.

I thought I knew as much as anyone could know about Elvis. I was dead wrong. Pamela Keogh's fresh and insiteful look at Elvis Presley's life and career had me entranced. From the minute I read the first page I knew I could not put this book down. Her take on Elvis and the incredible impact he had on the world is compelling.

Before Elvis there was the War. Before that the Depression, before that the first War. Mixed in with all this there was the Jazz age, the big band era, and swing. But Elvis carved new territory. With a sound all his own, Elvis found a niche somewhere between where the black artists of the day were trying to go and the mainstream of popular/country/gospel.Untutored, Elvis was a natural showman. His hair, dress, and stage antics were enough to drive parents nuts, and to drive their kids straight to him. The onstage Elvis was a very different person than the private Elvis. And here, through interviews with the people who knew him best, by extensive use of the Graceland archives, and including more than a hundred images, many rarely seen before, is what may be the definitive biography.Ms. Keogh has managed to capture the magic of Elvis on stage with the private person. She sums up her book: \\"Elvis. He was generous, he was kind, he was rambunctious, and, at times lonely, but who among us is not? By any measure, he lived a ful life, and even today, he does not fail to live.\\""},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life.

Apart from my obvious joy at seeing Ms. Keogh's previously unpublished photos and stories about The King, I was inexplicably drawn into her writing from the very first line.

However many of the stories and words in the book have been read and heard elsewhere...de ja vu? Also, there are some inaccuracies in the book(albeit minor) where only die-hard elvis fans like myself would notice. Nevertheless, the book is a fast read that's entertaining with accompanying photos and is a good addition to every Elvis fan's collection.As a side note, I highly recommend Peter Guralnick's &quot;Last Train to Memphis&quot; and &quot;Careless Love&quot; - the best and most compelling books on Elvis ever written!"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man.

The Life. The Legend.","review":"\\"Before Elvis, there was nothing,\\" said John Lennon. He was referring to music. We all know the universe, earth and humankind existed before Elvis Presley. Lennon was right, though. Modern music began with Elvis. Before Elvis, music was meaningless and worthless.Elvis Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His parents were Vernon and Gladys Presley. There was a twin brother, who died at birth. Elvis grew up in a two-room house which Vernon built. He was close to his mother, a relationship which defined his personality. His family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when Elvis was 13. They moved into the projects. Elvis was a misfit at school. He wore flashy clothes and hung out on Beale Street. He listened to black musicians play the blues. He had rhythm. After high school, he took a job driving a truck for an electric company. He decided to record a song as a gift to his mother. He went to Sun Records in Memphis. Sun was owned by Sam Phillips. Marion Keisker, who worked for Phillips, saw something in Elvis. She suggested to Phillips that he work with him. Phillips put Elvis with guitar player Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black and drummer D.J. Fontana. The result was That's Alright Mamma. Memphis radio stations picked it up. Other recordings for Sun followed, and Elvis caught on across the south. Girls loved him. They screamed and swooned. Parents detested his gyrations and called him vulgar. The new music was rock & roll. The older generation called it everything from \\"nigger music\\" to \\"devil's music.\\" RCA purchased Elvis' contract from Phillips for $35,000. They got a bargain. Elvis had his first number one record in January, 1956, with Heartbreak Hotel. Others followed: Hound Dog, Don't Be Cruel, All Shook Up and Too Much. Elvis appeared on television, the Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan shows. Sullivan insisted he only be shown from the waist up. It added fuel to the fire. Hollywood beckoned, and Elvis made his first movie, Love Me Tender. In two years, he had laid the foundation for the music which would dominate into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life.

References to Jackie Onassis, Audry Hepburn, and JFK, on the whole, added little.Priscilla's voice seemed loud and clear. While that helped in understanding her relationship with Elvis, it made the book appear one-sided. Still, Elvis' intense relationship with Ann-Margret was acknowledged.There were some interesting new details, but very few. I wondered what compelled the author to write the book. Perhaps hearing the old stories in a new publication, or by a new author makes them fresh again. There are always new books on Elvis, and I find myself buying one more."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"I have always been an Elvis fan & have read a lot of books, articles, etc., about the man. But THIS book totally engrossed me!There was so much trivia I never knew. A WONDERFUL 50's picture with Sophia Loren sitting on his lap that I never knew existed.Ms. Keogh wrote an extremely fair & balanced story of this remarkable man, neither saint nor sinner, but human. She did not demonize him solely as a bloated, drug addict, nor endow sainthood by writing Elvis-can-do-no-wrong.I think that any Elvis fan will appreciate all the little things included in this book, along with the extreme fairness with which this cultural icon has been treated by Ms. Keogh!Now, I can't wait to read her other books!"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"The book is an intersting read, not a tour de force, but compelling, the pictures are fantastic and the stories about people that were a part of Elvis' life are neat. Bernard Lansky his clothier who fancied up a young Elvis in cool shades of black pink and other colors. The author writes in her own way to give the reader a glimpse of never heard information along with already known news, but if you are a fan of the King, this is a must have for your collection."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"With Pamela Clarke Keogh's book, Elvis moves deeper into the, \\"Establishment's\\" consciouness. The author of biographies on Audrey Hepburn and Jackie Onnasis knows in her heart the book will sell like hot cakes!The usual descriptions of Elvis and his astounding career are polished and set forth for a discerning readership. Eyes will widen and eager fingers will search through the expanding Elvis catalogue. Opened ears will then hear the pages!!! That is what is the essence of this book - it is a fresh Guide to Elvisland."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"Pamela Keogh has an extraordinary talent for tapping into the very essence of style icons through fashion and lifestyle.In Elvis Presley: The Man, The Life. The Legend--Keogh has a rich subject, which she handles with intelligence and fun. Elvis Presley is the ultimate American icon, reigning in the days before advertising sponsors, product placements and endorsements. The book is a joy to read, a must-have for all Elvis fans or those who just want to have a deeper understand of this larger-than-life artist."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life. The Legend.","review":"I agree with all the other five star reviews and want to add that the audio-book version has a great female narrator that puts a real edge on this unigue look at Elvis. There's something about her voice and performance that brings the authors already exciting details of the Elvis story to life. I was surprised at the new details that came up and how the dramatizations of certain events made me really feel like I was there with Elvis shopping at Lanzkey's, recording at Sun Records, and performing on stage.Even if audio-books aren't your thing, you might give it a try. However, after reading the other reviews I also know that this would be a great book to sit with quietly and take it in at your own speed and 'inner voice'. Either way, the author really got a new slant and style to the retelling of how a poor boy with his father working on a chain gang came to fame and changed pop culture forever."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man.

I have little time to myself, but the teacher gave me the book for Christmas! I loved it! I wanted to read more but was so busy. I JUST finished the book and I loved the photos, the details of what I already knew and NEW information. This is great for a more casual fan I was told, and it is true! It focuses on the good (that is how the teacher is!) She purchashed many copies for people and I was a lucky receiver! This is a great book and a must have for new, casual or die hard fans (die hard is the teacher) and I am grateful for the book. I wish the author knew how great this book is and helpful to me. If it was good enough for the teacher to buy 2 dozen for gifts, it is well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley: The Man. The Life.

Told in an energetic style, it has the crackling narrative drive of a great novel. Fans will adore it; it's a beautiful book, full of stunning black-and-white photos of the King, some seldom seen. And it will delight anyone interested in the style secrets of an icon, from his clothes to his Graceland furniture. The coolest book on Elvis ever."},{"Title":"Just Mahalia, Baby","review":"I read this lengthy story many years ago. In the meantime I was privileged to meet one of Mahalia's former pianists, Rev. J. D. Strawther, who is so listed in the book. Hearing Strawther's chronicle of his experience with the powerful singer made the book come alive to me. I am a very strong admirer of the late Clara Ward, and enjoyed reading, from Mahalia's viewpoint, about the relationship of the Ward Singers and Miss Jackson.It is extremely admiral to see how that Mahalia pulled herself up by her own bootstraps in a day and time when that was very difficult, and given her problem with timing in regards to her vocal singing. It must have taken a lot of courage for Laurraine to write the good, the bad and the ugly; and some instances were rather disappointing. But she wrote as she was instructed, &quot;Don't make me no saint, baby.&quot;"},{"Title":"Just Mahalia, Baby","review":"Great biography! I have always enjoyed reading about the world's greatest singer, and this biography simply takes out all the stops and tells about the true Mahalia, in her own words. Mahalia, I miss you more and more each day, because no one sings like you or as well as you sang."},{"Title":"Just Mahalia, Baby","review":"I first bought the hardback copy in, I think, 1975. It was a labor of love reading this extensive work, as Mahalia Jackson requested this book in response to \\"a vast wave of dissatisfaction\\" with much in print about herself. Moreover, I finally did contact Laurraine Goreau and spoke with her on the phone about her work, Mahalia, and other issues. Ms. Goreau was candid, warm, and helpful. Her book was taken from extensive interviews with luminaries such as Jacqueline Onassis, Studs Terkel, Irving Townsend (Columbia record producer) and many others. She incorporated actual tape recordings she had made with Mahalia since 1967. The story begins at the early 20th century in New Orleans and details Jackson's life and the culture surrounding her. It elaborates extensively on her mystical life and visionary state. We as readers follow her through the streets of New Orleans, Jim Crow life, the Baptist and Sanctified Churches, the dinner table, the Mississippi River, the Crackerjack (Voodoo store), the Catholic Church making novenas, etc., and thus we discover that Mahalia was a woman eclectically motivated and exposed to multicultural forces. She was extremely complex, intelligent, self-actualized, and as the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated \\"in harmony with her own nature.\\" The train trip to Chicago, the decades of struggling to make ends meet, failed marriages, Thomas Dorsey, Carnegie Hall, Europe, Africa, India, and Japan are only a few events that shed intriguing insights into the psyche of this extraordinary woman. Her anxieties, illnesses, and temper shed further light on the broader scope of her personality. This book is an interesting cultural as well as psychological study of Mahalia Jackson. At the end, the reader has the sense that, as Seneca stated, \\"The conclusion is, not that hardships are desirable, but that virtue is desirable, which enables us patiently to endure hardships\\" (Epistle LXVII). Mahalia Jackson had more than her fair share of hardships. Her courage, humor, and determination serve to demonstrate an incredible drive to overcome. That she did!"},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"This book provides a non-nonsense look at what a man can expect (and how he can contribute most effectively) during pregnancy and as a father. There is a particular focus on the first few months of fatherhood - which are frankly the months that worry me the most as my wife enters month nine!Sears' presents a straightforward philosophy based on nurturing the child (often by taking care of the mother). He presents nurture as fundamental to (1) providing a structured, trusting environment so that the child may develop and learn, (2) building a solid foundation for a well-disciplined child, and (3) establishing a relationship that allows your child to assume values that the parents want rather than those from other role models.As I reflect on the book, most of it seems to be common sense, but it certainly was not obvious before my reading. I would recommend this book to all men about to have a child."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. I have used many of the ideas from Dr. Sears book to raise my two children. I own five other fathering books but this is by far the best and most practical one.Lets face it, there is little support or literature for fathering. I think society expects men to raise their children just like our dads did. Most of the available fathering literature is written by men with one or two children and psychology degrees. Dr. Sears has six kids and is a busy pediatrician.Especially if you are a first time father, do your child a favor. Buy and read this book."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"Dr. Sears is the acknowledged leader in the attachment parenting movement, with many well-received books to his name. Like his other titles, _Becoming a Father_ emphasizes early bonding, positive discipline, and respect for the child's physical and emotional needs. To the extent that all fathers need to hear this message, this is an excellent book. So why the low rating? Because despite his child-positive message, Dr. Sears is caught in a time warp when it comes to models of masculinity. Underlying his arguments for an active role for fathers are assumptions that this reader found frustratingly rigid and occasionally downright offensive. An example:&quot;The growing child should see that important family matters require a mutual decision-making process that involves both mom and dad, but I believe that dad is primarily responsible for making decisions.&quot; (p. 194)Even more troubling is the author's attitude toward homosexuality, which seems to be informed more by conservative religious values than by current medical knowledge:&quot;'I don't want my son to grow up to be a pansy,' exclaimed John, a new father. His sentiments are shared by most men.&quot; (p. 200)For those readers who aren't already aware of the meaning--or should I say &quot;demeaning&quot;?--of this slur, Dr. Sears goes on to define a &quot;pansy&quot; as &quot;an effeminate boy.&quot; Given the author's 1950s-style ideas of masculinity, I'd hate to think how he would judge a boy who, after watching his father wearing a younger sibling in a sling, asked for a doll to play with. He concludes:&quot;I am personally concerned that our society tends to approve of lifestyles [sic!] such as homosexuality. Society sees this as an 'acceptable alternative.' I can accept a person as a homosexual without having to approve of the morality of homosexuality.&quot; (p. 208)If this &quot;love the sinner, hate the sin&quot; attitude reflects your own beliefs, you will probably get a lot out of this book. But if you take a more egalitarian view of male-female relationships and don't believe--and most mainstream doctors do not--that weak paternal role models &quot;cause&quot; homosexuality, you may want to look elsewhere for advice on fathering. To be fair, there is much of value in this book, but the truly helpful ideas can be gleaned from Sears's array of other works (such as _The Baby Book_) or from other attachment parenting guides, like Katie Granju's _Attachment Parenting_."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"Yes indeed. Why? I do not know. But, my husband read this book cover to cover. It was the ONLY book he read to prepare for the birth of our daughter.His issue, and mine, has a lot to do with Dr. Sears' consistently characterizing Dad as &quot;helper&quot;, someone secondary in importance to Mom and incapable of being motherly.His writing style is kind of folksy if you like that.If you are really liberal and politically correct,you will not appreciate this book or this man for that reason and for the wayyou may perceive his views on gender identity and development in children.If words like conservative, traditional are anathema to you, leave the book on the shelf."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"Both my husband and I read this book before our first child was born. We both found it to be very practical, hands-on, and informative. Many parenting books give the same information over and over and it tends to be \\"common knowledge\\" if you are halfway educated. This book provided new ideas for bonding and involving the father in the child's relationship. As a breastfeeding mother, I especially appreciated his detailed advice and guidance for the father on how to support a nursing mom and baby. I am a licensed parent educator and I will reference this book for infant parenting classes. In regards to the \\"A Customer\\" review that felt the book was sexist and unsupportive of homosexuality - I disgree. Perhaps the quotes are taken out of context, because I am very liberal and open-minded and I NEVER got that feeling after reading the book many times now."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: How to Nurture and Enjoy Your Family (Growing Family)","review":"It has been difficult to find a book for dads that is not filled w corny jokes and no brainier info.

Not only does it give hope to fallen leaders and those who love and serve under them, it also gives great encouragement to each individual in the body of Christ. We all have dead things in our lives in need of God's restoring power and this book speaks truth to the lies satan and the world tells us regarding the possibility of healing and restoration for our broken places. The world and the church sometimes looks on the sins of others with hopelessness and judgment while God looks on the ruins of our life with compassion. Only someone who was in need of this compassion and the revelation of the absolute restoring power of God could write this book. How refreshing it is to read a book by someone who goes beyond the mere knowledge of restoration to share the pain and ultimate joy of living in the restoring power of God. Before you give up on a situation in your life or the life of another, read this book!"},{"Title":"HE RESTORES: God's Plan to Restore Fallen Leaders","review":"An intrigueing book - and one that is much needed in the world today.

This book is a much needed resource for leaders all over the world. Mr. Baldwin did a great job writing. His passion and humanity comes through the pages. What is so inspiring about the book is the progression of the theme. He begins with such encouragement to those who have fallen. He gives hope! But as you continue reading, he does not dodge the true issues of sin and failure. He hits the problem head on, but gives hope for recovery.If you know a leader who has lost his position or integrity because of a failure, whether in the church or in secular society, HE RESTORES is an excellant book for them.I hope we hear more from Mr. Baldwin. He is an excellant writer. I'll be looking for other books in the future. 5 STARS FROM ME!!!!"},{"Title":"HE RESTORES: God's Plan to Restore Fallen Leaders","review":"The author addresses many of the issues involved in recovery, being careful to provide the biblical foundation for his assertions. He argues in favor of believing for restoration. In some places he alludes to things he learned in his own recovery process. He advocates accountability to others, such as the need for one-on-one time with a fellow leader or leaders. He leaves the impression that recovery of a leader requires help from other leaders rather than a lay Christian recovery team. He addresses hindrances like bitterness, shame, self-pity, discouragement, and problems dealing with the past. He says little about how to go about dealing with these issues one-on-one.This book lies midway between a narrative of recovery like \\"Restoring the Fallen\\" by Earl D. Wilson, which documents how a lay Christian recovery team actually went about achieving the recovery goal, and \\"Restoration Manual\\" by Thomas L. Pedigo, which basically provides an extremely comprehensive list of components useful for recovery, together with assembly instructions."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"A seminal work on queer spirituality and historical interpretationArthur Evans was one of the earliest stalwarts of the gay liberation movement and one of the founders of New York's Gay Activist Alliance. Born in 1942, Arthur Evans studied at Brown University and received his doctorate from Columbia University (in philosophy). While at Brown, he and friends formed the Brown Freethinkers Society, describing themselves as 'militant atheists' with the objective of combating the harmful effects of organized religion. At Columbia, he was instrumental in the founding of the Student Homophlie League, one of the few campus gay organizations to precede the Stonewall uprising. He is the author of a 1997 3-volume work on queer perspectives on philosophy entitled \\"Critique of Patriarchal Reason\\" of which Volume 1 has been published.\\"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture\\" (\\"WAGC\\") is one of the seminal works of the queer spirituality movement.The book opens with a recounting of the May 30, 1431 burning alive of a young French girl, a transvestite, named Joan of Arc. The book, while primarily \\"an expos&eacute; of the role of homophobia in the European witch hunts\\" is actually much more than that. It offers a thoroughly researched and well documented chronicle of the Christian Church's genocidal murders of heretics, women and queer folk, moving from the medieval near equation of heresy with sodomy and vice-versa (\\"How can you call me a Cathar - I, a married man with children!\\") through the suppression of same-sexed intimacy amongst the third world victims of European colonization through to what was the present day (which is to say, the 1970's).What the author had to say thirty years ago is still relevant and appropriate today, though some have taken issue with his justification of the use of violence in over-coming oppression.A careful reading, though, shows this not to be \`justification' but simply \`explanation' of why and how the then nascent gay movement might understandably have (but didn't) become violent in view of the fact that \\"Christian violence was responsible for the birth of the modern nation-state ...\\" and as witnessed by the contemporaneous rise of the radical fundamentalist Christian right and the presidential election of Ronald Reagan. The author of \\"WAGC\\" shared with many of us then the sentiment that \\"the other shoe was about to drop\\" and the decade of openness birthed by the Stonewall uprising would be ended, likely in a hail of bullets.I recommend Arthur Evan's work for anyone interested in the history of the Christian Church, queer spirituality or queer history."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"The best part about this book is that Evans offers a historical text which is an alternative to the histories printed by other researchers and writers of the past. His links to other texts, etymologies and traditions is quite substantial and his application of this learning to modern day times in the Western world is still appropriate today, even though this book was written in the 1970's. The only drawback is that he advocates the use of violence in activism in order to get the gay/witchcraft point across, and although this may just be a sign of the time when this book was written, it does put a bit of a dampener on the rest of the text, especially when taking into consideration the wiccan rede. However, this book is a must read for any witch studying history, or any lesbian, gay or bisexual person trying to trace their historical roots."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"This little book is full of amazing and interesting material. I highly recommend it to any LBGT person that is interested in Witchcraft, alternative lifestyles and religions, and historical accounts.Although some of the information is dry and dated, the overall presentation of information is excellent. I bought my copy used and even though the condition of the book wasn't great, the content definately made up for it.This is the type of book that should be in every queer library.

His review of pre modern history, as pertaining to medieval religeous history is just as good as any of our more christian based histories. And in some aspects, it is. whether his view is considered extreme from the reliouse right, and it is. and whether it has any more worth of consideration, and it does. is something that needs to be judged not on the authors worth, but the worth of what you do based on the author's claims. Go and research them on your own time. This is his challenge to you. How much of our understanding of history is based on the political motivations of today."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"A book with a title such as this lends itself to far too much speculation. True, the book could have been another one of those pseudo new-age self-help books about \\"finding one's inner spirit\\" or somesuch. However, Evans provides an excellent historical lineage for concepts and ideas that are perdominant in both religious imagery and gay culture. I would have preferred a bit more detail in tracing certain images, but for anyone looking for a crash course in how homosexuality and witchcraft are related, without any superflous details about how to bewitch a lover or cure heartbreak, this book is a must have. Especially interesting for those interested in comparitive religions!"},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"This excellent book details the direct connections between our cultural mistreatment of homosexuals and the European/American historical religious killing of 'witches' (women 'considered bad') by Christians."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture","review":"Evans' book broke new ground when it established the link between the historic oppression of gay people and the religion of Witchcraft.

You have to experience it. Main character Alton Hayman is such a perplexing mixture of whiskey slamming Texas outlaw and Lone Ranger, you have to step into his boots and grow with him, just to understand what he's about. And when you do, you can feel the white-hot sweat of fear running down the back of his neck in the relative cool of a South Texas night and feel the knots in his stomach that only \\"Jack Black\\" can relieve.Hayman isn't fearless. But even in his youth he demonstrated a fearless faade that gave him a reputation. \\"I would stand up for what I thought was right and would not back down from anything,\\" Hayman reminisces.After a stint in the paratroopers, Hayman begins his career as a Federal Narcotics Agent, as a brand new member of the United States Customs Office, in Laredo, Texas on the Mexican/US border. He believes in his cause.His relative innocence is not to last for long, however. He quickly discerns that, in his job, it is every man for himself, as agents are rewarded on the basis of cases made, not cooperation and teamwork. Hayman lives in a world of informants that may or may not tell the truth and agents that are only as trustworthy as their own best interests. He learns that drinking on the job is expected--a not unwelcome revelation-and that \\"Customs doesn't give a...what you do, as long as you can ... produce.\\" During the course of his first year, Hayman remarks, \\"In the eight months that I had been in Laredo, I had been shaped and molded into a much different person. I was no longer the nave trusting person that had come to Laredo.\\"From his innocent beginnings, Hayman's drive to succeed compels more and more dangerous encounters, many alone, at night, on the banks of the Rio Grand River. He discovers that stops at the US Customs stations will not fill the bill , so he resorts to isolated river crossings, making his way, through rattlesnake infested brush, to lie in wait for smugglers, without backup, under a darkened sky. His tools were minimal: a Browning 9mm with an extra clip and a pump, a .12 gauge shotgun, a flashlight, snacks, coffee, plastic handcuffs and a snakebite kit. He quickly discovers that the smugglers have machine guns, leaving him well out gunned, but even this does not stop Hayman, whose risk-taking behavior causes him to grow in status daily, due to the number and size of cases he is making.But the risks he takes are not lacking in consequences. Hayman continues to work for the Customs department for several years, making increasingly dangerous and sophisticated busts, and he continues to drink. His obsession with his work grows and his inattentiveness to his wife and child grows right alongside. He makes a transformation from regular guy to federal agent, something that you almost sense he regrets, looking back. He then moves to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, a move that will further erode his confidence in the cause that he has chosen to pursue.At points in the book, it is impossible to tell whether the good guys are good or the bad guys are bad, with the hero taking on significantly concerning characteristics, while observing concerns of his own in the other agents. Over the course of his career, the stress of the job takes its toll on Haymon, who suffers post traumatic stress syndrome from too many near death experiences and appears, at times, to have fallen completely apart.This book is about the human condition. Anyone who has ever felt fear and moved forward even when the odds were worse than bad; anyone who has ever questioned their own innate goodness; anyone who has experienced stress beyond their ability to cope; anyone who likes the excitement of the chase and values the toughness and determination of the Old West; anyone who wants a glimpse into the dangerous world of narcotics agents and smugglers and the dangerous world of a man's mind, will find this book fascinating. The main character will challenge the reader and make the reader think.The author, Thormalen, was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1940 and grew up in Alice, Texas, which explains his realistic depiction of the climate and geography of Hayman's surroundings. Thormalen has worked as a police officer, criminal investigator for the Customs Agency Service in the Treasury Department and as a special agent with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the Justice Department. After leaving the Justice Department, he taught law enforcement at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas, where he also served as department chairman, Dean of Men and Dean of Students. He also worked as a middle school counselor in San Antonio.Thormalen says to keep in mind that this story is a novel, not an autobiography, and the main character, Alton Hayman, is a composite of himself and others. He emphasized, \\"The characters are fictional and if anyone says that they see themselves in the book, they are mistaken.\\" On the contrary, Thormalen notes, \\"This is as accurate a portrayal of the true life of a Federal Narcotics Agent's life as I can make it [and stay out of court and not get shot].\\"Thormalen conceived of the idea for the book when teaching Criminal Justice at Sul Ross University in Alpine, Texas. He was having difficulty finding a good, honest text for his senior level class, \\"Special Problems in Law Enforcement.\\" Thormalen says, I thought it was important for the kids that were my students at the time and just entering \`the life' to have a true and honest idea of what lay ahead of them; so as to avoid some of the true pitfalls.\\"In closing Thormalen noted, \\"Change can never take place unless you have the strength to look the truth in the face; and change was what I was hoping for both for myself and our government.\\""},{"Title":"The Right Side of the Law: Reminiscences of a Federal Narcotics Agent","review":"A great story -- I stayed up all night long to finish it -- and cried at all that happened in this brave young man's life. Very-well written, seems true to life."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"The best historical writing combines the quality of scholarship with that of literature, and that's what we have here. First published in 1947, this book is a deserved classic. It's the story of the Rocky Mountain fur trade in the latter half of the 1830s, a time of outrageous characters and extraordinary deeds, set against the finest landscape. DeVoto resolutely refuses to judge people of the 1830s by the standards of a later century. This is what infuriates the &quot;politically correct&quot;. But DeVoto is surely right - any other approach might tell you something about the historian's own time but would shed little light on the period under study. Instead DeVoto's honesty brings his characters vividly to life. That doesn't only mean the fur trappers. He has a detailed and discerning knowledge of the Plains Indians, and appreciates the cultural, linguistic and indeed political diversity of the various nations. The Native Americans emerge as striking individuals in their own right. The book has been called romantic. Well, DeVoto is certainly keenly aware of the romantic quality of his epic tale, but he doesn't romanticize things. He's much too good a historian to make unprovable assertions. Always he has the evidence to hand, and if he repeats a tall tale, it's only for the pleasure of the telling and he's careful to point out when the source can't be trusted. His depth of research combined with a keen eye for the relevant detail make for a highly readable result. What all this adds up to is an elegy for two lost ways of life - that of the fur trappers and that of the Plains Indians, who managed to be friends and enemies at the same time. But both were swept away by outside forces that were huge and irresistable - Manifest Destiny as it was called, and its expression in the great migration to the West starting in the 1840s. Reading this book is like listening to an old friend telling great tales by the campfire on a warm evening. Fine work indeed."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"Across the Wide MissouriMr. DeVoto has a passion for this subject and a passion for the characters that live in it.Here are some excerpts from the book:\\"There were few delicate feeders in the mountains...The river tribes liked the green, putrid flesh of buffalo drowned while crossing the ice and hauled ashore weeks later, \`so ripe, so tender, that very little boiling is required.' They ate the kidneys raw... the white man would eat the liver raw as soon as it was taken; he seasoned it with the gall or sometimes with gunpowder...he had no more tableware than his belt knife - gravy, juices and blood running down his face, forearms and shirt. He wolfed the meat and never reached repletion. Eight pounds a day was standard ration for Hudson Bay employees [but often eat twice that amount]...melted fat was gulped by the pint. Kidney fat could be drunk without limit...Hump and boss boil in a kettle, cracked marrow bones sizzle by the fire...Camp is pitched by a small creek or a rushing mountain river...Here is the winesap air of the high places, the clear, green sky of evening fading to a dark that brings the stars within arm's length, the cottonwoods along the creek rustling in the wind. The smell of meat has brought wolves and coyotes almost to the circle of firelight. They skulk just beyond it; sometimes a spurt of flame will turn will turn their eyes to gold...Horses and mules crop the bunch grass at the end of their lariats or browse on leaves along the creek. The firelight flares and fades in the wind's rhythm on the faces of men in whose minds are the vistas and the annuls of the entire West.\\"If you are yearning for a dry narrative of the fur trade, this is not your book. This book gives you a feel for the land and a feel for the kinds of men involved in the fur trade. It gives you a feel for the hardships that they faced, the cutthroat business practices of the trade and how instrumental these men were to opening up the west for settlement. He does not sanitize history or historical figures. He presents the good and the bad of both the individual fur traders and the various Indian tribes that were most closely linked to the fur trade.As it turns out, this is not a simple story to tell or to organize into a linear narrative. There were many different characters and crosscurrents cutting through the entire period. He weaves this story together with the sinew provided by the movements of a few of the most important mountain men: Jim Bridger, Tom Fitzpatrick, Joe Meek, Bill and Milton Sublette and Kit Carson.He runs another colorful thread through the story made of missionaries. These are clearly the most foolish, most spiteful and most disagreeable people in the narrative. Some of them are also the most well-intentioned and tragic characters in the grand story. Of the missionaries' desire to convert the Nez Perce and Flathead Indians to Christianity, he says, \\"[Nez Perce] were superior Indians, they made no trouble, they liked and admired white men...Their desire for instruction in the mysteries was genuine and paramount, as clean as the desire of these Christians to give them what they wanted. Both desires were simple and altogether hopeless...The Indians receiving instruction were men of the age of polished stone...They tried, both Indians and whites. There they stood, the seekers and the bearers of truth...the sincerity of these Indians' desire for religious instruction could not be doubted.\\" And yet this first wave of missionaries met with frustration, failure and murder.But the primary and repeated organizational thread that runs through this story is a fascinating and completely unlikely man named William Drummond Stewart. This man won the respect and deep friendship of all the great mountain men. He was kind, generous and good humored. Captain William Drummond Stewart of the British Army \\"was in his thirty-seventh year. He was the brother of Sir John Archibald Stewart, eighteenth of Grandtully and sixth baronet, and was next in succession to him...He went through the Hundred days with his regiment and fought at Waterloo.\\" He traveled the prairies and the mountains in comfort, elegance and style. He was as tough, as adventurous and as skillful as any of the mountain men. Yet there was not even a hint of royal superiority about him.Mr. DeVoto is a magnificent writer. If you are looking for an outstanding overview of the fur trade, this is your book. He also provides fascinating notes in the appendix and an extensive bibliography for those who are interested in further reading."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"Bernard Devoto wrote before the mavens of political correctness had the power to harm honest research and writing, so it is to be expected that some contemporary readers would be hurt and confused by his frank and realistic depiction of the west of the fur trappers. Devoto spent years researching this classic, then presented his findings in polished prose that evoked the period and the wild life of his subjects. This, like all of his historical works, is worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"A very romantic view of the subject by a master wordsmith. Reading, no, experiencing this book affected me very deeply, and I have since delved deeply into DeVoto's writing and his life. The reviewer who found this book to be poorly written has greatly different standards than do I, because this writer thinks it is a gorgeous book. I am fortunate to possess a first edition with many of the color paintings, captions for wich were the original purpose of the project. A must for anyone who wants to truly feel the early western experience."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"Whereas Ambrose's &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; got me interested in the early exploration of the American West, &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; got me interested in the actual lives of the mountain man and fur trapper/traders, and how they also explored unknown regions of the west. Their day to day existence and survival amongst the Indians, dealing with the forces of nature, the early stages of Manifest Destiny, etc. were all to me mind boggling. DeVoto brings to life the fur trade at the peak of its industry. I must agree with a couple reviewers though on how the text does get somewhat wordy and complex, the list of characters involved is quite lengthy and one is always flipping back and forth to the maps and notes. But this is what it takes to tell the whole story. From his bibliography one can pick and choose which books are of interest to the reader and take it from there, that's what I have done. I would recommend this book to those of you that are interested in this time period."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"I first heard of Bernard DeVoto while reading Wallace Stegner. If Stegner liked him, I thought, he must be worth reading. That turned out to be an understatement. DeVoto may be the greatest historian and man of letters this country has ever produced, and it's hard for me to believe that I came to such a ripe age before reading him. Of his great American trilogy, Across the Wide Missouri was the most enjoyable to me, simply because it tells the story of the Mountain Men, the trappers and fur traders, which I've always found interesting. He writes with the authority and panache of a great scholar, one who has researched his subject completely and relies only on first hand accounts, and transmits the knowledge he has gained as only the best of teachers can. Across the Wide Missouri is an enormous work that I will never forget, it reads like the best potboiler, and along with DeVoto's other works, has added immeasurably to my understanding of American history and my appreciation of great writers."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"Bernard De Voto's meticulously detailed account of the last days of the fur trade reveal the lives of the sometimes inspired, often desperate, original survivors, not the faux survivors we now watch on \\"reality\\" TV. Drawing largely from journals and records of the traders -- and noting spots where he doubts their credibility -- De Voto creates a compelling picture of the goings-on between the fur men and various native Plains tribes, a relationship that in many respects confounds our current understanding. It seems it was more varied and complex then we've been led to believe. Sometimes an uneasy friendship and respect prevailed, sometimes murder, but often it seemed both native peoples and fur traders were striving to exploit each other for all they could get. Most particularly he distinguishes between the tribes, their customs and proclivities. Clearly a fur trader's survival often depended on his ability to understand these differences. But De Voto's over-arching story of survival -- and, ultimately, defeat -- involves the brutal competition between the fur companies as each attempts to rule the trade. De Voto's voice is smart, robust, sometimes quite humorous. (Watch for irony.) However, coming to us from an age before the Civil Rights Movement, before the Women's Movement, the author does not share the benefits of our deeper, subtler understanding. That's the bad news. On the good side, he writes without self-censorship, uncurtailed by the obedience contemporary historians must show to the various academic conventions of our era."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"A detailed description of the Fur Trade that opened the West to further settlement.

There is a wealth of information in this book, but it will take a determined reader to decipher and translate just what DeVoto is trying to say and you just might find yourself re-reading paragraphs more often than not. I'm surprised his editor didn't force a rewrite. Fur trade novice's beware, this book is for those with more than a passing interest in the topic. But again, there is a wealth of information here if you have the time and patience to give this book."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"If you are doing historical research you will love this book. It is an extensive listing of names, locations and dates. However, I'm not sure what the point is of knowing that so-and-so was at xxx creek on a certain day. I would have liked more insight on individuals, more character development, a better understanding of what their lives and daily challenges were.The book doesn't flow--it is a collection of facts that are not well synthesized.Although the characterization of the Indians is certainly not politically correct today, it does reflect the experiences and attitudes of the time. It makes it clear that relations between Indians and the frontiersmen varied greatly by tribe, the individuals, and circumstances."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"I first read this book which I borrowed from my local Library about forty years ago, and I borrowed it again and again.

He jumps back and forward of the period under study in the book and goes into what I can only describe as historical diatribes every once in a while.The book is very readable in spite of these faults and his pictures of Whitman, Spaulding &amp; company add real flesh to people that are often overlooked or treated as one demensional.Two thoughts about editing: At the time &quot;Missouri&quot; was written, in the mid 40's, DeVoto was unquestionably the expert in the field and so he probably edited his own work. Not the best situation. Maybe he should have edited an updated edition of Chittenden's &quot;The American Fur Trade of the Far West&quot; instead and published a collection of historical essays on the period under his own name.As someone interested in the west I am glad I read it but will only be recommending it to a select few and maybe only parts of the book to others."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"There are a lot of things about this book I don't like.

You have to wonder why.If the author had stuck to his original premise, the Rocky Mountain fur trade in the mid to late 1830's, he would have had a winner. But only selected portions of that era seem to be here. Worse, Bernard DeVoto overlays so much extraneous information on what is here, in such a dense fashion, that this work becomes incredibly difficult to follow. It really is a very odd book. Many, far too many passages move beyond opaque; they become indecipherable. The reader winds up spending more time trying to understand the relevance of certain passages than he or she spends on the story itself.This book was written 57 years ago and literary styles have certainly changed. However, I think it is fair to say the author has a difficult time adequately communicating with his reader. The first half of the book is acceptable, but the last half reads like it was written by Edgar Allen Poe. DeVoto continuously makes up his own names for people, places and organizations. The result is a circuitous, nonsensical ramble much more based on myth than fact.I was very eager to read this work and have really liked other works by Bernard DeVoto. Having read it, I feel cheated. I hope you have much more luck with it than I did."},{"Title":"Across the Wide Missouri","review":"I found this book to be poorly written with historical &quot;embellishments&quot;even I, with limited knowledge, was aware of.It also contains one of the most misogynous passages I have read in along time on Indian women's sexual trade with the fur traders."},{"Title":"Complete Masonry: Building Techniques, Decorative Concrete, Tools and Materials (Sunset)","review":"Sunset has published several books on this subject, 3 of them called &quot;Complete Masonry&quot; with different subtitles and a basic one, possibly others. This is the only one that I've actually gone through cover to cover and it is superb. I have the Black and Decker flavor of Complete Masonry too and this one is far better at 1/2 the price.The projects described are quite a bit more appealing than the B&amp;D's plain cookie cutter boring wall and walkway offerings. More importantly this book offers better techniques of design that can be applied to your own unique design.Another of my favorites on the subject of concrete that is also applicable to walls, walkways, flooring or whatever else you wish to conjure is a book called &quot;Concrete Countertops: Design, Form, and Finishes for the New Kitchen and Bath&quot; It actually offers much more than what the title leads you to believe and suggests concrete as a very versitle replacement for standard brick and tile uses of the past."},{"Title":"Complete Masonry: Building Techniques, Decorative Concrete, Tools and Materials (Sunset)","review":"I bought Sunset's \\"Complete Masonry\\" because I am thinking about using concrete for my next kitchen counter top. I had heard on a radio home improvement program that concrete kitchen counters are popular in some other countries. Complete Masonry has one chapter on concrete counter tops, but the example they give is an outdoor barbecue, not a kitchen. The techniques can be adapted to a kitchen, but it's not the same as having illustrations of specifically what I want to do.Other than that, Complete Masonry has lots of information for the home gardener or handy person. You get pictures and details for laying out and construction of walks, stairs, patios, walls, ponds, rock gardens and all kinds of decorative and imaginative masonry work around the home. It's aimed at the home improvement market, not for the professional mason, although a professional might get some creative ideas from it's illustrations. Complete Masonry starts with very basic teaching such as \\"what is a shovel\\" and works up to include all the details you would need to construct the projects in the book. Like a lot of Sunset books it's full of ideas and examples of very elaborate projects, though the projects appear to have been done by skilled professionals. Even so, with a little practice you could probably finish any of the projects if you have a little construction skill and are willing to do the work. It's a good idea book, and a practical how-to home improvement book."},{"Title":"Complete Masonry: Building Techniques, Decorative Concrete, Tools and Materials (Sunset)","review":"This is a very well done book, and I enjoyed it very much.

A great potential villain is sketched out. But it all ends there. The storyline is soon abandoned. I kept reading and hoping for its reappearance.

There is total anonymity. What we see on the face of things is something to laugh at, something to puzzle over. It's easy to see the authors and artists of these trashed treasures as headcases or worse, until you see a love note from a shy obsessed teenager, or a diary entry from a solipsistic slacker, and you realize, I wrote something just like this once.I think the subtitle of the book, Evidence of the Human Condition, is quite fitting. In many cases, these articles are proof of what most people refuse to believe about themselves; that they are capable of baseness, depravity, meanness, fantasy, sickness, rage. Instead we find these things sloughed off into a dumpster, crumpled up in a ditch, or, in some of the more disturbing cases, placed deliberately in order to be found.I gave this book four stars instead of five because of the layout. While the transcription of some of the chicken scratch handwriting is helpful, there are sometimes hazy images in the background that are distracting and unnecessary. I think that the documentation can speak for itself, and embellishing it with extraneous or unexplained artwork enervates the impact of the compilation.Aside from this minor setback, I Found It! is sheer genius, leaving us with two questions: Why wasn't it done sooner? and When's Volume 2 out?"},{"Title":"Love Is for the Lucky (Thorndike Large Print Harlequin Series)","review":"Quite a nice story, didn't get you too involved that you couldn't put it down, but plesant enough.

He possessed prodigious intellectual talents as can be surmised by the scope and quality of his activities. He is also a recipient of the 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature for his various humanist writings.As someone who has a keen semi-professional interest in mathematics, and foundational issues of mathematics in particular, I have been familiar for a while with Russell's mathematical and logical works. His influence on those topics has been profound and enduring. Recently I have also read his short bookThe Problems of Philosophy. It is a short, pedagogical work that deals with some of the most enduring questions that have characterized philosophy. Russell is clearly an authority in the field, and this shows in his command of the topics that he discusses.Having these things in mind, I was expecting \\"Political Ideals\\" to be a very stimulating and intellectually sophisticated work worthy of the reputation of this great man. Unfortunately I was severely disappointed. This book is no enduring tract on political philosophy. I can think of many bright undergraduate students that I've known personally, from all parts of the political and ideological spectrum, who would have presented a much more coherent and persuasive account of their own political ideals. The tone of the book is polemical in the extreme, without much thought being given to any deep analysis. Russell makes many sweeping statements and complete generalizations without as much as hinting at demonstrating their validity. Despite his implied concern for the common man, Russell's overall attitude is that of a nave elitist. He seems to believe that the highest ideal that human beings aspire fro is the unbridled creativity. This sounds grand in principle, but in reality most people would much prefer to spend their leisure time engaging in some form of passive or semi-passive entertainment. One gets an impression that in Russell's mind an ideal society is one filled with identical replicas of Bertrand Russell. As I mentioned earlier, I am a big fan of much of Russell's work, but I'd rather live in a world dominated by ordinary Joe Schmos than in one filled with brilliant geniuses. And for that kind of world political ideals of Bertrand Russell leave a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Political ideals,","review":"My understanding of this book is that Bertrand Russell thought nationalism (more commonly called \\"patriotism\\" and seen as a good thing) was one of the main causes of war by creating the feeling that one's country is always right, which caused the suspicion against other countries and peoples, and that the \\"possessive\\" feeling for material goods that leads to greed and the desire for power that not only makes the leader of a country want to take territory from another in order to increase his power, but was the cause of colonialism, and in his view is a part of the competition that is inherent in capitalism, although that view of capitalism can be disputed.I think he viewed free trade as an important step, although a minor one, in reducing tensions among countries by showing that other countries had value to offer to us, which would make us more likely to want to cooperate with them in international affairs and therefore would reduce the likelihood of war and would show that other people in the world are more similar to use than they are different. It seems he also realized that the labor movement would be one of the principle opponents to free trade, although he didn't explicitly say that. Also I don't think he could have envisioned how rapid globalization caused by free trade would become and that it would not just be displaced workers in opposition to this change.I feel it is refreshing reading a book about pacificism that was written in 1917, when World War I was still raging, and by someone who was thrown in jail for writing his views against senseless war and his ideas how it can be stopped, even if his idea of a one world government and the abolition of capitalism can be called unrealistic. Also keep in mind that the League of Nations wasn't created until 1919 and the UN in 1945.This book is definitely worth reading, but look for it at a library because such a small book isn't worth an exorbitant price.Page 84: \\"Universal free trade would indubitably be of economic benefit to mankind, and would be adopted tomorrow if it were not for the hatred and suspicion which nations feel toward another.\\"Page 36: \\"At present, owing to the fact that all industrial changes tend to cause hardship to some section of wage earners, there is a tendency to technical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations, new processes, and new methods.\\"Page 85: \\"National pride as it exists now, is almost exclusively concerned with power and dominion, and with its capacity of enforcing its will against the opposition of other nations.\\"Page 88: \\"Men must learn to be conscious of the common interests of mankind in which all are at one, rather than of those supposed interests in which the nations are divided.\\""},{"Title":"The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"The free kindle Poe collections that I tried has no table of contents or links and some serious formatting issues.

The subculture would come later, with rock and roll, Elvis, and portable radios. Meanwhile there was a depression to work through and a big war to win. Small wonder that kids of that era passed quickly from adolescence to adulthood with hardly time for a coke along the way. The Amboy Dukes is a milestone youth novel of that era. Though not as self-consciously literary as its middle-class competitor Catcher in the Rye, Dukes vividly dramatizes urban despair in a crowded working-class precinct of New York City, and its effect on the Jewish youth gangs spawned there. It was then and remains a classically gritty tale of modern America.Because Shulman portrays the sexual escapades and pot smoking in candid fashion, it's easy for critics to stigmatize Dukes as a trashy novel. That however neglects the many dimensions to the book, including some very fine writing by the author. Instead, I take it as an honest depiction of what Shulman knew and chose to set out in unusually forceful and unpatronizing terms. Coveted by teenagers of the time for its daring assault on censorship, the language and events may seem tame compared with today's non-existent standards. Yet Shulman's characters and their dramatic narrative remain as fresh and timely as ever, the murder of the teacher standing, in retrospect, as an opening shot in the youth rebellion to come. Substitute Latino or Black for the Jewish Dukes, add a level of drug trafficking, and the story (including the awful conditions that spawned them) remains essentially unchanged from then to now.Also, author Shulman goes into vivid detail describing the youth fashions and moral behavior of the day, or what kids then considered 'cool'. More important, however, is his sharply drawn slice of class realities, as experienced by pivotal characters Frank Goldberg and his 11-year old sister Alice. Their two wrenching tours through the tonier parts of the city are among the book's memorable highlights. In fact, it is the easily overlooked Alice, and not the more melodramatic gangbangers, who remains the book's most pivotal and sympathetic character. For it is she who's being propelled into a new post-war era with all the sadness and growing sense of entrapment that bedevils the working poor. It is through her youthful enthusiasm slowly succumbing to despair that the book touches a universal chord, as we experience with her the poignancy of a crushing loss of hope. It is here, far from the prurience and rawness of the rest of the book, that Shulman achieves his finest, most revealing moments. I like to think that in the coming years, low-interest loans, Levittowns, and other now much derided assisstance programs redeemed at least some of her innocent dreams. (There's also a glimpse in these passages of the rational basis of consumerism.)Because of its questionable content, The Amboy Dukes continues to lead an underground existence, overshadowed by the more respectable and refined Catcher in the Rye. But the fact that it has survived the years and continues to be published is testament to a lasting value as social commentary.Though currently out of print, Shulman's book is far more than a teen novel. It is a permanent record of artistic achievement deserving of literary respect, cultural interest, and a continued readership. Pick it up."},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"I was in junior high school outside New York City when this book made the rounds. (I'm now in my early 70's.) It was a paperback with a racy cover. The word was out in my school: \\"Wow, this is a great, dirty book.\\" In those days, even George Orwell's \\"1984\\" was considered on the border of being racy; so obviously, times were far different then. Kids who got the book (including me) kept it hidden from their parents. I think there may even have been allegations that there was some communist conspiracy behind the book, because it showed the gritty and harsh world of youth gangs in New York--not a flattering picture of America. And it ended tragically. (In those days of the McCarthy hearings and blacklisting, anything that showed anything American in a bad light was believed to somehow be mixed up in communism--at least that's my recollection today of the way things were then.) I still remember, 60 years later, the horrifying last paragraph of the book--but will not divulge it here in case some plan to read the novel.I kept my copy hidden in my closet, always fearful that my parents might discover it and raise hell with me for reading such \\"smut.\\" Kids who took the book to school had it confiscated by the faculty. That fact alone increased the desirability of the book--much as the old 'banned by the Catholic Church' or 'banned in Boston' boosted sales of novels and movie tickets.Amboy Dukes appealed to the sexual interests of we then-adolescent boys who read it. The characters routinely \\"felt up\\" their girlfriends and occasionally had sex--much as we hoped to do when we were a little older.Of course, the social implications were lost on most of us kids. We were more interested in the sexual capers of these 1940's gangbangers. It is only in retrospect, and on reading the earlier reviewer's commentary, that I now see the book in terms of what author Shulman was trying to show us. By the way, the 1949 film \\"City Across the River\\" was based on the book. In the credits at the beginning of the film, it says: \\"Introducing Mr. Anthony Curtis.\\" This was Tony Curtis' first substantial role in a movie!I was not aware when I read the book that the Amboy Dukes was a Jewish gang, nor that kids joined gangs for protection against other ethnic groups in impoverished, tough areas of New York City and Brooklyn. (I grew up in a solidly middle-class town where there were no gangs.)Speed ahead one year:I purchased a relatively pricey used paperback through Amazon and read Amboy Dukes again--this time as a 72-year-old retired man, 60 years and a lot of miles after my first reading. I see now that there was an awful lot of stuff that I surely did not understand as a 12-year-old during the first reading. And I note that the stuff that was considered terribly racy, even lewd, by 1940's standards is practically \\"G\\" stuff today. But on my recent re-reading of the novel, I find myself thinking this:The 16-year-old protagonist Frank Goldfarb and his fellow Dukes were far more sophisticated than any 16-year-olds--or even 19-year-olds--I ever knew. Likewise, in many ways, Frank's younger sister acted like an adult. And the Amboy Dukes, as a teen gang, seemed more like an adult crime family or well organized motorcycle gang. I mean--teenagers having their own club house? Organized with leaders and soldiers? These mythical kids were SMART!Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it again, and found that I had forgotten perhaps 80 percent of the book. It was almost like reading it for the first time--except for the grisly ending, which I recalled perfectly. It gave me chills then and now.Overall, author Shulman presents a pretty gritty view of New York street gangs during the World War Two era."},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"This book was an iconic \\"coming of age\\" requirement in the late 40's.

In the 1960's I was introduced to a man who manufactured handbags. We started going out and after several years, during a conversation I happen to mention the Amboy Dukes; how racy it was and how tough the gang was etc.When this man just sat there very quietly, smoking on his cigar, like he was pondering what to say, then saying..the book is correct, it was written as it happened. I asked him, how do you know that and he said to me..I was one of the Amboy Dukes. I didn't believe this usualy quite business man could be one of the characters from this book. He went on to tell me that all the names of the gang were real and the boys , as they turned in to men became Murder Inc. that's when he left the gang.I thought to ask his daughter if in fact her father was a previous AD gang member and she said to me..my father told you about that? Yes, he told me he was an AD and her reply..he must trust you because he never mentions his tough boy hood growing up in Brownsville.So, I knew Georgie and heard more about the AD's first hand.MKW"},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"Douglas Doepke did a great job with his concise review. Another reviewer feels the book is outdated. This is clearly a mistake, because the only thing that really changes from one generation to the next are clothing styles and slang. I personally grew up with a similar bunch of thugs in the Bronx during the sixties, and just about every incident mentioned in the Amboy Dukes was replayed at least once. The locations and clothing styles may have been different, but all else remained the same. This book is a must for anyone interested in learning what it's really like to be an urban Juvenile Delinquent.The Amboy Dukes was also made into a movie (City Across the River), which was Tony Curtis' first major role."},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"1st book I ever read. This started my reading experience. I am 79 years old and still reading anything I can get my hands on. My favorite past time.."},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"In this book, author Irving Shulman shows himself to be quite an adept and capable story-teller. He definitely captures and conveys the flavor of Brownsville, the gritty East Brooklyn neighborhood where his story takes place, He writes in such a way so as to grab and hold the reader's attention. What is more, I must say that the book has a powerful tragic, surprise ending (that it would be wrong and unfair for me to give away). The Amboy Dukes come across as decent, average kids who were destroyed by the horrible neighborhood they had to live in.Having grown up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, not far from Brownsville, where the story takes place, I must say that author Shulman very much captures and conveys the atmosphere of 1950s Brownsville. I believe this story has the makings of a good movie. I therefore would highly recommend it, as it really stays with you!"},{"Title":"The Amboy Dukes","review":"I must admit that I last read this while in high school in the late 50's! You can guess my age from that! I found the book to be really outdated and not worth re-reading. Very little nostalgia even though I was familiar with all the geographic locations in NYC."},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"Sometimes I am simply proud that I have read a book. This slim volume falls into that category. The fourteen short chapters explode with new ideas, fresh perspectives, and tantalizing viewpoints. To summarize these riches is unlikely to do them justice, yet I will try.De Certeau inverts social values and cultural hierarchies. His hero metaphor is not the exemplar, but rather the ant. Wisdom resides not in the pronouncement of expert or philosopher, but in the routine discourse between ordinary people. To De Certeau the definitional constraints imposed by the experts result in artificial distinctions. Only the discourse of ordinary people is firmly rooted in experience and embraces the varieties and logical complexities of living.Among these complexities of life is the amazing adaptive capacity of the ordinary. Even the most oppressive and controlling of cultures cannot eradicate the subversive agency of the peasant. This subversive agency is expressed through mythic stories, common proverbs, and verbal tricks. De Certeau refers to the adaptive capacity of the ordinary as tactics of living, and these tactics may be best exemplified when the worker does the personal while on the clock.The distinction between strategy and tactics is central to De Certeau's thought. Strategy refers to the top-down exercise of power to coerce compliance. Tactics refer to the opportunistic manipulations offered by circumstance. The conflict between strategies and tactics is ironic - as strategic forces expand to increase dominance, there is a corresponding increase in opportunity for tactical subversion.De Certeau relates his ideas to the theoretical work of Foucault and Bourdieu, and continues his inverted perspective by looking anew at the concept of city, commuter travel by rail, story telling, writing, reading, and believing.This book is more of a riddle than a narrative; de Certeau provides glimpses of his meaning from time to time, but deliberately avoids propositional clarity. This style requires that the reader take an unusual stance toward this book. Instead of expecting the author to communicate, the reader must content himself with hints and suggestions of meaning. I am convinced that these hints and suggestions are more than worth the reader's investment of time. Find a quiet place and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"DeCerteau's ideas in this book primarily deal with control and resistance: he finds that average people have developed various strategies that establishes their independence in a world that seeks to dominate them. He's especially interested in how people receive media: he thinks media producers (including writers) seek to impose meaning on media consumers, yet he rejects the notion that consumers consume mindlessly. DeCerteau examines the creative strategies employed by consumers, and he in fact sees them as a form of unrecognized producers (which is part of why this book is of interest to people studying 'fan fiction' and similar phenomena).Like much French theory, this book functions like a poem, making its argument by way of symbolic relationships and analogy rather than by calling upon the causal / statistical relationships that characterize much American argument. This may turn some people off, and even by French-theory standards this book is not user-friendly at all. DeCerteau often uses common, general words (say, &quot;writing,&quot; or &quot;time&quot;) to refer to very particular, highly-nuanced concepts. Simply relying upon the commonly-accepted meanings of those words will not do, and yet deCerteau rarely takes the time to explain the meanings that he has in mind. The result is that the book reads like an enormous cryptogram: you can only decipher what he means by particular words by noting and crossreferencing the varying contexts in those words are used throughout the book-- a tedious process which forced this reader to continually question whether the nuggets of gold were really worth all the panning through silt."},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"This is one of the great books of French post-structuralist thought. I realize that to some people that might be like saying &quot;one of the nicest Nazis I know.&quot; But for those who don't immediately dismiss the entire genre, there is much to be gained from reading, and rereading, this book.In essence, Certeau is challenging the rather despairing vision of Foucault's The Order of Things, with its image of the panopticon from which no one can escape. Certeau focuses on everyday practices to see how people do in fact escape the all-seeing gaze of the panopticon. In particular his distinction between &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;tactics&quot; is useful and intriguing.The language is highly poetic and at times difficult going, but *how* Certeau says what he says is in some ways as important as *what* he says. He wants to write in a way that at the same time uses and escapes the constraints of ordinary language. It takes some getting used to, but it is worth it."},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"Michel de Certeau's brilliant book is one of the primary nodes in the historical switchbox that eventually crossed the signals that led us through structuralism and practice theory to critical realism and Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. His classic exploration of everyday life will send flashes of light and pleasure through the mind on a constant basis - his dense, absolutely masterful, and witty expository quasi-poetry on economy, power, and practice is essentially an extended series of aphorisms, upon any one of which an entire essay could be based. And a good one, at that.What we have here is a celebration of the everyday, the common, the mundane, and the wonderful capacity of life to resist systematization and classification via its organic flexibility and espirit de corps. It is a wonderful wake-up call: &quot;A few individuals, after having long considered themselves experts speaking a scientific language, have finally awoken from their slumbers and suddenly realized that for the last few moments they have been walking on air, like Felix the Cat in the old cartoons, far from the scientific ground. Though legitimized by scientific knowledge, their discourse is seen to have been no more than the ordinary language of tactical games between economic powers and symbolic authorities.&quot;Writing in the tradition of Lefevbre (more so than anyone else who comes to mind at the moment), his work touches upon contemporary Foucault and Bourdieu only briefly and then moves on to do much more. For example, in the way of analyses of strategic and tactical behavior, resistances, spatial practices, sublatern hermeneutics, and state/scientific ideologies of secrecy and knowledge. In de Certeau, we see not just a clearing of the intellectual path for towering figures such as Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Giddens, Lash, Appadurai, and Taussig (to name only a handful) - enabling them to come whistling along with their variously insightful ideas from A to Z - but we see it done with a panache and &quot;Ich weiss es nicht&quot; that is memorable in the persona it invokes.And as long as you're sitting on the Paris-Munchen ICE, scratching your chin and contemplating the axiological implications of beer or coffee at 9am, I can't think of anything better to read than de Certeau's comments on the rite of passage of Railway Incarceration and Navigation (Chapter VIII), in which a whole series of transformations is extracted from the mundane in a suprahumane and very-French manner. Bon voyage!"},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"One of the most interesting writings on everyday life is Michel de Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life (1984, first published in Paris in 1980). Written in a somehow fragmented and often elliptical style, the book's central point revolves around everyday practices that he distinguishes between strategies and tactics that inform the author's arts de faire. De Certeau's hetereodox view sustains that daily life is defined by regularities, even though they may be recurrent. Far from being made of trivialities as in Erving Goffman's view, and distant from Hans-Georg Gadamer's interactive play, to say nothing of the set of normative social roles as in Talcott Parsons's view, De Certeau's everyday life is made of procedures. From his critical reading of authors such as M. Foucault, P. Bourdieu and M. Detienne, in his metaphorical language everyday life is similar to a battlefield in which procedures develop into practices, i.e. strategies and tactics. The description of the pair of concepts extends from guerrilla analogy allowing De Certeau to breaks with the understanding of daily life as routine and claims that it is rather continuous movement. In this movement, like in the battle ground, strategy refers to a \\"postulate of power\\", circumscribed to a variety of terms that De Certeau makes current use of: property, ownership, place, among others. Tactics on the contrary is seen \\"a calculated action determined by the absence of a proper locus\\" are ways of operating, taking \\"advantage of opportunities\\" of (daily) life (moving around, talking, reading, cooking, individual creative assemblages, etc). Determined by the \\"absence of power,\\" (of proper locus) tactics is the \\"art of the weak\\" operating insidiously \\"blow by blow\\" as in the art of craft.The daily practice emphasizes how labyrinthine procedures of action function in reference to the procedural logic and dynamic of power relations. The emphasis on daily life as a battlefield, breaks with the normative character of everyday social action and highlights the power relations that relate substantially to the social construction of public life. The concept of everyday practice in De Certeau therefore helps us to consider different ways of space formation and appropriation, as well as breaking social and physical boundaries that demarcate contemporary urban life. This leads De Certeau to another pair of articulated concepts: space and place. Space refers to the absence of previously defined positions and, therefore, it is an order that provides various possible moving experiences in everyday life. Place, on the contrary, calls for certain rather stable configurations. The everyday practices and tactics allows for an understanding of the ruptures in contemporary urban life: an insinuating poetic and war-like inversion of everyday life. This is a fundamental reason why The Practice of Everyday Life is an essential reading for contemporary urban studies.Rogerio Proena Leite, PhD.Professor and researcherFederal University of Sergipe - UFS/BrazilThe Practice of Everyday Life"},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"I purchased the book as required reading for a doctoral level research methods course. It is a translation of work by DeCerteau that is highly conceptual in nature. The focus is upon observing, experiencing and seeking to represent the life-world from a reference point and through a lens that acknowledges that we continually and simultaneously interact, collide, incorporate and are immersed in our experiences of the world and social phenomena. Deconstructing everyday practices, the work seeks to refocus thinking and assert new angles of vision that \\"make the familiar strange.\\" I especially enjoyed the chapter about navigation and travel described as a train journey in which the typical circumstance of our movement about in a seeming stationary world is reversed to our immobility as the world passes by, until we arrive and the perception is again reversed.The book is a dense read, which may be due to the theoretical content and to some extent to the translation. In some instances, I found the inclusion of the French phrase by the original author helpful in opening meaning and facilitating understanding when I could not quite grasp the idea from the translation. The work is interesting, but is by no means to be taken up as recreational or light reading. Rather, I found it necessary to bite off in pieces leaving time to digest before moving on to further consumption of the book."},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"Michel de Certeau- The Practice Of Everyday LifeFoucault has repeatedly insisted that power is invariably accompanied by resistance, that resistance is as ubiquitous as power. Hence his emphasis on the intrinsic reversibility of power, a reversibility which, at its limit, encounters totalitarian domination- the attempt to hypostatize power relations, to render them irreversible. Yet, it is characteristic of Foucault's intellectual honesty that he has never attempted to imbue this resistance with a positive descriptive content, nor has he been tempted to prescribe a definitive program of resistance. This has, understandably, exasperated many who read Foucault's reticence as being symptomatic of a widespread nihilism. This is undoubtedly exacerbated by Foucault's late focus on the \`hermeneutics of the subject' and techniques of the self, which could easily be construed as a disastrous amalgam of Baudelairean aestheticism and neo-Stoic asceticism. Of course, what these critics overlook is that this ethical turn is offset by a series of lectures that provide political science with a critical re-orientation. I am speaking of \`The Birth of Biopolitics', \`Security, Territory, Population', \`Society Must Be Defended', which find Foucault grappling with micrological technologies of governmentality and biopower.Antonio Negri, in his re-appraisal of Deleuze and Foucault, has emphasized that their work, in refraining from crafting haughty manifestos, articulates the conditions by which democracy can be constituted through an ongoing, constructive process of articulation. What this effectively terminates is a whole legacy of political thought, from Machiavelli to Lenin, a lineage that circumambulates around the sublime object of the state. When Foucault exhorts us to \`chop off the king's head', he is in a sense reiterating a Lacanian maxim: let us traverse our fantasy, let us exorcise the deadly fascination with the state. Once we insulate our ears from the sad elegies to the nation state, once we part ways with the \`sad militants' (Foucault's intro to Anti-Oedipus) and their masochistic rhapsodies to castration, critique and action become possible once more. This is what Negri refers to when he speaks of the immanent, constituent power of the multitude, a creative forging of singularities that no longer have any reference to the state. A new agenda is drafted, one which introduces a new dimension to political praxis: the micropolitical. Before we can speak of grand politics, we must take stock of the molecular, capillary forms of power that circulate through our very bodies, the traces of power that saturate thought. Rimbaud's exhortation, changer la vie, resonates once more- if, in a postmodern \`network' world, every relation is political, politics is nothing less than the creation of new forms of commonality.Michel de Certeau's wonderful book might seem slightly dated. Its problematic is, on a cosmetic level, situated in the same heritage as Debord, Venaigem, the Frankfurt School and Agnes Heller. Compounding matters is the fact that this book was published in the \`80s, one and a half decades after cultural Marxism's preoccupation with the \`everyday'. What separates it from this strain of Marxist thought is its eschewal of any macrological empancipatory politics in favor of molecular interventions, small, imperceptible forms of resistance that elude mechanisms of control. The fragmentary and elliptical form of its presentation can be vexing- the book should be approached as a \`toolbox', an intellectual notebook rather than a cohesive argument. De Certeau says as much when he proposes that it be read as a series of sketches, the elaboration of which is delegated to future researchers. These two provisos aside, I find this to be a marvelous read, an attempt to enact a \`reverse-Foucauldianism', mapping the ways in which \`regular' men and women circumvent the machinations of a technocratic world, re-appropriating the city for their own use, investing space with desire and pleasure.First, a few words on the rhetorical acrobatics performed throughout the text. This is a very French piece of writing, its lyrical garrulity and lexical excess bordering on the obscene. On the level of form, this book is very much worth reading, being closer to the likes of Lautreamont, Perec and JMG Le Clezio than any French theorist I can name (perhaps Foucault's early essays, his book on Roussel and The Order Of Things approach the giddying delirium of de Certeau's passages on walking and the train). I can't help but feel that certain of the more poetic sections of this text don't translate very well into English- the syntactic structure of modern French literature just seems florid and awkward when transferred to English. Still, this text is endlessly surprising, studded with beguiling images and elegant declaratives.Besides this, I think de Certeau does a good deal more in advancing the study of the quotidian than the likes of Baudrillard, Debord and the Frankfurt School, whose phenomenologies lean a bit too much on vulgar/neo-Romantic Marxist conceptions of \`false consciousness' and \`reification'. In a courageous move, de Certeau deconstructs the imposture of the intellectual as Master (a strategy that we rehearsed continuously in the work of Jacques Ranciere), reinvigorating the figure of the Everyman and rescuing him from the asphyxiating talons of capitalist domination. In contradistinction to the dour narratives that would submerge the person beneath some totalizing principle (the spectacle, simulation, alienation), reducing the individual to a mere cipher for anonymous relations of power, de Certeau attempts to enact a reversal of intellectual imperialism. In this way, he formulates a science that is strictly materialist, empiricist and pluralist, a science that attends closely to the concrete and permits itself to be twisted by what emerges from it. Guided by an unflinching respect for working men and women, it attempts to map \`lines of flight', trajectories that irradiate from the most unexpected sources.Of course, this is not all that he does. de Certeau as not so sanguine as to evacuate critique from his approach altogether, and there are a number of excellent chapters that deal with power and its multiple semiotic regimes. The closing chapter on death and the chapter on language and its relation to the body-which can be read as a dialogue with Lacan's supposition that \`the letter kills'- are exemplary in this respect. The richness and breadth of this book are extraordinary. You should read it."},{"Title":"The Practice of Everyday Life (v. 1)","review":"Beautifully expressed, rigorously researched, awesomely original. Real food for reflection.

Though it's not an easy read (What philosophical discourse is an easy read?), it is illuminates the battleground between the institution which imposes order (democracy for instance) and it's improvising enemy, who operates within the dominant force's own field of vision and seizes opportunities as they arise.

THE VESPER SERVICE MURDERS is only the second of the author's twenty-six books featuring Hugh North. Captain North is invited to participate in the investigation of a series of murders in the city of Deptford, Massachusetts. Dr. Walter Allan, a friend of North, is used as a narrator by Mason. North is already famous because of newspaper publicity about previous cases he has solved dating back to World War I army service in Europe. Knowledge of American Morse code is employed by North as a tool of detection in this case. The novel is written in the style of a police detective story and it shows the promise realized in the later entries in this series which deal entirely with espionage and international intrigue.In THE YELLOW ARROW MURDERS Hugh North is actually working as an agent of G-2 of the United States Army on a case in a foreign country. He is sent to Cuba to either buy or steal plans for an advanced torpedo which are being sold by its inventor in Cienfuegos. The seller of the plans calls himself Alvarado but his real name is Doelger. He is a disgruntled American who was discharged from the U.S. Navy for dereliction of duty in 1918. When North arrives in Cienfuegos, he finds plenty of competitors already there seeking the prize. Some are agents of their governments while others are merely adventurers in the game for profit. In one role or another there are representatives from England, France, Japan, Germany, Russia, Portugal and Italy. This is the first novel in the series in which North operates in a foreign country under orders from G-2 on a matter of international intrigue.In THE BRANDED SPY MURDERS Captain Hugh North is sent to Honolulu. His mission is primarily to prevent a war from breaking out between Japan and the United States. A Japanese naval squadron is headed towards Honolulu with unknown intent. North attends a party at the home of Abner Polk, owner of a big American steel company. The other guests at the party include intelligence operatives from Russia, France, England and Japan as well as steel barons from France and Germany. All have an interest in either starting or preventing the war. Before the evening is over a dead female is found floating near Polk's dock. She has a strange design on her shoulder. Perhaps it is a tattoo that has been erased. Who is the dead girl and how does her death fit into a plot to start a war? The toughest obstacle North faces in this adventure is his attraction to Nadia Stefan, a beguiling Russian agent. Considering the fact that the story was written in 1932, the near attack by Japanese naval ships on Honolulu shows the author to be gifted with uncanny foresight."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"The Trolls is a pretty good book.The main charactors are Amanda, Melissa, Pee-Wee, and Aunt Sally.The kids parents go away on a buisness trip and Aunt Sally has to baby-sit the kids and while she is she tells the kids crazy stories about her and their father's childhood.One of the kid's favorite and most interesting is the story about the trolls.The reason I put 3 stars is because the book would have been better off with out the stupid stories told in between the story about the trolls like she would tell about the trolls tell about some other crazy story then go back to the rest of the story with the trolls.

Because the action has some aspects which are more complex, but not necessary to understand to enjoy the narrative, the audio version could be understood by the average seven or eight year old quite easily, but still hold the interest of an adolescent. This greatly expands the range of children who can enjoy listening to the tape, and as a parent I found it held my interest as well.Two little girls, who delight in torturing their little brother, find a curious reflection in the stories their eccentric Aunt Sally tells them during their parents' week away. Aunt Sally is a &quot;long lost&quot; sister of their father's, and hearing the stories of his childhood in the third person is a fascinating and more important experience for them than is first apparent to the girls or to the reader/listener.The humor in the story is nicely captured by Haggerty's reading, and the the voices of the different characters she is able to portray is impressive. Aunt Sally's eccentricity is well-conveyed, as well as not a little regret, though the overall tone of the story is quite upbeat.Aunt Sally is quite an admirable character, and her recounting of childhood adventures demonstrates a healthy respect for children on the part of the author, Polly Horvath. Though nothing particularly frightening happens that would scare a young listener, a refreshing discussion of the darker side of sibling behavior is the somewhat hidden revelation in some of the stories of the children's father's experiences as the youngest child. Such a recognition that children are not all sugar and innocence is quite welcome, especially given the sophistication of many young readers today, and gives this book a weight that is unusual in such an otherwise gentle and humorous story."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"Estranged Aunt Sally comes to babysit for Amanda, Melissa and Pee-Wee while their parents are in Paris, and then relates their hilarious, sometimes sad family history.

It was very funny and some parts made me laugh out loud. Although it was a humorous book, at some points it was just a little bit scary and the end almost didn't belong.

It being a children's book, I was expecting a happily-ever-after type ending. But when I thought about it, it made sense. The reason Aunt Sally was sympathetic towards PeeWee was because he reminded her of Robbie. And after they gave Robbie to the trolls, the family changed forever. I love what Aunt Sally said, &quot;I guess knowing that your own trusted family could give you away, even in jest, well, it changes things.&quot; This book made me want to hug my little sister! &quot;The Trolls&quot; is very imaginatively written, and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and I never liked to read.

This is unabashedly fun reading with the merest pricklings of social and moral edification.

When I said it was odd I mean odd because of what happens in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fantasy because if you like historical fiction or any other genre you won't like this book. You won't like it because it isn't like any other genre. I would also recommend this book to anyone who is between the ages of eleven and fourteen because it is easy reading. This was a good book. I liked the book because I liked the events that happened in this book. The events were interesting. Since the book and its events were interesting it pulled you into the book."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"WOW! This was the most creative fantasy I've ever read! Polly Horvath defintly deserves a 5 star rating. The wierd stories Aunt Sally tells and draws are VERY entertaing and are soooooo good! I DEFINTLY reccomend this to the ages between 8+! Great for adults too!"},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"It's not always easy to get a 7-year old boy to read on his own. Trolls did it. Even though there were some hard words that made this book (perhaps) more appropriate for 8 to 9 year olds.Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"The Trolls, I know it doesn't sound exciting but you won't believe the stories that they tell. Their like stories in your wildest dreams. Let me tell you more, Melissa, Frank, and Amanda are getting babysat by their Aunt Sally. Aunt Sally is a great story teller! The funny thing is the stories she tells really happen to her and her 4 brothers and sisters. Well for you to know what the story is about read it yourself!"},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"I bought this book for my grandchildren, but decided to read it first. There are many good things in this book, and it has a good moral to the story, but I am not sure that all will understand the moral, (teaching the two older children to appreciate their younger brother). And the discordance between the children's father and Aunt Sally is sad, and never resolved, even though the parents did ask Aunt Sally to babysit so they could go on vacation.The worst thing about this book is Chapter 11 \\"Fat Little Mean Girl\\". The name really turned me off the whole book. To use the word 'fat' to describe a mean little girl encourages the readers to believe that fat is synonymous with mean. It is difficult enough for an overweight child in this world. To name a character this, and use it as a name through the complete chapter is cruel. I'm going to try and return the book and will let the store know why I am returning it. I was extremely disappointed that an adult would use a name like this in a book, and am extremely disappointed that the book was a finalist for the National Book Award and as a \\"Boston Globe-Horn Award Honor Book\\". There are adults out there who weren't paying attention, or who don't think there's anything wrong with prejudice against fat people...and passing that prejudice along to children."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"not particularly beautifully written, but funny and witty.

From the beginning, I wondered why she was the last resort, and Dad did not want to call his sister.Was their dad upset with the way Aunt Sally taught the children to eat their green beans, using them as nose pickers, or walrus tusks? Was it because she told them stories of their dad's past, growing up in Canada?Each night, the children would beg for green beans. Pee Wee built them into log cabins before eating them. And each night she would tell of the family history. Aunt Sally told them about Uncle Lewis who came for two weeks and stayed to six years. There was also a tale of Great Aunt Hatty and the mysterious man.Along with Amanda, Melissa and Pee Wee, I loved Aunt Sally's storytelling, building a tree house, and teaching the children how to eat meatloaf by adding surprises. The children continued to wonder why their dad did not want her around.Aunt Sally hinted that maybe their dad wasn't happy about the trolls.Uncle Lewis told Aunt Sally's family that the reverend had gone through six wives. When he was finished with one, he would take her to the beach and leave her for the trolls. \\"That,\\" said Aunt Sally, \\"is what happened to all six wives.\\" Uncle Lewis also told about the neighbor's dog, which fell off the front porch.

So Mr. and Mrs. Anderson need to find a babysitter, for their trip( their going to be gone for a week). So the Anderson's remember that Aunt Sally is in town, so they get her to babysit Amanda, Melissa, and Frank. When the parents leave Aunt Sally tells them stories, one story was about a lady who shot 8 cougars, and many more stories about her childhood. This book is Fiction/fantasy.I like the book because the stories are really funny, and the kids say a lot of funny things! I do recommend the book because it's stories that are in your wildest dreams and because you can relate to the story. Kids 9-14 would like this book and people who like fantasy. Every chapter ended with a cliff hanger because they would be in the middle of a story then the chapter would end so you would have to read it. The thing that surprised me was that all the stories are true, from Aunt Sally's childhood. Well to find out what happens who have to read the story!"},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"I'm an adult who was a huge Mary Poppins (the original books) as a kid. I really thought this would be some dumbed-down, silly, politically correct, mindless pap story for children, but I gave it a try since I received the tape as a gift. WHOA! What a superb surprise and a gift indeed. Horvath's opus is thought-provoking, haunting, deep, funny as heck, and colorful as a smashed fingerpaint factory. Julie Hagerty deserves an Audie Award for her performance. I'm an audiobook expert--a crabby critic who chews up audios and spits them on on nearly a daily basis--and, believe me, almost nobody has this kind of narrative flair and commitment. Plus, this is the kind of book that respects children's intelligence, imagination and intuition. Highly recommended for kids whose parents aren't fearful of allowing them to, duh, THINK or, OOH SCARY, read Grimm's. If you're the sort of adult who revels in excellent children's literature, don't cheat yourself of this audio experience either. You'll have that bright and shiny-eyed wonder going again. And you'll never look at Canada the same!"},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"My teacher was handing out books and I was like one of the last ones called up. There wasn't a very big selection at all. I looked at all the books and this one looked the newest out of all of them. Most of them were old or I had already read them. So I picked it up and like a week or so later I finished reading \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" by Laura Ingalls Wilder. So \\"The Trolls\\" was out on my computer desk and looked to see if there was a description of the book on the back, and there wasn't but I took it anyway. Instead of reading a description on the back I read the last page and decided to begin reading from the start. I did and loved the book. I HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"This is a delightfully funny book. It's a great book to read aloud. Both my 13 year old and 8 year old listen and don't miss a laugh.Aunt Polly really knows how to get the kids attention; she grabs the reader too. You just have to know how each zany antic turns out.Even green beans sound like fun."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"My family loves this book! We just finished listening to it in audio format during a long road trip. It is full of funny stories that had my kids laughing out loud. It also has a touching message - be kind to your siblings - because family relationships matter."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"I first remember picking up this book at my local library in grade school. I loved it then and got my own copy. I'm in college now and I still pull this book out and read it just about every other year. It's an entertaining story that has stuck with me ever since I first read it.The book centers around the eccentric Aunt Sally, who is called in as a last-minute babysitter, and the three Anderson children - Melissa, Amanda, and Pee Wee. The story progresses as Aunt Sally tells the kids about her and their father's childhoods, ultimately leading up to the story about the trolls. The book has a good message, is witty and fun, and yet becomes serious in some places. Some of the younger readers may not enjoy the dark areas, but for some reason I've always enjoyed that kind of thing. It's also written in a way that younger kids can understand, but still utilizes a large and imaginative vocabulary that won't seem boring or dumbed-down to adult readers.Overall, I strongly recommend this book. The story is an adventure that I think all can enjoy, no matter your age. It's the only book from my childhood that I keep coming back to!"},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"The absurd family tall tales that start this book lead to a story, (when Dad was left by his siblings for possibly imaginary but also possibly real trolls), that is so heartbreakingly sad it will make you forget that you are reading a book that is aimed at middle grade readers.I have always liked and not-liked Horvath books because of their frequently mixed messages and sometimes forced quirkiness. That doesn't mean they aren't good for young readers, it just means my admiration for them is reserved. But \\"Trolls\\" really is Horvath's best work. The tall tales are not disguised as anything other than tall tales, and the fun just sets you up brilliantly for the socko finish.This is a book that can be read and enjoyed by readers at many different levels, and if you only have room for one Horvath, I suggest this might be it."},{"Title":"The Trolls","review":"This book is just wonderful, and the audio version is even better. My seven year old son discovered it at the library, and began playing it for my four year old daughter and me at dinnertime. We ALL laughed and cried - it has the special ability to touch the sensibility of multiple ages. And the reader! She is amazing! The kids repeat her intonations, quoting the book, all the time in the way they will quote Monty Python ten years hence. I can't say enough about this book. I'm trying to figure out how to contact the publisher to beg them to reissue this in a audio cd version. Get it from your library if you can, and if the audio version is not available, get the book to read aloud!"},{"Title":"History of New Paltz, New York & Its Old Families, from 1678 to 1820","review":"I borrowed a copy of the book from a co-worker who turned out to be a cousin from about 5 or 6 generations back. This book is full of my ancestors. There are so many names in the book which I found I was related to. The Hudson River Valley is so rich in history. The book tells of the French and Dutch settlements around the area called New Paltz. It tells stories about many of the families and where they came from in Europe. There are a lot of facts about the people and their families. There is a genealogy section which lists the first settlers of the area and goes for a few generations listing the spouses, children, children's spouses, with birth, death, and marriage dates. I have ancestors in a few of these families. The main families in the book are Louis DuBois, Christian Deyo, Abraham Hasbrouck, Louis Bevier, Anthony Crispel, Hugo Frere and Simon LeFevre. The author of the book is a descendent of Simon LeFevre. The book tells how the immigrants came to this country, which wasn't even a country yet. It tells how they supported themselves, tells of the dealings with the Indians in the area. It tells about the houses. It tells about the churches and their importance in the development of this area. It tells how the French and the Dutch finally came together after living in separate communities. The index in the book is excellent. Every name mentioned in the book is in the index. It is an excellent research book for geneaology if you know that you have ancestors in the Hudson Valley of New York State. It is very interesting reading even if you aren't related to the people in the book. I haven't read the whole book. I have used it mainly for researching my family tree. I plan on buying my own copy because I want one of my own to refer to in the future."},{"Title":"The Standard Deviants - Habla Espanol (Learn Spanish) (SmartBook Visual Learning System) [Includes Video]","review":"I have seen inside how it write and work for me.

I was surprised to enjoy it so much and look forward to Kean's next book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"You gotta love picking up a novel by a first time author and not being able to put it down. I was totally absorbed from the first chapter to the last. Rob Kean packs a punch and plenty of surprizes, along with some truely interesting main characters that you love to hate. I have heard of &quot;hazing&quot; that goes on at some universities, and read some pretty ghastly stuff surrounding some deaths due to hazing and perhaps the highly disturbing motives behind these deaths, reading this work of fine work of fiction was an eye-opener!! Kudo's to Mr Kean - looking forward to your next novel!!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Too bad that Mr. Keane doesn't understand what fraternities or humans are actually like. In an effort to write a drama, he fails to write realism--the characters were as shallow as those found on 50s sit-coms, and the ruthlessness portrayed in the Sigmas was previously reserved for Lex Luthor. A cheap attempt at cashing in at the unfortunate dark side of the Greek system, the book ignores all the good that fraternities and sororities do."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Coming from a small liberal arts college in New England myself, The Pledge vividly portrays life within the cliques of these small schools. From the &quot;jock fraternity&quot;, to the &quot;women lib leaders&quot;, the story rings true to life at a small school. The twists and turns always leave you guessing the ending. Overall, a fine effort by Mr. Kean."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This is hands-down one of the best, most thrilling, most tangible works of fiction I have ever read. Mr. Kean captures the essence of fraternity life so completely, it's as if he lived, ate, and slept at the &quot;Large white house on the corner of College and Maine&quot;. His acute descriptions of the Maine winter scenes rival Jack London's recounts of the Alaskan Wilderness. Meanwhile, the depth and richness of his characters would make Tom Wolfe proud. This is a must read!

I was disappointed to find that it was nowhere near as good, although it was a nice try. As a college student, I found that the characters were, for the most part, unrealistic, especially Shawn Jakes- the author seems incapable of describing realistic female characters. I thought the book would've been better with less predictable plot. Also, the rhyming WAS tiresome. Still, it was interesting...I wasn't happy with the ending tho. I had the feeling it was trying too hard to be deep and missed."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I read the advance copy of this book so it might be different than the published version, but I really enjoyed it.

However, being a Greek alumnus who also enjoys a well-written, break-neck paced thriller, I loved this book. I think maybe because I know my fraternity was nothing like the Sigmas in this book, or maybe I can separate fiction from reality, either way this book is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it for anyone searching for a good page-turning thriller that is not set in the usual places, with the usual characters. Some were written very stereotypically, yes, but overall, everything worked for me.

As a former small college athlete myself, I felt the characters were extremely well developed extensions (although at times exagerated - but isn't that the point) of many of my classmates. The complexity of the plot and the techniques Mr. Kean used to slowly reveal it left me almost disappointed when I turned the last page. I am anxiously awaiting his next effort."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who wants an inside look at the Greek system of fraternities in America's elite colleges.

I could see some spots that should have been pruned vigorously (Shawn is not exactly a realistic woman, she is somebody's(probably most men's) fantasy. Mark Jessy the hero is interestingly flawed, the scenes with the parents of the murdered pledge are poignant in the extreme, the rhyming gets a wee bit tiresome, and in short, Animal House meets the Firm.

This novel has many pages, which some consider a fault, but it reads so fast. The story begins with the mysterious death of a Pledge, hence the title, at a rich, powerful and shady Frat house. This fraternity will do anything in it's power to conceal the truth, and they do have the resources at their fingertips! This is a story of money, power, greed, love, and the author combines them so well. The characters are deep and you will feel for them. You get to know them and how they think. Mark Jessy is the Super hero, a mysterious, yet intelligent young man with a complicated past. Shawn Jakes is the beautiful, extremely intelligent, motivated star. There are so many well developed characters. The Dean is a interesting person, to say the least. The frat brothers are muscular, brainy, good looking and Dangerous. My favorite, of course, is the former Marine who will crush anyone who crosses his path. The freshman Pledges are so perfectly portrayed. This book will make you cry, be happy, smile and imagine the possibility of this really happening. You won't be able to put it down. I can't wait to read his next book, which I hope is on the horizon. The movie, which he was reportedly advanced $1,000,000 for the rights, should be spectacular. Critics have also stated that the events in this book are farfetched, they must have not noticed the words FICTION in the cover.

Now being a type of person who LOVES reading but has a hard time finding ample time to do so, I MADE time to read this book. Fantastic characters, plot and suspense. Everything was vivid; I felt like I was right there. However, the ending really disappointed me. All sequence of events were very descriptive and pulled me into them. The ending did nothing but summarize what happened. This novel is a major page turner and I promise you'll read it fast...you may want to throw it against the wall when you get to the ending.....very disappointing."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Maybe it was because I am currently a pledge for a fraternity. Maybe it was because I have a love for nature, boats, and costal villages, as do the two main characters. Maybe it was because I hadn't read a novel for pleasure in 10 years. I can't quite put my finger on what endeared me to Rob Kean's first ever novel, The Pledge, but I really liked it.I had heard about the novel while my pledge brothers and I were cleaning up the dining room at our fraternity house one evening after the actives had finished dinner. Two of the actives had hung around after dinner and were talking about some book called the Pledge and that it was one of the best books that they'd ever read. I got on-line, read some reviews and without much hesitation clicked on the &quot;Confirm Order&quot; icon.The Pledge delves into a fictious fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi, at a fictious New England, Ivy League school, Simsbury College. It chronicles the events that occur following the death of a pledge at Simsbury's most prestigous, most revered fraternity, known to all simply as &quot;Sigma.&quot; The main character, a former brother himself, is torn between loyalty to his &quot;brothers&quot; and his obligations as a member of Simsbury's &quot;D-Squad,&quot; which is charged with investigating the death of Sigma pledge Chad Ewing.As I became more and more engrossed in the story it became increasingly more difficult to put this book down; to the extent that I actually skipped a class because I didn't want to stop reading. I finished the final 500 pages in 5 straight hours.I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in college life, anyone interested in fraternity life, and anyone who believes that just because a man graduates from college and becomes a successful businessman he is honest, just, ethical, and possesses a clear sense of what is right from what is wrong.If you've read this review, you WILL LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Set in Maine at an exclusive private college, The Pledge is a worthwhile first effort by Rob Kean.The Pledge, not surprisingly, is set in a long established and incredibly wealthy fraternity. Alumni support and ongoing involvement is a way of life.While fraternity pledging seems to have been tamed down in recent years by most colleges, the Brothers have apparently not heard. The process of belonging seems to be a traumatic series of events aimed at degrading, humiliating and absolutely breaking down the new candidates. There is an uncomfortable air of torture in the actions of the Brotherhood toward their aspirants.The reader becomes quickly engaged in the bizarre life of this fraternity in the death of freshman pledge, Chad Ewing. Cover-up becomes the order of the day when Ewing loses his life after a night of horrifying pledge activity. The college administration responds quickly to limit it's responsibility and any fair investigation of what took place the night Ewing died. College leadership seems primarily invested in the second in charge, Dean Templeton, an unsavory human being if there ever was one. Everything he touches is dishonest and seemingly rigged.The fraternity shows its true colors in the diabolical actions that its members take to absolve themselves of any responsibility for Ewing's death.There is saving grace to the horrors of the actions at the college found in two students, Shawn Jakes and Mark Jessy who are charged with leading the Student Review Board, which has responsibility for reviewing the death.While the fraternity brothers and the Dean are not at all worried about the Student Review, complication after complication occurs as the investigation proceeds.Ultimately and at great odds, justice is finally served as the story winds down. We are rocked from the depths of evil to the refreshing integrity of two college students whose lives are literally at great risk.Readers and reviewers have had mixed reactions to The Pledge. While I might agree that it could have been pared down by probably more than a hundred pages, the story is indeed gripping for those willing to stick with the story.As a reader, Kean tapped into an enormous range of emotions that don't usually surface in most things I read.I believe those who enjoy a good mystery and undaunted by a long one will enjoy The Pledge. Some bumps and wrong turns here and there. However, Kean does a fine job in his first work. He will undoubtedly develop as an important writer. A following is definitely in Rob Kean's future if he continues to work as hard as he has in crafting The Pledge!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The book was written to read fast - I read the whole thing in one sit (I missed some classes too, oops) The story line is well thought out and flows evenly, but I find that the descriptions of the charecters and scenes a little too perfect for reality, aside from the coruption. However, it is well made up for with the many plot twists that grip the reader to continue reading."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Rob Kean did an excellent job on his debut. Once I started reading The Pledge I couldn't put it down. He keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this book to anyone. I look forward to reading more from Rob Kean in the future."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"As a whole, I thought the book was very, very intriging. However at some points of the story it got somewhat confusing, without giving too much of the plot away, regarding certain members of the Sigmas, and what was their motivations for certain things. My favorite, however, is Mark Jessy and I thought he handled the investigation perfectly. The ending was rather good, and justice was served."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Good book, but not great. I would have preferred alot less description and more story. If you want to revisit your college years, might help some."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Seldom do I not finish a book, even a bad one, but this novel was more than I could take after 100 pages. The author, a genuinely nice guy I heard in an interview, fancies himself a writer, but I found little in the story beyond stereotypes and cliches. I am astonished that the book was not edited more tightly. I am even more astonished that Kean received a $1 million contract for this book, a second, and movie rights. All the best to him, for in matters of taste, we are all experts. What a country!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It kept me so intrigued until the very end. Rob is as charming in person, as his writing is chilling and believable. Who doesn't like a book that brings you back to college days? Keep writing!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"So nice to get away from the legal mysteries and medical thrillers. May be a little far-fetched but couldn't be more exciting and fun to read.Never knew what was coming next. Loved the writing style and the author's clever way of describing things. Particularly, rumors."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I loved this book and literally could not put it down. In fact, I woke early one Saturday [5:00 a.m.] and didn't get out of bed till I'd turned the last page at noon. Shawn Jakes is no more of a fantasy than James Bond, and I'm looking for a sequel."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Couldn't put it down!! A book you pick up as soon as the kids are on the school bus. A great book for anyone who simply reads for pleasure but as a mother of 3 sons rapidly approching college age I was a bit frightened after reading this book. I guess that means that I think things like this could actually happen on a campus. Thanks Rob for your insight!!!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I was hooked from the first page. Kean has an ear for dialogue and a gift for suspense. I kept thinking I would stop reading at &quot;end of this chapter,&quot; but then something would happen and I would have to read on. Is he working on a sequel?"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I loved this book- great characters, great action, great read"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Imagine the nice college boy, the son of your neighbors, this well-educated guy being member of one of the most famous fraternities, this friendly person is about to become a member of a corrupt trust undermining the market, political power, law, and order. In order to maintain and enlarge their world wide web of business, money, and power, this mafia recruits young students for their fraternity Sigma Delta Phi. The selection process for the &quot;pledges&quot; is pretty hard, and it is vital for the fraternity that the &quot;wrong&quot; people never become brothers. They have to be removed from the pledges, from the brothers.Chad Ewing is removed from the list of pledges by his untimely death. For some strange reasons, the only official investigation of his passing is in the hands of a &quot;disciplinary squad&quot; formed of three students: Former Sigma brother Mark Jessy, his girlfriend Shawn, and Simon, a prospective law-school student. This gang is headed by Dean Templeton, a corrupt man without reasonable qualification besides the fact that he is from Oxford.The book describes the squad's search for evidence to relate Chad Ewings death to the pledge activities of Sigma. Their efforts are permanently undermined by the Dean and by the mighty alumni of Sigma. The description of this process is well written, gripping, and makes it hard to put the book down. The effect is enhanced since for quite a while, no happy ending is in sight (and I leave it to the reader to judge the actual end of the book).&quot;The Pledge&quot; reminds me a bit of the good old &quot;Dallas&quot;/&quot;Dynasty&quot; soap operas: A few good guys surrounded by a world of evil brothers. The power of money and economic strength is clearly displayed. However, like in &quot;Dallas&quot; the characters remain relatively simple (although the author grants some of them - especially Mark, the main figure of the novel - at least a certain evolution).Another question is of course why reasonably intelligent people should want to become members of a fraternity with those pledge activities.An interesting plot - conspiracy - students - sex&amp;crime (I must have been at the wrong university) - silly rituals - a strong polarization of characters - 3 stars."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I am a sucker for any novel set on a college campus, prep or boarding school. Unfortunately, I found the book to be suffering from the toos - too wordy, too long and too much going on and not enough fully explained for my liking. I think the premise was a good one but needed some good editing and then some pulling together."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This book is probably one of the worst and unrealistic things I have ever read. The characters (especially Shawn) are unrealistic, as is the portrayal of a fraternity full of murderers, rapists, and thieves. Sometimes I wish someone would write the truth about what fraternal organizations do...this kind of trashy libel is getting old."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This book lacked any factual representation of Greek organizations and seemed to be simply out to get a rise from people who have sons and daughters in those organizations. The plot was weak and unfounded, the portrayal of the fraternity members ridiculous and stereotypical. Perhaps Mr. Kean should do that thing called &quot;background research&quot; before he writes another novel."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I read the first chapter of this book at the bookstore one night and it was pretty catchy. I then decided to buy the book and was extremely disappointed. This kind of prose would never make it past any self-respecting college professor. How it got past an editor at a major publisher is beyond me. The writing is so childish and predictable. The author seems to have a vast knowledge of adjectives and somehow feels that no noun is complete without one. The story is filled with many subplots that take far too long to develop and only serve to annoy, not add suspense. Obviously the author never learned one of the golden rules of creative writing: more words (700+ pages for a murder mystery/thriller??) does not always equal better."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The Pledge is a fast-paced and exciting debut by Ron Kean that will most likely find wide appeal among both younger and older readers. It will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end. So why a &quot;3&quot; rating and not higher? Basically because the plot and characters, while interesting, tended to stretch my willingness to extend credibility beyond the breaking point in too many instances. While I understand this is a work of fiction and some implausability is 'allowed&quot; in order to maintain suspense, The Pledge, for me, went too far too often to rate it more than three stars. Nonetheless, The Pledge is worth reading and I'm looking forward to Kean's next book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This being Rob Kean's debut novel, there are two elements of this book which can be forgiven which might not with a more experienced novelist. First and foremost, after about 350 pages of very well-crafted confusion keeping the reader involved hoping to unravel the mystery, a character appears and lays it all out on the table in 5 pages. Never mind that the explanation for this character being in the know is fairly weak; we just don't want to have it handed to us after the air of suspense has been built.The second problem is with the believability of the plot. Without going into spoilers, the chances that the powers-that-be in the book would go unnoticed for so long are low, especially considering the particular way that Simsbury College is portrayed: as a fine but small liberal arts school. My college was in the US News and World Report top ten every year as well, and there's no way a rise to power inolving *my* school would go unnoticed by some form of outside authority.If the preceding paragraph seemed cryptic, by all means, read the book. It kept me involved even as the aforementioned doubts crept into my mind. Rob Kean has a knack for unique prose and strong characterization. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Great read! If you are looking for a page turner for the summer holiday this is the one. Yes, as some have mentioned the story line is a bit sensational at times, but isn't this true of most action/suspense novels? The story was gripping and certainly one we can all relate to at some level. I couldn't put this one down.Great first novel"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Like a movie of the week, this one droned on and on never really managing to break the surface of what was behind all the hatred. (Someone give Kean a hug.) This book is far too jaded for someone with so much promise (as the book jacket claims). How many times can a reader tolerate phrases such as &quot;partying like rock stars&quot; without it sounding hackneyed?"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. I read it over the Christmas holidays a few years back. This woulud make an excellent motion picture. It reminds me a lot of \\"The Skulls\\" movie that came out a few years ago. I like the issues with the college and fraternity life and like the protagonist and his mission to help clean up the dirty things that he finds. I have recommended this book on several occasions for people to read and those people have echoed my thoughts of this book. Very well written, feels almost like a James Patterson book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Wow, I'm surprised that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. This is a candidate for the worst book I've read in my life. It starts bad and gets worse, with stupid characters and absurd plot twists.Most grating is the consistantly bad writing; Kean simply writes poor sentences, and it can be painful to read them. I mean, I don't expect Nabokov, or even Grisham, but this was just an amateur effort throughout. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised after reading Kean's thanks to his collegues at a big consulting firm for their support. Hey Kean, go back to your day job shredding documents rather than writing them!Maybe I just felt cheated because I had to lug this 720-pager home from the library and back."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Chad Ewing dreamed of being popular. He was a young man who wanted to &quot;fit in&quot; with the popular crowd, pledging the Sigma's would fulfill his dreams. The dreams are shattered when his naked, graffity covered body is found, broken and twisted beyond belief, dead.Chad's death is ruled as a suicide or an accident, but as his family and fellow students question the myserious death, it becomes clear that something sinister is going on behind the closed doors of Simsbury College.Mark Jessy, once a Sigma brother himself, and girlfriend Shawn Jakes, are part of the college committee investigating the death. As they begin pulling away the layers of a cover-up they will be pitted against a group of individuals who will stop at nothing to keep their good name, and their fortunes.Mark will question everything he has ever believed in, including an incident in his past that will somehow be connected to the recent death.&quot;The Pledge&quot; is an interesting novel. Complex plot, and fast-pace keep the pages turning.The novel would have earned 5 stars from me, except, I found it was peopled with too many characters, and it's a little too long in length.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The author shows some promise: the plot is intriguing and fairly unpredictable. But his characters are hackneyed and two-dimensional and his style is extremely immature: overblown, self-indulgent, trite prose. A strong editor could have improved this book immeasurably by cutting 50 pages and several hundred adjectives."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Several things bugged me about The Pledge. One, I thought it was terribly written, full of cliches and stereotypical characters that bogged down every page. Author Rob Kean desperately needs an editor; the book's 514 pages could have easily been sliced by a third. I was skimming through the final pages, something no novel should ever make you do. Plus, there was another thing that nagged me throughout about The Pledge - it should have been set in the 50s! Eliminate the few references to cell phones and e-mail, and Kean's bunch of mafia frat thugs would have been much more believable conducting business in any era but the '90s."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This book invited me inside and made me wish the story would continue even after I had finished the last sentence, primarily because of the feeling underlying what Mr. Kean has written. Kean obviously has passion for the craft of writing. It's apparent in every paragraph that he loves words and goes nuts when he has a good story to tell. The plot is interesting, though in places it is needlessly obfuscated. The main character, Mark Jessy, is beautifully drawn, fully realized, and totally believable. On the other hand, the females in the book are less believable, tending more to sound like juvenile fantasy figures than real women, but that's forgiven because the book works."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I was most impressed reading Rob Kean's book, &quot;The Pledge.&quot; The storyline flowed remarkably well, and I found myself unable to put the book down. In fact, it took me two sittings to finish, the second one of which ended at 5:15am one Saturday night/Sunday morning. The characters are well developed, and I found myself laughing (yes, out loud) at their mishaps, cheering their triumphs, and scowling at their foolishness. I highly recommend this book to those in college (for its relevance) as well as for suspense lovers of all ages who enjoy a good read."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"At Simsbury College at Sigma Delta Phi, the most exclusive frathouse on campus, pledge Chad Ewing is found dead, with vicious, sickpoetry scrawled on his body. While the powers that be try to pass off his death as a suicide, Mark Jessy a former Sigma brother and his beautiful girlfriend Shawn Jakes begin an investigation into Chad's death, and uncover scandal, extortion and corruption that dates back to the fraternity's inception two hundred years before. Kean writes well and has delivered an exciting page turner, and in Mark Jessy, has given us a reluctant, yet honorbale hero. This is the perfect summer thriller."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Having never been a fan of sororities or fraternities, I found this a very compelling book. The author did a great job taking the meaning of &quot;brotherhood&quot; one step further. With all that is written today about college hazing, this certainly brings home the impact these organizations can have on young minds. It's a book you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The Pledge is a novel that speaks to current day events on college campuses. While it is fiction, it rings of more truth than the casual reader would imagine. There is nothing really unbelievable about this other than that in real life the ruthlessness would be far greater and more clandestine. The book reads like a fast-paced Grisham novel and smacks of understanding and intellectualism approaching Donna Tarrt's Secret Society. With hazing again on the rise and more and more injuries and deaths attributed to it, this book appears in a time when students, parents and university administrators need to take a careful look at what is really happening. This book speaks volumes of truths for those who will listen. For those who simply ignore this book as a work of fiction are extremely naive to the machinations of some Greek organizations, Alumni influence, and university indifference and greed. This book is a must reading for the college freshman interested in a Greek organization. Anyone who is familiar with Greekdom and academia will secretly confess that this book could really be more truth than fiction."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Rob Kean is a master of suspense. Even the most minute details will keep you spellbound as the author does not divulge anything without having you read more.This was one of the best books I've read in awhile. I even took the book to school, gave my kids an assignment, and continued to read.I'm not usually enamored with books about collegiate shenanigans, being long past that age myself, but this book kept me riveted. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about mystery, abuse of power, and a fast paced - can't put it down story line."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I will admit that this book did a good job of pulling me in. The action and intrigue were well paced and written in an easy and flowing manner. The characters were cookie-cutter but still interesting to see. The dean, frat brothers and alumni made for a nice villan and an interesting alternative to the whole \\"one big bad guy\\" idea. Instead of one head honcho, we have three to contend with. Each with their own motives and mission. However, there is one thing that spoiles a book for me and makes me give a bad review. With all the words in the English language, why is it that authors feel they must use the four-letter ones? The \\"f\\" word was on every page...used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. There are many words in the English language...perhaps the author should have taken some time and found them...."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I'm going to keep this review extremely short. This is the first book that I've read in a LONG time that kept me reading all day. I couldn't put the book down. In fact, when I sat down for supper, I kept this book on the table, so I could read it as soon as I was done eating.If anyone's looking for a book that's a *really* quick read, this book is for you. I can hardly wait to see what Rob Kean comes out with next, and I&quot;m already looking forward to the movie!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"As an active alumnus of a major international fraternity, I wasn't sure how I was going to respond to this book. However, I found that I could not put it down. Outstanding. To the average reader it may be an indictment against the fraternity system. I would disagree. I shows what many so-called fraternities have become in the U.S. But it also explains what fraternities are supposed to be. Although some fraternties chapters have become the hazing, evil institutions this book represents, I still believe most chapters are trying to provide the true brotherhood and &quot;family&quot; that these characters where searching.Excellently written and captivating."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down and I highly recommend to others!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I enjoyed The Pledge, although I thought the author was trying a bit too hard to be &quot;literary&quot; - too many flowery descriptions, etc. As a Bowdoin graduate, though, it was fun to read the book and hear some of the phrases and nicknames for things that I haven't heard in 10+ years. I think that Rob Kean has a future in the Baldacci/Grisham genre of writing."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Great dialogue, fast-paced and plenty of suspense"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The Pledge was a disappointment from someone supposedly well educated"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This psychological thriller is multilayered.Simsbury College, a fictional school in a small town in Maine is controlled by a Mafia-like fraternity.

There are questions of who to trust and who really is behind all of the bad things happening! This was a mystery which also showed how dangerous greek life can be.

(The jacket copy says he &quot;attended.&quot;) My husband, a Bowdoin alumnus, refused to read this book beyond the first chapter saying that it bore absolutely no resemblance to his experience.People have commented about the unrealistic characters of Mark and Shawn. How long would a college of the stature of &quot;Simsbury&quot; put up with a dean like Templeton or a befuddled president?Also, if Sigma were indeed the all-powerful, brothers-to-the-end, world-controlling fraternity it is made out to be, why was it that NONE of the Simsbury College trustees was a Sigma?"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats.

I would recommend this book to anyone who like a mystery/thriller book."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I picked this book up at a bargain table &amp; am glad I did. The other reviews describe the plot so I don't need to, but it kept me reading right until the end. It's a classic good vs. evil story, with the good being very good &amp; the evil being really evil."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I picked up this book because i'm fascinated by fraternities. I've never belonged to one, but i'm fascinated by the whole concept of the secrecy of the initiation rituals and what might possibly go on, and how most frat brothers would go to their grave first before telling what happened. Which leads me to believe that they experienced things and had things done to them that were either really embarrassing or humiliating.This book is a great page-turner. I usually shy away from novels of this length, but the fact that it was a murder mystery/suspense story centered around a frat house was too good to resist. I'm thrilled to learn they are making a movie of this book because as soon as i was finished, i thought how great a movie this would make. The rhythm and flow of this book reads like a screen play.Unfortunately, knowing how Hollywood can totally ruin a good book, the movie version will proabably be a major disappointment. As a matter of fact, i'm willing to bet that the movie version will have people who read the book saying, \\"The book was so much better.\\"Anyway, pick up this book. It's a lot of fun. Just be sure to suspend your disbelief at the door because there are some plot points that might be a bit hard to swallow as far as believable.An excellent first novel."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"An amazing first novel by Rob Kean. His characters are detailed down to their chipped teeth (Once you read the book you will understand). Each character takes the story deeper and deeper, creating a real novel about the perils of Fraternity Life.The story takes us into the twisted (yet believable) world of a fraternity that will do anything to make itself and its members flourish and succeed in life. Everyone will get involved in the fraternity's most recent scandal. But, Jesse (the main character) must deal with his own past fraternity life/scandal to solve this new one. It seems like there is no way out of the twisted lies for Jesse.If you love stories involving Fraternity and College life, you will love this one."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Rob Kean's first book was a success in every sense of the word. The story kept you entertained, guessing, surprised and not wanting to put the book down for what might occur next. I attended an Ivy League college, joined a frat, and played a college sport. These connections made the story even more captivating for me on a personal level. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, fascinating read about the powers and extremes of fraternal brotherhood."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I think this was an outstanding book.

I hope to see more like this one."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Being a young sorority girl myself, this book was both interesting and a page turner for me. The author is amazing in the way he writes this story. I could hear and feel every moment of the book.

I cant wait until he has another book out!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I picked up The Pledge just to read the cover summary. I knewthis was a must read. I'm not going to go into an overly detailed account of the book. I read a review on this website which said the plot was unbelievable and too complicated. On the first, isn't that why we escape into the world of fiction? Secondly, the plot was complicated, but that's part of what made it so wonderful. The book had more twists and turns than a scenic road on a mountainside. It thoroughly held my interest. Like any book it had certain slow spots, but it would quickly pick up. The review I read stated the characters were not well developed. Nothing could be further from the truth. All the reader doesn't know is the characters' blood types. It's a 718 page roller coaster that's better than any amusement park ride. I could go on, but if you have a strong affection for your college days, enjoy surprises with the turn of a page, and want to be completely consumed by a book....READ THIS BOOK!!! If it were a car, it would be the ultimate driving experience."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The Pledge was one of my favorite reads of the year, and I have read a lot of books. It is the type of book that just grips you and has you looking forward to reading every chance you get. After you read a chapter you are always left saying well maybe just one more, and then another. It is quite long, but reads very fast. The characters are well developed and likeable, and there are numerous interesting subplots weaved into the main story. There is also some humorous moments, especially involving the dean. The main plot is very compelling, and the plot twists are numerous. I hope Rob Kean has another book this good up his sleeve. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This is a fine debut novel from an an author I hope we see more from. Rob Kean has given his readers a gripping story on how power corrupts and things that people will do to maintain that power.Being a young man not too far removed from his own college days has also permitted Mr Kean to keep his details current, lively and informative. This is a book that could be read by college students AND their parents and both groups would be able to enjoy it. In addition to a deftly paced plot, the author also provides a morality play within the courtroom and murder subplots that co-exist within the pages of this great read.While set on a fictional college campus, this is primarily a murder mystery with some really well done courtroom drama thrown in for amplification. Kean does a fine job of building his characters as well and by book's end, I am sure every reader will have found a new level of respect and admiration for Kean's hero, Mark Jessy.I really enjoyed this book and can heartily recommend it to to college aged folks and their parents with equal fervor. Pick it up and read a great debut novel. I don't think you'll be sorry you did."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Simply written, with the pace of a James Patterson, the story line of a Sydney Sheldon and the plot of a Pat Conroy (Lords of Discipline) - this book held my attention for the three nights it took me to read it. Though reviewers seem to worry about whether it could happen or not, I'm thinking &quot;who cares?&quot; It's a good read, there are NO slow parts, and Mark Jessy is a hero, a la Will McClean of Conroy fame. Good for you Rob Kean, good for you. I eagerly await your next syllable."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"It's not often that I can't finish a book; usually if I can't it's due to a lack of plot interest. This is the first book I haven't been able to finish because I disliked every single character, even the two so-called good guys. The first hundred pages had nothing but evil characters manipulating and getting away with everything. I disliked the main good guy (can't even remember his name) for ever being involved in such a disgusting frat, and his girlfriend for going out with him; for someone who was so against frats, it seems strange that she should be going out with a former frat member.One hundred pages into the book, and there was not even a glimmer of hope that the evils of the frat would be punished. All of the actions of the characters were infuriating and just depressing to read.Thanks goodness I didn't buy even the paperback version of this book; it would be one that I couldn't even display on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I picked up this novel as a way to spend some time at the pool and while I wasn't disappointed, I was surprised at how predictable the plot line was written. It is a novel that explores that element of what makes frat houses and their inhabitants &quot;connect&quot; to one another, but this frat house, Sigma Delta Phi, not only expects psychological support from their members, they expect a kind of pseudo/robotic loyalty. Naturally, this enslavement comes with an incredibly high pricetag-namely being willing to forego any comfortable moral or ethical considerations. A subplot, involving the interactions of males versus how women interact, is, again, interesting yet shallow. The females that inhabit the book are either heavyset, hateful lesbian types or the sultry, intellectually vacuous ones. The only positive female of Rob Kean's novel is a blonde(naturally), yet brilliant and serious student whose first goal was to make Mark Jessy fit her preconceived ideas of what &quot;frat boys&quot; are really all about. This gorgeous protagonist, Shawn Jakes, then learns more of the human side of Mark Jessy (after convicting him on a date-rape charge as a member of the school disciplinary team). This relationship seems quite contrived--a man's pov that men perhaps don't view this crime in quite the same way that women do and perhaps don't wish to. All-in-all a pleasant read, although not enough to make me hope for a sequel."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"As a national officer of Alpha Epsilon Pi, the last remaining Jewish fraternity, I picked up this book on a lark. Hazing is still a large issue in today's fraternity world, much to the dismay of most responsible participants.This is obviously a work of fiction. There are horrendous cases of hazing but nothing like the sadistic brand written about here. Also, while I recognize this was fiction, the absolute stretches made in this book, strained my ability to believe in the characters and the story.Yes, there are other flaws (how many people can be killed, bought off, etc. without anyone raising an eyebrow) and why isn't a Sigma on the board of directors if they donate so much and dominate the campus?But, it was a fun book that was a little escapist, a little scary and more than a litte silly."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I had seen this book on the bargain table a few times and thought I might like to read somebody's perspective on fraternity life, as I had been in one myself. After finally buying it, I read the jacket and realized it was Rob Kean's first book and that he went to Bowdoin and lived in Boston and I was anticipating reading it just to see what kind of writer he was to get such a lucrative book deal. Before I got a chance to read too much, being the Amazon junkie that I am, I ended up checking out reviews, and found that, sure enough, some people loved it, and some hated it. By this time I was dying to see why the reviews were so mixed. So, I finally finished the book I had been reading and focused on The Pledge. I would like to share my views by reviewing the reviews.Here are my thoughts regarding the negative reviews. This guy wrote a book while working full time, and he did a good job. It was something that kept me reading to the end. I personally thought that most of the plot was farfetched. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a work of fiction. If you are reading this book to find out how a fraternity operates, then you are going to the wrong place. I know that some of the elements are true, but there was just too many things that I couldn't buy. Oh yeah, this is a work of fiction! To think this is how a real fraternity operates is like thinking that you can bury your pets in a Pet Semetary and they will come back to life.My thoughts on the 5 star reviews. I wonder what other books these people have read. I'm not sure how this book can receive the highest available rating. My impression of Rob Kean is that he is an imaginative and talented writer, but the talent is raw. If he writes or has written another book, I would hope he took the time to improve his writing skills. I will read him again, but I can't really compare this to the best books I've read in terms of overall reading pleasure.All in all, this book has some quality, depending on what your reading tastes are. If you can't stomach plots that seem quite unrealistic, then don't read it. If you are the parent of a fraternity child, understand that it has more fiction than truth. If you are looking for a great work of literature, don't get your hopes up. If you are looking to be entertained for a week or two, give it a shot."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I'd heard this book was really hot ... And I'll admit, there were some good &quot;hazing&quot; scenes, but overall, I found Kean's writing pretty tame. Not nearly as good as Alan Dickson's _The Greek Way_ or Michael Nambla's _Barely Brothers_."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This book certainly did not read like a first novel. It was excellent! The story takes place at a small private college in New England. The main story line revolves around a very rich or rather well endowed Fraternity.The trouble begins when a pledge dies, following a night of hazing and a party. The Sigma's feel like they will get off without a hitch, because Mark Jessy, a former Sigma brother, is on the Disciplinary Squad that will be looking into the pledges death. Mark is sure that it had to be an accident, and that his former \\"brothers\\" could not possibly have caused the death.Mark's girlfriend, Shawn Jakes, who is also on the Disciplinary Squad does not like the Sigma's and wants to get them shut down. She is determined that they will not get away with what they have done.The third and final member of the Disciplinary Squad is Simon Schwitters. He is planning to become a lawyer, and is therefore very interested in the case.The Dean of the college, Anson Templeton, will serve as the Judge, should the Disciplinary Squad press charges against the Sigma's. Templeton, however is very dirty. He is out to make a quick buck. He is on the payroll of the Sigma alumni. The Sigma alumni is responsible for most of the donations to the school, so they need to be kept happy. Dean Templeton is usually able to make problems disappear for them. However, this time, maybe not so...this book is rather long, but is worth reading. I found myself sitting up past midnight reading, not wanting to put it down. I enjoyed it and I am sure you will too."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Wow. This has to be absolutely one of the worst novels I have ever read (and I've read some of the stuff profiled in Pronzini's GUN IN CHEEK and SON OF GUN IN CHEEK). This is the literary equivalent of an Ed Wood movie-- ludicrous situations and dialogue so bad they have to be read to be believed. Jaw-droppingly awful. How did this thing even get published?"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"The Pledge's account of the shady dealings of a snooty college, it's big name frat, and the people who will stop at nothing to make them both accountable for the hazing death of a student, is a quick and easy read. The size of the book, which could have easily been edited down a couple hundred pages, makes it drag in places.This steady thriller will make readers re-examine their own college days and be glad for what they had."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I read dozens of books a year. This one is a standout! Definitely a book you cannot put down. Well written, great plot!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I tussled with giving this book a 4 or 5 star rating. In the end, I decided on 5 stars. It was a very good book that kept my attention the whole way through. It was somewhat predictable, but the way the author presented the storyline, it still did make you wonder whether what you thought would happen really would happen. The hero is an everyday guy, who kind of fell into his role. At first you didn't know whether to cheer for him or boo him. The frat parties were graphically depicted and I have no doubt that some of this stuff happens out there in the world. Whether or not a \\"brotherhood\\" of frat alumni would form is questionable, but certainly within the realm of possibility given the not so distant steps from hazing events to a brotherhood. Along the way, the author adds some rather dramatic \\"asides\\" in the story line - eg, the family of a dead student visiting his grave. At first these seemed to be too numerous and not pertaining to the storyline, but by the end of the novel, I realized that these asides DID actually add to the atmosphere of the story.In all, an excellent first book by this author and I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Ok--I picked it up because it looked entertaining, but The Pledge just wasn't that great. The plot, on top of being drawn out and convoluted, was implausible. What kind of exclusive fraternity bids a pledge without knowing one blessed thing about his past? And come on, generations of former brothers that still hang around the frat house? It reminds me of the thirty year old guy who trolls around teen dance clubs trying to pick up high school girls and impress people with his fancy car. And, I was very dissatisfied with the way the story ended. I was hoping Mark would at last reconcile with his fugitive father, who was sort of at the center of the entire conflict--but we never even met the man!For me, the best parts of the story were the rhymes that Mark and the other black cloaked figures recited. Maybe the whole story could have been in rhyme--that would've been something!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"This review is for the UNABRIDGED AUDIO BOOK.What an interesting read (listen). From the beginning when a pledge of 'big bully' frat (Sigma) was hazed to death, I knew it would be non-stop and it was. The story takes place at Maine's Simsbury College. The characters in this book are many, so you really have to pay attention at first to individual personalities. This book stirs a bevy of emotions within the reader.It boggled my mind to think how these Sigma apes got off on all the humiliation they inflicted to the pledges, and I can't help wonder... does this go on in real life? The college is run by a self serving, spineless man, Dean Templeton - and I was ever so happy how he 'got it in the end.'The story has a nice ending. Kean did a very good job of closure to all of the characters except for the two main parties, Mark and Sean. It left room for the reader to consider their fate - either separate or together. All in all, a good book to invest your time in to read or listen.PS... if you listen to audio books, please get the UNABRIDGED version. With all of the details and story of this book, I fear the abridged version would leave you somewhat baffled. In fact, never listen to anything abridged. It's like looking at a newspaper with no print!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although the plot is a little far fetched at times, it has enough suspense to keep you interested. The characters were well developed and you really got a sense of how a private school might react if something like that did occur. While reading it, I thought how this book would make a great teen horror movie. Hmmm...I guess I'll have to wait and see!"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"If you went to college in a small town, this book will be very familiar to you.I went to school in a small town at a selective university, and many of the people, places, etc. are all familiar, making this book a very good and easy read.I hope Mr. Kean comes out with a follow up soon."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I certainly enjoyed reading &quot;The Pledge&quot; being a fraternity alum who went to the same high school as Rob. I could relate to many of the stories, humor and descriptions of greek life and the students at a small liberal arts college. I especially was impressed when some of the character names resembled similarities to our town upbringing. Additionally, some of the character actions put me in sync with Rob's mindset. I do, however, agree with some of the other readers comments about some of the characters actions being a little too unrealistic in addition to the overuse of certain four-letter words. Nevertheless this book is a thriller in the end. Anyone who has been a part of the greek system will certainly relate. My favorite quote about the attractive blue-eyed blonde girlfriend of the hero, &quot;a body that roughly fifty percent of the campus longed to hold, and the other fifty longed to resemble.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"I'll be the last to describe this as a classic, it's much more of a page turner than anything else, but for a light read, especially when you're on vacation, you could hardly do better.Set on fictional New England college campus, The Pledge is about a Godfather-ish fraternity that controls everything at the college and in the surrounding town, as well as having their teeth sunk into many things nationally as well. The fraternity accidentally kills one of their pledges during a hazing stunt, and the book details the acts the chapter undertook to cover it up as well as just how ruthless they can be.As a Greek myself, I can say that very little of what is written in this book is true. But if you can suspend your disbelief, you'll have a book that you won't be able to put down until you're finished."},{"Title":"Pledge, The","review":"Good captivating charactors. There are enough plot twists and charactors to keep the suspense through the entire book. It was set in a college, and the students were quite believable. Looking at the descriptions, I could just about find someone from my college days to fit each of Kean's charactors. Some of the \\"alumni\\" weren't as believable, however, this may be due to my pre-set convictions. It was a page-turner to the very end. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys best sellers."},{"Title":"Pilot","review":"As a leading poet and authority of English language haiku for the past three decades, Anita Virgil has delighted and inspired us with her superb poetry as well as enlightened us with her wisdom on the subject of this literary genre.

Sometimes the main characters have been of the mischievous type like Squirrel Nutkin, Hunca Munca or Samuel Whiskers. Well, in \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\", the main characters, Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, are two thoroughly disagreeable and unpleasant creatures. Mr. Tod has foxy whiskers and is of a wandering habit. The other animals either cannot bear him or are frightened of him. He has several different houses but is rarely found home. However, his houses are not always empty, for Tommy Brock is prone to moving in without Mr. Tod's permission. Tommy Brock is a fat, waddling badger with a horrible grinning face and a habit of digging things up. One day he pays a call to old Mr. Bouncer, Benjamin Bunny's father. Today he is in charge of looking after the young, while Benjamin and his wife Flopsy are out. Unfortunately after conversing with the badger and smoking a very strong cabbage leaf cigar, the old rabbit falls asleep and Tommy Brock makes off with the rabbit babies. When Benjamin and Flopsy return they find their young gone and Benjamin at once goes out to track down Tommy Brock. Along the way he enlists the help of his brother-in-law, Peter Rabbit. Of course, they are not the only ones after the terrible badger. It seems that yet again he has set up house in one of Mr. Tod's residences and the fox, who is not in the best of moods this day, discovers the badger asleep in his bed... There are not many color pictures in this book, but there are many black and white illustrations in the style of woodcuts. Of course the story is extremely interesting and suspensful. \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\" is a longer story than some of the author's other tales. Also, there is more narration than dialogue and the language is early twentieth century, so this story may be more suitable for older children. Parents and children should not pass up this lesser known tale by a very talented storyteller and illustrator."},{"Title":"The tale of Mr. Tod (Her The Peter Rabbit books)","review":"My 7 year old loved this book.

Jameson Currier's latest collection of fiction seeks out to exploit that very indecisive and fickle nature of men. DESIRE LUST PASSION SEX is an extremely well written, entertaining and poignant collection of short fiction in which the male ego is placed under a literary microscope and dissected right before the reader's eyes. The book features nineteen short stories, many of which have been previously published in erotica anthologies and gay men's fiction journals.Jameson Currier's stories are diverse and enigmatic as he treats all his topics with genuine expertise: the frustration of surviving the AIDS epidemic, getting romantically involved with married or \\"unavailable\\" men, the fears of getting older and the fears of still being too young and/or inexperienced. Altogether, the stories deal with real characters trying to survive in an overly sexual world. His first story, \\"Lessons\\", involves a man who has re-emerging from sexual hibernation after the peak of AIDS and answers a personal ad for a sexual trainer. To his complete disgust, he finds that the teacher is a 300 pound late 50's man named Joey. Though completely disgusted by his host, the narrator feels almost obligated to stay and have sex with him. Somehow, a strange bond forms between both men and the experience ends on a good note. If only all of Currier's characters could be so lucky. A later story, \\"Expatriates\\" involves a romance between two men at a flea market. Dru is a small-town working-class boy, who is engaged to his girlfriend of several years and Rusty, an ex-model, helps his sister run a booth at the flea market. Dru's and Rusty's friendship centers around them hooking up in Rusty's van, while Dru contemplates choosing between his girlfriend and Rusty. Ultimately, the friendship is doomed and Dru re-closets himself.One of Currier's gifts is his ability to take very specific moments and unleash some form of hidden erotica. He turns a boy's near drowning during lifeguard lessons into a picturesque scene of man-boy love, unleashes the sullen intellect of a man snowed in with his escort and gives the personal account of wild sex with the modern day Tarzan. Gay Men will love this for this collection for its all-too-true scenarios and brisk erotic qualities. Women will love this for a sneak peak into a gay men's mind and the personal struggles between romance and sex which is worth re-reading over and over again."},{"Title":"The New Professional Chef (TM)","review":"After 29 years in the Hospitality Food Service Industry I have finally found one book that encompasses most of what one needs to know as a Chef, Professional or Amateur.

It is a different story now, because if I don't cook, I don't eat. Take out has its limits in more ways than one. The New Professional Chef is perfect for someone like me. The title did not scare me one jot, because I needed professional help. The truth is, that this book is REALLY for everyone. Perfect for ANYONE really, who if forced to have just one general reference/cookbook, which would be kept close at hand in the kitchen, could find EVERYTHING one needed to know about: Nutrition and Healthy Cooking, Equipment Identification(knife identification, hand tools, pots &amp; pans), Raw Ingredients (excellent illustrations on various cuts of meat, poultry and game birds, fish &amp; shellfish, a wonderful section on grains), and my favorite section, Mise en Place, which shows you the necessary skills &amp; techniques that you will need in the preparation of ANY meal. Various cooking methods are also presented, and a great many recipes are available to chose from. This is the perfect gift for anyone from a college graduate who is setting up their first apartment, to newlyweds.

The Wine Spectator Greystone restaurant on the campus is a wonderful place to dine and I heartily recommend it. The atmosphere is inviting and it's great to watch the chefs preparing mouth-watering dishes in the open kitchen. It was a treat for me, as a cooking enthusiast, to visit this presitigous cooking school.After visiting the CIA, I found this book and knew I had to have it as a reference foundation for my cooking skills. It has step-by-step techniques and recipes presented in a concise and easy to follow manner. I would recommend this book to anyone serious about learning the skills that professional chefs use every day.Please note that a kitchen scale is highly desirable when using the recipes. Most recipes use weight measurements instead of volume. Additionally, you will find that the recipes will need scaling down to feed average families, since they are designed for the professional restaurant chef.Great for the serious cooking enthusiast!"},{"Title":"The New Professional Chef (TM)","review":"Being a graduate from the Culinary Institute of America, I can tell you that this book is great for reference for freshness checks, seasonability but as for the recipes they dont always work and there are alot of mistakes.

While most of the recipes are scaled for large quantities, they are easy to scale down due to the use of weight as a measure rather than volume.If you were to buy only one cookbook to last a lifetime this would be the one. While it is pricey, you must realize the amount of time that has gone into the preparation of such a tome.I highly recommend this book for you.

My only gripe is that this book should be all technique, with recipies supporting the ideas only. All in all, worth the discounted price here at Amazon.

It is used as the main textbook for those studying at The Culinary Institute of America. Because of the differences between home cooking and professional cookery, the average home cook might be intimidated by some of the preparation methods and yeild of the recipies. It does explain very cleary the rudiments of professional cookery, and has many sequential photos to cleary demonstrate the methods being taught. After each section/ lesson, recipies are provided for dishes that demonstrate the particular cooking method being taught. Every home should have a book on the techniques of cooking, not just a collection of recipies. For that reason, I reccomend this book to anyone wanting to learn serious cooking."},{"Title":"The New Professional Chef (TM)","review":"Not being a professional chef, this book was quite intimidating. The info regarding ingredients was great, and the recipes so far have not let me down. This is a great aid in helping a normal guy like me prepare a very nice meal for company the RIGHT way. A great appreciation for fine cooking is developed after studying this book. The ingredient measurements in weight were a bit of a stumbling block for me at first - if you don't have a scale, you had better be an excellent guesser. Overestimating and buying too much veal loin can be pretty expensive. This is THE book for basics and, of course, a fine meal for that special occasion when company is planned (most meals here require several steps and multiple sub-recipes, and are not fast, Betty Crocker projects).

But do NOT buy the abridged version (Puffin). One thing that is taken out is Kingsley's many sarcastic references to American democracy. The publishers have taken out the anti-American sentiment to sell more copies to Americans--this is, of course, a very American thing to do, and it's this sort of thing that led to Kingsley's satire in the first place. I would suggest that publishers stop mutilating books and start reading them. I certainly hope people will stop buying the abridged version.I note, by the way, that the anti-Irish sections are left untouched.Here are some passages--page numbers are to the excellent Oxford World's Classics version, ed. Brian Alderson (1995):&quot;But he [Cousin Cramchild] was raised in a country where little boys are not expected to be respectful, because all of them are as good as the President.&quot; (85)&quot;Being quite comfortable is a very good thing; but it does not make people good. Indeed, it sometimes makes them naughty, as it has made the people in America . . .&quot; (115)&quot; But they were true republicans, those hoodies, who do every one just what he likes, and make other people do so too; so that, for any freedom of speech, thought, or action, which is allowed among them, they might as well be American citizens of the new school.&quot; (141)&quot;So she packs them [the sperm whales] away in a great pond by themselves at the South Pole, two hundred and sixty-three miles south-east of Mount Erebus, the great volcano in the ice; and there they butt each other with their ugly noses, day and night from year's end to year's end. And if they think that sport--why, so do their American cousins.&quot; (147)There are others."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"\\"The Water-Babies\\" by Charles Kingsley is best described with reference to J. M. Barrie's more famous work \\"Peter Pan\\", both of which belong in the canon of Victorian fairytales. Kingsley's work is poised between two words: the world of Christianity and the whimsical realm of fairies, and the onset of the scientific and historical developments that resulted in the evolution theory, industrial factories and the War. Although certainly not as famous as Barrie's tale of the boy that never grew up, Kingsley's story is equally fascinating, though much more difficult to read.Tom is a young chimney sweep of London, under the brutal care of Mr Grimes who doesn't hesitate in sending him up the filthiest, narrowest chimneys whilst he collects the money from downstairs. Tom himself is quite the little savage, but when his master is employed at Harthover Place, he is in for a surprise. Getting lost on the rooftop and crawling down the wrong chimney, Tom finds himself in a room where three things change his life. The first is a picture of the Crucifixion on the wall. Having no idea who Christ is, Tom is rather intrigued by the picture: \\"Poor man, he looks so kind and quiet. But why should the lady have such a sad picture in her room?\\" The second is the young girl asleep in the bed, beautiful and peaceful. The third is his own reflection in the mirror, which horrifies him - \\"Tom, for the first time in his life, found that he was dirty\\".Accidentally waking the little girl on his way out, Tom sets the entire household upon him - out of the house, across the moorlands and down the valley to meet his \\"death\\" in a nearby creek, and his rebirth as a water-baby. And there his adventures really begin, as he investigates his new form, meets the river-folk and begins his journey to be reunited with the little girl in the white bedroom - Ellie, who has not forgotten the boy who woke her from her sleep.Like Barrie, Kingsley's story is chock full of allegory and moralising, namely concerned with images of baptism and rejuvenation, as seen from Tom's transformation from \\"dirty\\" (figuratively and literally) to the white form of the water baby, to the moral growth that he gains over the course of the story. Presiding over all of Tom's adventures is the Madonna-like figure of Mrs Do-as-you-would-be-done-by; a fairy queen that takes many different forms and names throughout the course of the story. As well as this, there are touches of the Victorian fascination with insect life, as Tom's \`evolution' could also be compared with the pupae and larvae stages of the insect life cycle that (with the onset of microscopes) was being explored by biologists of the age.But Kingsley's story falls short in several aspects, namely when he is speaking to an adult audience rather than a child one. Though the story is subtitled \\"a fairytale for a land-baby\\" and the narrator is conversational and chatty throughout (in fact the style reminds me a great deal of C. S. Lewis in the \\"Narnia\\" series) calling the reader \\"little man\\" and often providing legitimate queries that the reader would probably be asking at that time, often he strays away from Tom's story to discuss his own personal opinions and theories on the general mindset of the Victorian world - some of which is amusing, some of which is tedious.For instance, Kingsley perhaps gives us the strongest evidence of the existence of fairies in the world - or at least why experts can never really claim that fairies, water babies and other such creatures do not exist. Only his own words can really do this justice; as the reader says: \\"But there are no such things as water babies,\\" to which he answers with devastating logic: \\"how do you know? Have you ever been there to see? No one has a right to say water babies don't exist until they have seen no water babies existing.\\" You can never prove a universal negative!But these amusing ponderings, and tongue-in-cheek criticisms on other Victorian minds will probably be far over the heads of any children that the book is aimed toward. I can't believe I'm saying this, considering I hate having original books tampered with, but perhaps it would be best to read a young child an abridged version of Kingsley's story, and waiting till they're older for the complete text. For the record, I got my copy at age nine, and didn't get it finished till ten years later. Furthermore, it is a book of its time, and you'll find within its pages several disparaging remarks directed toward the Irish, Americans and several other ethnic groups (heck, this *was* written during the British empire!)However, Kingsley's book is a necessary inclusion into the library of children's literature - namely because it can be enjoyed by adults too. With a poignant look at the horrors of a sweep's life, to the humorous commentary on his contemporaries, his intriguing philosophy on the nature of fairies and the sublime moments of Christian spirituality, this is a classic to be read and re-read in childhood, adulthood and old age; it'll be a different story each time."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"[A warning--there is no unabridged version of &quot;Water Babies&quot; now in print. The Puffin notes that it is abridged, but the Wonder Book with the beautiful Wilcox-Smith illustrations does not state that it is abridged, but it is. Check university libraries for 1898 or so versions illustrated by &quot;Linley Sambourne.&quot;] &quot;The Water Babies&quot; first published in 1863 is a classic mid-Victorian fairy tale that also reveals some of the preoccupations and anxieties of Victorian culture including sanitary health reform (hence the emphasis on cleanliness); Christian socialism (that is social reform based on Christian teachings); child labor and child abuse; and primary education. The dark side of Victorian culture is also revealed in this tale--especially in the original unabridged versions. Here we see a philosophy of social Darwinism that leads easily to notions of white supremacy as well as much anti-Irish sentiment--this at a time when Ireland had still not recovered from the horrific &quot;Great Famine&quot; of 1845-1852. There is also a sub-text of anxiety about adolescent male sexuality--of young men needing to maintain sexualy purity before marriage--again, the emphasis on Tom purifying and cleansing himself. Although written for children, it is a rather difficult text whose language does not invite the young reader in in the way that the Oz books or the Alice books do. I think its real use is as a document of mid-Victorian culture and is best read in the context of other &quot;social problem&quot; or &quot;condition-of-England&quot; novels such as Kingsley's &quot;Alton Locke&quot; or Dickens's &quot;Hard Times.&quot;"},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"Truly only for children (or adults) who are already readers with inquiring minds and imaginative, curious natures. The era, great detail and background of the book put me in mind of tales from Dickens. It makes a time-traveler of the reader. If books already transport you, this one will take you to wonderfully imaginative places. If you want today's 'politically correct' or simple easy reading, don't bother with WaterBabies. But for a window on another time and place (and a lovely bit of magic), this books's priceless.I tend to rate children's book solely on their entertainment value and how well they capture and retain interest. This book may not be for every child or adult but if you like fairy tales, underwater adventure, and stories where striving and good eventually triumph (yes, a happy ending :-) This is just lovely.I bought a facsimile of the first edition when I was a kid and recently bought the edition with Jesse Wilcox Smith simply for her illustrations. Children would probably enjoy the abridged (and less dense) edition better than the original but I'm sure it all depends on the child. And there are many illustrated copies by noted artists that can be bought used.Kingsley's Water-Babies was a childhood favorite, I read it to my son when he was of an age, and look forward to reading it and discussing it with grandchildren. As a child I was a bit shocked over the blatant condescension towards the Irish probably because as an Irish-American I had never come across such attitudes before. It was an eye-opener as to the views of the era but certainly more as an occasional background aside - not enough to detract from the overall magic of the book."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"Interesting that an original version of this book is extremely hard to come by. The abridged version, as mentioned by another reader/reviewer, omits crucial references to the racist and anti-Irish underpinnings of this \\"fairy tale.\\" The book was basically written as a critique of anti-slavery, anti-abolitionist sentiments stirring in Britain regarding it's colonies, which were still - after the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 - encouraging the slavery and mistreatment of black people. Read the book, but tell the children the truth, please."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"This book was a wonderful novel to read. It showed how little kids were treated durning this time period. Once the faries found Tom his life changed forever. The author explained how he started out as little boy and saying bad words to how he changed and in to a understanding boy. The book is a wonderful read because it shows what happens to others who don't know what it's like. Not all of this is true because it is a fairy tale. The author's one quote that stayed with me the most is &quot;You're not supposed to belive all of this because it's a fairy tale even if you do believe. This is a powerful story and should be read to little children. It will show them that being bad is not the way to go. If kids learn tpo be nice when they are young then it can stop hatred and people being mean in future years."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"I have just reread a copy of the book given to me as a child in the 1930's.

Charles Kingsley's work was banned for quite a while. There is no question that this cleverly written fairy tale has a lot of hidden information to explore.

Mr. Kingsley has other wonderful works to explore and in addition, there is his niece, Mary Kingsley who wrote on Africa."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"I thought I'd pass along a review of this book I've just discovered in Rockwell Kent's book Wilderness (1920), \\"easily the most remarkable book to come out of America since Leaves of Grass\\" (The New Statesman). From August 1918 until March 1919, Rockwell Kent lived on Fox Island, off the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska with his 9 year old son, also named Rockwell. Kent took along a lot of books, a copy of Nietszche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, which he was illustrating, and a pile of books, both educational and recreational, to continue the education of young Rockwell. This quotation is from p. 96 of the Wesleyan University Press reprint of 1996.[quote] Short notes in the journal mark \\"Treasure Island's\\" swift passage. Then enter \\"Water Babies!\\" \\"Just after [young] Rockwell's heart and mine,\\" I have recorded it. But Kingsley must lose his friends,--a warning to the snob in literature. How it did weary us and madden us, his English-gentry pride,--unless we outright laughed. \\"At last it's finished. that's an event. When Kingsley isn't showing off he's moralizing, and between his religious cant and his English snobbery he is, in spite of his occasional sweet sentiment, quite unendurable. So to-night we read from 'Anderson's Fairy tales'--forever lovely and true.\\" [unquote]Kent (1882-1971) was a famously independent and independent-minded artist and illustrator. He was possibly the most famous illustrator in the generation after N. C. Wyeth. His spectacularly luminous paintings from rural New York State, Newfoundland, Greenland, Chile, and Alaska--extreme climates all--have been the subject of several retrospectives."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"purchased for a gift, and was loved by the reciever. the art work is beautiful, and the story line was perfect for the individual."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"A British copy (printed in London), the book is pretty much what I recall from years ago.

A treat of a story that makes one WANT to be honest, trustworthy, courageous, determined, considerate, kind, caring, and good! The beauty and benefits of this story far outweigh its few flaws from a dated past.Somewhat pass&eacute; today in our politically correct society due to the complacent English prejudices (hopefully only from the era in which it was written) mentioned in it. Racial stereotyping was completely acceptable in children's books (and society as a whole) not just in England but everywhere and not that long ago.The one bit that stuck with me was something to the effect ... If you ask Paddy (as a symbol for the entire Irish population!) a question and he lies in answer, don't get angry at him as he doesn't know any better. Egads. Hard to believe but sadly too believable. I'm Irish therefore I lie?? OMG!! But in fairness, in the beginning chapters of the book, the author did have the fairy godmother type take the form of a wholly admirable and beautiful Irish peasant woman to look out for and talk to our hero, Tom :-)As an Irish-American who has never experienced any anti-Irish prejudice, I thoroughly enjoyed this book both as a child and still love it as an adult. So don't let my prejudice comment stop you from reading the book. It's old, from another era, and the author had a well-meaning, kindly but unthinking and sometimes ridiculous victorian paternalistic attitude towards the Irish that I found at worst irksome but easily ignored. It snuck in here and there but was not the focus of the book. And he certainly was not rabidly anti-Irish as some from his era were. Actually, I got the feeling that the author was probably a bit forward thinking and more kindly inclined to the Irish for his time though still a product of his own upbringing and times.I know that \\"politically correct\\" is often made fun of nowadays. I'm all for it in modern lit simply because - to our children- kindness, fairness, and equality will simply be taken for granted one day. And that would be a wonderful thing! But at the same time I would hate for any lit from the past to be white-washed or cleaned up simply to meet today's standards. It is part of a historical record. One day, racial stereotyping will simply be a ridiculous primitive practice from the past. Both kids and adults will enjoy wondering innocently how people could ever have been so silly! Re-writing classics or the past serves no one.Overall, this is a sweet, wholesome, moral and still very appealing book which I would be happy to gift to any child or adult! It still has much to offer the modern reader."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"I read this book nearly half a century ago in my native England, then I read it to my American step daughter, and saw the same sense of wonder and delight in her face that I probably had on mine. It taught me Karma, it taught me the value of home, that kindness can be a gift; and it still provides the subtitles to emotions I feel today - \\"to the sea, to the sea\\". Perhaps it struck a chord with me, the father of another man's child, rereading Tom's struggles to find his way without a parent. It was a sweet return."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"Handsome new edition annotated with the latest scholarship reflecting Charles Kingsley's acceptance of Darwinian thought. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"Reading this really makes you want to get away, just like Tom does in the story. Although this is sort of a longish fairy tale, it is delightful and intriguing. For me, though, this book's biggest selling point is the illustrations by Warwick Goble. As a fairy tale fan, I first came across Goble inThe Moon Maiden and Other Japanese Fairy Tales, where all the color illustrations are in the middle of the book. Here, they are sprinkled throughout the book, more closely accompanying the story, and adding that much more to the reader's enjoyment. While the text is crisply printed on stone-white paper, the color illustrations have a glossy finish that really makes them pop. Old and young should derive plenty of satisfaction from this book."},{"Title":"The water-babies: A fairy tale for a land-baby","review":"This is a classic British \\"children's\\" story and is more for adults or older children. It was written in the 1860's. It's a charming look at the transformation of a dirty chimney sweep into a clean 4\\" water-baby, but on a higher plane also a look at the death of children during this Industrial Revolution time period. Beware: some of the author's prejudices come out in this book especially when it comes to the Irish which he represents as dishonest and magical. There is also an abridged version, and if you use this book with children, you might want to use the abridged version or explain these things to them. If you are an adult, you should read the unabridged version. Charles Kingsley had a good time writing this book!"},{"Title":"Scholastic Question & Answer: Do Stars Have Points?","review":"Although slotted for the age range 9-12, I read it aloud to my 6 year old and he understood and enjoyed the book. The format is question and answer, which you may or may not like. We found it fine, as many address common questions. The answers are detailed with many statistics and what some would call \\"trivia\\". The tone of the writing is not patronizing and it seems to cover just enough information for an overview.The subjects covered are: stars, our sun, explanation of \\"sun rising and setting\\", galaxies, the Milky Way, constellations, planets, orbits of plants, earths rotation, earths composition, Earth's atmosphere vs. space, our moon, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites, is there life elsewhere and what are some unanswered questions we still have? This is a good overview. Note that each planet is discussed in one paragraph. I feel that for a more thorough study we will need to delve into each planet a bit more, but this book was enough information on all the other topics it covers. The picture books on each planet by Seymour Simon are wonderful for getting more information on each planet and for their great illustrations.The illustrations in this book are drawings, which are nice but not as great as some of the wonderful photographs that are available. I am granting this 4 stars due to the illustrations being all drawings, and because of the lack of detail on each planet. I suggest supplementing this book with at least browsing through some other books such as coffee table books or other adult books about space so that the child can get a different perspective and to appreciate the beauty that is captured in our modern high tech photography."},{"Title":"Torpedoman","review":"There are many books about WW II U.S. submarine patrols in the Pacific. Many of these books are fascinating in their descriptions of tactics and leadership. A few books are almost as dry as official patrol reports. What unifies these books is that almost all of them have been written by officers, frequently skippers. In the last few years, books like &quot;Hell Above, Deep Water Below,&quot; have appeared, written about or by enlisted submariners, which is how the vast majority of the force served. Ron Smith's &quot;Torpedoman&quot; is the latest addition to the submarine genre and it's a doozy. The book follows his time training to be a submariner, through the Seal's outfitting, and on through a number of harrowing patrols. The book captures the camaraderie of the sub's crew and the way more experienced submariners looked out for the new sailors and showed them the ropes. The book appears self-published. Author Ron Smith's (apparently) unedited language is unvarnished and the story often isn't pretty or very noble and he makes no apologies. For that we can be thankful as Smith brings a sense of character, and a sense of time and place, that are unlike that of any other sub narrative I've read. Smith reports the mundane, day to day routine (monotonous watches, what he had for breakfast, laundry) alongside the dramatic (depth charge attacks, fights with Marines, other sailors, and civilians, drinking binges). At one point he and fellow crewmen sit on the oily, wet deck of the aft torpedo room, eating sardines and canned pineapple in the dark, trying to hide their fear by telling dirty jokes as the Seal sits at a 30 degree angle unable to trim, below their test depth, trapped by seven destroyers off the coast of Honshu, quickly running out of air and batteries. But this book is also interesting because of Smith's descriptions of the changing life stateside. Along the way, we learn about San Diego, Mare Island, Vallejo, Honolulu, and Hammond Indiana from a sailor's point of view, with a particular eye towards the sexual mores of the era. People did speak and behave differently then and &quot;Torpedoman&quot; captures this better than any other book I can think of. I would strongly recommend this book to those interested in submarines tales."},{"Title":"Where the Indus Is Young: A Winter in Baltisan","review":"While we were trekking around in Latin America we inherited \\"Where the Indus Is Young : A Winter in Baltisan\\" from another backpacker from London. He thought this book would be perfect for us to read, being a mother and daughter \\"on the road\\".I gladly accepted a free book, and I initially thought it would be perfect for my daughter (11) to read. She started reading it, but thought it was way too boring so she put it down and refused to pick it up again. (\\"Where the Indus Is Young : A Winter in Baltisan\\" couldn't quite compete with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban [in English] that our friend had brought from Texas to Bogot&aacute; especially for her...)I ended up reading \\"Where the Indus Is Young\\". This book is a daily journal, from a mother and her daughter spending a winter in Baltisan. I enjoyed reading about all the different people they met on their journey. I could perfectly well relate to their difficulties as a mother/daughter traveling without male company. I found that I quite enjoyed this book, although it made our trekking through Latin America look like charter-tourism compared to what they did."},{"Title":"Contemporary Abstract Algebra/Answer Key","review":"Very Good to create math problems and help my bro with math!"},{"Title":"Contemporary Abstract Algebra/Answer Key","review":"i want to read the answer of this book if i can take it please send to me to my email and help me"},{"Title":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Book of Pregnancy and Child Care","review":"This is my first parental experience for me and my wife .we expect a little girl in a few months. We are very excited and we are trying to get prepared as best as we can. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Book of Pregnancy and Child Care was really a very good choice, it was recommended by a friend whose case is very similar to mine. The book is very good to read and use as a reference too, it is very detailed dealing with every case the mother may have from serious illness to leg crumbs .The book really covers all three stages of pregnancy, childbirth and childcare in a way that satisfies you and keeps you away from the headache of buying other books for such stages. Having such source of information covering mother health during and after pregnancy, baby's nutrition, signs and behavior milestones gave us too much confidence to deal with our first child in a professional way. One last comment is that the book is very bold at stating facts that may harm your baby like for example what smoking may cause to the baby. I think the book is reliable, complete and advanced"},{"Title":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Book of Pregnancy and Child Care","review":"This book is a wealth of information; I've already tried many of the parenting techniques provided with great success. It never makes it back to my bookshelf for long because I am always referring to it. What's more, the information is presented in an objective, non-judgemental way. You are never made to feel like you're a \\"bad mother\\" just because you can't stay home from work or have trouble breastfeeding. It simply provides all the information you need, then the decision is up to you to decide what's best for you and your baby. A nice change from some of the other parenting books that seem to be written by authors who believe that their way is the only way."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's Will is one of the most beautifully written and moving novels I have ever read. I simply could not put the book down. Dale Cramer has a unique style of writing that is very engaging, descriptive, and causes the reader to care about the characters in the story.I am an avid reader but rarely will I reread a fiction novel. However, Levi's Will is different. There are so many subtle nuances in the story that I find myself wanting to read it again and again just to make sure I haven't missed anything.Like Dale Cramer's other novels, Levi's Will leaves readers with a sense of hope and peace and is universally appealing. My husband and son are reading Levi's Will, too.Thank you, Dale Cramer, for a beautiful story of broken relationships, restoration, and the power of forgiveness."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Dale Cramer writes in such a way that you feel like you're right there with the characters. Levi's Will is an excellent novel. The ways of the Amish versus the \\"English\\" makes it an interesting read.Thank you, Dale! You've written another winner!"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I loved this book. It isn't like any other Amish fiction out there. It isn't about the pull of the world or struggle to leave and face the ban. Instead, it's a story of a legacy of fathers to children, good or bad. The story unfolds with Will leaving his Amish community and the rest of it focuses on the pain of unforgiveness, the loss from severed relationships, and the wounds that run deep in a shunned man.The book alternates by chapters between the present and the past. But it's easy to follow since each is labeled by year. One thing I didn't like was that in one chapter, we see Will in the present looking at a picture and he tells us many chapters ahead about a main character who will die. It took away from the suspense a little by telling it that early.Readers absolutely must read the afterward! I loved the book before reading it but loved it even more when I read that. I won't give anything away by telling what it said, but I'm so glad I didn't read that ahead of time. It made the story so rich when I read it.I enjoyed the humor in Cramer's \\"Summer of Light\\" and that wasn't in this story since it was much more serious in content. I'd love to read another of his books! It would be wonderful to see the emotion and drama of \\"Levi's Will\\" merged with the author's incredible dry humor from the other book. Now that would be a story I'd rush to buy."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Have you ever read a book and then when you finished it you had this \\"wow\\" feeling? That's what I felt after I read Levi's Will by author W. Dale Cramer. What a wonderful story! The fact that it is based partially on Cramer's father makes it all the more intriguing.Will Mullet runs away in the middle of the night from his Old Order Amish family. He leaves behind a pregnant girlfriend, causing him to be banned. His younger brother Tobe tags along, but eventually finds his way back to his family. Will on the other hand changes his name to Will McGruder (so that his father can't find him), joins the army and begins a life that is filled with so many lies that he can't keep track of them.When things come to a head, Will resigns himself to returning home, even though he has no idea how his father will receive him. I was expecting the \\"prodigal son\\" story. I thought Levi (Will's father) would welcome his long lost son back, after not seeing him for over eight years. But, if that had happened it would have been a very short, uninteresting book. As far as Levi is concerned his son Will is dead. Now Will has to come to terms with never being excepted by his father again.This is a wonderful story about forgiveness and acceptance. When you read the afterword at the end of the book, you will be more than touched. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Will is tired of being ostracized by his father and others in the Amish community because he has impregnated a young girl. He runs away from home, thinking that he can leave his past behind, but as the years pass, he discovers that some things are too big and too fundamental to run away from. Will attempts to come home and reconcile with his father, but theold man will not be budged. He will not share a meal or a conversation with Will, something that Will's sons notice and ponder.This book is about timeless themes--the relationship between fathers and sons, the destructiveness of unforgiveness, and the glorious possibilities of reconciliation and obedience to God. W. Dale Cramer is one of the best Christian writers of our day, blending harsh reality with the redeeming love of God. His characters are real and unforgettable. I heartily recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"My husband and I picked up a stack of CD's to listen to on a long car trip. Levi's Will had \\"Inspirational Fiction\\" on it so we thought it might not be too bad. We were immediately drawn in by the story and couldn't wait to get back to it each time stopped. Dale is an excellent writer, and the story was indeed inspirational. I was so impressed with his writing that I bought all of his other books. I thought they would be a great addition for our church library.Sorry to say, I have been disappointed. It seems to me he did not intend for women to read Bad Ground. As I read it, I kept thinking that my husband would really enjoy this story, but I felt I was intruding in a man's world. I haven't been able to finish Sutter's Cross. It started out pretty interesting, but it became obvious what was going to happen in the end. It just didn't hold my interest.I will never forget the story of Levi's Will."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Dale Cramer is a master storyteller--one of the best in the CBA (and the ABA for that matter).

Something for other writers like myself to aspire to."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Next to the Bible, only one other book I've read has moved me like Levi's Will. I really had no expectations about the book when I bought it, aside from the rave reviews from others. I knew it had something to do with the Amish, but my knowledge of the Amish is limited to the cake-like bread we buy from them in the fall when we go to see the covered bridges in Parke County. W. Dale Cramer's book changed all that.He's sneaky with his descriptive story-telling, never letting me know he's being descriptive or telling me a story.Switching from past to present tense, Cramer keeps me just ahead of his words, though not in the sense that I could in any way predict what's about to happen. It's more like he's pushing me along as I grab at pieces here and there, until in the end I put them together to get the whole picture.This is an important story, and one that will leave you re-examining your own values. If you can only buy one book this year, let this be the one.[...]"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Forgiveness is the most necessary action in every human being's life - giving it and receiving it. Without practicing forgiveness, our world is left in a state of bitterness rebellion hate and loneliness.In Levi's Will, Author W. Dale Cramer tells the story of an Amish son and father who take decades to reconcile after the sun leaves the Amish community to escape a life changing command.With emotionally packed prose, this fictional account of part of Cramer's father's life, opens the door to the exploration of the damage forgiveness leaves in its wake and the beauty of healing since forgiveness \\"is the proof of love.\\"Cramer introduces readers to Will Mullet, son of Levi, a strict Amish father who demands his son's obedience in marrying the young Amish girl who became pregnant after she and Will got carried away during \\"bundling.\\" Will rebels at the unfairness of the punishment; after all, what did his father expect when two raging-hormone teens are given privacy to get to know one another?This story is ripe with characters who will live on in memory for decades. Kramer has managed to master the ability to bring characters to life, complete with abilities and disabilities, who remain unforgettable.Beautifully and sensitively written, without glossing ever the tragedies human stubbornness and pride brain, Levi's Will is a book for both genders and one to read again and again to experience the cleansing of one's own heart.Cramer has been received well, and it's difficult to find a bad review. Sutter's Cross and Bad Ground were chosen in 2004 as two of the Top 50 books by Publishers Weekly. He has also been awarded a 2005 Christy Award for excellence in Christian Fiction. Cramer won in the general category for his acclaimed Bad Ground."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"This is one of those rare books that leaves you sitting silently in your chair holding the book and reflecting on the experience after you read the last word. The story is about Will, an Amish boy who runs away. He leaves some of his Amish ways behind but finds himself drawn back to his roots over the years. The book spans WWII, the Korean War and Viet Nam and its aftermath and tells a lot about three generations of this family -- the Patriarch, Levi, old order Amish, Will (no longer Amish but conservative to his bones) and Will's sons Welch and Riley who live an entirely different lifestyle than Will is familiar with but also from each other. Although the setting is fascinating and tells us many things about the life of the Amish, the real story here is one that is about everyone. What it all comes down to is God and forgiveness. That is the purpose and the story of every life, Amish or otherwise. This is a wonderful telling of that age-old story and one that will leave you pondering your own destiny and purpose - a gentle, moving read."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Mr. Cramer is a fantastic writer. Usually when authors are too descriptive and use words not entirely common in contemporary fiction circles, I find that it disrupts the flow of the story.Not so in this case. Mr. Cramer's prose is beautiful and lyrical and paints quite a detailed picture. His characters are captivating; his story is compelling.Levi's Will is a tale about fathers and children; of love and forgiveness; and ultimately, about redemption and the fact that it cannot come from any source other than God.It begins with the protagonist, Will McGruder, in his early sixties, who has come home to bury his father. Through flashbacks, we meet 18-year-old Will, who, by virtue of running away from home and the responsibilities that entails, has been excommunicated from the Amish church. Back and forth, from the present to the past, new bits of information and history are revealed, and with each flashback, the pieces come together with startling clarity.Ordinarily too much jumping forward and back would result in a convoluted story that is too fractured to follow, but Mr. Cramer is a master storyteller, and I found that his form of narration made Will's journey that much more poignant.There is so much that leapt from the pages to make a mark on my heart, and I'm singling out but a few examples:The first comes from the unlikely wisdom of Tobe, Will's seemingly oblivious younger brother, who had run away with Will before returning to face his punishment like the man Will was surprised he'd become: \\"I know I had to go home. I couldn't stand being without a name, without...boundaries. I had to be attached to something, to come from something. I can't explain it right because I just don't have the words like some people, but I know when I was out there like you, I could have been anything, and it would have meant nothing. It was like being alone in the middle of an ocean. How do you know who you are, or what you are, or how big you are, if you can't see anything but yourself?\\"The second comes in a quote Will's estranged, rebellious son, Riley, reads to his father in the car on their journey to bury Will's father: \\"He raged against the ending of his days, for he found too late he had set his gods too low. With great clarity of purpose he had sacrificed himself, and poured his life out on a place that came, in the end, to be no place at all.\\"But perhaps the central theme of the book is offered up by a tiny German priest who has escaped Hitler. Will meets him on a steamer bound for the U.S., and his words still haunt Will years later: \\"Somehow you must come to understand that God is love, that love is the proof of God, and forgiveness is the proof of love.\\""},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"In W. Dale Cramer's novel Levi's Will, you will find rich storytelling, an eloquent writing style, and thought provoking dialogue.Returning to his Amish roots to attend his Father's funeral, Will McGruder, an Amish prodigal, remembers the span of his life from the time he originally fled in shame. traveling with his son back to Amish country, Will recalls his life as the scenery and the conversation spark flashbacks of his childhood and the events that propelled him to leave.The story is told in two parallel time lines which create intrigue as the reader assemblies both the past and the present events, adding a sense of mystery to the story. Memories of bravery, dedication, responsibility, fear, love, and friendship are described with endearment, focusing the reader to think of their own lives and relationships.This is a novel that you want to savor as it is filled with common sense wisdom. The story is not so much told as unfolded as you read. This is a wonderful story with authentic, believable characters, and rich history. It has been said that W. Dale Cramer writes enduring characters, and this is true. You are left with the feeling as if you know these people and this family. A great read, I recommend it highly.Reviewed by: Keiki HendrixVessel Project Book Reviewer"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I hadn't read Dale Cramer before, but I found \\"Levi's Will\\" at the bookstore, and it looked interesting. It's about all of what the other reviewers have cited -- faith, Amish beliefs and culture, breaking from one's family and culture -- but the real surprise for me was reading it as an almost personal history. Sustitute hardshell Southern Baptist for Amish, and it's like reading the story of my father, who broke with his upbringing, went to war, had serious family issues, and three sons who had all of that distilled into them -- and at almost exactly the same time period this novel covers. (Riley, Will McGruder's youngest son in the novel, would almost be my contemporary.)It's a testament to Cramer's writing that he could take something of his own personal histroy and transform it into this story, and that a reader would be startled into recognizing his own personal history. Absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"As both a author and reader of Christian fiction I was impressed with Levi's Will. The characters seemed real and the story line was believable.

Not only does it pull back a curtain to artfully portray the Amish way of life, it gets to the heart of broken relationships in a way that transcends culture or religion. Cramer has created believable characters and shown us their hearts, making us care very much about the outcome. And through it all he teaches a valuable lesson about love and forgiveness"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Living in Western Kentucky, I have grown up surrounded by the Amish and Mennonite communities here. I also understand the mystery of their lifestyle and how it draws our curiosity. The rigidity of it, while not exactly tempting to most, is appealing on many levels. The strict adherence to biblical principles and \\"not being of the World\\" but apart from it is a spiritual call many feel. It is what drew me to Levi's Will and kept me turning the pages. It is also what ran Will Mullet from the farm of his father Levi and on an adventure like no other.Will ran away from home at the age of nineteen after his \\"sin\\" was exposed through the pregnancy of his seventeen-year-old girlfriend. Instead of facing his responsibilities, he rebelled against his father's judgment and expectations. He rebelled against everything he knew. He joined the war, married an English girl, and made a place for himself in the World.Levi's Will is the story of a son finding his way in the World and amongst the Amish. Anyone who has ever had a strained relationship with a parent, or felt their parent expected more from them than they could give, will definitely relate to the relationship between Levi and Will and Will and Riley. The intricate characters, familial relationships, and storyline will personally involve you in their lives.This is the first book I have read written by W. Dale Cramer and he does an excellent job of developing the characters and the flow of the story. He moves seamlessly through time and location between chapters. The time jumps could have been a challenge for some authors, but not him. He does it well and in such a way that it is hard to put the book down. You just want to know more about Will, his family, his life, his relationships, Levi, and the Amish. Which is the mark of an excellent book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"The title, Levi's Will, holds a double meaning that reflects Amish patriarch Levi Mullet's strong spirit, and his inability to forgive prodigal son Will, from whose perspective we hear the story. The narrative of Will's life, starting with his defect from the Amish as a teen-ager through his military career and into his senior years, is both engaging and rich in description of his many adventures and life lessons. The damage done to Will by his own father, and replicated later in his empty relationship with one of his own sons, would have been predictable if a less skilled writer had presented it. Here, it appears fresh and meaningful, as do the many small details captured in Will's life. Also done well is the out of order sequencing of events, usually not a style I'm fond of, but which somehow works here. Sensitive and thought provoking, this would make both an excellent book discussion selection, or to be savored alone leaving the reader to ponder the recurring themes of faith, forgiveness, and freedom. The details on Amish life are well researched and accurate. It's not a page-turner, but something even better- you'll want it to last."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I have lived in the area of Ohio which is featured in this book and known many Amish people.

He leaves behind family, scandal and beliefs in order to set out on his own. Defying his pacifist upbringing he enlists and fights in the Second World War. After the war he marries and settles down with his family. But even when living in the Deep South, far from Ohio, he cannot shake the memories of his family. He cannot fully and finally uproot himself. His prodigal heart beats for home.In Levi's Will Dale Cramer, whose previous books, also published by Bethany House are Sutter's Cross and Bad Ground, brings us a story of betrayal, judgmentalism and forgiveness. He brings us a story of \\"the sins of the fathers.\\" Ultimately he brings us a story about grace. With settings as diverse the Amish countryside of Northern Ohio, the battlefields of Europe and the burning heat of Georgia, Cramer's attention to detail and realism paints a story that is both moving and profound.Cramer's novels remind me of those written by Jeffrey Archer - he can draw the reader into his world without relying on cheap tricks. He can carry a book for 400 pages without filling it with action that would take more from the plot than it would add to it. For example, when he sends Will to war, he sends him as a mechanic and not as a soldier. He does not add electrifying plot twists in an attempt to keep the reader intrigued. And indeed, he does not need to. This is a book relying more on the strength of the characters than on their actions. And in my view it is the mark of a superior novelist that he can create characters strong enough that they carry the book of their own accord.I enjoyed this book from cover-to-cover. It moves slowly compared to the thrillers I most-often seem to review, but I definitely enjoyed it more. It seems to me that Christian fiction has come a long way since I last invested time in it. Levi's Will is a long way from This Present Darkness. And it's a good thing."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"LEVI'S WILL is the perfect title for the story of Will Mullet, son of Levi Mullet, partriarch of a large Amish family.

This is a story of fathers and sons, how one affects the other, and how with love and forgiveness, it is possible to go home again after all.Once again, Dale Cramer draws us into a story that takes place in a setting most of us will only know peripherally. In BAD GROUND he took us down into the mines; in LEVI'S WILL we travel with him to the world of the Amish, where he introduces us to living, breathing people, not just caricatures wearing black hats and beards. It is a beautifully written story of real people that engages the reader from the first few pages until the very end, and will leave you feeling satisfied and at peace."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"All of Dale Cramer's book make you feel like you are part of the experience.

Keep them coming."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"The relationships between fathers and sons are the backbone of LEVI'S WILL, a novel that explores themes of forgiveness and rejection by rising Christian fiction star W. Dale Cramer. The title is clever --- a play on the name of Amish farmer Levi Mullet's son, Will; an allusion to Levi's stubbornness; and a nod toward the legacies that fathers leave their sons.The protagonist of Cramer's novel is Will Mullet, a 19-year-old Amish teen who is in desperate trouble. His girlfriend of sorts is pregnant, and rather than tying the knot, he elects to run away from Apple Creek, Ohio, and enlist in the military (another no-no in his pacifist community). The story bounces back and forth between the 1980s and four decades before, as we listen to Will's musings as a 60-year-old, then follow his life leading up to that point.The prose is often beautiful, as one would expect from Cramer's earlier books, SUTTER'S CROSS and BAD GROUND (named one of Publisher's Weekly and Library Journal's top books for 2004). However, rather than fleshing out one location, as he did so well in both earlier books, Cramer ambitiously attempts to follow Will across the globe, placing him in Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Belgium, and other places. For readers who appreciated Cramer's ability to develop a sense of \\"place,\\" this fragmentation --- along with the switching back and forth between time periods --- will feel a bit disappointing. (The community of Apple Creek would seem to lend itself to lots of introspection.) James Michener did a better job fleshing out the Amish community in CENTENNIAL, which included as one of its many subplots Pennsylvania Dutch boy Levi Zendt's abrupt departure from his Amish home for the settling of the West. Granted, however, Michener took 900 pages to do so.What Cramer does with excellence is unfold relationships between generations and between friends, which ring with authenticity. When Will heads for Atlanta to find work with an old military friend, Jubal Barefoot, Cramer's writing lightly skims some of the strong themes of Bad Ground --- construction projects, the maturing of a man through difficult circumstances, and the forging of relationships between men bound by hard labor.But the central relationship is between Will and his father Levi, a difficult, stubborn, strong-willed man who considers the shunning of Will for a lifetime a virtue rather than a sin. This exemplifies one of the central themes of the book: our sin, the power of forgiveness, and the bitterness of forgiveness withheld. Will carries his own load of sin: the guilt of abandoning the pregnant Amish girl, Mattie, at Apple Creek with him for decades, the despondency over not being a true father to his illegitimate daughter, his belief that he has caused the death of a man, and his grief about his own failures as a parent to his sons.Perhaps the strongest part of the book is when Cramer concentrates on Will's need for his father, something that no other relationship --- friendship, marriage --- can replace. Will tries to repair the breech about midway through the book, returning home and facing his father at dusk. Surprised by Will's appearance after so many years, Levi lights a kitchen match and examines his son's face by its dim light. In one of the book's most poignant scenes, Levi rejects Will and storms back to the house. Later in his life, with the breech still unrepaired, Will builds a small fire and Cramer, the narrator, reflects, \\"Even then, a thousand miles and a thousand light years away from Levi Mullet, sometimes Will gazed into the fire and saw before his face the flame of a single match flickering in the breath of his father's condemnation. Even then, some small part of him understood that it was no slavish ambition that drove him to work so hard, but a deep and festering need to prove something.\\"Eventually, Will faces his own culpability --- his rejection of Mattie and his daughter, his own shortcomings in his marriage, and his failures in parenting his own sons. The sins of the fathers reverberate through generations. Despite the tense relationship themes, this is a quiet novel, thought-provoking rather than a page-turner. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for the power of forgiveness, the need for reconciliation in relationships, and the cost of repeating the same mistakes through generations.(...)"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"There are some books that are so well written they must be savored; once you finish them its hard to pick up the next novel, because you know it will lack the flavor of the one you just finished. Levi's Will is such a novel. Levi's Will draws on well developed characters, beautiful prose, and a story line strikes at the heart of the father, son relationship. Dale Cramer is one of the finest novelists of our time."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"\\"Dusk. An Amish farm in Ohio. Will's father doesn't recognize him at first--it's been eight years--so he holds a match up to Will's face to see him better. \\"I thought you were dead,\\" Levi Mullet says, then blows out the match and walks away.This is not how it's supposed to be. Where's the fatted calf? The party?For years, Will has worked to overcome the ban of his father and the Old Order Amish community. Only now, when the life of his own son hangs in the balance, does he begin to see the truth--that love is the proof of God, and forgiveness the proof of love.Levi's Will is the mesmerizing story of an Amish man seeking to build a bridge across three generations.\\"I tried reading this book twice~ and I still could not get in to the book. I found it dragging and long. I am sorry I could not give any other opinion. Very rarely do I not finish a book~ but this one was one of the few."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Focusing on the stone-chiseled men of a previous generation, Cramer somehow pens novels of beauty and grace. He introduces us to sympathetic characters, then leads us through their dark valleys to reach the glow of redemption. With his last novel, \\"Bad Ground,\\" he gained respect and high praise from such notable publications as Publishers Weekly--and rightly so. I counted it as one of my favorite novels of the year.\\"Levi's Will\\" is equally engaging. I was caught up in the story of young Will Mullet, an Amish kid, who runs away from home to avoid the wrath of his father. This decision leads him on a path of deception which will cause a decades-long divide between Will and his Amish kin. Along the way, he sees the evil of WWII and discovers love. His lies catch up with him, though, resulting in a masterful--and humorous--scene between Will and his wife, a southern woman with a backbone to match his own.The last half of the book feels somewhat inevitable, yet Cramer draws us deeper into the nuances of his characters and the Amish lifestyle, and to his credit he still manages to generate emotional response. Lessons of love and forgiveness are learned, bridging the hurt of three generations; the hearts of fathers and sons are moved toward eachother; and the hypocrisy of religion is revealed, while the possibility of knowing a personal God is presented as an honor.Once again, Cramer shows us how the lessons of the past still apply today. His ability to do so through works of fiction is nothing short of miraculous."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"While much of Christian fiction tends to be overly optimistic, unrealistically wholesome, and often just plain sappy, Cramer injects much more realism and intellect into his prose, a writing style that is much more comparable to good mainstream fiction authors.I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Levi's Will.\\" Spanning over 40 years, this book tells the story of Will, a teenage boy who runs away from his Amish home and leaves behind a pregnant Amish girl. He subsequently enters WWII as a soldier, marries a strong-willed young woman from Georgia, and has a family of his own, but over the years his soul longs for his father's forgiveness and acceptance. He also wonders about the fate of the Amish girl and unborn child that he left behind--details that he kept hidden from his wife. However, Will's father, Levi, is a hard man dedicated to the strict Old Order Amish who refuses to forgive his \\"wayward\\" son. It's a beautiful story of bitterness and forgiveness, and one I highly recommend.While this story has its melancholy moments, Cramer includes enough hope to encourage the reader. One thing especially profound about this novel is its treatment of time. For over 30 years, Will seeks his father's forgiveness. That requires substantial patience and wisdom, something we all need more of. Will is a flawed character, which I like because he's very human, but Cramer shows that God doesn't always tie a neat bow on our lives and answer our prayers like we think He should. Sometimes things go wrong. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Sometimes we just don't understand life. Cramer's writing is extremely honest--something I'm very glad to see in the Christian fiction market. I'm eager to see what Cramer writes next."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Follow Dale Cramer's literary progress and you'll witness the evolution of a writer. Those with literary aspirations are well advised to begin anywhere-you can't go wrong with his novels, no matter how hard you try-and savor the tangible journey of a born storyteller. Rivetingly good when he started-even his first novel received remarkable critical praise-he just gets better with time. Learn from him if you can, but be warned: You'll be hard-pressed to analyze technique that all but vanishes in the presence of pure, can't-put-it-down-even-at-3-a.m. tale-telling.Cramer is a rare find among contemporary authors-a writer of depth and excellence who has something worthwhile to say. His books have dimension because he approaches them from a myriad of angles, burrowing under the skin of an impressive roster of original characters, polishing off with exquisite craft stories that burbled to the surface from deep inside. Steinbeck's honest appreciation of the common man, Wendell Berry's poetic vision of the binding relationship between man and the earth, Hugo's understanding of the heart-rending war between justice and mercy, and Tolstoy's timeless rendition of the human condition all find their way into his work. Superb craftsmanship, simple but eloquent language, and an extraordinary sense of timing make his fairly complex novels easy to fall into and impossible to leave behind. You will always take some of a Dale Cramer novel away with you.Levi's Will is no exception. It's a quiet but irresistibly compelling story rich with the complex layers and well-developed characters Cramer is known for. He combines the intimate history of a family with the sweep of social and political history in the 20th century and never seems to break a sweat. Yet you'll read it over and over, each time discovering some new connection, some intricate detail, some new layer you hadn't seen before, and you'll wonder, how did he do that? Then you'll go back and read it again.Ultimately, what makes Cramer's work more magnetic than many mainstream literary novels is simple, but it's everything: Heart. His books pulse with it; his stories reverberate with it. His characters live. In the 21st century, a living, breathing author brimming with talent and integrity puts his heart on the page and we remember what novels were meant to be."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's Will by W. Dale Cramer is an amazingly powerful book about the relationships between fathers and sons and Father and Son. Cramer's previous books (Sutter's Cross and Bad Ground) were so deeply moving, it always felt as though he were writing from his own history. According to the acknowledgements in this book, there is some truth to this story and it shows, or should I say, it shines. Will Mullet runs away from his Amish background and authoritarian father Levi into the World. He spends the rest of his life trying to gain his father's approval while denying that same approval to his own son Riley. This book is so elegantly written; it moves along quietly with no huge climactic scenes or melodrama. It's a simple story of quiet people living their lives the best way they know how. I've read some of Beverly Lewis' Amish books, and the characters seem to be idealized or romanticized. While Cramer's Amish didn't make me want to run out and buy a buggy, they were portrayed as real, true human beings with quirks and flaws. Their plain faith shines through the book like a beacon, not just to Will, but to the reader as well. Cramer's descriptions of Amish life and countryside are profound. The book doesn't end, it simply slips away, leaving the reader, Will, and Riley with hope."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's Will sets out to show that you can go home again, but that it might take a lot longer than you ever dreamed it would and there's no guarantee that the welcome mat will be out, ever again, when you do get there.A father-son saga, this novel spans 42 years and three generations, and movingly relates countless incidents that readers young and old will recognize as identical to the conflicts and heartaches of their own mortal struggles, especially with their loved ones.Born in an Amish community in Ohio, teenager Will Mullet runs away from home in 1943, changes his surname to McGruder, and over the years fashions a new life for himself, including military service in World War II, and settling in Atlanta with a wife and children of his own.Throughout, however, he feels like a displaced person, and well he should. Spending one's formative years in an old order Amish community is poor preparation for life in the outside world, and covering one's trail with lies is poor preparation for life in any world. Not even Will's wife Helen knows that her husband is not who he said he was, meaning that she and their children are not quite who she thinks they were, and that the man she has been sleeping with for years will turn out to be worse than a stranger; to her he's a cipher.Will begins to come clean with Helen and his own children when the urge to go home again brings him hope that he can heal the breach with a father who long ago disowned him-and who will prove slow, very slow, to forgive. There's also the little matter of still another secret in Will's past: He is the father of an illegitimate child he left behind who is now being raised by his sister as her own daughter.Underneath this main storyline for most of the book's pages is the minor theme of Will's troubles with his own sons, Welch and Riley, particularly Riley, who is every bit the rebel, and then some, that his father was in more innocent times. Will came of age in the 1940s; Riley is the 1960s version of the rebel son: draft-dodging, drugs, anti-war slogans, and up-yours attitudes from the Youth Rebellion, Sexual Revolution, and various other socio-political movements that disdained anyone over 30, proclaimed the me-first philosophy of life, employed the in-your-face approach to discussion, and embraced the certitude that nobody born before 1950 could possibly know his elbow from third base. Riley is, of course, wrong on virtually all counts, but how he begins to get a clue is an affecting story that surfaces at just the right time as part of the book's major theme: in part, how the sins of the father are visited upon the son, but mostly how the generation gap challenges the bridge-building skills between parents and children alike. It is no coincidence here that Will, a blue-collar worker, builds bridges for a living.Levi's Will is a solid follow-up to Bad Ground, Cramer's 2004 offering that was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best books of the year. It also finds Cramer demonstrating again that the Christian-fiction genre, his m&eacute;tier, can easily cross over into mainstream fiction. The latest novel might not be the writing tour de force that Bad Ground was, but its command of story is much surer, and in fiction ultimately the story is of paramount importance.Speaking of \\"paramount,\\" this novel would make a very good movie. You listening, Hollywood?"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"On his journey to manhood on an Amish farm in Ohio, Will Mullet makes a life-altering error - and it's one that he can't take back no matter how much he wishes it so. He leaves his home and all that he knows to head out to the \\"World,\\" while his father, Levi, is left to contend with his son's mistake.During the course of his \\"Englisher\\" lifestyle, Will changes his name, renounces his Amish roots and joins the army to fight in a war that his people will have no part of. He meets a good woman, and painstakingly, through Amish-bred hard work and perseverance, builds a family and home.Always, for Will, there is something missing. It isn't until he decides to confront his father and face up to his strained relationship with his own eldest son; that Will discovers the answer and salvation he is looking for has been there all along.Cramer illustrates elegantly the fabric of the Amish lifestyle and what it means to turn away from that life. He also tells a touching story of a man's quest for faith, acceptance and forgiveness.Will Mullet illustrates for readers the true power of seeing through another's eyes and the forgiveness that God can grant...if we only listen for His still, small voice."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"W. Dale Cramer, author of Levi's Will, proves himself a master storyteller with an obvious passion for \\"getting it right.\\" His prose is beautiful and his characters are drawn so realistically that you will believe you've known them forever. And when the story concludes, you'll realize you've grown to love them all, even the difficult ones, and you won't want to say good-bye.Will Mullet is 19 when he flees Ohio, his Amish family and the girl he got pregnant. He enlists in the military, meets Helen and marries her, has two sons and settles down to live as if he had no past. But his Amish life catches up with him and he's forced to tell his wife the truth, which includes his father's unrelenting judgment of him, the Amish ban and the child he left behind.Will's father is rigid, extremely harsh and slow to allow the prodigal son back into the fold. Only when Will \\"let's go\\" and forgives his father, does his father begin his own acceptance of Will and allow him to come home again.The tragedy of pride, which kept a family separated and seeped into the next generation, broke my heart. The process of forgiveness and healing lifted me up and gave me hope. And love... the proof of God made my heart sing.Cramer deftly weave's Will story between their Amish world and our world and travels between time periods with ease.

What will his father say? This was a relief and joy to read since it is not your typical Amish family story.

I personally dislike books that flip from past to present in each chapter and this one didn't change my opinion even with its great story line.I did enjoy reading a book written in a man's perspective especially since there aren't too many out there in this specific genre.

Dale Cramer. I was simply floored by \\"Bad Ground\\", had a good time with \\"Sutter's Cross\\", and now am practically speechless after \\"Levi's Will\\". While this wasn't the story that \\"Bad Ground\\" was, it is still a 5 star read. It paints a picture, and you can see everything as Cramer unfolds his story. Can you say, \\"raw emotion\\"? Yeah! Hurt, humility, love, anger, lots of conflicting emotions go into this, and it almost made me cry in the end.With the story of Will and Levi, eventually leading to Riley, you see the story of a dad, from generation to generation. The hurt of some, the pride of others. This is a painting of forgiveness, yet also of understanding. It also underlines the utmost importance for a dad to have a relationship with his kids, sons or daughters. My dad probably did the best thing he could have ever done for me the day before I finally moved out. He took me shopping for a few essentials (that wasn't the most important thing, mind you) and on the way home he asked me a question. He asked me if he needed to ask my forgiveness for anything before I left. That meant a lot to me as a son, and now it means something to me as a dad myself. It isn't a sign of weakness to ask your children to forgive you, no matter how old you or they are. THAT is also the lesson in \\"Levi's Will\\" that everybody needs to not just know, but learn.I've always enjoyed the band, \\"Crosy Stills and Nash\\" and one of my favorite songs they wrote happened to be \\"Teach Your Children\\". Check out the 2 choruses, and see if they don't ring fresh. It's more than appropriate.Teach your children well,Their father's hell did slowly go by,And feed them on your dreamsThe one they picks, the one you'll know by.Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,So just look at them and sigh and know they love you.Teach your parents well,Their children's hell will slowly go by,And feed them on your dreamsThe one they picks, the one you'll know by.Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,So just look at them and sigh and know they love you.That song can ring true to every parent, like it or not.

Eight years of lies have finally caught up with him, and threaten to destroy everything he has worked for. Now he must face the mistakes of the past and seek forgiveness.Set amongst the Old Order Amish, LEVI'S WILL is a superbly told story of generational sin, and the forgiveness and love one can only find through God.In a recent interview with Focus on Fiction, W. Dale Cramer reveals that this was a fictionalized story of his father's life.Cramer opens the book in 1985, before taking us back in time to 1943 when Will makes his break from the Old Amish community. Throughout the story, we are transported between present and past; following Will as he makes his way in life, struggling to overcome the judgmentalism he grew up under. Will leans on the one thing he understands, hard work, but fails to notice that he makes similar mistakes to those of his father.Cramer drew me into Will's story, capturing my attention from start to finish. It's not often you find a book that has you genuinely caring for the characters, silently screaming at the unjustness of actions, and praying that God's love will soften hearts.

For years, Will continued to run from the Amish boy he was. He created a new identity and traveled across the world. The day he returned to the farm and to his father, he expected a reunion such as the prodigal son. But instead, his father rejected him. For years, Will tries to gain his father's approval and love. It is not until his own son has jeopardized his life that Will begins to understand the truth of God and forgiveness.If you want to be taken to another time and another world, this story swallows you up. The ways of the Amish, and the variations of different orders, come to live in this novel. You felt Will's pain and wanted to steer him in the right direction.

Dale CramerThis was an amazing story of Amish life and the adventure of a young man named Will Mullet. Will leaves Amish life at the age of 15 with his brother Tobe. We, as the readers, get a look at what it was like for the Amish runaways in the 1940s. Good decisions and bad ones as well, reap varying results for the boys. Tobe and Will part ways and we follow Will's story. Many things happen to Will before he is drawn back to his Ohio home to visit his family. And what happens next. . . is for you the reader of the book to find out!It was interesting to see how the author intertwined the past and the future, and how the three generations fit into it. We see how fathers and their sons relate through the generations and how much a father's approval really matters to the child. We also see how easily the father's failings are passed on to the next generation.Every time I picked up this book, it was like I was pushing play on a story. The author used such vivid words to describe what the characters saw, did, and felt! I eagerly picked up this book and made time to read it. In the Afterword, which I would also recommend reading, the author reveals that this story is \\"loosely based on my father's life\\". I love how various authors write about the experiences of their families. It sure makes the experiences of the characters mean more to me.This is the first time I have read a book by W.

What if his father made a different choice?I have read many a Amish fiction story, and when I started reading this one, suddenly foind it to be different and was not surprised when I reached the end of it and discovered it to be based on a true story. It had the ring of truth to it, from me growing up among many ex-Amish and ex-Mennonite families, I learned alot. I still remember visiting an old Order Amish farm with some ex-Amish friends and wondering at their treatment of her. This story is so well written, it is amazing. You will feel the pain of Will in the choices he has made, he knows he has not made the right choices and feels the pain of it. You will feel for his wife and think with amazement, at least I did, at all she put up with. You will read until the last page when Mr Cramer successfully sums up many of the things that plague, not just Amish, Mennonite churches, but many churches.I highly recommend this book, especially if you would like to understand the dynamics that confuse you in the Amish faith."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's Will tells a rich story of one man's journey through life.

It is a compelling and complex story which examines the complicated relationships shared between fathers and sons. Impossibly high expectations, disappointment, rebellion and rejection are the theme's that rule many relationships and Cramer does an excellent job of portraying all of these in this book. He also shows how important and important forgiveness can be.This is a story of great depth and strong characters. It is a story of pain, conflict and estrangement that spans three generations of family. It is powerful and moving and will easily captivate the reader. It is a book well worth reading and reflecting on.This book was provided to me for review by Bethany House Publishers."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"W. Dale CramerISBN 978 07642 07129Contemporary fictionThis was a very good book about an Amish family and the choices they face. I have read a lot of fiction books about Amish and Mennonite people and sometimes they can be a little patronizing of the faith that these communities hold. Sort of an \\"aren't they so cute?\\" attitude. I admit I was worried that this book would be similar in that regard.I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see the true respect and care that the author took towards the Amish faith. There was little, if any, patronizing attitude, and I felt that the author really loves and adores his Amish heritage. I appreciated the realism that was present in the book. The author speaks about his ancestry and I could really tell that this was a near and dear topic to his heart.The book flips back and forth between two or three times in the protagonist's life in which pivotal things happen. He ends up leaving the Amish faith in a way that means he ought to be shunned. I felt this was a great book.Recommended"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I must admit that I'm usually not a fan of stories that represent the Amish tradition. Mainly, I don't often find them very entertaining. Even as I began to read this book, it took a few pages to get in to the story. However, it wasn't long before I was swept into the world of Will Mullet, or as his fake name was, Will McGruder.As a mother, I also must admit that I have secret ambitions for our kids. I've always proclaimed that I just want our kids to be Jesus followers. I don't mind what they choose as a career or life goal. As long as they have faith in Jesus, I will be happy. But some parents hold stricter ambitions. Some parents want their kids to follow certain denominations for church or hope they'll follow a particular career path. Undeniably, most parents could agree that they have some sort of secret ambition for their children.Similarly, the Amish have secret ambitions for their children with hopes that they will sustain their way of life. Even more, the Amish community is known for their strict adherence to rules in their faith. If someone wants to leave the world of the Amish, they won't be able to come back. They are basically banned from the Amish community. In Will's case, he impregnanted a girl from the Amish community. This sets his father and the elders in a rage. To make things worse, he bails out on this girl to escape into regular American life of the 1940s.After a short time, Will joins the Army and begins to make himself a life in America. Sadly, his father now rejects him as a son. His father is crushed that Will has turned his back on his father's ambition for Will's life. The story continues with their relationship and how it changes for better and for worse. The reader will learn about forgiveness and the common conflicts between father and son. Admittedly, this story was amazing."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"This is a wonderful story about a man whose long journey away from his roots takes him back to them in the end. We first see Will near the end of his life when he has gone back to his childhood home to bury his father. His troubled son comes with him. As they meet the people from Will's youth and participate in the funeral rituals, Will remembers. Most of the book is the story of his life, told in the context of his Amish childhood.The title of Levi's Will reflects the story perfectly, with its multiple meanings. It is Will's story, but the way he lives his life is influenced his father, Levi. Levi's control and rigidity drive Will away from home, but not before teaching him a persistence that makes him constantly seek his father's approval and forgiveness, even though they are estranged. Throughout his life, Will defines himself as his father's son, but usually in a negative way. Levi was Old Order Amish, so Will abandons God. Levi was a pacifist, so Will joins the army. Levi was a harsh father, so Will abdicates his fathering of his own sons to their mother. On the other hand, Will works hard and loves his farm, because that is what Levi taught him.After running away from home, Will has to find his way in the World. He makes some bad decisions, but also meets some people who love him. Because of them, he eventually faces the repercussions of his upbringing and his response to it. He not only has to forgive his father, but he has to learn to ask forgiveness from his wife and sons. It's a hard lesson and he doesn't fully learn it until the end.I highly recommend this book, not only for the deep themes, but for the easy style and the wonderful characters. Will's struggles happen within a great story and the resolution is very satisfying.Pros: I want to say everything about the book, but I'll be more specific. It's a good story with flawed but likeable characters, a good setting and real themes.Cons: None that I can think of.The original reviw was posted on Pix-N-Pens [...]"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's WillW.

It reminds me a lot of Beverly Lewis\` series \`Abram Daughters\`.I was pleased to see Beverly Lewis had indeed endorsed this book. The character, Will, is raised Old Order Amish. However, he runs away leaving familiar territory behind.I must say I was surprised when he decided to join the Army. However he actually liked being in the military. He found the Army was much like his Dad and the way Will was raised.When he came home from the war he married a girl he had previously met, Helen. A few years into their marriage Will decides he really wants to go back home and see the Amish family he had left.I leave you with this, Will and Helen went home to the Amish territory.

At the end I was expecting there to be a paper will written by Levi giving some special thing or instructions to Will, and then came to understand what \\"will\\" meant in this story.

Coming from a man's viewpoint gave the characters a definite twist. Cramer can hold your attention though, no doubt about that. He spins the story in such a way that you just have to read on to discover more! Even though this book flashes back in time throughout the novel, it is not difficult to follow nor clumsy to read. I liked some of the references to the sixties and the author's appreciation of what a soldier's life can entail. It was not my favorite book among Amish fiction, but it didn't leave me disappointed either. I might actually get my husband to read it (he would never dream of reading some of the other stories)."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"\\"Levi's Will\\" is a real page turner!

I would definately buy other books from this company"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Levi's Will by W. Dale CramerI received a copy of this book for review purposes from Bethany House Publishers. I am under no obligation to write a positive review, just an honest one.Levi's Will is quite unique as far as Amish fiction goes. It is historical Amish fiction, which I always find very intriguing because it's a blend of two of my favorite genres: Amish fiction and historical fiction!Levi's Will centers around the life of Will, a young man who left the Old Order Amish when he was just 14 years old. His father Levi could never forgive him, even though Will had never been baptized, so technically need not be shunned. But Levi was so strict that he wanted nothing to do with Will once he left.When Will leaves he also leaves behind a deep-dark secret: he impregnanted a young Amish girl. He is running away to avoid marrying her, and this type of sin is not easily overlooked in the community.So, Will travels to find work and eventually joins the military. We follow his life as he marries, has children, and is not able to reconcile his life with a God who loves him. But underneath his new life are a bunch of sins including abandoning the woman he impregnated, and their child, and lying to his new wife about his past.Eventually the weight of the sins all adds up and Will comes clean with his wife. Together they go to see his family for the first time in years. Will wants nothing more than to receive forgiveness and acceptance from his father, but the anger over the past years has not seemed to diminish, and Will struggles even more with his haunting past as he discovers what happened to his child.Will he ever be able to find what he seeks? Will he be able to understand where his father's anger comes from? Will he be able to stop running from his haunting past and face the many sins he has committed? Or will the secrets Will has been hiding tear him apart, including destroying the relationship between himself and his wife and children?Read Levi's Will to find out!This book is an honest look at a fractured relationship between a father and son. Will's running away from his mistakes does nothing to encourage his father to forgive him, but Levi is also a stubborn man, imposing a harsh shunning on his son, even though technically under Old Order law it is not necessary.Will wants what so many children want: the approval of his father. Whether he admits it openly or not, it is clear that once he regains contact with his family, the purpose he seeks ultimately is a relationship with his father being rebuilt. Yet, as they spend more time together things almost get worse, rather than better.The book also jumps back and forth in time between following Will's life as he grows up, and Will in the 1980s when he receives news that Levi has died and his response. We also get to see how Will's fractured relationship with his father affects his own relationship with his sons, eventually causing the relationship between himself and his sons to fracture.This slightly dark but very honest saga echoed deeply within me because of my own mixed feelings towards my father. While I haven't done anything like Will to cause my father to shun me, our relationship is fractured at best as he has done some pretty cruel things over the past 6 months. I could completely relate to the struggle between deciding to write a parent off, or try to regain a relationship with them.I also loved that this book is loosely based on the life of W. Dale Cramer's own father. I think that perhaps this is what made the book so real and honest. I admire W. Dale Cramer's willingness to be open and honest about dark family secrets, and clearly the emotion of his own life experiences pours through and translates very well to the reader.I absolutely loved this book, though it was very different than expected. Levi's Will is not the cheeriest of books, but it is an honest look at the harshness of hidden sins, and imposing shunning on a child. It is also an honest look at the torrid relationship that can exist between a parent and a child, and how that goes on to affect future relationships between other family members.I think that this book easily makes W. Dale Cramer one of my favorite authors. His voice while writing is one of the most compelling and honest of authors I have read, along with his willingness to touch harder topics, instead of just writing tales of happy endings.I would give this book 4.5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"I was given this novel by a book store clerk at my own book signing. She took it from the shelves and presented it to me with a proud smile. \\"Have you read this?\\"I hadn't so she said, \\"You must!\\" I try to read any book someone is that enthusiastic about and I was not disappointed.I wrote the author halfway through just to tell him how wonderful it was. It was one of those rare novels that isn't just exquisitely written but that leaves you forever changed. So many emotions are brought up, not in a manipulative way, but organically from the conflict. Universal truths were presented and although I didn't grow up Amish, I still found myself nodding at the ultimate take home message--forgiveness is often only found when we ourselves extend it.A rare, wonderful novel that I can't recommend highly enough."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"It was one of those book which kept popping back into my mind days after I read it.

Will runs away with his little brother and finds himself in many fascinating situations and meets many fascinating people. He goes against his Amish upbringing, but he never forgets who he is. After many ups and downs throughout his life, he finally finds peace. I love the very impressive way that the author moves back and forth through Will's past and present to fill in all of the blanks and keep the story moving at a brisk pace. Well worth the read!If you find \\"Levi's Will\\" interesting, I truly believe that you would also like a book from first time author Chip Hill titled \\"The Fire Watcher\\". This is an awesome fictional story based on many true events from the author's life. Chip weaves a gripping tale about the main character, an older, broken down, alcoholic maintenance worker at a shuttered nuclear plant that gets stranded in a fire pump room and struggles alone for days with memories of his past personal and professional failures. This is a story with a rather subtle Christian message about forgiveness and redemption. Like \\"Levi's Will\\", the book moves back and forth effortlessly through time to flesh out a powerful story of hitting bottom and being raised back up by faith, hope and love. This is a great book that I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Levi's Will","review":"Thanks to Bethany House Publishers for the review copy. In Levi's Will, Cramer brings the modern-day Amish community to life. He crafts a powerful story of a son, Will, who leaves the Amish community of his birth under a cloud of disgrace to find his way in the world. Eventually he reestablishes contact with his family, but his reception is mostly cold, especially from his father, Levi, who considers Will to be under the ban imposed on him for his youthful waywardness. As the years go by, and he is embroiled in a complicated relationship with his own son, does he begin to see his father's actions mirrored in his own. Over many years, Will is brought back into the fellowship of the family, and receives absolution of sorts from his father. A forgiveness that likewise brings him back to God as well.This is a well-written book that explores the imperfections in a father's relationship with his son, and how those can sometimes be unwittingly passed on to subsequent generations. But it is also a story of forgiveness, both withheld and granted. And it becomes even more powerful when you read the author's 2009 Afterword to the book (originally published in 2005), which tells of how the book is a relatively close parallel to the experience of the author's own father. Or, at least, it was except for the ending. He hadn't experienced the the same reconciliation, and was still under a ban and outside the fellowship of his sister's Old Order Amish family. But after the publication of the book, he was encouraged by his sister's children to write an appeal to the bishop asking forgiveness for the sins of his youth, a forgiveness which he eventually received. So the (real) story ends with a happy reunion of long-estranged family. As Cramer summarizes it, \\"Only God can get away with an ending like that\\" (396)."},{"Title":"Walking Up and Down in the World : Memories of a Mountain Rambler","review":"this is quite an adventure for someone who has only hike locally in the Cascade Mountains.

He seems to write, not to tell what he has done, but to recount familiar tales to the curious listener.

Instead, he enjoys the telling of adventures past and current, inviting the reader to take a hand in the making of their own experiences."},{"Title":"Walking Up and Down in the World : Memories of a Mountain Rambler","review":"This book languished on my shelf for over a year until I'd had my fill of fiction for a while and turned to Smoke's book as a possible literary escape into the mountains. Ten pages in, I was hooked and the more of it that I read the more I wanted to know. Mr. Blanchard's tales of old-school climbing and mountaineering on Mt. Hood were enthralling. The book goes on to detail his walks, climbs and bicycle rides in the Sierra's, Alaska, India, Japan, and Nepal - among other places. It details his friendship with uber-mountaineer, Norman Clyde and his wanderings with so many notable mountaineers and climbers of the day. His writing style was humble, yet often very amusing, like it seems he himself was. His tale isn't told with the usual balls-out - \`We almost freaking died!' inflection that seems to be the trap of many of today's travel/adventure writers. Instead of leaving me breathless, Walking Up and Down in this World left me with a smirking smile and a want to take a week off from work, strap on my crampons, and head up into the winter clouds and snows of the high Sierras. The book is a good read and I highly recommend it to anyone who climbs in the California Sierras, boulders in the Buttermilks, or just want to read about an extraordinary mountaineer and trekker."},{"Title":"Walking Up and Down in the World : Memories of a Mountain Rambler","review":"I've had Smoke Blanchard's Walking Up and Down in the World for many, many years.

Why, just the section on Norman Clyde is worth the price of the book. And Smoke was Norman's friend. Cool. Yep, this is an old book that not many will know of let alone seek out, but it is filled with Smoke's amazing experiences, journeys, tragedies, glories, and his ornery philosophy.

You'll be glad ye did!!GG"},{"Title":"The Parables: Understanding the Stories Jesus Told","review":"When it comes to scholarly treatments of the parables of Jesus, there is a regretable shortage of quality works from an evangelical perspective. This book by Kistemaker is one. Much of the treatment is meaty and substantive, although as I will discuss below, the book could have been more exhaustive in this regard.Among the strengths of the book are Kistemaker's interaction with more liberal views on the parables, along with a very good introduction explaining the evolution of parabolic interpretation. Kistemaker wisely demonstrates early on that the allegorical methodology that prevailed for so long was/is rather notorious in advancing wildly speculative interpretations that helped obsure these critical teachings of Christ. As a result, Kistemaker appears to embrace a methodology that values historical considerations at the time Jesus spoke these teachings, as well as stressing what the parables actually say as driving the interpretation, rather than musing about what is not said and basing interpretation on such fanciful musings. In addition, in drawing wider conclusions about the messages and teachings that the parables are meant to convey, Kistemaker attempts to substantiate his application and interpretation comments in other Bible passages. Clearly, he is working from the view that Scripture is internally consistent and can interpret itself coherently as a result. While such a view might seem like the norm to evangelicals who hold to a high Bibliology, it is regretably not the view held by the majority of other scholars who have produced works on the parables. As a result, the conclusions reached by Kistemaker are quite different than those of Jeremias, Linneman, and others.Kistemaker analyzes virtually all of Jesus' parabolic sayings as recorded in the Synoptic gospels. When applicable, Kistemaker analyzes terminology and structural differences between two different gospel accounts of the same parable. There is a chapter for each parable and each chapter is less than 10 pages. I thought Kistemaker did a good job of packing a lot of good material into compact analyses and as such, it is very accessible.I gave the book 4 stars because I felt that many of the conclusions and applications made by Kistemaker could have been more in-depth. It appeared to me that Kistemaker clearly wanted to go down the road of sticking with the obvious rather than muddying the waters with fanciful and subjective speculation concerning these teachings. And while I certainly believe that such an approach is the right way to go, I still felt that there was room for deeper analysis of these teachings. Many of Christ's parables have profound eschatological and christological teachings associated with them, but other than the obvious conclusions, these aspects weren't explored to as high a degree as I would have liked.Nevertheless, this is a very good book that is quite accessible and also quite substantive in many areas. A good antidote to the agenda driven approaches that have characterized much of parabolic scholarship up to this point."},{"Title":"The Parables: Understanding the Stories Jesus Told","review":"Conservative scholarship, solid history, combined with readability - this volume offers a careful (but layman-friendly) analysis of most of the stories Jesus told. He begins most of the short chapters with a closer look at the setting of the parable. This historical and cultural background sheds first century light on each parable for our twenty-first century eyes. Commentary and application round out each chapter. He addresses various viewpoints and interpretations thoughtfully, but without losing us in arcane academics. His focus is on helping pastors, teachers and writers dig into the text in order to discover the riches there.Kistemacher's scholarship was a great help to me as I wrote my book (Parablelife: Living the stories Jesus told in real time - FaithWalk Publishers - available on amazon.com). And I believe it'll be a great help to you if you're a pastor, Bible study leader or serious student of the Word."},{"Title":"The Parables: Understanding the Stories Jesus Told","review":"The Parables: Understanding the Stories Jesus Told by Simon J.

In a few pages he opens your eyes to the history, context, the hidden nuggets of what is going on in the background of the parables. He tackles 39 different parables that Jesus told.A friend recommended this book to me not to just read but he suggested I use it as part of my daily devotions. I did that I have been alternating between this book and his other book \\"The Miracles\\" and I have to say the best way to read this book is as a daily devotional. It will help you understand and apply the truths in your life.I highly recommend this book to everyone - those who have studied the parables for a long time or a newbie on the scene or if your somewhere in between. I have no doubt you will learn something new."},{"Title":"The Parables: Understanding the Stories Jesus Told","review":"This is a pretty good book that covers most of the parables.

And yet Gilbert Harrison does a fine job. I didn't think the book told enough when it came out in 1983, but maybe I was expecting more than I should have, for on re-reading this book this past week I was struck over and over by how much indeed Harrison brings to live his evanescent, elusive subject.Wilder's admirers were always pained, during his lifetime, about how little he actually produced. Why, oh why, did it take him so long to write his three famous plays, and why so little other work? It wasn't as though he was a busy family doctor like William Carlos Williams, or needed to hold down a manual job to make money, for family circumstances seemed comfortable; although Harrison pulls back the curtain and reveals some of the details of Wilder's financial life, in a way more clouded than his sexual history. And we see, just about for the first time, the extent to which Wilder was always writing, always, but he was such a perfectionist that his experiments hardly ever pleased him! Such an oddity, for the plays that came out after his death were just as good as the ones he had produced, and I think as time goes by the magnificent LIFE IN THE SUN will become better and better known, it is totally beautiful; while the short play cycles, including the SEVEN DEADLY SINS and the SEVEN AGES OF MAN, are simply wonderful and everyone should have the two newish compliations of COLLECTED SHORT PLAYS at their bedside. He seemed to know everything about human life, not just the sunny, heartwarming OUR TOWN moments, but also about the chill and the pall that, say, we love reading Auden for, or Sartre's NO EXIT. He was scary, as he proved in the devastatingly nihilistic speeches he gave \\"Uncle Charlie\\" in the script he wrote for Alfred Hitchcock, SHADOW OF A DOUBT. Did he hold back on the remaining one act plays (and THE EMPORIUM) because they were possibly too bleak? If so, we now have them to treasure. Did he fail to find happiness in his private life due to homophobia, or perhaps to a crippling shyness which led him to abdicate from the body's demands? Harrison is good at all of these lines of inquiry, but most of all he gives us the sense of a life rich in a hundred ways besides the usual, including the generosity some called saint-like but which, as the wise know, is nothing but a sublimated form of curiosity. The giver wants to see the reaction of those to whom he gives. That's all Dolly Levi really wants, to see real life from the angle of the donor."},{"Title":"Enthusiast: A Life of Thorton Wilder","review":"Very detailed with extensive knowledge on Wilder. Easy to read and had a lot of good analyzation about the effects of his books on Wilder's life, popularity, and his connections.There were no markings and the book was in very good condition. Great buy for $0.01!"},{"Title":"Enthusiast: A Life of Thorton Wilder","review":"Thornton Wilder is a fascinating man. Of all the biographies I have read on writers from this era, Thornton Wilder comes across as one of the true real intellectuals but who doesn't take himself so seriously which is a nice combination.The main frustration I had with this book was the lack of sources - there are NO notes. In 380 pages of biography, there are only a few *asterisks which give the source for that particular bit of info - maybe 20 of these asterisks in the WHOLE book.Where did all the author's info come from and why wasn't it noted? No bibliography either. Only hint is the author acknowledgement page. The book seems to have been well researched, my complaint is just the lack of resources that might have been interesting to look into.Oh one interesting thing is that Thorton and Henry Luce (founder of TIME Magazine) both lived in China for a few years in their youth and attended the same school in China. Would have been interesting to learn more about that."},{"Title":"The Arthurian legend in the literatures of the Spanish Peninsula,","review":"This is one of the very few places that it's even possible to find information about the Arthurian and Grail traditions as they were known in the Spanish Peninsula. Entwistle discusses the Spanish and Portuguese variants of the Grail history and quest, Merlin, and Lancelot, examining the texts and detailing how the stories of the Round Table came to be in the Spanish Peninsula. His comments are insightful and thoroughly documented. This is a fine presentation of an area of Arthurian studies that many people don't seem to know exists let alone have any direct knowledge of the topic. This work is a true gem and should be a part of any serious collection of works on the subject of King Arthur."},{"Title":"Spring Days","review":"In the preface to this book the author calls it the worst book he ever wrote, and he says he destroyed every copy he got his hands on. Having read it I can say that he's obviously a good judge of his own writing. It's about 3 spoiled sisters, their spineless brother, their whining, greedy father and a libertine friend. I only liked one of the characters, and he had a very small part. The only way I could get through it was to do lots of skimming. I like how Moore writes, so I'll be happy to try other books of his, but this one's a flop."},{"Title":"Michael Lawrence's Opening Leads","review":"This is not a quick list of formulas, such as lead 4th best.

Did pard not double an artificial bid (2 club response to Stayman)? What inferences can we draw from the opponents holding? Pards?The theme of the book is how to learn to think about whats going on, based on the bidding.This is not a quick read, it requires deep thought and study. The author also discusses the meaning of bidding sequences, and conventions, and what they imply about the opponents (and pards) shape and strength. I consider it an Intermediate level book, and a *MUST* read for anyone who wants to enjoy the game.I suggest first reading: Opening Leads by Robert Wene. Then &quot;Improving your Opening Leads&quot; by Hugh Kelsey. After reading these 2 you will be in the proper mindset to benefit from this one. This is much deeper than those 2, but is slower going becaus ethere is so much to consider."},{"Title":"Michael Lawrence's Opening Leads","review":"I did not think someone could top Easley Blackwood's classic treatise on opening leads. I was wrong! Lawrence has outdone himself with this fantastic book on opening leads. This book contains material that is not to be found anywhere else in bridge literature. The idea of leading the declarer's response suit at notrump is a truly counterintuitive idea that Mike's analysis proves is probably the correct move! His ideas on avoiding top-of-nothing leads from 10xx and 9xx are also solid suggestions. And not leading ace-empty suits vs. trump contracts! These concepts are only the beginning of the excellent advice to be found in this book.A great book for all bridge players, but novices and beginners should beware - this book is very demanding, and the material requires full understanding to really be valuable. (By the way, Blackwood's book is still worth reading, especially for his scientific approach to opening leads.)"},{"Title":"Michael Lawrence's Opening Leads","review":"Be warned, this is a long, heavy, book. There are many bidding sequences where you have to visialize what the other 3 hands are holding. Its worth the effort, but its a big inventment in time. Expect to spend at least 2 weeks reading it. And it could easily be 3 or wven 4 weeks if you don't bear down.You will really get a lot out of it if you put in the effort.You will look at auctions differently, and improve your hand evaluation as well."},{"Title":"Michael Lawrence's Opening Leads","review":"This book teaches you to think about leading rather than simply listing a table of card combinations. Some observations are common sense. When leading against NT, your goal is either to* establish long suit tricks in your suit* avoid surrendering a trickSimple and obvious right? But how many times have you blindly led fourth best without thinking whether a passive lead would be better on this auction? Lawrence teaches you to listen to the auction and decide on a goal before looking at your individual holdings. He explains why major suit leads are much more attractive than minors against 1NT -- 3NT auctions. He explains why you should usually lead passively when RHO has opened 2NT. He explains when leading a suit bid by the opponents is OK and when it is a mistake, even with a fairly strong holding. And of course, he pays just as much attention to leading against suit contracts. This book is an expert course on leading. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Making Greeting Cards with Rubber Stamps","review":"Using clear, consise directions, nationally known Rubber Stamp artist MaryJo McGraw shares her techniques on how to mask, embellish, emboss, water stain and more to create one-of-a kind greetings from elegant to festive to whimsical!

I am just a beginner and found the information on different stamping tools and how to use them very helpful. Mary Jo has an incredible attention to detail and covers all the bases from which a beginner or expert could benefit. Her samples range from the cute and simple to the more artistic and creative.

I almost put the book back on the shelf at the store when I saw that, figuring the rest of the book would have problems like that as well.

And I stayed immersed in it until the final page! Although Ferber's portrayal of blacks is dated and condescending, readers who can overlook this fault will find a plot and characters that grab their interest from the start. Curiously, although her Indian characters generally are flat and unpolished portrayals, those whites who speak up for the displaced Indians are quite eloquent in defense of those same Indians. The story of the Sooners, the Cherokee Strip, the impact of \\"Oil!\\" and the eventual statehood of Oklahoma is sure to provide an entertaining--and perhaps even informative and enlightening--selection for readers who don't mind the occasional purple prose paragraph. I'd recommend it!"},{"Title":"Cimarron (Armed Services edition)","review":"This 1930 novel by Edna Ferber deserves to be included in the canon of classic Westerns, along with The Virginian, Riders of the Purple Sage, and anything by Louis L'Amour. The novel covers the period between 1880 and 1920 in the Cimmaron Strip of Oklahoma, during the great land rush, and the early oil boom. The language and customs reflect the period very well, including as often mentioned, the prejudices against Blacks, Indians, and Jews. These don't reflect the feelings of the author, but describe the conditions of the time. Much of the novel concerns the bigotry and error of the prevailing culture as it spread into the new territories. There is plenty of action, gunfights, holdups, hard travel, and noble action. The author was born in 1885 and knew about this period first, or at worst, second hand. Her knowledge show in the details of the characters lives, and the twists and turns of their fates."},{"Title":"Cimarron (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is a great story written from a wonderful perspective about a great state.

This book showed up exactly as advertised and was OBVIOUSLY wrapped with care and sensitivity to the subject matter."},{"Title":"Cimarron (Armed Services edition)","review":"This is a Christmas gift for my mom. She was excited to get it. Apparently, the movie with the same title (an older movie) was based on this book. It was hard to find this particular book, in fact nearly impossible until I tried amazon"},{"Title":"Cimarron (Armed Services edition)","review":"Cimarron marks the end (for now) of my excursion into Edna Ferber's works, and it embodies many of the strengths and flaws Ferber portrays in all her stories.On the plus side, we have strong, almost painfully realistic characters. There is a demanding undercurrent of no-nonsense tell-it-like-it-is beneath Ferber's romanticism, just as there are startling cliche busters hiding behind the melodrama. In addition to her always vivid sense of setting, I appreciate her warty characters. They aren't always lovable, but they're always intriguing.However, Cimarron also suffers from the same flaws as do the rest of her books. The prose seems even more overblown and purple than usual here. Ferber knows how to pick the telling details and she can turn a beautiful phrase. But she also likes to heap on the glittery descriptive phrases like too many toppings on a pizza. Even more concerning, however, is her tendency to carefully and slowly build the story, only to chop it off in a hurried and abrupt ending."},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read.

Mr. Knelman seems incapable of painting his prose anything but purple. I couldn't get past the first chapter. There's a good book about Mr. Carrey waiting to be written; but this isn't it."},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"Wow, I just finished this great book, it is very well written, with insights in the world of Jim Carrey. Martin Knelman has written by far one of the best bios that I have ever read. He went into great detail of the feelings that where upon Jim Carrey and the people that surrounded him at the time. Through the begining to the end, you get to read a life of a born jokester, and his rise from poverty and a malnourished life, to a guy who makes a few bucks and makes everyone laugh or cry. The book is only 230 pages, but I guess if Martin Knelman, the author had dragged it on, then it would not of packed such a punch.I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's since Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and ever since then I have been emersed in the magic that is Jim Carrey. With only &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; being the bad movie in his career, which was not horrible, Jim Carrey has had a great life in film in television with a lot more to come. Films like &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; and &quot;Truman Show&quot; were horribly underrated and not given much of a chance. With the dark and witty humor that the &quot;average&quot; Jim carrey fan would not appreciate or enjoy. So to some it all up, a great choice and a great read, &quot;Keep on laughing&quot;...Thanks for reading!Ryan"},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"This terribly-written book rehashes tabloid newspaper articles to put together a lengthy People-style picture of Carrey's life. The first couple chapters are the worst and you will struggle to get past the ridiculous overuse of adjectives by the author.The writer interviewed a few old Canadian associates of Carrey, which results in way too much of the book being about people associated with Jim's early years. About 25 pages are devoted to Yuk-Yuk's history, a comedy club that no one will care about.It does skip through his career but often provides nothing more than Wikipedia versions of his movies and TV shows. There are a couple of errors, even in the asides (the writer says someone named Katie Ford worked with Carrey as a teenager in the 1970s and at age 16 was a \\"regular writer\\" of the TV show Growing Pains--except that show didn't start until 1985!)There are no substantive interviews with anyone of importance to Carrey's career. Instead it's mostly gossip from newspaper articles, poorly reassembled and written at a 9th-grade level. You will learn a few things you may not have known (he lived in a van with his family after he quit 10th grade) but you have to wade through the bad writing to get to it.As another reviewer said, a decent book about the comedians life has yet to be written. This is sophomoric and don't believe the book's cover that claims the writer is \\"an award-winning cultural journalist.\\" None of those words describe this book."},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"Martin Knelman is a wonderful writer and of all the books I have read about Jim Carrey, his was the best written and most interesting of them all.

Jim Carrey, The Joker is Wild will definitely touch you."},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"For anyone who thinks Jim Carrey led a charmed life before getting where he is today, this book is a definite read. It opens a lot of doors into understanding his acting style, why he does comedy and why he is an actor.....he lives for attention and approval, and all his fans are happy to give that to him. He came from the school of REAL hard knocks. This makes me admire him all the more for perserving in the face of multiple adversities and giving us the performances we love to watch over and over. My personal favorite of all is The Truman Show, and the Majestic is right up there too. Catching up on his old films after reading this book, and I can see where he was coming from in his life at the time. The author did a tremendous job of writing this bio and I truly thank him for shedding light on someone I thought was &quot;just another pretty face&quot;....a wonderful bio on Mr. Carrey. I hope he gives some thought to bringing it up to date at some point. Jim Carrey I salute you for your wonderful acting.

This biography was well written and very detailed, you get to know Jim as you go through the book, from his succeses, his failures, his life as a celebrity. you also get to know how much he struggled over the years and how hard it was for him and just how hard it is to become a comedian. I definitley reccomend redaing htis book, it is good from the minute you open and close it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Jim Carrey -","review":"Growing up in poverty is not an easy thing to do. You wouldn't think that very many, if any, \\"famous people\\" would grow up being poor. Well, Jim Carrey is one of many who did. Growing up for him wasn't easy at all. It was always in his genes to become a comedian. But his first gig didn't go as planned, it was very disappointing. He dropped out of school at the age of sixteen, trying to pursue his career in comedy. He continued to go to the club where he was made a fool of. His comedy breakthrough came at the age of 19. His big jump off was when he got a role in a TV series, \\"In Living Color.\\" This got him started for other movies such, as \\"Mask,\\" and \\"Liar, Liar.\\" As they all say, the rest is history.The thing that I liked most about Jim Carrey, was that he never gave up on his dream of being a comedian. At home, everybody thought that he was the funniest person ever. But when he went to his first gig at Yuk-Yuk's, it wasn't what he thought. It was a humiliating time for him. But he didn't let that stop him. When he was a little older, he went back to that club and performed again. He then became a regular there. This proves to show you that you should never give up on your dreams. Just because you have one bad night or act, it doesn't mean you have to give up on your dream.Something that disturbed me about Jim Carrey was that he dropped out of school. I mean, it was his own choice but then again it sends the wrong message to children. By him doing this, and kids reading it he is saying that you can still make even if you drop out of school. The thing is that we want kids to stay in school and get an education for themselves. But people make their own decisions in life. It is up to them and what they want to do in the future."},{"Title":"Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe","review":"The somber and quiet images in this book appear to be from the past, but were photographed within the last few years. This unique book offers views of Jewish communities depopulated by the Holocaust and left today much as they were after WWII. Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe left many of these areas undeveloped and frozen in time.The images in this book are artistically composed and printed with great attention to detail. Viewing the large printed images give one of the feeling of standing in the place itself. I strongly recommend this book as one of permanent importance. With the rapid changes now underway in the area, it may also be the look we have at the communities that made up such an important part of the cultural fabric of Eastern European life prior to WWII."},{"Title":"Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe","review":"Silent Places, by Jeff Gusky, takes us on a poignant, and incredible photographic journey to Eastern Europe, where he documented (in B&W; photographs) the architecture and landscape of the Holocaust era...Synagogues, houses, landscapes, windows, doors, parks, all images from the past, but actually taken recently. The B&W; aspect gives a ghost-like and haunting composition to the photographs...the aura of life within the frame illuminating our senses.Time erodes the landscape, and even the architecture, but the sense of humanity and life still exist within the confines. We feel the aura of the past, brought into the present, the sounds of silence and former life, and activity resounding, for all of us to view. The ghosts of the past, sing their song, through broken windows, deteriorating doors, ruined homes, leaving an indelible mark in the time continuum, compelling us to wonder WHY?Gusky's book is a a work of brilliance, one that we soon not forget, a book both compelling and haunting. It is a historical journey into the depths of loss, destruction and places that once hummed with Jewish life.It matters not what our beliefs are, because we are all one underneath the sun, the umbrella of life on the planet. The history defined within the illuminations of this book define us all on some scale. We all have history, all have ancestral pasts, villages and cities of life, that run through our genetics. Time erodes much of our past, our life's history...and in that aspect...this book gives us to ponder and realize, that each person's history is a part of the universal whole."},{"Title":"Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe","review":"When I first came across a reference to 'Silent Places' I was intrigued by its title and content. When I received my own copy of the book and read how Jeffrey Guskey (Dr.) became interested in what it meant to be Jewish and why he decided to journey to Poland it all made sense. And it was also fascinating to learn that he had to learn to photograph which added so much to the intrigue of his story.I am a photographer myself and this book is a precious document - the subject matter is at times chilling but very carefully observed. The research and the journey he embarked upon is a discovery that changes one's life and that becomes apparent as you look at each one of these beautifully seen images. And from a photographer's point of view this is photographing with your heart, while your eye composes and records this precious slice of history.This book is a reminder of what we as human beings are capable of - the horrific crimes of the Nazis during WW2 which ended in 1945, and 50 years later the healing force of one man's journey to understand and to put into perspective something which is almost impossible to imagine.Thankyou so much Jeffrey Guskey."},{"Title":"Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe","review":"This book is, without a doubt, one of the most treasured books in my collection.

I have seen and own many books on the subject and it is one of the most haunting; clearly showing, even after all these years, how these locales remain stuck in that dark time. The photography is excellent--all the more impressive since the author taught the art to himself just for this project.

As a result, many writers that we associate with that decade, e.g., Ernst Hemingway, receive almost no mention, whereas others, e.g., Hart Crane, get a considerable amount. The highest praise that I can bestow on this book is that in looking now at the poetry and literature of that period, I feel much more at home in their world than I did before reading Cowley. A marvelous book in man, many ways."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"Cowley was many things: author, poet, editor, reviewer, American expatriate in Paris. He was aware of his diverse past and constantly strove to contextualize himself within what was going on around him. Exile's Return was his first such attempt. In it Cowley recounts his experiences in such notable hot-spots as pre-war Greenwich Village and inter-war Paris. Moreover, he examines the movements of which he was a part within larger historical/literary/artistic trends.There are some things to bear in mind with this work, however. Cowley returned to his past often, and often his return would bring re-evaluation. While there is some evidence of this habit across the various editions of Exile's Return, the trail of revision is more apparent by comparing this work against other retrospectives (Dream of the Golden Mountains, View From 80, etc.).Another issue with Cowley is that he (as most, especially Modernist, writers) tends to favor his own position. That is, he perhaps exaggerates his own part and importance. This tendency becomes controversial within the context of his chapter on Harry Crosby. While they were clearly acquainted, Caresse Crosby (Harry's wife), among others, thought that Cowley didn't know Harry well enough to write what they considered a spurious account of Crosby's last days.However, even with these negatives the book is highly recommended. In it, one gets a concise introduction to Modernism, important figures in the expatriate movement and inter-war Paris, and pre-war New York. Further, one receives a context of how these movements and people fit together. Among Cowley's works, this is one of his finest."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"Cowley was the ultimate in a thinking,toughly idealistic American living a literary dream in an epoch which permitted the indulgence. Jaggedly incisive as a writer, Cowley decided instead that editing was his prowess and observation his art. So he proceeded. Much romantic lore has been made of the many great American authors inhabiting the Left Bank scene in Paris in the 1920s. Exile's Return makes sense of the historical, literary and personal sequence of events leading to this decade-long picnic, and transforms the legend and nostalgia into the movingly profound minutiae of everyday life and thought amongst the loose collection of free spirits who changed modern conceptions of Western literary art forever. Artistic and intellectual achievements notwithstanding, \\"une generation perdue\\" comprised some very desperate and talented people trying to make sense of a world gone mad and define themselves within the insanity. A lot like now. Imagine an author being able to account for the global, tragic complexity emblematic in 9/11 and explain its implications for humanity and civilization's expressions. Flash back eight decades and you have Cowley's subject matter and his accomplishment. Let's hope someday somebody equals Malcolm Cowley's formidable ability to observe and explicate, and make us love, in retrospect, a loveless and temporarily hopeless age as it finds its way into our favorite novels and poems."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"Exile's ReturnThis is a book of essays, anecdotes, and observations. They are primarily concerned with the 'Lost Generation' of American writers who spent time in Paris between 1918 and 1930. Donald W. Faulkner provides the Introduction and Cowley, who made some revisions to the 1934 publication in 1951, writes a note on the text.I imagine that many of the 'senior citizens', such as myself, will have some sense of familiarity with the subject matter. A few may have read the book in the days of their youth. Unless they are experts on the subject they will find Cowley's intimate perspective interesting, and they will enjoy the easy accessible style of the writing.For younger generations it may not be the best introduction to the period. The names Hart Crane, Harry Crosby, and Edmund Wilson should have some resonance, as well those more familiar ones such as Hemingway and Fitzgerald.Appendices include A Selective Chronology of Events from 1915 to 1934, and A Tabular History of the Literary Life, 1924-1949.Many detailed works on the authors and the period have been written since. Cowley's perceptions do not date, as they are more of less contemporary rather than historical. But it must be said that they do not provide a suitably informative introduction for those readers not already familiar with the territory."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"This is the story of the so-called lost generation of American writers, their alienation from their American roots, their attempts to replace America's \\"mechanical\\" values with moral values, by escaping to Europe or into themselves. Of their struggle to reconcile their need for self-expression with their need to make a living. The crass money values of America drove them overseas, but their need for American money always drew them back, back to an America that was changed, in their perceptions.This is not an easy read. It is literary criticism but also contains strong elements of aesthetics, philosophy, history, and especially, sociology. So many interweaving threads are hard to follow. The isms involved are complex: Bohemianism, Dadaism, Symbolism, etc. But there are flashes of brilliant writing here.The author was steeped in literature, up to his neck. He lived it, full-time. He knew the big names on both sides of the Atlantic. This book is very much an inside view of the mostly-American literary scene to 1930."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"Exile's Return is so insightful (and entertaining) that one needn't even be particularly interested in the American literary scene of the 20s (or the Dadaists, who Cowley hung out with in Paris), though it's essential reading for anyone into the &#34;Lost Generation&#34; (sorry, but the name has pretty much stuck by now) or any other subculture since."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"Malcolm Cowley was a witness to perhaps the greatest explosion of literary creativity in human history and records his observations here with great precision and wit. Like one of the other reviewers, I also sensed he exaggerated his own importance around the modernist era in Paris. However, his observations (not unbiased by any stretch) about the Dadaists and Harry Crosby will provide valuable background for those interested in this time and place and seeking to understand the modernist works. I would recommend reading it in tandem with \\"Shakespeare and Company\\" or \\"Sylvia Beach\\" to improve one's understanding as an historian, or with some of the great works Cowley lists in appendix B."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"What happens after a World War and all the great artistic figures of the 20th Century inhabit one city? Malcolm Cowley's accounts of Paris and the Lost Generation are some of the better accounts of the greatest minds of that generation on a street level and daily experience. F. Scott drinks too much while indulging his new-found celebrity. Hemingway on the other hand writes constantly, is just one account that Cowley brings to the book. With the wealth of personalities clashing and feeding off of each other, Exile's Return gives a gritty look at a romantic period in one of the most colorful cities in the world."},{"Title":"Exiles Return: A Literary Odyssey of the 1920's","review":"i strongly recommend this book to anyone who needs more insight into the idea of a lost Generation"},{"Title":"I Fish: Therefore I Am","review":"I read this book for a book report in my senior English class.

It provides practical, concise and real world guidance to any senior bank executive seeking to add value in his institution by optimizing the usage of economic capital. Economic capital based performance measures are clearly presented and illustrated with real life examples. Additionally, anyone implementing Basle 2 must ask how this can be done and what value it creates for the organization. This book provides the answers.The book quickly gives a real world context the value of risk management information to bank CEOs, CFOs, institutional security analysts, and investors. It then goes on to demonstrate theoretically and practically how risk management information can be used to address key strategic decisions faced by senior bank management.Any risk manager, CFO, or CEO in a financial institution should find this book valuable if they seek to create shareholder value in their institution. Similarly, anyone seeking to rise to the executive suite must understand the issues addressed in this well written book."},{"Title":"Value Added Risk Management in Financial Institutions: Leveraging Basel II & Risk Adjusted Performance Measurement (Wiley Finance)","review":"Belmont has done an exceptional job at communicating the importance and practical application of risk measures for today's business environment. The book offers the reader a thorough assessment of what banking executives face everyday and how best to manage these risk and regain the control necessary for any banking executive to grow its business without putting into jeopardy the best interest of its shareholders, which in no small measure is a testament to Belmont's clear understanding of the challenges faced by most executives and the demands they face in terms of managing near term performance goals with long term stability."},{"Title":"Value Added Risk Management in Financial Institutions: Leveraging Basel II & Risk Adjusted Performance Measurement (Wiley Finance)","review":"Even without the incentives provided by the upcoming Basel 2 guidelines, this book is timely and convincingly puts forth the proposition that active risk management is in itself a valuable component in the creation of shareholder value. Returns on investment in more sophisticated tools for risk quantification will be enhanced when the information is not only used for performance measurement, but also for such shareholder value-added activities such as capital allocation and balance sheet structuring.I recommend this book for all practitioners of risk management."},{"Title":"Value Added Risk Management in Financial Institutions: Leveraging Basel II & Risk Adjusted Performance Measurement (Wiley Finance)","review":"This is a book that every bank board member should read. Sure, any board member worth his/her salt will be familiar with Basel II and risk measures such as VaR, but how many think of Basel II as a cost or imposition, and VaR as just another piece of information? Mr Belmont's easy to follow approach should allow readers to examine the way in which they can differentiate their own institution by using the investment in regulatory risk management to create, rather than just protect,shareholder value.Thankfully, Mr Belmont strikes a good balance between theory and reality, both in his explanantion of market behaviour and in the presentation of his arguments. This is a book that the &quot;mathematically challenged&quot; like me can still enjoy and benfit from."},{"Title":"Value Added Risk Management in Financial Institutions: Leveraging Basel II & Risk Adjusted Performance Measurement (Wiley Finance)","review":"This book is a gem - very timely and well-thought out. David Belmont obviously has a lot of experience in this area, but also has put in a lot of thought-leadership into this book. He traces the Basel II accord to its roots in M&amp;M economics, and convincingly argues why bank risk management is a critical function. He then traces a thread from risk management to capital management and shows why and how banks can make use of Basel implementations to achieve a high degree of control and positioning of their operations.The only knock on this book is that I found several typos and simple editing errors - it is clear that deadlines won over editorial quality. Hopefully the next edition will be cleared up in this regard - nevertheless I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Microsoft Excel 2002 - Introductory","review":"This book was one of the books used for a computing class I recently took.

In this latest study, \\"Heavy Lifting\\", we learn that most of the public has a good idea how legislatures operate, and they don't like what they see.The legislature system is designed to look bad in the public eye. Legislators may do a good job fighting for their constituencies, and thus garner the support of the people of their district, yet the interests behind these constituents conflicts with interests represented by other legislators. The meshing of these interests lead to struggles, defeats, and compromises that fail to fully please the interests at hand. From the standpoint of constituents that are viewing an outcome that failed to meet their expectation, the legislative process is a failure. From the standpoint of analyzing how legislative systems should operate, the process may be basically the best possible operation.The expectations the public has of legislatures has changed, according to Alan Rosenthal. Constituency groups decades ago perhaps understood the reality of compromise better than advocates today realize. The media, which observes that conflict is more interesting than everyday good news, seems more apt to cover the battles of ideas within legislatures. The increasing expense and negativity of political campaigns exacerbates the legislatures' declining perceptions.The constituent demands upon legislatures appear to be increasing while the available amount of time does not increase. Even gaining support of a majority of both houses of a legislature is not always enough, as the Governor then plays a critical role. Governors present various leadership styles and abilities to cooperate with legislatures, who themselves can be supportive or detrimental towards resolving conflicts between the branches of government.A good legislator, according to Alan Rosenthal, is one who successfully represents his district's constituents, is skillful at the lawmaking process, and is able to properly balance the legislative role with the role of the Governor. The author surveyed Ohio legislators and found that 62% of Senators and 56% of Representatives surveyed stated that believed more attention to their representational duties would make them better legislators and that 38% of Senators and 44% of Representatives stated more attention to their lawmaking responsibilities would make them better legislators.Legislators are busy, including legislators from states where the legislature is considered part time. The author surveyed legislators in five states and discovered that 46% of legislators responding stated they spent 60 or more hours per week at their legislative jobs while 29% states they spent from 50 to 59 hours. The number of hours spent working was higher for legislators who served longer, which reflects the additional duties often given to veteran legislators.The author believes most legislators do successfully represent their districts. They identify with the people of their districts and their needs. Advocating their concerns before both the legislature and administrative agencies is seen a key purpose of their legislative duties. This provides many legislators with the sense of fulfillment they seek from being legislators.19,000 people from all states were surveyed. It was found that, over the past two decades, 7% stated they had contacted their state representative and 5% stated they had contacted their state senate. While much of such contact was part of an organized effort to contact legislators, it does show that a sizable number of people have personally invested time in reaching out to their representatives. This contact becomes muddled, as there seldom is a clear and consistent message to legislators uniting his or her constituency. Further, the author concludes that most people do not follow closely follow legislative issues and matters.The growing nationwide organization of many interest groups along with the increased ability to exchange information is making advocacy to legislatures across the nation more active. Political party identification is a strong cohesive force for most legislators, and party identity and party caucuses are strong factors in determining how legislators respond to legislation. At times, attempting to gain a partisan advantage is a critical part of legislative decision making strategies. This can create difficulties, as legislators may find themselves conflicted between their caucus and their constituencies should their goals differ. The author presents this conflict as perhaps a legislator's greatest challenge.While it is difficult to identify exactly what it is that makes a legislator a good representative, the author notes there should be a positive connection between a legislator and the views of his or her constituency, an ability to deliberate legislation, and an ability to provide leadership, although this requires experience and resources as well as the proper leadership skills.This is an excellent book for students of state legislatures in particular and of governmental decision making in general."},{"Title":"Heavy Lifting: the Job Of the American Legislature","review":"Alan Rosenthal is one of our best experts in state legislatures. His works on the subject are insightful and provide much detail and wisdom. \\"Heavy Lifting\\" merely confirms his reputation in this regard.The book tackles the standard subjects that one would expect to be addressed in a text on state legislatures. The work begins with a description of what legislators do in the American states, followed by a rich discussion of representation in its various manifestations. This includes subjects such as: the relationship of elected legislators with their districts; how they reconcile their views on policy issues with those of their constituents (Should they bend to the views of their constituents or exercise their own judgment?).The work considers legislators' efforts at lawmaking. What are the challenges facing them as a result of the various processes evident in the different states? How do they address the conflicting demands of interest groups, parties, committees, the \\"other\\" house? How does one put together a majority coalition? How does one \\"manage\\" majorities?There is also discussion of how legislatures must interact with governors. The text goes over the \\"dance\\" between these two branches of government at the state level.Finally, there is discussion of leadership in the legislature and commentary on what a \\"good legislature\\" is like.All in all, this is a fine book by one of our leading experts on state legislative politics. For those wishing to learn more about the subject, they could do a lot worse than examining this book."},{"Title":"Heavy Lifting: the Job Of the American Legislature","review":"Book was in excellent condition when I recieved it. I was happy with the service I recieved."},{"Title":"American cultural patterns: A cross-cultural perspective (Dimensions of international education)","review":"I read this book as part of a class I took called socio-cultural perspectives on language and found this book very interesting and insightful. I teach German at an American university and since I am not American it is important to have an understanding of American culture. A lack of understanding can lead to miscommunications and frustrations both on part of the learner as well as the instructor. Though American Cultural Patterns is somewhat philosophical in its approach, it remains a very readable book with numerous comparisons between American and other cultures which are very helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing more about American culture, be it for professional or personal purposes."},{"Title":"American cultural patterns: A cross-cultural perspective (Dimensions of international education)","review":"This book seeks to look at American cultural patterns within a cross-cultural perspective. A number of cultural stereotypes are compared with the American stereotype, particularly Japan. I say \\"cultural stereotypes\\" because this is what is primarily used. At times, I have to disagree completely with the authors' interpretation of the meaning behind the actions of the cross-cultural experience. For example they give some examples of difficulties the author(s) had in Japan and then they explain why this occurred, always giving the benefit of the doubt to the Japanese culture. However, if that same action would be seen as an insult by a Japanese person I really see no reason for the authors to explain it away using a Japanese cultural value. In other words, they fail to critically analyse different cultures either from within or from an American perspective. The end result is that you are to assume that other cultures always treat people with respect and it is only an American-centric view that would think otherwise. I am not American and can claim something of a dispassionate view on the subject.At first glance this book appears to be a useful, quick read for those going overseas but in reality it is a tough slog through some unanalysed stereotypes. This book fails to get past surface meanings to the deeper reality of the cross-cultures with which it contrasts American culture."},{"Title":"American cultural patterns: A cross-cultural perspective (Dimensions of international education)","review":"American Cultural Patterns - A Cross-Culture Prospective is a very broad but in depth study of this title subject.

The authors do explain that they are addressing the main American culture (versus our rich group of subcultures). Additionally, they do not privilege one culture over another (as one reviewer stated). Their goal is to (1) explain how deeply our cultural responses are ingrained and (2)to help us recognize that our American outlook is not universal--amazingly there are other ways of perceiving the world than the way most Americans do. The book is not a quick, easy read--both authors are university professors (who probably use their book as one of their required readings ;D) Academics & those used to scholarly texts will get the most out of, everyone else will need to be patient and take it slow."},{"Title":"The Earth Through Time, 2nd Edition;","review":"The book is so good to understand the earth's evolution and the origin of the features of the planet.

Later I found out that the local salesperson had cheated me, by telling me that a CD version was not available. Actually, the CD version is much cheaper, almost 1/20th the price, and easier to use. However, you don't get the same sense of satisfaction from the CD version.These books are beautifully crafted (I have an edition bound in leather, and edged in gold) and are a joy to behold and refer to. They take up a lot of shelf space though, and it's a bit cumbersome to locate information, especially now that we are all so used to clicking across an ocean of cross-references. Nevertheless, there is a special charm to rummaging through these books, and I have spent many leisurely afternoons flipping through them. I have also picked up many useful items of information at times, for use in my work. The illustrations, and drawings are simply superb. The entries are written with a nice flow, neither too technical, nor too verbose. However, you must keep in mind that this product is primarily designed for school students, and may not be useful for any serious work.The only worries that I have are about the reliability of information. For instance, I found that a river in Arunachal Pradesh (India) has been named wrongly, and the people of the region do not recognise the name at all. Similarly, in the entry related to Lord Shri Ram, worshipped by millions of Hindus, there is no mention that he is viewed as divinity by Hindus. This obviously raises doubts whether information related to other cultures or topics is also erroneous.This kind of errors could be on account of the selection of biased writers (I saw Mr. K.N. Pannikar on the advisory board), or it could be on account of simple errors that anyone could make. Unfortunately, the problem is compounded by the non-responsive attitude of World Book editors. For instance, I wrote to them a couple of time on e-mail, pointing out these discrepancies, but there was no response.Overall, a beautifully crafted product, one that you will love to own.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece."},{"Title":"New Complete Guide to Landscaping: Design, Plant, Build (Better Homes and Gardens(R))","review":"This has been one of my best purchases yet for gardening.

Martin with Photographs and Illustrations by the Author and with Cover Art and Illustrations by John Still. 144 pages. Chambersburg, Pennsylvania: Alan C. Hood & Company, Inc., 1991 [1963]. ISBN 0-911469-07-9 (pbk).Alfred Martin was something of an oddity. When he was ten years old he learned how to tame wild birds by trapping songbirds for the English bird trade. Later he found his way to Maine, built a house in the woods, fished, hunted, practised taxidermy, and cultivated the friendship of wild birds. Although he possessed a great fund of knowledge about birds, we learn that no great knowledge is required to teach a wild bird to feed out of our hand. The method Martin employed, and whichwill work with many though not all birds, is simplicity itself and is clearly described in his book. What is required, then, is not knowledge but something far more difficult for us moderns - what is required is a shift of attitude, and a great deal of patience.The intelligence, skills, and abilities of wild creatures are vastly underrated in our modern world. So puffed up are we with arrogance, so obsessed with the illusion that we are at the tip of a mythical 'evolutionary tree', so proud of our technical achievements and contemptuous of life forms which seem to get along without the aid of technology, it has become almost impossible for the average person to accept the fact that wild creatures, far from being wholly other than us, are our fellows. But for Martin birds were not so much animals as persons, and he emphasizes that without a genuine respect for their intelligence and talents, without fully accepting them as our fellows and equals, they in turn will never come to respect and trust us enough to come to our hand.Martin's book is written in a rather rambling style and contains much else besides his method of hand-taming wild birds. His book is rich in personal anecdote, and in addition to the many good stories about his experiences with numerous species of birds and other animals there is also a great deal of information and practical advice for anyone who may be thinking of setting up a bird-feeding station to attract birds to their backyard. Among the many topics he covers are how to build a birdbath, how to build houses and feeders, how to select appropriate foods, how to care for injured birds, and so on.Given modern society's strict insistence on the otherness of nature, however, Martin's most important lesson for us is his seemingly outrageous notion that birds are every bit as worthy and deserving of our respect and compassion as are our fellow humans. He assures us that once we begin to see wild birds, not so much as 'animals' but as little people in their own right, it won't be long before we experience the thrill of them landing on our hands to receive the gift of food. But before this can happen it is absolutely essential that we drop all feelings of superiority.The prevailing ideology insists on our separateness from nature. But the idea that we are essentially different, being false, runs contrary to our nature and leads toreal suffering, the suffering of an alienation that issues in boredom. Martin points out that birds rightly consider man as their worst enemy. Terror is the form their suffering takes. Martin's achievement is to have given us a book which demonstrates how easily both the bird's terror and man's boredom can be replaced with real joy."},{"Title":"Hand-Taming Wild Birds at the Feeder","review":"I am originally from the state of Maine where Mr. Martin hailed from. This book is terrific and not only gives insight on how to hand-feed wild birds, but also gives helpful information about them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in birds.And don't let Karen Seichevilch's review get you down; she just didn't have the patience to go through all the steps to get birds to feed from her hand. It took me 6 months to get a bird - a chickadee - to feed from my hand."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],M={key:0},L={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-33113d74"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/5.md","filePath":"guide/5.md"}'),R={name:"guide/5.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
