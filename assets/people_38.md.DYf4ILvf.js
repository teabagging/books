The reviewes may make one feel like they are not alone in the state of clutter that they live, but it was hard to find the tips on how to remove the clutter. Maybe check some of his other books on clutter first, then you might enjoy this one after you are clutter free."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"I'm writing primarily to take exception with the most recent reviewer who returned the book. It's more a matter of preference than he or she is wrong and I'm right. I purchased this book in 1996 and have read it several times since, mostly for the motivation and change of attitude. I've given copies of it as gifts to family members. I love this book because it shares other peoples experience which is often very funny and is very helpful to see the ways that hanging onto too much stuff is a net and gross negative that can affect and bleed, (at times literally)in so many ways into ones life. Following through with this book is work and at times the work is painstaking and draining. Having someone assist at the right time, (who is detached from your stuff) can be very helpful, but not by any means necessary. The rewards: in a way you get your life back. To much stuff can be a form of malignancy in its own way. It can weigh a person down emotionally and block ones vision field for true dreams and accomplishment."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"Don Aslett is an author of choice for organization and de-clutter books, paperback, easy to read, adequate price, I would check out a library before ordering.

Would not recommend for someone seriously wanting to declutter."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"Here it is - a book cluttered with clutter comments. Kinda thin on the help, but heck! what are you going to do when all those junkies get rid of their stuff or want to share how their life doesn't go well because of all their junk! Don turns their comments into cash and sells it back to us! He's not dumb, and he doesn't have to have his file clutered after he keeps cluttering up more books about clutter. Too much clutter? Buy all his books and let them clutter your life! I feel I got taken by the cutiesies! OK one more piece of clutter to get out of my life!"},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"I have several books on simplifying life and organizing the home. I have found the organizing books patronizing and useless. Organization books helped me organize some of my stuff but not get rid of anything. I never really organized everything because to do so was too daunting of a task as I had too much stuff.This is the first Don Aslett book I've read. Especially in the beginning, it is something like 95% reader's stories of their clutter and junk. It is laugh-out-loud funny. These stories are so extreme that I had to stop reading and immediately started going through my own things and getting rid of stuff. I'd go back and read more and then go back to de-cluttering. It took me 6 weeks to read the book because I have spent hours and hours de-junking my house in between. There are also some funny quizzes and poems, those that didn't interest me I simply skipped over.The overall approach with this book is that it presents many readers's stories of what they save and collect and how they got rid of some of it. Then Aslett chimes in with his two cents and sometimes some tips on how to decide whether to save something or keep it or other words of wisdom regarding the subject at hand. Then back to this format over and over. I actually loved the format and felt that it was not preachy in nature. It was also easy to read in small bits and pieces, something nice for a busy mother like myself.Aslett focuses on getting rid of most everything that we are not currently using or using within the last year. While I can't get that radical, it is inspirational. He deems a \\"collection\\" as anything we have three or more of, and he recommends having no collections. When I started thinking of it that way, I realized that I had some true garbage items that Aslett considers a collection, so I got rid of some of it! \\"Getting rid of\\" can mean giving things away to charities or friends, doing a tag sale, or throwing out the true trash. As I was de-junking I found some things he stated to be true: that some of the things I'd been saving had broken some time while in storage, some things attracted mice and were chewed, newspaper clippings were so yellowed that they were unreadable, and some books so mildew-y smelling that I got a headache when trying to read them. After experiencing that I realized Aslett was right when he said that even the stuff we save is usually useless (or lost) by the time we get around to trying to use it so we are better off to get rid of it sooner than later and not even to store it at all.There are some very common-sense and useful tidbits such as the discussion of \\"is having a tag sale really worth the time, effort, etc.\\" to which the answer is \\"no\\". I agree with him that selling used clothing to a consignment shop or at a tag sale is also less \\"profitable\\" than donating it to a charity and taking a tax deduction. The part about saving empty containers (boxes, tins, etc.) hit home and is true, how silly is it to save empty containers! The part about saving newspapers until we have time to read them is hilarious and I had to share that with some of my relatives who are guilty of this never-ending project of catching up on old newspapers.I do feel a sense of more freedom now, as Aslett tells us we will feel if we de-junk. I also feel that my things do not bog me down. I have more de-junking to go but I am actually enjoying it! I also love living in the spaces that I've streamlined and de-junked, I can put my hands right on things when I need them, no searching through piles, etc.I highly recommend this book. A relative and have two others waiting to borrow it next. Just talking to my friends and relatives about my own de-junking has inspired four people to start their own journey, and they haven't even read the book yet. Actually I am considering giving the Aslett books as gifts in the future!Addendum: I am now reading \\"Clutter's Last Stand\\" and \\"Lose 200 lbs...\\" and I find that both of those have harsher attitudes and sometimes actually are a bit demeaning and insulting toward people who have clutter. This book though, had none of that attitude and is by far much funnier and contains more reader mail which is fun to read."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"This is not necessarily a how-to-dejunk book (like Clutter's Last Stand, which I HIGHLY recommend), but rather, a book of testimonials. It's stuffed with short paragraphs written by &quot;your fellow packrats&quot; about how they dealt with the clutter in their lives -- kind of like those before-after diet success stories you often find in women's magazines. Some of the testimonials are particularly helpful and poignant -- how to deal with stuff that belonged to a child or spouse who has died, how to deal with gifts. Aslett will have you getting rid of unnecessary gifts and memorabilia guilt-free, while saving those few things that have real value and meaning.Some of the stories are downright amusing -- my favorite, a story by a woman cleaning out her recently-deceased grandmother's home, who found oatmeal boxes and all kinds of other boxes, even boxes in the attic, full of metal disks. She finally realized that the disks were the ends off biscuit cans -- grandma made biscuits for breakfast every day for over twenty years. A woman described her husband, who saved every school paper he ever had, because &quot;when he's President it will be necessary for history.&quot; There are notes from a woman who saved all of the shoulder pads she had removed from her clothing, even though she looked ghastly in shoulder pads, another woman whose clothese are so tight in her closet she doesn't need hangers -- &quot;They're just suspended there by compression.&quot;In addition to the testimonials, Aslett includes all sorts of silly poetry about clutter that will have you laughing, poems about &quot;The Junk Drawer&quot; and &quot;Purse of the American Wife.&quot; The poems and stories aren't necesssarily how-tos, but perhaps they will be a mirror to help you see the absurdity in your own save-everything behavior -- to help you realize that the faded curtains from the bedroom in your last house, the six-year old can of Slimfast powder, the abandoned ceramic projects, the dead flashlight and old bridesmaids dresses are a burden."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"Aslett's masterwork is CLUTTER'S LAST STAND, which I have probably read at least 30 times (I even gave a copy to my ex when we parted ways). This book CLUTTER-FREE!: FINALLY &amp; FOREVER is full of testimonials--&gt; but in many cases they are more than that as they show how real people have grappled with the concept of clutter, freedom, guilt, obligation, etc. I find I read different Aslett clutter books at different times, depending on my level of motivation. I definitely recommend reading CLUTTER'S LAST STAND before reading this one. Nonetheless, this is a really good read."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"I'm giving this book 5 stars. I know some people were disappointed that it's mostly full of testimonials and reviews of Don Aslett's earlier books. Even though there wasn't much &quot;how-to&quot; in this book, I found the experiences that people shared very interesting, entertaining, and even kinda scary. But, the important thing about reading the book was that it worked for me. Over the last couple of weeks I've gone through my stuff and have hauled away 2 1/2 pickup truckloads of junk. And I'm not done yet! I didn't think I had much clutter, but I found a lot. It's just wonderful to let go of things that complicate my life. I think this book has potential to inspire many people to let go of their junk, and live a more simplified life."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"First, let's be blunt. Aslett got a free book out of the letters and emails sent to him by fans of Clutter's Last Stand. This book has very little Aslett and very little practical advice other than \\"toss it.\\" It consists of personal stories of being a prisoner of clutter, the wilder the better.That said, if you want to feel massively superior to people who've saved sixteen years' of National Geographics, the entire contents of the city dump, or a barn full of fluorescent light fixtures, this book is a hoot. Once you've started decluttering, read this book during your drink breaks. It's easy to put down, thanks to all the short sections, and the vision of not being like these people will keep you going."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"I love this book!! It is full of stories that people sent Don about their experiences. Oh My Goodness, I laughed so hard I cried!! And then I started dumping junk FAST!! I didn't want my mother to read my high school diary or know that I kept broken tongue depressors from childhood imunizations!!If the normal &quot;dump your junk&quot; books just don't work for you, try this one!! It will entertain and scare you into getting rid of the junk in you life."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"This book is not as motivational as Don's other books (such as Clutter's Last Stand - one of his best!), but it is great reading for those of us who have decluttered our home, but find the clutter has crept back in the door a little. Reading all the testimonials in Clutter Free makes it easy to realize how decluttering must be a lifestyle or the freedom obtained by decluttering could be lost. I think the experiences of others recorded in this book could be encouraging to people who think that their house is too hopelessly cluttered to clean out."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"I appreciate the irony of buying a book on clutter with which to clutter up your bookshelf. But I still love this book and leaf through it often. The thing is, once you've read Clutter's Last Stand and then implemented the helpful suggestions there, it's a life-changing moment. You see things differently than you did before. Kind of like a born-again nonsmoker, you want to dwell on the subject of clutter and read more and more anecdotes about other people's before-and-after moments.The chapters are as follows: 1 - More Sightings of Unidentified-Lying-Objects (examples of strange junk that people keep). 2 - The Cost of Keeping It (the hidden costs to your finances, energy, and health). 3 - More Incredible Excuses for Clutter. 4 - Help with How to Dejunk. 5 - How to Identify Junk and What to Do with It Afterwards. 6 - More Advice on Specific Topics (e.g., kid clutter, kitchen cabinets, vehicle junk). 7 - Preventing Re-Junking. 8 - Success Stories.True, this book could be viewed (by the hard-core de-junker who wants to keep his bookshelves bare - who doesn't even HAVE any bookshelves!) as a bit of a retread. Basically, this book is made up of hundreds of letters sent to the author by all those former packrats whose lives he's changed.It's like browsing through an especially content rich online forum with hundreds of people sharing their personal anecdotes - except it's a whole lot better edited! This is the book for those who have managed to clean up their lives and who either want reinforcement, or who remain fascinated with the concept of de-junking and what an incredible difference it makes in the lives of so many. Plus this book has a wonderful tone: never condescending, and full of laugh-out-loud humor."},{"Title":"Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever","review":"What happened, Don? Mr. Aslett's previous books like Clutter's Last Stand were very motivational and informational; this book was a huge disappointment. A reader must wade through tons of testimonials to scavenge a few tidbits of useful information, and this info is by and large a repeat of that found in his previous books (even he admits this). This is the ultimate in clutter recycling! If you want good how-to information, stick to Clutter's Last Stand; if you want an overwhelming amount of clutter confessions, this is the book for you.

I might recommend looking through this one before buying - maybe the hints will strike you differently."},{"Title":"Island light","review":"The Gulf Coast of Florida has not produced many first class novelists, unlike Zora Neal Hurston or John D. McDonald in the South. It is a real loss for Southern Lit in general, and Florida in particular, that Alexander Key gave up adult fiction shortly after WWII in favor of children's lit, of which he was the author of several classics. Before he did, however, Key, also a noted illustrator, turned out two quite serious adult novels set in the Big Bend area of Florida: The Wrath and Wind (1949) and Island Light (1950). The first is an antebellum story of yellow fever and hurricane in the community of St. Joe. The second is a postbellum story of revenge, mystery and treasure on St. George Island and nearby Appalachicola. Maximillian Call, ex privateer and blockade runner for the Confederacy has escaped from the notorious Ft. Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas where he has been imprisoned for 20 years. During the war, his mother has died, his property has been confiscated, his lover has disappeared and he seeks revenge. Key to that revenge is Call's relocating the wreck of a spanish ship on St. George which he had discovered before the war and locating its treasure.. He has competitors, including the northern-born light house keeper on St. George who is slowly going insane from his obsession over the treasure, his ex-lover and her husband.If the plot of this book seems farfetched and fantastic, think of it in terms of Key's later science fiction books, almost all of which involve some degree of innocence betrayed and the search for some kind of Eden. Island Light is a book about the fall of man and the search for redemption. It is clear that for at least two characters in the novel--Max Call and Charlotte, the niece of the obsessed light house keeper--St. George Island itself represents a key to that redemption, mysterious and Edenic. It is their Witch Mountain, so to speak.Key left the Gulf Coast after divorcing his first wife, and moved to the North Carolina mountains where he wrote his juvenile science fiction masterworks. One wonders what would have happened if he had stayed, both to his reputation and that of the \\"forgotten coast.\\" Island Light is an artifact, to be sure, but one that is well worth exploring."},{"Title":"Island light","review":"A great tale by a master storyteller,Alexander Key, set in Civil War Northwest Florida. Like Key's other fictional masterpiece, The Wrath and the Wind, the story doesn't end, it just stops, leaving the reader yearning for more. Key later wrote Escape to Witch Mountain, which Disney made into a motion picture."},{"Title":"Nine-O Adam","review":"I grew up with the author. We had our ups and downs but I'm very happy for him. I was struck by the similarities in which some things in our lives turned out. I'm currently in Iraq and I liked his war stories both about Iraq and Queens. Congratulations Adam!"},{"Title":"Nine-O Adam","review":"One of the better cop books I have read in awhile. It is definitely not a &quot;me, me, me&quot; book if you know what I mean. He doesn't mind a joke at his expense. Ironically I had just finished reading 'Jarhead' when I started 'Nine-O Adam'and the two shared some of the same experiences on the same soil. It is a very 'good' book seeing it is his first book. Some of the grammar is off, but I see his point in writing a 'story' instead of writing a 'book'. It is definetley worth reading."},{"Title":"Nine-O Adam","review":"An excellent book. A former NYPD Officer chronicles his life and his dreams from the Military to the NYPD and finally, LAPD.

It's for people like me who prefer reading to be shocked and this story is as shocking as any and a warning for those who go on Spring Break to be careful. Sadly, Mark Kilroy's disappearance and murder would uncover a mass grave and go into ritualistic killing involving a satanic group. There are 16 pages of pictures here plus a story that would make the hair on your arms stand up with shock. They died as human sacrifices to the prince of darkness not just for fun but they did seem to enjoy murdering innocent lives and took part in the occult. I got this book at a yard sale and so far it's an easy read."},{"Title":"Fairy Brewhaha At The Lucky Nickel Saloon","review":"In the Wyoming Territory, Lucky Nickel Saloon owner Mick is ecstatic that a fairy paid for his drink with a gold coin, which enables him to remit the rent owed to his landlady who was threatening him with foreclosure. His spirits plummet when the coin turns to dust. A fairy horde descends on the saloon, causing mayhem and aggravating his regular non paying customers. Former regular Tom Murphy and his mermaid wife Miss Lizzie, who just arrived in town with the circus, join the melee.Everyone takes refuge under the magic piano to avoid the out of control fairies who intend to rob the circus of their gold so they can make more real gold. They demand Mick serve the only drink that can get them drunk, Fairy BrewHaHa, but he doesn't remember how to make it because he and the fairy King J.R. Ewing were drunk when he concocted it. Mick's girlfriend makes a deal with the fairies that will solve everyone's needs. The fairies will get the drink they want and a gold coin so they can make more gold coins; Mick will receive three gold coins a week for a supply of Fairy BrewHaHa. Now he must remember the ingredients and find a gold coin from all his mooching regulars.This wacky, wild and wonderful urban fantasy takes place in the Wild West but instead of cavalry fighting Indians; fairies are fighting humans. Readers will chuckle out loud out with the snappy repartees and the zany situations that arise when two different species occupy the same space. Ken Rand is a grand storyteller whose historical urban fantasy will gather him a huge fan base.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Proposition (Arabesque)","review":"Shirley Harrison's The Proposition grabs your attention from the very beginning.

The Author use the Plates of the one of the best historical illustrators Angus McBride to traces the development of Greek warfare throughout the classical period and offers a detailed account of Greek military dress during this famous period.This book provides a unique and practical perspective on dificult theme in military history with wonderfully descriptive illustrations, to tell you the true I see this title as an invaluable resource for historians, if you are into Military History you should add this book to your shelves.Look for other titles of Nick Sekunda of the Greece Armies and the Classical period but to understand more of this subject the books of Peter Connolly on &quot;GREECE AND ROME AT WAR&quot; and John Gibson Warry &quot;Warfare in the Classical World: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weapons,Warriors and Warfare in the Ancient Civilisations of Greece and Rome&quot; but for me the best study since it appear for the first time on 1967 but is still the principal comprehensive work on this subject is &quot;Arms and Armor of the Greeks&quot; by Anthony M.

Would have liked to have seen more illustrations of various types of body armor."},{"Title":"The Ancient Greeks (Elite)","review":"The coverage here is warfare in classical Greece from the Persian wars at the beginning of the 5th Century to the death of Alexander the Great, a period of roughly two centuries. The Greek situation changed dramatically during that time, both socially and politically, but the military arts really didn't. Mostly, the state came to play a more central role, which lead to increased uniformity in dress and equipment, at least by region. Nearly everything we know about the armies of this period comes from the works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and a few others, augmented by sculptures and illustrations on ceramics, and a very few archaeological finds. The hoplites of the earlier period were heavy infantrymen armed with spears and round shields, and the Spartans were the masters of the method. They didn't wear armor at first (or even much clothing), but helmets, leather jerkins, and bronze greaves gradually were introduced. In most engagements, there were no missile weapons worth mentioning (other than javelins), and the cavalry (without stirrups) never played more than a limited role, so war was very much a hand-to-hand affair on foot. The text provides a useful survey of military and political events over the time span covered. The color plates this time are taken from surviving illustrations or are entirely a work of the artist's imagination, but they give one the flavor of the period."},{"Title":"The Ancient Greeks (Elite)","review":"I used this book as a reference for painting plastic Greek figures.

What can we expect from her next?"},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"I felt that the authors writing style was about that of a middle school student. Unfortunately, there are few books on the life of Lady Bird, and I did learn quite a bit about her life. I was disappointed that once LBJ's presidency was over, the book ended in a few short chapters. The author flew through the last 30+ years! I find it hard to believe that Lady Birds life didn't include much that could have been included in the book. Also, one of the women I admire most in American history is Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas, who was a close friend of LBJ's. There is a photograph of Ms. Jordan with Lady Bird included in this book and the author did not even mention her in the caption that accompanies it. Tacky!!"},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"I saw a whole new Lady Bird through this book. Ms. Russell did an excellent job of portraying Lady Bird. This seemingly quiet, reserved woman is a woman of great courage, dependable, stable, a role model for any age of woman. I am an independent person and I was so inspired by her character. I have never been very fond of the President, but I can see where he would have never become successful had it not been for his wife. She was a behind the scenes wife, pushing him forward; so wanting to help people and make this country a bettter place to live. I could identify with many of the situations between her and her husband. Some might consider what she went through and endured in her marriage as a weakness, but I consider it a strength. Wonderful woman, in my opinion, one of the most independent and best first lady's of all. I would compare her to Eleanor Roosevelt. Hillary was a strong first lady, but this one we have now has done nothing for us women. She is a leave it to beaver person and that just isn't realistic in or world today unless one happens to be in the same position as her in wealth, etc. Lady Bird shines and this book is so well written. Would like to hear more from this author."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"I have yet to finish this book but I do like it and find it an easy read. I have almost completed the three volume biography on LBJ that Robert Caro wrote and wanted to see what else was available. Since he referenced this book several times, I bought it and have not been disappointed. If you are into Lady Bird then be sure to read Caro's trilogy on LBJ as well as this one."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"After all the hype (at least in Texas) about &quot;Lady Bird,&quot; and my own fascination with the Johnsons, I was really looking forward to this book. I must say it has not lived up to my expectations. Very little of Mrs. Johnson's gracious voice comes through, so a reader unfamiliar with her would not understand how eloquent she is. Many of the anecdotes seem lifted directly from Caro's and others' LBJ biographies. Finally, how did this book get onto the market with such sloppy editing? The author has Mrs. Johnson's mother pregnant at age 50 when she was actually several years younger according to the birth date and other dates the author provides; and alludes to the Johnsons' wedding and honeymoon in 1954, not 1934. There are numerous annoying typos and not a few awkward grammatical constructions. This book needed more of Mrs. Johnson, less previously plowed ground, and an attentive editor."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"Lady Bird Johnson, (1912-2007) First Lady from 1963-69 was truly a gracious lady. This book does a fair to middling job of portraying her life, but the final chapters that cover her life after Johnson's presidency ended are sketchy and skimpy.Lady Bird is known for her Beautification Project and it was largely her influence that spurred Johnson to pass many bills during his administration.A decent book, but Robert Caro's biography is much better and much more in depth."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"As a fan of Jan Jarboe Russell's past articles in Texas Monthly magazine, I was not disappointed by her biography. The author proved to be honest and forthright as expected. I appreciated Lady Bird even more because she really showed true grit in a world dominated by men. Behind the scenes, she proved to be the influential guiding force in LBJ's political life. Her business savvy was amazing to say the least. For a woman of her time, she was a truly remarkable lady in every sense of the word. Thank you Jan Jarboe Russell for telling us about the real Lady Bird."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"Lady Bird is the unusually revealing biography of Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of President Lyndon Johnson by Jan Jarboe Russell (a contributing editor at \\"Texas Monthly\\" who has covered texas politics and culture for more than thirty years). Skillfully researched and smoothly written, grounded in conversations with the former First Lady and interviews with her inner circle of friends, family, and advisors, Lady Bird shows both the public and private sides of a strong, determined, and remarkable woman whose influence on her husband, and through him America, was considerable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"I thought I knew Lady Bird Johnson -- sweet, flat, uninteresting, dominated by her powerful husband -- until I read this outstandingly revelatory book. Bird is every bit as strong as Hillary, and probably even LBJ himself. Author Russell makes a convincing case that Bird is a force to be reckoned with, and I'm not talking about her party-planning skills. Superior biography that brings it subject to life."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"Jan Jarboe Russell has authored an extraordinarily insightful book that reaches beyond a conventional biography of a woman's life. Her book brings together as no other has a close attending to the lived complexity of the very human relationships between Lady Bird and Lyndon. Somehow Jarboe-Russell has given us the other half of the story of what it is to experience life in an auxillary position. Most biographies of spouses of historical figures in the past have focused on the male experience and male vision. In her illuminating venture into the world of a contemporary Hera, Jarboe-Russell raises intriguing questions about the sacrifices a woman often makes to live in a male-dominated culture. This author has succeeded admirably in providing the reader a glimpse of a mythology that continues to to be alive in many marriages. I was spellbound by the narrative. It is a gem of a book."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"After reading Robert Caro's masterful biographies (Volumes 1 and 2) of LBJ, I yearned to learn more about the background of Lady Bird--specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to LBJ but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward. Well, Russell's book certainly disappoints. It is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited. The only new information that I gleaned from this book was gossipy. If one wishes to learn substantive information about Lady Bird (and of course about LBJ), Caro's biographies are a far superior source."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"As pertains to Lady Bird, the book is alright. Early in the book, however, the author makes a statement that in my mind caused me to wonder just a little if the rest of the book would be on target, that statement being as to Lyndon Johnson having &quot;given us Vietnam&quot;. Unfortunate statement, as Vietnam was well underway before LBJ took the helm, even before Kennedy. If the author can't get THIS glaring fact straight, then how can I really trust the rest of the book? A better read, for those who care to dig deep and get facts, &quot;Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His TImes 1961 - 1973&quot; by Robert Dallek is a better picture, giving us the real Lady Bird, much better than Ms. Russell's work. Ms. Russell's book gives a good detail of Lady Bird's early life, but the Dallek book gives us the Lady Bird that means the most - what a great woman!"},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"There is too much of the author and not enough Lady Bird in this book. I am fascinated by Mrs. Johnson; she must have been a real Steel Magnolia, having put up with LBJ for so long, but this book seemed to focus too much on him. I would have like to have heard more about Lady Bird's efforts to beautify America, and the other causes that interested her. The author did not serve herself well when she asked Mrs. Johnson too many personal questions which led to Lady Bird's withdrawl of participation in the book.At the same time, I think this book is a good overview of Mrs. Johnson's life and times. I just wish that the author could have gone deeper than LBJ's manic personality and infidelities."},{"Title":"Lady Bird: A Biography of Mrs. Johnson","review":"It's remarkable that there has never been a biography of Lady Bird Johnson until now.

I will say this, which I extract from her dedications page. \\"Kimya kingi kina mshindo mkubwa.\\" Translated from Swahili, this means: A long silence followed by the mighty noise. Like the end of a glorious theatre production, the audience is left silent and then, instantly and without warning, are brought to their feet in a thunderous applause, giving credence to a great work of art.Mikaylah Simone has created a book of poetry that spans every area of life. We are drawn in during the first chapter, Spit'n Politics, with a powerful short piece, \\"Consciousness,\\" which speaks of integrity and justice. She moves us then to Inner Voices, with pieces such as \\"One True Voice\\" and \\"Flatline,\\" works that dig deep into the human psyche, laying bare our heartfelt desire to have a voice in a world that would work to quell our views; and opening our mind to the reality of our mortality.Some Call it Love gives us a down-to-earth, sister-lemme-tell-ya view of love, with works such as \\"Cupid,\\" which spits resentment of an age-old love god who, without permission, shoots \\"unsuspecting people in the ass.\\" And the remedy for keeping this deceptive love god at bay is something you would never imagine.Simone keeps us glued to our chairs when she moves on to For the Sake of Religion, a riveting look at secular religion and the damaging effects of creating a god for a people who have been yanked out of their culture and thrust into a state of destitution. She fearlessly calls out priests on their penchant for nuns and little boys, while they lay warmly ensconced in their fine robes, concealing their false prophecies. And we, children of a lesser god, buy into the hype.Ancestors Calling, Urban Echoes, All in the Family, Youth No More and Tributes, continue to mesmerize and teach, while holding us to a greater level of awareness. Simone's works are timeless and speak of truths always known, but rarely expressed. Her words ring like those of a prophetess from the Middle Kingdom, giving insight into the world at large, with a clarity that can only be described as revolutionary.I couldn't put it down...at least until the last chapter. In her final chapter are the musings of other writer poets, and although I love and respect the works of Blue, Troi Miller, and a few others, I was anxious to read more of Simone's work. I felt like a child left in the middle of a 100-store mall. I was carried and nurtured, then summarily left to strangers, who although friendly, couldn't provide me with what I spent the past 3 hours enjoying.MY MANUFACTURED ENGLISH is a great read that resonates from within and demands its place in history as a great work of art.

While the book does contain fighting, injuries, modest interest in girls, awareness of childbirth and death, all appear in a non-graphic manner that is appropriate for all ages.

With this unexpected break from studies, 15 year old Josh and his friends decide this would be a great time to take a hiking and camping trip...but their trip doesn't turn out exactly as they planned!After a few weeks, a new teacher is located and classes once again resume. With the new teacher comes a new student (the teacher's attractive daughter), Camelia, and immediately all the boys are enamored with her. Josh becomes acquainted with her and her father (the new teacher), but when Camelia and Josh start studying the books in Camelia's father's library, Josh comes across some confusing new ideas. Ideas that contradict the Biblical teachings that he's heard all his life....but Camelia and her family whole-heartedly believe these strange new ideas. Josh becomes confused and starts to doubt his faith....could these new ideas possibly be true, or is the Bible right?This book didn't manage to hold my attention quite like\\"Once Upon a Summer\\"did. While it was enjoyable, it just didn't seem to have quite the charm that the first book did. It's probably just because the story elements here didn't entirely appeal to me: the camping trip, and then Josh's confusion with creation vs evolution. However, this is a critical portion in Josh's life, and definitely should not be missed if you plan on reading the whole series.This book (and the rest of the series) has a good, clean story that would entertain most people of any age -- young, middle, or old! This series would also be a good one for families to read together."},{"Title":"The Winds of Autumn","review":"Novel spends 12 months in the life of fifteen-year-old Josh Jones. I was disappointed that novel had no well developed storyline / plot. However, I enjoyed the characterization of Old Sam, the town drunk, and how Josh's Uncle Nat (town pastor) was persistent in seeing that Old Sam was taken care of. I also thought Josh's great-grandfather (aka Gramps) did a marvelous job of helping Josh analyze the Darwin theory of evolution in Chapter 17."},{"Title":"ARRT Examination in Cardiovascular Interventional Technology (Admission Test Series)","review":"This book was useful for practice exam testing, but is not good for studying.

Without any previous knowledge of CIT this book would be difficult to use as is. It would be a good supplimental book, strictly for testing purposes, if you have other reference material to study from. The information in the questions is still very useful and tests your knowledge completely, but without any back up information for incorrect answers, you would still need another book for reference and studying. I would still highly recomend this book just because it has such a large amount of sample questions in all ares of CIT. Because there are so many possibilities for for potential questions on the CIT exam, this book will definitely cover a large portion of those questions and a least provide question written in similar format as on the ARRT exam."},{"Title":"ARRT Examination in Cardiovascular Interventional Technology (Admission Test Series)","review":"Material in book is outdated.

It is, in every sense, a delight to read and will easily withstand repeated readings.This is the third of John Shelton Reed's books that I have read and its style sits somewhere between that of &quot;1001 Things Everyone Should Know About the South&quot; and &quot;My Tears Spoiled My Aim&quot;. The book comprises a collection of dispatches culled from Reed's contributions to newspapers, journals and magazines between 1979-1990. Most of these are 1,000-1,500 words long. The book begins with observations on two of his favorite themes, Southern identity and the New South, before moving on to Southern culture, food, politics and religion. Reed is a favorably prejudiced but acute observer of Southern manners, quirks, oddities and behaviour.The dispatches are written to entertain and don't disappoint. I found plenty at which to laugh out loud. However, this is not to say that Reed is not surreptitiously engaged in a secret mission to raise his readers' awareness of the character and virtues of things Southern. There's plenty enough here even to make a Yankee laugh - especially some of his more elliptical humor. I particularly liked his comment on Ted Kennedy: &quot;For my part, I rather like the fellow. He's certainly the closest thing to a good old boy that Massachussetts will ever produce - which isn't to say that he ought to be president, merely that I think he'd make a pretty good drinking buddy as long as somebody else did the driving.&quot;Reed is exceptionally good at capturing the spirit or the essence of something and making it seem familiar to you. I have never visited Bob Jones University but, in just over three pages, Reed made me feel I knew what kind of place it was. He does the same for a number of Southern characters and institutions.Reed is a gifted cultural interpreter who appraches his topics with respect, affection and good humor. It's tempting to say that Reed is a popularizer but that belies his considerable writing talents. Whilst everything is written in an engaging style, Reed makes few concessions to his readership - he delights in his use of language and deploys an extensive vocabularly that would make some of my students reach for their dictionaries.All in all this book is an unqualified delight. Go buy it now - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"WHISTLING DIXIE: DISPATCHES FROM THE SOUTH.","review":"I'm viscerally saddened that I am the first person to review this book. It is probably the most tender yet forceful books I've ever read about the South. Funny and articulate, Reed gets to the heart of every matter he writes on, a fact which is clear whether you agree with him or not. I'm a Southerner being held captive for four years out here in California, and books like &quot;Whistling Dixie&quot; just make my heart skip a beat every time I read them, just thinking about my homeland. And, Northerners, I really do think y'all would like this book. It's a good-hearted introduction to the South. It's absolutely biased, but who wants to read a textbook about the South?"},{"Title":"WHISTLING DIXIE: DISPATCHES FROM THE SOUTH.","review":"When I took Sociology of the South under Dr. Reed at the University of North Carolina, he immediately won the respect of everyone who heard him speak, by virtue of the mix of humor and humble generosity with which he offered up quite a prodigious wealth of knowledge, and because of his graceful personal style. These qualities are evident in his writing.Now that I live in gritty Gotham, and am faced daily with a culture amazingly alien to the one in which I was raised below the Mason-Dixon, I think every day of the issues he explored in his class (and in his books). He has done depthy and earnest sociological study of issues which plague the minds of Southerners and people who know them: Why Are Country Lyrics So Sad? Why Are Cheating Husbands More Likely To Get Shot Down South? What Exactly Is A 'Southerner,' and Why Won't They Shut Up About That Old War? (and) What, Exactly, Is The Big Deal With Kudzu? I highly recommend this book, as well as My Tears Spoiled My Aim."},{"Title":"WHISTLING DIXIE: DISPATCHES FROM THE SOUTH.","review":"Mr. Reed sure can write. I don't always agree with him; to turn around what he says about Steve Earle, Reed's politics are suspect. And more importantly how can he believe that Randy Travis is better than Earle and Dwight Yoakam? Still even when I didn't agree with the book I enjoyed reading it. The essays on country music and Ted Kennedy are worth the price of the book by themselves. Best of all it's wonderful to see someone defending my home region who isn't a confederate flag waving idiot."},{"Title":"WHISTLING DIXIE: DISPATCHES FROM THE SOUTH.","review":"I've long been a fan of John Shelton Reed's &quot;Letter from the Lower Right&quot; in Chronicles magazine, and gave very high marks to &quot;1,001 Things Everyone Should Know About the South,&quot; which he wrote with his wife. But for some reason, I had never made an effort to track down and read any of the collections of his essays. I see now what a mistake that was. I wish I'd read this back when it was new.It was some consolation to find that the articles and essays here assembled were definitely worth the wait. Reed is a very funny writer, but he's not a &quot;humorist&quot; or humor writer in the sense of, say, Dave Barry or even (to move outside the region) P.J. O'Rourke. You'll definitely get a laugh out of many of these pieces, but you'll also find them deeply informative. Reed is, after all, a serious researcher and thinker, and the two indisputable facts that define his writing -- that he loves the South, and he *knows* the South -- feed off one another.Granted, many of the essays here are more than a little dated (some date back to the Carter Administration), and I'd love to know how things have changed in the thirteen, fifteen, or almost twenty-five years since some of them were written. But that's no doubt just one more reason to track down Reed's more recent collections.Southerners, including expatriates, will nod knowingly at much of what Reed says, and will get a kick out of seeing themselves depicted so accurately in print. I hope they'll also take to heart his commitment to preserving many of the things -- from culture to accent -- that make the South truly distinctive. Folks from other parts of the country will find that Reed has not only made that sometimes-puzzling region a little easier to understand, but has made the trip a remarkably pleasant one."},{"Title":"WHISTLING DIXIE: DISPATCHES FROM THE SOUTH.","review":"In this collection of essays and articles, John Shelton Reed tackles the zeitgeist of the South. He goes about it with an academician's skill that enables enlightened humor and sound argument while avoiding cheesy, low-grade cliche.Reed emphasizes the importance of cultural/regional distinction. He acknowledges that the South, like any other region, has its problems; however, when it comes to culture, it rules the world. In a country becoming more and more like the James McMurtry song \\"I'm Not From Here, I Just Live Here,\\" this distinctiveness is more important than most people think; therefore, Reed takes great pride in it.If you live in the South, Reed will articulate things you've always felt and will give you an appreciation for what makes your homeland unique. If you're from somewhere else, perhaps you'll gain a new understanding of what makes Southerners tick. But whoever you are, I think you'll like this book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Last Word on First Names: The Definitive A-Z Guide to the Best and Worst in Baby Names by America's Leading Experts","review":"I can't tell you how many baby name books I read before I found this.

Does not give many meanings of names, rather the authors concentrate on how the names are perceived today. Has a lot of unusual choices - not for you if you love very popular names. Could stand to be updated now, but still my favorite baby name book ever!"},{"Title":"The Last Word on First Names: The Definitive A-Z Guide to the Best and Worst in Baby Names by America's Leading Experts","review":"I own 7 baby name books, and this is by far my favourite. If you're interested in baby naming trends (and want to avoid a trendy name), this is the book for you. No doubt about it: this book is very judgemental (but people are judged by their names whether we like it or not). However, the writers seem to be well-rounded and intelligent so I often agree with their comments. The best thing about this book is how the writers discuss the names in current cultural context. I find this much more useful than a list of names with their obscure definition (who cares that Calvin means bald?). This book is useful especially for first time parents who may not realize that Brittany, Emma and Tyler are not original. I'd like to see an updated version of this book (even though I probably won't have any more children, I just find this book so fun to read)"},{"Title":"The Last Word on First Names: The Definitive A-Z Guide to the Best and Worst in Baby Names by America's Leading Experts","review":"Unlike boring name books with tons of lists, this one actually picks the best and worst names out there and gives you the authors personal opinions of them.

But the authors are too obsessed with what Hollywood celebrities are naming their kids, and all that gossipy fluff gets rather tiresome after awhile. Please-- take out the fluff, and use that space to give us a concise meaning for each name. THEN this book will truly be the only naming guide a prospective parent needs.

Of course, it is based solely on the authors' opinions and as far as I'm concerned this book is far too judgmental.

The book never touches on Hindu or Middle Eastern names other than Jewish. It is very judgemental and seems to make fun of people. I would not ever recommend this book to anybody. It is so trendy it even has &quot;seen on Oprah&quot; on the cover. Save your money for a latte or something trendy that tastes good. Forget the trendy books, and please forget the trendy names!!

They authors judge that there are many &quot;far more attractive&quot; names than Vance for a boy, but Fred, Caleb, Barney, Moe, Angus, Mack and Tully fared just fine as reasonable choices.With all due respect to the Barneys, Moes and Freds of this world, I'm glad, as a Vance, that my parents did not read Satran's and Rosenkrantz's book.

Having grown up in the mountains of North Carolina, I am always on the lookout for books about life in Appalachia, and \\"Beauty Before Comfort\\" has to be one of the best in recent years. The honesty, reality, humor--they recall Dorothy Allison's \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" and the poetry of Kathryn Stripling Byer. Glock deserves a place at the table of strong, stunning Southern women writers."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"This book has a heartbeat. The easy and beautiful flow of Allison Glock's words coupled by a truly engaging tale made this memoir impossible to put down. I read it in just two days and was upset when the reading experience had to end. I still can't stop thinking about Aneita Jean Blair's story. How there where so many woman like her that longed to leave their depressive environments but found themselves trapped.Glock does not glorify her grandmother's personality. She is not portrayed as a hero but simply an extraordinary character. Making this memoir both unique and haunting."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"Aneita Jean Blair is my hero. I was inspired by her ability to make the best of everything. I also enjoyed the way she used her beauty and feminine wiles to get what she wants. And when she didn't get what she wanted she would suck it up and move on with grace and poise. This book was a quick and enjoyable read. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find yet another display of one woman's unbelievable strength."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"My girlfriend was reading this book and I just happen to start thumbing through it after I grew tired of the morning paper. Instantly it was like I was seven again and my grandma had asked my brothers and sisters to gather around and listen to the way it used to be. But this book blows the traditional &quot;I had to walk to school in four feet of snow&quot; story out of the water.

Ms. Glock may be a gifted writer, but she is a poor storyteller."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"I think most of Jean Thornberry's dissapointment in life came not from the town/area, but instead within herself. She seemed insecure and unsure of herself, grasping at men in a desperate fashion. Not receiving the love and attention at home from her own Mother, too weak to stand up to a \\"dictator\\" of a husband, and a Father, whom was self-centered, cold and hateful. What a pitiful childhood. Robbing Jean of her self confidence and self esteem. Thusly, she comes into adulthood blaming not only the valley and people, but indeed the very heart and soul of the area. Why did she spend her entire life, in the town?? Strength and perciversance may of delivered her from the detested town.There is poverty, alchoholism, bigotry and the seedier side of life in every town, county and state across this nation, around the world. Alchoholism crosses every line of wealth and nationality.The area does indeed produce lazy, ignorant, slovenly people.But is also a birthplace of some of the finest folks on this earth. People who value nothing more than family and friends.Hardworking, caring folks with high moral standards. Thrifty, honest people who provide for their own, care for their elderly, raise their young to dream and fly. Self sufficient people who can perservere through the hard times, and find joy and happiness in every day life.The area itself is a site of splendid beauty. The gentle foothills, seem like velvety mounds with the deep green leaves of summer. The gently flowing Ohio River, dales and glens, winding country roads, and slow and easy pace, comfort and soothe the soul. A sense of peace and serenity abound.It is an area with pride in it's rich and vital heritage.Life is what you make it from the deserts of Arizona, to the beaches of California, the mountains of Colorado, to the foothills of West Virginia. Happiness and contentment come from within. And it all boils down to the half empty/half full glass."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"How did this woman ever get a publishing contract?

Your feedback matters.Happy reading,Allison Glock"},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"I came from an industrial town in Tennessee, and Allison Glock's wonderful story of her grandmother, who lived in that kind of environment, really resonated with me. Aneita Jean Blair's life is not the kind that usually gets the full biographical treatment, especially from a granddaughter.The second outstanding part about this book is the writing. Lines such as &quot;Just walking through the house required lurching effort,&quot; written about the death of a family member, make the story more real.Having read some of the reviews here on Amazon, I cannot understand the hostility that some people convey about this book. My favorite line from an angry reader was this one: &quot;I think if you right (sic) a book you should actually know what you are talking about.&quot;That line--complete with spelling that shouts ignorance--says it all. Allison Glock does know what she is talking about, and tells it very, very well."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"I read the first reviews that came out about Beauty Before Comfort, and, to quote Yogi Berra, it was deja vue all over again: this book could have been written about my mother. In fact, I could have written it!Although my mother stuck, more or less, with one main man (my father) from the time she turned sixteen, I couldn't help comment on the similarities between Aneita Jean and Mary Churchman (my mom). Those many points of comparison made this delicious reading. I believe anyone with a flamboyant female relative in her background would find this book a delight. For me, it filled in many areas of my mother's life during that same era (30s and 40s) that she has pulled a gauzy curtain over - now that preserving her self-image as a devoted wife and mother is more important to her than creating the well-bred hussy image.Beauty Before Comfort - what a great title! It sort of says it all, and this book reads as well as a pair of beautiful and sexy sling-back high-heeled pumps: even if the shoes were borrowed from a cousin, aren't quite the right size, and pinch horribly by the end of the evening, by God, they sure look great!"},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"Allison Glock has fashioned a lovely little book about her grandmother growing up in West Virginia during the Depression and World War II.The author shares with us anecdotes, both happy and sad, about the hardscrabble existence of those days where working in a pottery factory was how people made their living and social life was pretty much confined to one's holler or at best the next one down the road. Nobody of that generation ever left town except to fight in a war.Glock is especially adept at describing the townspeople and their feelings, drawing the reader into the story and enabling us to feel so close to the characters. The section describing Petey Dink is especially touching.Kudos to author Glock. She has done a marvelous job. This book reminded me of David Baldacci's recent novel, &quot;Wish You Well.&quot; Whereas his book is a work of fiction concerning tough times for a family in Virginia, Glock's accounting of her grandmaother's life is all the more interesting because it is true.Keep on writing, Allison. You are very good."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"Allison Glock is a poet. Her words are stark and striking, and her storytelling is mesmerizing. After meeting Aneita Jean, I wanted to go back through the years and get acquainted with my own grandmothers, hear their stories and live vicariously. I felt an intimate attachment to the memoir, as I grew up in Newell, WV, and currently reside in Chester, and my parents live on Phoenix Avenue across from Aneita Jean's childhood home. I frequented Thornberry's store, growing up in the 70's, and I still think about it every time I drive through the town and see the building that once housed the store. I was a bit taken aback by some of the harsh assessments Glock levied on WV and Hancock County, but I understand that is her truths, and Aneita Jean's, but not necessarily mine (I escaped for 15 years but found myself yearning to return, so I did). I have recommended this book to all my fellow &quot;Newellies&quot;, and I look forward to the next work by Glock."},{"Title":"Beauty Before Comfort: The Story of an American Original","review":"Allison,You're a great little writer. That you evoked this much emotion from people reading your book says that you have the gift of telling a story passionately. You have stirred up some powerful emotions that goes to the heart of your ability to write. When people who can't spell or put a sentence together are moved to write a review of your book, you're doing something right. Either they love you or they hate you, but they are reading you.I went to school with your mother, until I was one of the ones who got out of Hancock County when I moved to California. Your mother must be very proud. I sure would be.Your book brings back many precious memories, even memories of some of the hardships grabbed something in my heart. You have written a very accurate description of the people and the area, and you have been able to tell it like it was while also conveying a loving image of your grandmother and the times.This is your first book.

Allison Glock has a stunning talent to come up with words that bring her characters and pages to life. This memoir of her grandmother doesn't duck the bawdy intimate details, which are compellingly, almost Jerry Springer-ish funny, and reveals with impact the bleak kind of John Steinbeck depression era drudgery and unfulfilled aspirations of the lives she articulates with such feeling. I think she will become a hugely successful author if that's what she chooses to be.

Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing. He is not a professional historian. The first chapter in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese sources. (The story of the &quot;Hmong&quot; king's defeat by China actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.) Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924). For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii Press, 1994). The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read with caution and cross-checked with other sources."},{"Title":"Hmong: History of a People","review":"As time passes I learn more and more about SE Asia and the US involvement there over the past many years. My daughter in law (daughter) is Hmong. This book revealed a great deal for me and opens my mind to questions regarding the Hmong,Laos, and the US. This book is well written, an easy read, but shares a great deal of information in its few pages. I recommend this book to anyone interested in SE Asia and the folk who live there."},{"Title":"Hmong: History of a People","review":"Like all the books about the Hmong, there will be at times glaring inaccuracies and mistakes in the material, and Quincy has taken a lot of heat over the years for his attempts to help the Hmong reconstruct their history, most of which was lost during the 4,000 years between their roots in ancient China and the 20th century.Considered by most to be one of the less reliable texts to work from, I nevertheless found many interesting elements within it, that, when combined with additional research, yields some fine and fun reading.It should definitely not be taken on its own- one should try and double check statements by using other materials, but most people who read this will feel inspired to study and learn more about the Hmong and their true histories, and that's not such a bad thing."},{"Title":"Hmong: History of a People","review":"Mr. Quincy did an excellent job on putting this book together. I have not yet read a book by anyone who would have gone as far back as Mr. Quincy did with this book. As a little Hmong girl growing up, I have always been curious of where Hmong people really existed from. My father tried his best to educate me on who we- the Hmong people were. Many of what he taught me seemed to be unreal, until I read Hmong: History of A People. It really shocked me that what my father was telling me was actually in print! My suggestion to all the Hmong people out there is that EVERYONE should read this book. There is not a doubt in my mind that you will not gain a better understanding of where you came from. After I had finished reading the book, I was shocked to know that my Great-great-great-great Grandfather was the &quot;Hmong King&quot;- Nhia Vue Lee. My appreciation goes to Mr. Quincy and his desire in wanting to have a better understanding of our culture."},{"Title":"Hmong: History of a People","review":"Okay. I don't like reading history books. But this is one book that you really need to check out. It isn't boring and if you are like me -- a Hmong American (of the newer generation obviously) and oblivious to the old generation and lacking in appreciation or knowledge of your background (if you are hmong) this is one awesome book that will set the records straight.As for those who are just really interested.. well! This will reveal what most of the population don't know about the hmong; their brief history of where they are originally believed to be from up to their involvement in the vietnam war as to where they are now and some cultural background, too. This is a really awesome book compared to most books written about the hmong people that i've gone through.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Hmong: History of a People","review":"This book starts out with Hmong's history within China and preChina. From there, a few incidents of war in the Mountains and lowlands near the Yellow River procceeding to the Mountainous regions Southwest of China. The accounts of Chinese and Hmong interaction clearly verify that our history is hidden somewhere in Chinese history. The Time frame of the book is based from B.C periods to the present time of which the book is published. It's filled with Hmong Legends and Historical events; such as the French Indochina War, the Vietname War, and the Secret War after the Americans bail out on us; the Hmongs!While reading this book, I discovered my family tree. One of the guy they mentioned was PaChay. His last name is Xiong. He is my great great Grandfather. Wow!Anyways I shouldn't have said that but I'm a family guy. What can I say? I'm just showing some Hmong Pride here. It's in everyone's(Hmongs) Nature to show some pride!Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend every Hmong to read this.

Fourth Edition based on the First Edition of 1918 and enlarged to incorporate all known poems and fragments. Edited by W. H. Gardner and N. H. Mackenzie. 362 pp. Oxford and New York : Oxford University Press, 1970. ISBN 0-19-281094-4 (pbk.)For anyone who is interested in Hopkins, and everyone should be, this is the standard and authoritative edition. It gives us the only complete and accurate text which for the first time puts the poems in their true chronological order.The poems have been arranged in four sections : Early Poems (1860-1875?); Poems (1876-1879); Unfinished Poems, Fragments, Light Verse, &amp;c. (1862-89); Translations, Latin and Welsh Poems, &amp;c. (1862-67). The book contains a useful and informative Introduction and Foreword, and is rounded out with very full Notes, a series of Appendices, and Indexes of titles and first lines. It is also beautifully printed on excellent paper, stitched, and bound in a sturdy glossy wrapper.Hopkins had a unique sensibility, and brought something very special and of great value into English poetry. He seems to have had the ability to enter into the intelligence and feelings and spirit of all life forms, whether animal or plant or even landscape, to resonate with the indwelling divinity within them, and to somehow magically bring the miracle of their vibrant being over into his poems.Hopkins is in fact a striking example of the fully human sensibility as described in the works of Heidegger and the great thinkers of the East, and exemplifies a quality of sensibility which most of us seem somehow to have lost. We skate dully and blindly over the surface of things, but Hopkins plunges into the depths of being and carries us along with him. In other words, he puts us back in touch with reality, with what life is really about. Hence his enormous value and importance.In a complete collection such as this, there are bound to be many poems that fall short of greatness. For the newcomer to Hopkins, one suggested approach might be to first read some of his greatest poems, poems such as 'God's Grandeur,' 'Spring,' 'The Windhover,' 'Pied Beauty,' 'The Caged Skylark,' 'Binsey Poplars,' 'As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame.'There are many beauties to enjoy in Hopkins - his unique use of language, his control of sound and rhythm, his amazing images and metaphors - but for me the most beautiful thing of all is the news he brings, news of a universe in which all things are of infinite value and infinitely precious, and in which no creature is of any less value than another because all are indwelt by divinity:&quot;Each mortal thing does one thing and the same : / Deals out that being indoors each one dwells ; / Selves, goes itself ; _myself_ it speaks and spells, / Crying _What I do is me : for that I came_&quot; (p.90).Hopkins makes us acutely aware of our loss, and our crime. His poems map out a path back to a saner, more balanced, and more wholesome and intelligent way of dwelling on the earth, dwelling lightly upon it with all other creatures and as its guardian, not its ravager.&quot;O if we but knew what we do / When we delve or hew - / Hack and rack the growing green! / ... After-comers cannot guess the beauty been...' (pp.78-9).Hopkins, I think, would have been very much in agreement with Heidegger who tells us that the earth must once again become a _Spielraum_ , a space of great beauty in which to play, and one in which all creatures, instead of being treated as mere objects, are allowed to do what they came here to do, to develop the full potential of their natures and fulfill themselves as manifestations of divinity. His poems are unforgettable, and one envies those who may be coming to them for the first time."},{"Title":"The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins","review":"The first poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins I read was \\"PiedBeauty,\\" which was included in a book of poetry for children thatwas given to me by my great-aunt. In high school, I read \\"Spring and Fall: to a young child\\" and loved it, though I did not realize it was by the same author. It was only college that I connected the two, and discovered a wonderful poet, who has become one of my favorites.For a fan of Hopkins looking for an authoritative volume, this edition is a treasure. In addition to his better known works, it contains early poems, numerous fragments, and unfinished works, in fact \\"every scrap of English verse which can be ascribed... to Hopkins\\" (from the Introduction xvii). In addition, it contains a good essay on Hopkins and his work, and extensive textual notes.Hopkins poetry may appear obscure and difficult at first, and in fact it is, at times, wildly original. Hopkins' language is deliberately archaic and inventive, and he both revives wonderful words not used since Shakespeare, and makes up his own. Hopkins also writes in \\"sprung rhythm,\\" a metrical style that is almost syncopated, and juxtaposes stressed syllables. I recommend reading his poems out loud. The sheer beauty of his language will inspire you to recite the words over and over again, until you understand his meaning: the essence which he is trying to distill. New readers may be daunted by this volume at first, and find that Hopkins' great poems are \\"submerged in a mass of less significant fragments\\" (Intro xiv). I would suggest his sequence of ten sonnets (#31-40) as an ideal place to start reading.Hopkin's friend and fellow poet Robert Bridges wrote that Hopkins strove \\"for the unattainable perfection of language,\\" and at times he seems to have actually obtained it: \\"Men go by me whom either beauty bright / In mould or mind or what not else make rare: / They rain against our much-thick and marsh air / Rich beams, till death or distance buys them quite.\\" (The Lantern out of Doors, #40).

I think the ?s represent spaces for formatting indentations. It would be nice if there were a way to either filter the ?s out or convert them to spaces.

There is no table of contents or links to individual poems. The line breaks in many poems are in the wrong location. Some of the greatest of his poems do not even have line breaks at all but are formatted as a single paragraph. Too bad, but I recommend looking for a better edition of this book."},{"Title":"The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins","review":"Gardner and MacKenzie have compiled a fine collection of Hopkins' juvenalia, mature work, and uncollected fragments/translations.I wish that I knew what to say to compel readers unfamiliar with his work to buy this or another collection. The Terrible Sonnets are among the most moving treatment of spiritual anguish in the English language. If you are doubting, take the time to look \\"Carrion Comfort\\" up on the web-- the poems are available at Bartleby.com. This book is one of my constant poetic companions.For readers already familiar with the more famous pieces, it is a treat to see his younger work and translations. Reading the book as a whole gives a picture of a mind in motion. What led him to this point?\\"NO worst, there is none.

It rather relates to Hopkins unique greatness as a poet which I will try to say a few words about.Hopkins created his own style of verse, his own vocabulary for perceiving the world, his own special rhythm and language in poetry.He is not the most easy poet to understand, and I will admit that his longer poems lose me.When I consider his work I relate primarily to five, six , seven poems which seem to me extraordinary. \\" The world is charged with the Grandeur of God\\" and \\" Thou art indeed just, Lord\\" and \\"Felix Randall the Farrier, Is he dead then?' are to me the most memorable. They contain a power and beauty, a tremendous sense of identification with and understanding of the suffering in life, a kind of unique and intimate perception of the details of the natural world.Hopkins the tormented priest wrote to my mind some of the most memorable and beautiful lines in the English language. Consider the closing of ' Thou art Indeed Just Lord\\" \\"Birds build but not I build/ but break Times wounds And never breed one work that wakes Thou O My Lord of Life Send my roots Rain.\\""},{"Title":"The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins","review":"On my Kindle, I don't know how to get beyond the introduction and to the poems. I do next page after next page and just get introduction. Pressing the joy stick right does nothing. There is a brief table of contents at the beginning, but Early Poems and Poems are not selectable. Of course, I can go to a high-numbered location, but I have no sensible way to choose the number. In addition, since the introduction was formatted for the Kindle DX, the lines run over on the Kindle 2.Of course if you know Hopkins, you can do a search on a word or two. The only word I knew to search for was \\"dappled\\". This led me to the poem I was looking for, and I enjoyed it and the next few poems. The poems fit on the page quite well.On reconsideration, I wanted to change my rating from one to three stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me."},{"Title":"The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins","review":"Very disappointing edition.

It's laid out in bland, boring type. The paper and cover seem cheap, like it was made by the local print shop. Worst of all, the lay out of te poems is a disaster. Titles appear at the bottom of one page with the actual poem on the next. The last couple lines of a poem often dangle at the top of the next page - sometimes even requiring a turn of the page! - when there is plenty of open space all around, enough for the whole poem to sit in one place. It looks simple amateur. Like the format on Word isn't translate to the printers. Simple terrible.

You would be well served to read that but as equally interesting is this account of his living with the Hopi while working on that book. This is written in a straight forward style so it is an easy read. Water wisely leaves the complication of the Hopi for his more scholarly work. This book explains the characters that he met and the conditions of their lives. This book will break your heart. The Book of Hopi will liberate your soul."},{"Title":"Pumpkin Seed Point: Being Within the Hopi","review":"Frank Waters wrote some of the best books we have about the culture and life of the American Southwest. His \\"Book of the Hopi\\" is the classic study of Hopi mythology and history, a labor of love described more personally in \\"Pumpkin Seed Point,\\" about the three years he spent collecting stories for \\"Book of the Hopi.\\"\\"Pumpkin Seed Point\\" is both personal and universal. Referring to his research he writes:\\"It wa a difficult winter for the two Bears and me. The kachina night dances were being held in the kivas of every village, and indomitably we went to everyone. Gorgeous as they were, each was an ordeal.\\"Referring to dreams, he writes:\\"These 'voices of prophecy' were ancient gods, archetypal symbols and images speaking from the lowest level of unconsciousness.\\"For Waters, the poetic and mythical shared spacetime with nature and the pragmatic concerns of everyday life. Who would want to deny that the Hopi had insights into something more profound than we usually imagine within our modern materialistic obsessions? Who could deny that the Hopi suffered from modern obsessions?Although writing in the 1960s, Waters' insights into the disappearance of the Anasazi remain as profound as any research that's followed him. His descriptions of Hopi life mirror what many of us imagine Anasazi life might have been like when we visit the great Anasazi ruins of Chaco, Aztec, Hovenweep, and Mesa Verde. I reread this classic recently at Chaco while working on my own novel,Ophelia's Ghost, about the disappearance of the Anasazi."},{"Title":"Pumpkin Seed Point: Being Within the Hopi","review":"If you're interested in reading Frank Waters you should read this first. If you're only going to read one book of his this would be the one. It recounts his life on the Hopi mesas while working with Hopi to get the Book of the Hopi into print. His experiences were really a microcosm of the larger problems between the cultures that were here at the time of European immigration and those incoming cultures. His understanding of the spiritual issues involved and the possibilities for integrating different world views into a new coherent whole is phenomenal and worth reading at the source.

But--not so fast.Yes, Anna Kane has amnesia. Yes, she is dismayed to learn that she is apparently married to Simon, who seems wary and suspicious of her. (Think early Leclaire hero here: tall, dark, handsome, autocratical, and arrogant.) As it turns out he has his reasons--apparently Anna left him on their wedding night, without a word of explanation. As Anna slowly comes to trust, and eventually love, her mysterious and bossy husband, she has to ask herself why she would have done such a thing.Well, love can make us do weird stuff, as Anna finds out during the unravelling of a surprisingly complex plot.Meanwhile, though, while poor Anna is sweating out every twist and turn of an impressive cliffhanger, it's easy to be fascinated by the scenery, culture, and history of the imaginary but captivating Caribbean island which Simon's pirate ancestors have inhabited for generations. If poor Anna has to go through all this angst, she's at least got a marvelous setting to do it in!This book is like a mini-vacation; nobody would want to live this story, but it sure can be fun to \\"visit.\\""},{"Title":"One Night Wife (Mills & Boon Romance)","review":"This is the first book by Day Leclaire I have read that isn't funny. Not even a chuckle. I really did like it. But I like her sweet laugh out loud books so much better.In this book Anna Kane has no memory of her husband Sebastian, but he will not except that. Why I don't know, he claims he doesn't believe in love, but it is clear he loves her beyond life itself. And he is willing to do anything to regain what he lost when she left him before the police contacted him about Anna being involved in a car accident.But Sebastian thinks Anna is pretending she can't remember anything, why he believes this Ms Leclaire never really fully explains.Christanna started out trying to get the plans for a plane Sebastian invented, for her stepbrother Benjamin, but she falls in love with Sebastian.Benjamin was flying the plane that Sebastian invented, when it crashed, taking the lives of Benjamin's father and Christanna's mother. Benjamin can't face the fact that he was the reason for the crash, so he asks his stepsister to take a job as an assistant to Sebastian and spy on him. She falls in love with Bastian and tells Benjamin. He pretends to drop the case, only to threaten her with blackmail later.Once they are married Benjamin tells Christanna he will tell Sebastian why she started working for him in the first place if she doesn't get the plans for Sebastian's plane to him.She can't face Sebastian knowing about her and her stepbrother's plot, so she walks out on him on their wedding night.Benjamin crashes the car they are riding in and then leaves the scene of the accident, almost killing his stepsister as he had their parents.(This doesn't seem to bother Benjamin at all) Anna has a head injury, from the horrible crash where she had to be pried from the wreak, but it turns out that her head injury isn't really that bad. As far as I know any head injury is bad, no matter how slight.The story is really heart ripping sweet, but sexy as all get out.From the back of the book: 'Forgive and Forget?Anna Kane wakes up in a hospital bed to find she can't even remember her own name.

It seems as though the author was trying to be poetic but instead there were just many sentences that didn't make any literary sense. For example:\\"You've learned to love and work well enough without a guidebook, and since I'm supposed to have one for you, I can tell you the next chapter's on rest though if you need a higher authority, I understand that citizens of Spain and France and I don't know where else are expected to rest, more than a little siesta.\\"That is word for word what is written in the book, I have not altered or miss-copied anything.

What is this strange relationship with the angel of her eye and ultimate perfection, Laura? Why can't a character that wants to go to Harvard actually speak the English language? And for that matter, why can't the author use the English language and communicate with the poor, beleaguered readers? It should not be so difficult to read a paragraph and sort out the narrative from the dialogue and who is talking to who.

I read Ellen Foster when it was an Oprah selection, so I was thrilled when I saw that the character had been revived. Ellen arrives in this volume still living with her loving foster mother at the age of 15. Her abstract but common sense way of looking at life and people, is still refreshing and makes you want to smile. Her manner of thinking is not an \\"easy\\" read but draws you into her heart and soul, and allows you to see things through her honest, frank eyes. I think most young readers will have difficulty if they did not read \\"Ellen Foster\\" first. However, if they persevere into the story they will learn how the trials of life can give compassion those who survive. You become endeared to each and every one of Ellen's friends and neighbors in the book based on her open and accepting view of them despite their special needs. I will recommend this as a wonderful sequel to the first book especially for those who can't get enough of Ellen's wonderful engaging way of explaining how life seems to her."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"This book was good, not VERY good, but good.

This novel revisits Ellen several years later, after she has grown up a bit, become more educated, and enjoyed the love of a strong parent figure. This novel tends to drag, and I had to force myself to keep reading a few times.

Kaye Gibbons does not disappoint. As a reader of all of Gibbons work and a native of NC, I am continually amazed at her ability to bring the essence of the South in both historical and personal perspectives. The description of the Moravians at the fair and the isolation that she felt at John Hopkins ring true as do the wonderful characters that fill in Ellen's life. For those who felt the dialogue awkward, I suggest a second reading and yes people do burn tires (it was the early 70's) and sell bad poetry - teacher's wouldn't have believed good poetry."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"Gibbon's follow-up to her very successful Ellen Foster finds Ellen on the road to higher education. At the age of fifteen, she has written a letter to Harvard, requesting that she be accepted for early admission. While waiting for a response, ensconced in a secure foster home with her mentor and foster mother, Laura, Ellen grapples with the usual government interference, her own adolescent angst, revealed family secrets and a dose of tragedy that will test even this resourceful young woman's mettle.When considering novels about girls in distress whose resiliency buys them a one-way, hard-won ticket to the future, not only does Ellen Foster come to mind, but also the young protagonist of Bastard Out of Carolina, a more dangerously challenged young character. Inspirational and thought-provoking, such works of fiction offer hope in a too often hopeless world. But whether such fiction merits a sequel depends entirely on the new material. Unfortunately, Ellen's voice hasn't changed much in three years, her Dickensian drudgery turned to promised opportunity that she naturally distrusts, given the government's role in her daily survival. Facing unexpected revelations, with Laura's help, Ellen must sort through a confusing history, prepared to make her way in an often unfriendly world. This young lady possesses extraordinary internal resources, along with supportive friends who want her to succeed.After the debut of Ellen Foster, it was clear that this girl qualified as a survivor. Propelled into a more secure environment, Ellen wields the tools of one who is determined to make her way through life on life's terms; given a hearty dose of heartbreak and wish fulfillment, Ellen proves the exception, her future one to savor: \\"I told Laura, I bet I can do this, don't you think?\\" Absent the drama and poignancy of the first novel, this follow-up fails to ignite the imagination for adult readers, but may find an attentive audience in other adolescents who are struggling with a vision for the future.

First of all, the book lacks a plot and does not seem to have any purpose except for the narrator's incoherent descriptions and actions. The random characters don't seem to add anything to the plot either.Another pitfall of this book is that the syntax is mutilated to the point of incomprehensibility.

It is definitely a unique voice, however, it was diffucult to follow at times and did not lend itself to the empathy created in the first book when Ellen was a younger child. I sailed through the first book but struggled to finish this one."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"One need not be familiar with Kaye Gibbons' debut novel, Ellen Foster, to comprehend or enjoy the characters in the sequel, The Life All Around Me by Ellen Foster. But since Gibbons gives little in the way of character description, it might help.Ellen Foster was 11 years old when readers first met her 20 years ago. Now she's 15, with the same attitude and determination that saw her through the physical abandonment of her mother and the abuse and eventual abandonment from her father. She has a stable home and is doing quite nicely, thank you very much. After having tested in the genius category, Ellen wants a higher education, and she wants it now--not waiting to finish high school.On one hand, I wish Gibbons had left Ellen alone. The plot is overly sentimental and too unbelievable with its Cinderella ending. The framing device that Gibbons employs screams first-year grad student. When something seems too good to be true, it often is.On the other hand, the main reason to read this book is its use of voice. Surprisingly, two decades and several novels later, Gibbons growth as a writer has not interfered with Ellen's voice. It's still as naive and plucky as it ever was. I'm intrigued at Gibbons' ability to use long sentences, a technique usually associated with slowing a novel's pace, to make the reader's heart beat faster. There is nothing long nor slow about Ellen.Gibbons also uses another unconventional technique and that regards structure. There are no quote marks to establish spoken words or to distinguish the words from thought, using commas to delineate one from the other, allowing only paragraphs to suggest a different speaker or a transition to another subject. Nor is the work broken into nicely followed paragraphs.If I were only a reader, I would have a lot of problems with The Life All Around Me by Ellen Foster. But as a reader/writer, the work was thought provoking and sure to stimulate discussion in my writer's groups and classes.Armchair Interviews says: This is a book has a lot of media \\"buzz\\" about it."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"Having read and enjoyed 'Ellen Foster\\", I never really got around to this sequel until recently when I found it in a dollar store [that itself should have been a hint].

There are too many other good books around to waste one's time on drivel."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"I loved \\"Ellen Foster,\\" and eagerly awaited this book, but I just could not get into it.

Ellen is surrounded by mentally challenged people and her opening letter to Derek Bok asking for early admission to Harvard puts her in the same category. Hard to believe she's as freakin' smart as Bok, and Johns Hopkins U, her friends and she herself think she is.The coincidences are cheap, and don't you believe she'll marry the small town Harvard-educated lawyer in the fourth sequel? After having her heart broken by somebody at Harvard in the third, and maybe losing investments in the dot com bubble.But Kaye Gibbons lays on her keen observations of people just trying to get through the day in a community that does things very differently from mine. Picture the students answering roll call from the stone wall outside the classroom because the teacher is willing to yell the roll out the window. Imagine any dull student handing over a dollar to buy a homework assignment. Picture the family that burns tires in their yard for a living. Imagine yourself on the train to Baltimore hoping that goofy teenage girl will go sit somewhere else.I enjoyed this book despite its silly denoument. Would recommend it for the charm of its style.

The style of this book is what killed it for me. The sentences, told in the first person, are excessively complicated and convoluted. I found myself not being able to follow what was going on and having to re-read sentences or paragraphs over. I just finished this book about a week ago and can't really remember much of the detail. I stuck with this book because I kept hoping it would come around and everything would fall into place. Didn't happen for me. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"I had to repeatedly reread paragraphs of this book to try and understand what she was saying. I felt like I was drunk! I loved Ellen Foster and raced out to buy this book, but I'm disappointed. The lack of quotation marks really hindered the reading. I couldn't understand who was talking at many times throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"I loved \\"Ellen Foster,\\" the prequel to this book. I thought it rang true and was a poignant, hilarious and honest look at a young girl's struggle to survive her dysfunctional family in the South.However, this book fails to live up to its predecessor. There is very little plot, although the writer could easily have used Ellen's quest to go to Harvard early as a consistent thread. Instead, we get scenes with tedious characters, as Ellen waits to hear from the school. Some parts are downright unbelievalbe, such as when Ellen earns money to attend a summer program by selling verse to her classmates, so they can then turn it in as homework. It's clear the school is not a good one, and even at the finest prep school, if half the student body started turning in poems, even the densest staff would suspect something underhand. But not here. Also, at $4 per poem, Ellen would have to do approximately 100 classmates' homework to reach her goal, which you'd think would finally clue the teachers into a cheating scandal. While this may seem a minor point that it's unfair to harp on, it helped destroy the book's credibility, particularly since the author made all Ellen's friends out to have subpar IQs. Plot holes big enough to drive a truck through makes it hard to enjoy the writing style, which did have its high points and the characters themselves, some of whom were engaging and likeable, if too good to be true.I was also baffled as to why Ellen was unable to find kindred spirits at the summer program for the gifted and why she seemed to feel less alienated with people who didn't know who Holden Caulfield was. This does not bode well for her stay at Harvard, unless she matures some more.The fairy tale ending also annoyed me. It's possible to give your characters' good fortune in return for their pluckiness, without making it completely implausible. I wish the author had done so here."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"Although the general premise is intriguing, this sequel to Ellen Foster left me disappointed.The book begins with a letter from 15-year-old Ellen to the president of Harvard University, citing the reasons he should be interested in helping her achieve her dream of higher education. From there, Ellen fills readers in on what's been happening in the three years since they met her last: finally finding happiness in the home of her foster mother Laura, making herself secure within a tight-knit circle of odd friends, and seeking closure with the aunt and cousin who threw her out of their house on Christmas when she was eleven.Despite my interest in the plot, I found it extremely difficult to follow Gibbons' writing style. She does not use quotes, and basically attempts to depict Ellen's life woes and joys in the rambly, vague manner of someone who should already be privy to all the information and is currently living through it. In certain cases, it took me several references before I could deduce who certain characters were.It shouldn't be that much work to read a book for pleasure."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"I guess most every good writer has at least one that misses. This book missed with me. I can't even tell you what I didn't like about the plot because I didn't understand or couldn't find any real story line. Ellen Foster was a delightfully written book, easy to follow with right-on descriptions, but this sequel is so strange. Much of the writing seems like free-form associating rather than coherent writing. Not enjoyable for the reader to try to make heads or tails out of. I cannot recommend this book. I, too, hope Ms Gibbons goes back to her old writing style for her next book."},{"Title":"The Life All Around Me By Ellen Foster","review":"For twenty years, readers enchanted with Ellen Foster, the resolute and sympathy-evoking protagonist of the Kaye Gibbons novel of the same name, have awaited a sequel. Gibbons, whose acclaimed \\"Ellen Foster\\" launched a remarkable literary career, has since become a national treasure. Her subsequent novels feature strong, honorable women who embody just about the best values America could represent. Gibbons has also been fearless in her selection of themes; she has brilliantly treated female depression, the burdens of raising a family on one's own and the resounding beauties of female friendship.However, \\"The Life All Around Me by Ellen Foster\\" is a terrible novel. Ellen's voice is false; the characters are unbelievable, and the novel has little narrative drive. At its best, \\"The Life\\" is contrived, and, at its worst, the novel borders on the incomprehensible.Living in a benighted rural Southern community in the mid-1970s, Ellen Foster determines to attend Harvard. Her earnest entreaty to President Bok concludes with the homily: \\"I believe that anything is possible if you have the combination of love for what you're doing...\\" and the tenacity to \\"not get up until it's done.\\" Gibbons never follows up on what should have been an interesting proposition: a sixteen-year-old applying very early admission to America's premier university. Instead, the author spends the next two hundred pages describing a community that has produced children so insipidly stupid that they make the cast of \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" look like geniuses.Preparing us for a modern-day Helen Keller, Gibbons requires Ellen to interact with and even educate some of these pathetic knuckleheads. There's her quasi-boyfriend and full-time village idiot Stuart, who goes to the \\"optimist\\" to have his eyes checked. And then, there's Martha, who is figuring out how to sell boys \\"their things\\" during a dreary school presentation on venereal diseases. For comfort, two flawless African-Americans -- one a mother, the other a child -- console and support Ellen when her soon-to-be-sainted foster mother, Laura, needs a moment off.Even the conventions that worked in \\"Ellen Foster\\" don't work here. Gibbons persists in refusing to use quotation marks. This makes her already garbled conversations even more difficult to follow. I lost count of the number of times I gave up on a paragraph simply because it didn't make any sense. Even more serious is the author's inability to tell a story. Ellen Foster deserves to have her life recounted with dignity and strength. She certainly doesn't deserve to be found on some bookseller's remainder table. Unfortunately, that's where \\"The Life All Around Me\\" is destined to go."},{"Title":"Runways to God: The Psalms As Prayer","review":"After his resurrection, Christ said to his disciples in Jerusalem, &quot;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and in the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.&quot; (24:44-44). This book, Runways to God, is premised on these words of Christ and analyzes each Psalm with respect to Christ's fulfillment.

While I don't necessarily agree with everything in the book (booby traps would create too much trauma for my skittish yorkie), I use what works for my abilities and my dog's emotional state. I have to say, Dunbar's methods work better than anything else I've tried.It's really too bad that Cesar Milan is the one with the TV show that has become so popular. I think he adds absolutely nothing to educating people about training their dogs. It also concerns me that his show places a warning at the beginning of each episode stating his methods should not be tried by an inexperienced dog trainer/handler. So then what's the point of having this show on TV? For him to sell more books or pure entertainment value?Anyway, Dunbar is heaps better than that clown and provides tools that normal people can use to help create a bond with their dogs. My dog and I now know how to communicate with each other. He knows what's expected of him and I know how to set the expectations without terrorizing him into it (like Milan says you need to do - pure BS)."},{"Title":"How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks","review":"How many times have I walked through the park to see a dog pushed in a baby carriage?

I was very shocked to find out that he recommends booby-traps for effective punishent of dogs on page 72 on his book. He suggests creating a trap that drops twenty pebble-filled beer cans on your dog after the dog triggers it by taking a bacon-fat soaked bait e.g. from the trash can.Dunbar finds this kind of \\"effective punishment\\" very clever because it doesn't affect the dog-human relationship. I find suggestions like this completely inhumane. Traps like that will scare a dog out of his mind and you risk coming home to a traumatized and maybe even injured dog. Please do not fall for such outdated punishment-based training methods. The re-labeling of these methods as \\"reward-based\\" or \\"positive reinforcement\\" doesn't make them any less abusive."},{"Title":"How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks","review":"While I agree with positive reinforcement training methods and would never resort to choke chains or pinch collars, Dunbar's book is a poorly written, smug, and pretentious mess where he tries to transcend the training manual genre and fails -- miserably.

I was immediately impressed with how well the positive-training techniques by Joel worked. But when I went to purhcase other books, I noticed that many other authors took a much harsher stand on punishment -- and really fixated on the whole alpha dog concept. So I investigated further, and soon learned that many proponents of the \\"positive training\\" methods credited Ian Dunbar. So I knew I had to have Dunbar's book.At first, I was turned off by the wordy format, and pictures of a bearded guy from the '70s. I was worried that the book may be too philosophical, and not practical enough. But I puchased the book anyway.Man, I sure am glad that I purchased this book. The wordy passages are filled with a wealth of information. Whereas other books offer brief, simplistic instruction -- this book offers an in-depth explanation. It is a great complement to my Labrador for Dummies book.I also found his tone to be light and humorous -- and honest. It is quite easy to read, and holds my attention.

However, after reading many dog training books, I found it simple and mostly common sense.I would recommend the Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson over it."},{"Title":"How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks","review":"First let me say that this book and the more recent \\"Before and After Getting Your Puppy (Dunbar 2004) are virtually identical. There is a little additional material in the later volume, but in that book states that all important training MUST occur in the first 6 months of puppydom. One day later is too late. For those of us who aquired the dog when slightly past six months - well - let's just hope it's not true.That said, I think most of the training techniques in Dunbar's books are reasonably effective - but he cops out on some very important behaviors. Many older puppies and dogs have greeting behaviors that include frantic jumping, pawing and scratching and even excited nipping. If an owner and his dog are ever going to have a social life (or a uneventful walk,) it is essential that these behaviors be corrected. These behaviors are particularily challenging because they are cccurring when a dog is in a high state of agitation and far less likely to attend to, or even hear, commands.Dunbar's recommendation is to have a party (with at least twenty people) and have all those individuals repeatedly enter the house armed with treats. The dog is instructed in the proper behavior and rewarded when he/she complies. Treat and repeat until Rover gets the idea. Then have a party the following week to make sure it all stuck. Dunbar also wants you to have all these good natured dog lovers to walk around the block a number of times carrying treats so that Rover can \\"run into them\\" on his walk and be shown (again, and again, and again) how to behave. Now in theory, this is a great approach, but the truth is that most of us don't have twenty or more friends willing to spend a number of hours, two weeks in a row, assisting us in our dog training. As this is his only suggestion for correcting greeting behavior, it leaves the majority of us in the lurch with jumpy, hyperactive greeters who will no doubt drive away the friends we do have."},{"Title":"How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks","review":"Wow!

This is really an important thing for a human being to understand because it will make the relationship between you, your family, your friends, and your dog countless hours of enjoyment. Once you understand what makes a dog tick there's no limit to the things you can do and you can do a lot of it without the aid of a book.In the early going of raising your puppy you'll find yourself going back to this book often -- and the good news?

I think he was often wondering &quot;why is she doing this to me?&quot; Dunbar's method has been a much more effective tool for me. I have used this method on a boxer puppy and a pug and found it very succesful. Both dogs enjoyed learning new things and it was easy to teach them using Dunbar's method. Sit, stay, come and the few tricks I taught, they learned very quickly. My only complaint is that when I had a serious discipline problem the book did not give me much guidence. We live across from a corn field that the pug found very alluring and unfortunatly a major roadway is between our yard and the corn field. When he went past his boundries and needed some sort of correction there was no guidence.

Very well written and researched, by a very talented young author, who's definitely in love with his subject. As the foreword of astronomer James van Allen states correctly, this book is first of all \`a tale of human achievement', i.e. the emphasis of this book is very much on the project as such and on the people that made it possible (and how they did it). Wolverton does pay substantial attention to technical issues and to the scientific results of the various missions, it's true, but I would have preferred him going into more detail on all these things, providing more data and explaining more of the scientific achievements. To my tastes, he spends too much time discussing \`the human factor' and the adventure side of it. But then again, this is the book's explicit \`mission'. It just wasn't exactly what I expected, although I enjoyed it very much (especially the story about the controversy around the famous plaque with the naked couple on it, and on the old DEC PDP 11-14 \`mini-\`computer that was still being used in 2000 to communicate with Pioneer 10). So, this book is highly recommended and a Must for space buffs. It's also a very beautiful book, solid and robust.

The book is a nice, concise and well-written history of the Pioneer program, from the early and unsuccessful probes flown by the military in the immediate post-Sputnik era to the trail-blazing missions to Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. All of the book was interesting, but I thought that the story of how Ames Research Center got involved in deep space exploration, the maneuvering to get access to the Deep Space Network, and the continued gathering of data from Pioneers 10 and 11 long after their primary missions ended to be particularly interesting and never before told. I wish that the book had been a little longer, with some more detail about the spacecraft and their scientific findings. Also the meager selection of small black and white photos is inadequate. But those are minor points and this book is a must-have if the subject interests you."},{"Title":"The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes","review":"The Depths Of Space: The Story Of The Pioneer Planetary Probes by by author and NASA expert Mark Wolverton provides the reader with an informed and informative historical overview of the Pioneer space probe mission program that saw the first mission launched in August 17, 1958 that had the misfortune to blow up 77 seconds into lift off. But every failure was a learning experience and subsequent missions ventured to probe the sun, go beyond the asteroid belt, went on to Jupiter, Saturn, and finally out of the solar system and on to the stars. Superbly written, The Depths Of Space is a seminal and enthusiastically recommended addition to personal and community library Space Exploration History reading lists and reference shelves."},{"Title":"The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes","review":"\\"The Depths of Space\\" by Mark Wolverton includes all the details for those of us who weren't born or were too young to know when these remarkable spacecraft began their journeys. Mr. Wolverton's tale shows the politics and competition between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center in the early days of spaceflight primarily through the stories of Pioneers 10 and 11, though without neglecting the other flights of the Pioneer series. For those interested in the history of NASA and spaceflight, this book is an excellent place to start. The Pioneer series of flights racked up a long list of \\"firsts\\", not to mention blazing the trail for JPL's Voyagers in the 1970's and 1980's. Pioneers 10 and 11 got there first, scouting ahead for the much more celebrated Voyagers a decade later.

Woolverton accurately presents a description of how an unusually competant NASA Program Manager, working very closely with the Experiment Scientists, all in a hostile political environment, pulled off an exceptionally precarious \\"Mission Impossible\\"."},{"Title":"The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes","review":"'The Depths Of Space' is a story of two little spacecraft and a NASA research center that could. This book is not a dryly written documentary, but an engaging tale that encourages the reader to keep turning pages, to find out what will happen next. Like the story of Apollo 13, we all know the outcome. But it's the journey to get there that matters, and Mark Wolverton delivers.In the early days of space exploration, all the NASA centers were focused on the \\"do-or-die\\" space race. Except the Ames Research Center. Ask anyone at the time and they would say that Ames might come up with an interesting idea in material shape, vehicle design, or even a heat shield, but nothing more exciting than that. Ames was quite happy not to be in the limelight, as it was \\"not given to flights of fancy involving outlandish ideas such as space flight.\\" To Ames, space flight was viewed as a fad of the day, with no long-term future. There would always be a need for better airplanes, which was the focus of Ames.Then Ames found itself reorganized, with a new branch called the Vehicle Environment Division (VED), dedicated to support NASA's space flight goals. Albert Eggers, an idea man, was put in charge, and put forth a challenge to his engineers at the VED: to design, build, and launch a series of solar probes. Eggers' deputy assistant, and a very capable engineer in his own right, Charles Frederick \\"Charlie\\" Hall was given the task to oversee this project.Meanwhile, the Army and Air Force were attempting to get probes to the Moon before the Soviets succeeded. Their project was called Pioneer, and they were instrumental in launching Pioneers 0 through 5. The first five of these six spacecraft went out in a blaze of failed glory, but each one getting further than its predecessor. Pioneer 0's Thor rocket booster blew up 77 seconds after launch. Pioneer 1 launched two weeks later, edging itself out of Earth's atmosphere to touch the inner Van Allen radiation belt, then burned up on re-entry two days later. Pioneer 2 made it up a thousand miles before it met with an untimely death, the victim of pre-mature burnout of one stage of its launch rocket and the failure of the booster rocket to even fire. Pioneer 3 made it 63,000 miles above Earth's surface, discovering the second Van Allen belt, before falling back and burning up. Pioneer 4 made it the closest to its goal, escaping Earth's gravity and passing within 37,000 miles of the Moon before it was lost in space. After this the Russians landed spacecraft on the Moon. Pioneer 5's mandate was to be the first spacecraft to be intentionally launched into solar orbit, which it succeeded at. 3 months later it would pass too far from Earth for any of its signals to be picked up again.After this the Pioneer project was handed over to Charlie Hall and Ames. From the ground up, they designed, built, launched, and operated the Pioneer 6 through 9 spacecraft, all solar probe explorers, designed solely to measure the Sun's activity. Thus began Ames' move from being a purely research-oriented institute to a contender in space exploration.Wolverton follows this substory with the main focus of the book: the design, construction, launch, and operations of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. These were to be the first manmade probes to explore the reaches of space beyond the orbit of Mars. Having been involved in missions such as Hubble, FUSE, and MESSENGER, I can say from experience that Wolverton captured the atmosphere of what went on behind the closed doors of the Pioneer project (which really hasn't changed all that much 30-40 years later with contemporary missions). From the scientists proposing experiments (both in working with engineers and management to the interplays in dealing with each other), to the work of the design and development teams, to mission operations and the realities imposed on operating spacecraft, you are put in the very rooms with these people as they argue, cajole, and support one another in order to make these spacecraft a success.Again, as with the Apollo 13 story, Wolverton captures the tension in the air as the science and operations teams watch with trepidation as their little spacecraft penetrate the asteroid belt, skirt the radiation fields of Jupiter, and in the case of Pioneer 11, dance outside of Saturn's rings (in prep for the two follow-on JPL missions called Voyager).While no longer operating (Pioneer 11's signal was lost in 1995, Pioneer 10 was last heard from in 2003), these two little emissaries of our world continue to this day heading out deeper into space, on course to transition from the outer boundaries of our solar system into interstellar space. Each probe carries with it a 6x9 gold anodized aluminum plaque with etchings of our solar system and two generic \\"naked people\\", should on some off chance the probes be discovered by an extraterrestrial intelligence. However remotely unlikely that is to occur. Space, you see, is really REALLY big, and the probes in it are infinitesimally small, a mere few tens of feet long. Traveling at 2.6 astronomical units (AU) per year (where 1 AU is the mean Earth-Sun distance), it will be over 26,000 years before Pioneer 10 passes within 6 light-years of Proxima Centauri, and over another 6,000 years before it passes within 4 light-years of the star Ross 248.Mark Wolverton pulls together all the above, and more, into an excellent, non-technical historical story that should be a \\"must read\\" for every space exploration aficionado. All it really needs now is a soundtrack."},{"Title":"The Best of Edison Science Teaching Kits","review":"This book is an amazing resource for anyone teaching science or interested in science fair projects (they even give instructions on making the display boards).

I homeschooled my children and I wish I had known about this book sooner."},{"Title":"Alaska (America the Beautiful, Second)","review":"I believe I have flown over Alaska flying back from Japan to California, however I am not sure about it. However, I have not been to Alaska, which makes it the only one of the 50 states left for me to visit. On my honeymoon several years back I made a point of traveling through Maine and dipping into Rhode Island in driving from Boston to Hartford just to make it state number 49. My expectation is to do a cruise, because everybody I know who has taken a cruise to Alaska has raved about it, so I think that will be the way to go. In her introduction to this America the Beautiful Second Series volume, Donna Walsh Shepherd makes it clear that are plenty of reasons to visit even if it is not on your places-to-visit list. Chapter One, \\"Alaska--A Great Land,\\" sets up the dichotomy that exist in the largest state (and second least populated), a land that has both temperate rain forests and frozen deserts.The next three chapters of this volume look at the history of the place that was the first part of North America to be populated. Chapter Two, \\"Coming to the New Continent,\\" starts 7,000 years ago when people first left their homes in Asia and walked east to Alaska, and ends with Seward's Folly as the United States bought Alaska for $7.2 million dollars (2 cents an acre) in 1867. Chapter Three, \\"From Gold to War,\\" covers from the discovery of gold in 1848 to what happened in World War II in the north. Chapter Four, \\"North to the Future,\\" starts with Alaska's statehood in 1959 as the 49th state and ends with the importance of the black gold of oil to Alaska.The \\"Spectacular Nature\\" of Alaska's geography is covered in Chapter Five, focusing more on the parklands and animals than the six distinct regions. Chapter Six, \\"Cities, Towns, and Villages,\\" contrasts life in the large cities of Alaska with that in the bush communities (Nome got its name because a British navy cartographer creating maps from ships' charts misread the handwriting that said \\"?name\\" to mean \\"Nome\\"). Chapter Seven, \\"Government by the People,\\" talks about what politics are like in a state where a few votes can decide an election. This is also where young students get to learn about the state symbols (the bowhead whale is the state marine mammal, but the state land mammal is the moose). If you cannot guess what the state sport is you are just not paying attention.The economy of Alaska is covered in Chapter Eight, \\"Making a Living,\\" which looks at the abundant natural resources and tourism (there is a list of the top-ten-most-visited places to help you plan ahead). You have to wait for this book's recipe until Chapter Nine, \\"Who Are Those Alaskans?\\" That would be citrus broiled Alaska salmon, which I am going to have to try (I poached salmon last month, I can handle this). Chapter Ten, \\"Alaskan Art and Alaskan Fun,\\" starts with the idea that Mother Nature is the best artist in Alaska, but also covers native and winter art. Of course, the Iditarod shows up here as well. The back of the book has the expected Timeline, where U.S. and Alaska state history run in parallel columns, and the pages of Fast Facts with all sorts of statistics that young students can use researching the state. There are also lists of books, organizations, and Internet sites where students can go To Find Out More.The American the Beautiful Second Series books are filled with color photographs of Alaska, original maps on things like topography and population density (by borough), and dozens of informative sidebars. These are always the treat in these books, and because there are not a lot of people up there in Alaska, Shepherd goes into some of them in some depth. There is a two-page spread on Alaska's current political leaders, whereas the life of a Salmon only gets a single page. But young readers will also find out about Gold Rush characters such as Klondike Kate, the Chilkoot Trail, Blue Babe the frozen steppe bison, and Jewel Kilcher. Teachers should take advantage of this series to have their students research the various states with an actual book (do they still do that?)."},{"Title":"Macbett","review":"Previous reviewer downgrades wonderful theatre of absurd play - a take on Shakespeare...It's a French play...written by French author; Title is Macbeth in French, \\"Macbett.\\" What is he thinking?"},{"Title":"Macbett","review":"I don't know if it was originally written in French, but I knew I would have trouble reading this edition when I saw the page labeled \\"Personnages\\", and found that the next page starts \\"Decor: un champ.\\". Yes, the publisher's name is \\"French & European Publications\\", but, from my unlearned perspective I assumed that Great Britian is part of Europe and made the mistake of thinking that some Europeans read books published in the English language. Another arrogant American bitten by Globalization! It would have been nice if the publisher had noted either their choice or the author's choice of published language in the description."},{"Title":"Bosworth Field and the Wars of the Roses","review":"There have been many books written on the English 15th century, some good, some bad, and some, like Mr Roswe's here, completely one-sided. The book is dedicated to one of the author's friends, whose ancestors fought in the conflicts, obviously on the Lancastrian side. Rowse makes all Lancastrians/Tudors out to be noble, pious godsends, and all the Yorkists to be devious, unworthy, decadent cads. Even more ridiculous, Rowse appears to have used Shakespeare's cycles of plays as his &quot;fact&quot; base! Can that possibly be topped? Why yes, as there is even a chapter in this book dedicated to launching cheap insults at anyone who doesn't follow his narrow-minded, bigoted point of view!! &quot;History&quot; books like this one should not be taken lightly though, as they can be very dangerous. And one more thing, this doesn't make me a revisionist, it makes me a tradiotionalist! The real revisionists are the ones who altered history from the 16th century on. Strong reccomendation to avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Bosworth Field and the Wars of the Roses","review":"I disagree with the claims that the book is well written. The bias in the book has already been covered so I'll stick to the various basic rules of writing the author breaks. For instance, he consistently uses phrases in Latin or French and then does not explain what they mean. This is a large no-no for any writer. The next problem isn't as large if you know the history of the period, but newcomers will find it incredibly irritating. Mr. Rowse consistently likens the situation he is discussing with another time period or person and then leaves it at that. This wouldn't be as bad if he described it more, but the entire description of a situation may simply be its likeness to someone else's with no explanation of who they are. Lastly, the book often jumps around in time periods which is normally fine. In this book however, the jumping around is not recognized by the author until several paragraphs into it. So you may be reading about an event and the author continues it as a narrative until you suddenly realize that the date he gives for this part is 5 years before the last one given, with no indication until that point that what he was discussing took place before the previous information of the same topic. Overall the book is more of a frustrating read than a well written book."},{"Title":"Bosworth Field and the Wars of the Roses","review":"A lively, detailed, and unapologetically traditionalist interpretation of the background of Shakespeare's history plays, by a respected Shakespearean scholar and historian. This book is an ideal introduction to the period for both history students and readers of the history plays; it includes, in addition to detailed accounts of the principal figures and events of the war, an examination of literary treatments (including Shakespeare's). Revisionists may be put off by Rowse's staunch defence of the Shakespearean view of the war, but traditionalists will enjoy it a lot. I found this book extremely helpful for my own studies of the War of the Roses and Shakespeare's treatment of it."},{"Title":"Bosworth Field and the Wars of the Roses","review":"This book is well-written, with sensible judgements about individuals, events and social forces in England from the end of Richard II's reign to Henry VII. While other more recent, detailed studies are also available, Mr. Rowse's book is a good resource for someone who is beginning to study this period, and for those who want a well-written discussion of the transition between medieval forms of English monarchy and the Tudor period. His characterizations of persons such as Richard III and Henry VII seem to be generally fair and well-supported by other scholars."},{"Title":"Aviation Year By Year","review":"I recently purchased this book and I love it. I am a huge plane fanatic and enjoy many books, flight sims, websites, etc. on planes. I can say that out of all my books this is by far my favorite. It has planes, airports, important dates, crashes, almost anything that has to do with aviation. It is very comprehensive. It is literally a dictionary of events that occured in avation history. It starts in the year 1500 with da Vinci, begins in large detail in the year 1900 and stays that detailed until the year 2000. It is a must for anyone who enjoys planes and aviation in general as much as I do. A terrific book."},{"Title":"Mekong Massacre (Black Eagles)","review":"The excitement in this story rocks.

Thus, the researcher finds a rich store in the early published accounts of her life and the movement she founded.In 1862 she sought healing from P.C. Quimby in Portland, Maine. Through contact with Quimby latent capacities she possessed were developed. Quimby died in 1866.Several weeks afterwards Mrs. Patterson, (later this second marriage would be terminated by divorce), fell on the ice, undergoing an injury for which she sought alleviation through the reading of Bible passages. Therefore, cure and revelation followed this pivotal incident.She moved six times in 1866 and numerous times in 1867 and 1868. Sarah Bagley, Hiram Crafts, Sally Wentworth, Mrs. Webster of Amesbury, and Richard Kennedy appear in the story of the religion's origins in these years. By 1870 Mary Baker Glover, she had resumed using the name of her first husband, and Richard Kennedy moved to Lynn, Massachusetts where he was to undertake a practice as a healer.In 1875 the first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was completed. In 1877 she married Gilbert Eddy, becoming thus Mary Baker Eddy. Following Gilbert's death, Calvin Frye became a member of her household, remaining there for the twenty eight years left of her life.THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE JOURNAL, beginning in 1883, had as its main purpose the dissemination of an awareness of Christian Science. Mrs. Eddy was assisted in polishing her writing by James Henry Wiggins, a Unitarian clergyman. She operated by a single standard, what was good for Christian Science.Mrs. Eddy used discordant elements in her personality in the service of her movement. After the founding of the Church, she ceased to have a private life. The fusion was successful. The second half of her life was one of great achievement and assistance to others.

The book is nicely formatted with clear tablature and notation. The fact that the lessons are annotated with CD track numbers makes the book/CD combination very convenient.When I first got the book I was a bit disappointed that it contained so few songs - and all in one key (E). But this book is all about starting to get to grips with different styles, licks, turnarounds and rythms that can then be applied to any number of songs. On the CD Happy is always encouraging you to play around with the material and &quot;see what comes out&quot;. In the end I found this much more fun and useful than learning another pile of songs by rote.The CD is great. The playing is very clear and Happy comes across as encouraging and friendly. The rest of my family likes listening to this disk just for fun !"},{"Title":"Happy Traum Teaches Blues Guitar (Listen & Learn)","review":"This book has a lot of good material. I picked up some new tricks from it. On the other hand, it isn't anywhere near a complete course in beginner acoustic blues. Now, it's always a mistake to expect too much from a single book. Some people seem to think that a single book should turn you into Stevie Ray Vaughan. I won't make that mistake; but it seems like the book ends just as it's really beginning. Three or four more songs would have made me happier and given my review a fourth star.Nevertheless, the material that *is* here is good. I figure, for the price I paid, if I learn just one really good chop, it's worth the price. I got more than one chop from this book. The book is aimed at beginners; it hits its target fairly well. None of the stuff is terribly hard. Keep in mind that if you're a beginner at guitar, as well as a beginner at acoustic blues, then this stuff will seem impossibly hard at first. But I've bought a ton of books, and I can tell you that there are beginner books that are really aimed at beginners, even if they're tough for a novice to pick up, and then there are books with the word &quot;beginner&quot; in the title that are so stinkin' hard that they still sit on my shelf, and I've been playing for four years. This book is truly aimed at the beginner. In short, there are better choices for beginner acoustic blues, but if you're like me, and you snag just about every available title on acoustic blues you can find, this book is worth getting."},{"Title":"Happy Traum Teaches Blues Guitar (Listen & Learn)","review":"I am very pleased with this book; it assumes some basic knowledge of chords, which worked perfectly for me.

Although the author was hardly a novice at diplomacy at the start of his account (having already served as a high official of the Arab Socialist Party), joining the government made him a front-row participant at such epochal events as the Sadat trip to Jerusalem, the Camp David negotiations, and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.True to his promise, Boutros-Ghali presents the memoirs he kept at the time raw, unimproved by later information, and they convey a candid sense of his errors and triumphs, his inconsistencies, digressions, and insights. The memoirs somewhat paradoxically reveal a aristocrat, very conscious of rank and appearance, who has an abiding concern for Africa; and a politician threatened with violence by the Palestinians who nonetheless insists on dealing with their concerns. But probably most interesting is how Boutros-Ghali came to appreciate Sadat's efforts. Consumed with non-aligned and African conferences, the author started out slightly horrified by Sadat's concessions to Israel. With time, however, he appreciated Sadat's extraordinary vision. His epiphany came in April 1979, a few days after the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, when he realized that \\"Egypt had sacrificed enough lives and money for the Arabs and the Palestinians. The time has come for Egypt to think of itself.\\" By September 1979, he was \\"fully convinced by Sadat's argument\\" that getting back the Sinai mattered more than suffering isolation at political conferences. So public an acknowledgment of one's own failings is rare, and all the more creditable coming from as distinguished a personage as the former secretary-general of the United Nations.Middle East Quarterly, Sept 1997"},{"Title":"Birds of Minnesota (Field Guides)","review":"I'm not sure why one one reviewer wants to say zero stars. This guide book states its goal in the introduction. It aims to help you identify birds you see in the field.

It provides solid basic information and good pictures. The negative reviewer complains the photos are too good?

The info listed (nest type, eggs, incubation and fledgling periods, preferred food, etc.) is concise and interesting, as are Stan's Notes. We've found every bird that frequents our feeders and nesting boxes in this book, as well as those in the nature preserve area near us.

This book contains the 100 or so most commonly-seen birds in MN, and if you get serious about this you'll want a more complete guide too (I recommend Sibley). We have given this as a gift to many friends and family, esp. nice as a theme gift with a feeder and seed! When we went to Florida we bought his FL volume and IDed 50 species in 10 days time.

The siege of the castle by the Graham family has left Marea vowing to avenge the deaths of her family and kinsmen and reclaim the castle for the MacKenzie namesake once and for all. Chase Graham had saved Marea of a terrible fate in 1571 that allowed Marea to escape the massacre. Now, 10 years later he wanders into her hiding place where she is known as Agatha the Witch, feverish and bloody from battle. While her pride tells her to kill him quickly, her heart longs to save him. And her destiny calls out for her to love him. This book was very well written and from page one I was hooked. Marea is the kind of woman that most want to be like. A tad headstrong but full of pepper and courage. I adored the swash buckling sword fights and the sway Marea has between loving Chase Graham and loving the Castle that was once her home."},{"Title":"Wild Scottish Embrace (Lovegram)","review":"Wild Scottish Embrace starts off with a bang or rather a clang, there's a siege of heroine Marea MacKenzie's castle and as she is only a small girl, she is helpless to stop the brutal deaths of her mother and father. Marea is almost killed by an English marauder but another English raider comes to her rescue allowing her to escape but she vows to regain control of her keep one day.Several years later Chase Graham becomes the laird of the keep after his father's death and he is no stranger to Marea who has stayed around the area disguising herself as an old woman. Chase was the boy who saved her life and Marea returns the favor and saves him disguised as an old, lumpy, sway backed woman.Chase is suspicious of his healer, Agatha, especially since he recalls a beautiful woman attending him at times. Marea is hostile with Chase and he returns her volleys. These two don't appear to like each other much and their argumentative conversations do not change a lot in this novel. Marea is still determined to retake her castle even though she lusts after handsome Chase.Marea is an emotional lady and she knows it. She is way stubborn and her castle invasion displays her lack of planning and logic. Marea tries to blame shift her mistakes onto others but her remaining family members will have none of that. They are wise to Marea's ways.Chase cannot put all the pieces together when it comes to Marea. He is furious with her for duping him on many levels and quite frankly these two only seem to get along in a bedroom setting. Both make sacrifices for each other but they appear to resent the other for it. Chase can be autocratic but he recognizes his faults before his heroine. Marea tells Chase how much she hates him, yes hates him. Her denials of affection for him were interspersed throughout the story.Surprisingly though, the intimate scenes between these two are believable, their passion for each other is intense but their interactions beyond the bedroom were lacking, they talked past each other until the final chapters of this novel."},{"Title":"Eugene Richards: Cocaine True, Cocaine Blue","review":"Cocaine true, Cocaine Blue represents the best of Eugene Richards. If Robert Capa's maxim about your pictures being close to be good is true, then Richards work is hands down about as close as anyone is getting.This book focuses on the impact of crack cocaine in three eastern cities -- North Philadelphia, Harlem, and Red Hook, New Jersey.Richards seems to have none of the fear that would stop most people, because his pictures bring a viewer over the comfort line to become shocking. The scenes exceed imagination. In fact, one of his pictures in this book was challenged for its authenticity because it seemed almost too perfect... In it, a women pauses to look at her John, her hands on his zipper, with her young child watching her. On a wall behind her, a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. is displayed. Some black political leaders saw this picture and insisted that Richards must have set it up. He could only assert that he was truthful in his portrayal.Truth is always stranger than fiction. This might be photojournalism's answer to magical realism: there is a wickedness and abandon to this world. The cover picture is another example -- the photograph shows an addict holding a syringe in his mouth. His eyes gleam in a way that suggests the insanity in the spirit of this individual.Richards is for the most part a photographer who works inside America. Some domestic photographers lament that all of the best photographs are made in wars, and that the situations in our home communities preclude us from being able to make great pictures. Eugene Richards shows how this is false. He takes horrifying pictures in Long Island, in Philadelphia, in West Virginia, in Kansas City."},{"Title":"Eugene Richards: Cocaine True, Cocaine Blue","review":"Eugene Richards, one of the worlds best photojournalist, has a gift to not only photograph well but also write about his subjects equally as well!

Despite the gestures towards multi-cultural values, this remains an utterly Eurocentric account of art. Some entries on 'trendy' French thinkers are really irrelevant in a book about art history, and are often laughable trivialisations of their thought (see the entry on Foucault, for example). These should have been excluded."},{"Title":"The Bulfinch Guide to Art History: A Comprehensive Survey and Dictionary of Western Art and Architecture","review":"This volume represnts two styles of art history guides encompassed in a single voume. The first part is a series of essays ranging from ancient art to architecture to modern art and is meant for the serious art history student. The essays are detailed to the point that beginners may have a difficult time digesting and retaining the information. The second part is the encyclopedic section with many entries ranging from artists to styles to subjects and beyond. It is here the novice will find relevant information, albiet brief, on most topics a beginning student will need.The two sections do not hurt the overall impact of the book, but they do take away space which may prevent either from fully developing its message. One editorial hangup is the use of arrows to indicate cross referenced terms. When grouped together, these can be very annoying. Italics or boldfaced indicators would have seemed more logical.This book makes for a good introduction, and depending on the seriousness of the reader, can be very useful in understanding art history."},{"Title":"The Bulfinch Guide to Art History: A Comprehensive Survey and Dictionary of Western Art and Architecture","review":"I had to write a paper for a History class and grabbed this book as a source from my college library.

There, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abided between the great powers of Light and Dark. \\"Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...\\" and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.Unfortunately, in \\"Warlock of the Witch World\\" (1967), Kaththea is wooed by the fair-seeming Dinzil, who is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones. She who was once a powerful witch is rescued by her brother, Kemoc, but because of her near-alliance with the Dark, she is stripped of her magic. No longer can she communicate mind-to-mind with her brothers, nor perform the simplest spell of healing.A witch without her magic is a very dangerous thing to be in Escore: a vessel waiting to be filled by the Dark.

Each book has something to hold your interest, attention to detail, inclusion of interesting esoteric knowledge, insights into the workings of the characters (human or otherwise) minds, and satisfying conclusions. Still, the novels set in the Witch World are generally acknowledged to be her best! I believe that the answer lies in the poetic (almost biblical) language that she uses in these works. The sentence structure and vocabulary instantly catapult you into a sense of being in another universe... one where miracles and magic are very possible.This particular book completes the trilogy very satisfactorily.

On that worthy end of the spectrum, there have probably been those books that caused a pause in you upon reading the final sentence; a pause followed by a nod of thanks to the author for having given you so much pleasure. And then there are those even more rare instances where you reach that final page and feel that sense of want for more. Its a mixed feeling of love for what you have just read combined with the emptiness that follows upon closing the pages for that final time. It is as if you have lost a friend. Rawlins hit that chord in me with Sky's Witness. The Wind River Range is probably my most favorite place to wander, and I was led to this book after searching for all I could find written about it. But one does not have to go to The Winds or appreciate their grandeur in order to be captivated by the author's writing style here. His ability to describe thoughts and places and to reflect on their nature is almost a gift of magic. He covers a lot of territory, both physical and emotional over the course of a year. It has been about five years since I read it, and I still miss the times it gave to me. If I were to have any reservations it its regard, it would only be the put-offish nature that his personality occasionally evokes in his writing and some of the personal encounters that he describes. Put simply, he is certainly not one to be with when he is in a foul mood. But in praise, this again also speaks to his ability to convey all those elemental spokes of our humanity. If you are one who loves the outdoors, this book will go a long way for you. But even if you are not inclined to the rugged nature of the backcountry, this book will still bring rewarding moments to you during that time spent in that soft leather chair."},{"Title":"Sky's Witness: A Year in the Wind River Range","review":"If you want to hike, back pack, and live in the Wyoming WindRiver Mountains for one year, C. L. Rawlins will take youthere in these 300 pages. You will not find a bettercompanion: his writings proceed in a rythmn -- moving fromintricate description of rock, snow, and lake, to insightfuland stunning explanations of nature itself, followed perhapsby a down-to-earth philosophical reminder. His humor catchesone off gaurd and he tests more than a few other emotions.I returned from a four-day back pack trip in the WyomingWind River Mountains August 1996. Several days thereafter, byhappenstance I noticed this book. In the early pages,Rawlins and his companion, John are skiing with fully loadedpacks on the exact trail. up the Big Sandy Opennings,that I traversed.

Being here does.&quot; He is humble.His words do make undeniable sense."},{"Title":"Sky's Witness: A Year in the Wind River Range","review":"I own six copies of this book (four are loaners). My life revolves around literature, and this is one of the best books I've read. It's definitely my favorite. Rawlins uses relatively simple language with a powerful, poetic effect. If you have any kind of interest in the environment, backcountry travel, or the mountains--and even if you don't--read this book. Rawlins' writing is beautiful and intense; overall, I think the writing carries more impact than even authors such as Ed Abbey or Aldo Leopold.Phrases such as &quot;The cabin is a frozen skull&quot; jump out, as do passages such as this: &quot;At first you're a stranger to the forest. It's too quiet. You feel as if your every move is seen and judged. Then, without noticing a difference, you feel more at home here than anywhere else. It's as if your heart skips a beat and then begins on an older pulse.&quot; If you're not an environmentalist when you start the book, you might begin seeing things in a new light. If you were already concerned about the human impact on the world before you started it, you'll feel it more deeply.Richard Nelson, author and Burroughs Medal winner, might have said it best in his review of &quot;Sky's Witness:&quot; &quot;A very fine writer...as lavish and varied as a jazz musician--lively, funny, sometimes outrageous; poignant, tender, engaging; richly informative; and deeply poetic. Filled with the joys of working on the land, Rawlins documents the subtle wounding of America's remotest wildlands, where rain and snow are tainted by the breath of distant cities.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sky's Witness: A Year in the Wind River Range","review":"Anyone willing to endure the physical hardship involved in self-supported mountain travel will appreciate Rawlin's extrordinarilly beautiful soliloquies on the mountain wilderness experience. Example: &quot;But it wasn't the smell of the air that played in me so much as the light. The moon and sun lay opposite each other in the sky, exchanging their gleams, and the country was laid out below all rough and golden. The ridge was a strong point, the hardest rock in the range. On it you could meet the wind, face it, draw it in and breathe it out. And I felt a desire with no object or reason, except the land and the wild light.&quot;Clearly Rawlin's regards the essence of the mountain wilderness and the essence of himself as one. He writes of the experience of being alone in a small raft on a clear summer night on a high altitude lake in the Wind River Range. &quot;I've touched this water, tasted it. I've caught and eaten its trout, scooped it into pots for coffee, mixed it with my blood, taught it to walk and tell lies, and pissed it back steaming onto the ground. The lake and I have more than a casual acquaintance, yet in the dark, it seems not to know me. I can't see my reflection. The water that has claimed a part of my life now holds me in a star-flecked indifference.&quot;I believe that all mountain travelers grapple with words to express their most intimate feelings about their mountain experiences. Rawlins gives these experiences expression with the skill of a violin virtuoso who is able to prolong the playing of a single note with haunting clarity and seemingly project it into eternity. So also does Rawlins project his love of the Wind River Range to a spiritual level.

Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion (ISAR), a researcher who produces sourcebooks and bibliographic material on topics as diverse as scientology to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, have collaborated to produce an important volume of pieces of Old Catholic history.Melton, a Methodist minister, highlights an issue in the Old Catholic polity in his preface, when talking about most bishops in the OC church:\`[An Old Catholic bishop] lacked any of the real power of a traditional bishop. His worker priests, dependent on neither the bishop nor any congregation for their financial support, proved a most rebellious lot. Unable to discipline them, the bishop was forced to cajole and placate them at every turn or face their abandoning him for any one of a hundred other bishops.'The Old Catholic church as a whole has this as a continuing problem -- no central recognised authority, and no overarching ethos of cooperation and consideration toward fellow Old Catholics. Small movements have begun to spring up in the time since Pruter and Melton's work, but the situation still remains that there are many more bishops who believe autonomy is all-important over ideas of community and cooperation.Part of the value of this book comes from the problem with Old Catholic history in general, spelled out without sugar-coating in the first section:\`We can see the Old Catholic Church, at least in its American phase, as a very new movement. Almost none of its present leadership and very few of its present membership were raised as Old Catholics. They have come to the movement as converts from the Roman Catholic Church or the Protestant Episcopal Church. Overwhelmingly the various jurisdictions which now make up Old Catholicism were formed in the past decade and those that were formed earlier have little substance to their history.'The first section of the book explores the precursors to Old Catholicism, from European and American sources. The Jansenist movement, the See of Utretch, and the uproar over Vatican I set the stage on the European continent, with later activity among the Polish Mariavites. The Oxford Movement, autocephalous orthodox churches and movement of Old Catholicism into England complete much of the historical path for later developments in America.The spread into America came through Vilatte, various Anglican splits such as the Reformed Episcopal Church, Bishop Brown of the Episcopal Church, Carfora, and independent orthodoxy. Pruter and Melton explore these topics before getting into the more varied history of the ethnic churches, which include the Polish National Catholic Church and the African Orthodox Church.Pruter and Melton are very frank about some of the shortcomings of Old Catholicism in its history. One such problem period was the 1960s, when Vatican II pushed many traditionalists out of the Roman Catholic church, and the older ethnic enclaves in America were assimilating, so Old Catholicism no longer had a strong base of support among those communities. Old Catholicism allowed for both traditional Latinists and diverse experimental liturgies, and so attracted a varied group. This did not encourage collegiality.Likewise, the various social movements of the 1960s and 1970s found homes in some Old Catholic jurisdictions; the issues of women's ordination and homosexuality continue to be hot-button debates in Old Catholic jurisdictions, but various bishops issuing pronouncements on one side or the other as sine qua non conditions for communal relationships led to further splintering.Finally, Old Catholicism has had the historical problem of ordaining the 'wrong' people.\`Unfortunately, Old Catholicism, in this process, became a haven for men who had dreams of being a priest or bishop but were entirely unsuitable for the task, or who, in a few cases, wished to use the ministry for exploitive, entreprenurial, or even illegal activities. These later cases have become the scandal of the Movement and have done much to prevent Old Catholicism from attaining much viability at all.'Pruter and Melton develop in some detail the specific jurisdictions and churches under broad headings. Then, the future of Old and Independent Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican jurisdictions is examined here. Whereas these groups seemed to be in decline in the mid-twentieth century, the later part of the century showed a remarkable resurgence. This is occuring at the same time that ecclesiastical authority no longer reigns supreme save in the narrowest of societal bands. Freedom of religion also provides fertile ground for denominational and jurisdictional movement.The authors confess the book is incomplete, as any such book will usually be. This book is perhaps more incomplete than many sourcebooks, because of the difficulty in obtaining original source material, and the trouble with verifying information when it comes from highly biased sources with few relatively objective modifiers for tempering. The original material used in production of this volume is being preserved at the ISAR centre in Evanston, Illinois, and is likely the most complete Old Catholic collection in North America open to the public.Like any good research sourcebook, this sourcebook has an extensive bibliography -- 848 books and primary sources, and 98 periodicals, grouped according to the same pattern as the historical outlines, with introductory annotations. This is a wonderful resource for further research into any Old Catholic topic.The final two sections include a chart of Old Catholic bishops, those resident in North America and those foreign bishops who exercise episcopal oversight for local groups or jurisdictions, and a directory of headquarters and major institutions of most of the Old Catholic jurisdictions in North America. Given the rate of change in Old Catholic circles, both of these sections are largely out of date, and useful as an historical snapshot from the early 1980s, but the usefulness is in doubt.A new edition would be welcome, but is unlikely any time soon."},{"Title":"Finding the God-Dependent Life: A Personal Story of a Life Transformed by the Secret of 'God-Dependence' over Co-Dependence","review":"I found this book by accident one day and read it thoroughly and before I was finished I believed that she wrote it just for me.

He has a very tough kind of intelligence, and a real ability to make works of Literature relate to the world that we live in."},{"Title":"Plausible Prejudices: Essays on American Writing","review":"I love this collection of essays about literature. Some of the sentences in the pieces are as witty and amusing as those found in the author's short stories. Epstein's criticism has teeth. He doesn't give fiction writers and other critics easy praise. The following comments are offered to give the prospective reader a sense of what the volume contains.To begin, Epstein asserts that he has learned nothing reading about three hundred reviews of his books. He notes that John O'Hara was thin-skinned. A reviewer should not show too much generosity. Many great essays started as book reviews. As a young man, through book reviewing, Epstein got his education in public. To a neophyte future biographer, (namely one Joseph Epstein), the life of John Dos Passos seemed to offer everything. The author passed up the opportunity thinking the result would have been bulky but not weighty.Edmund Wilson mined the connection between literature and biography. Literary criticism has been professionalized in the universities. Currently the literary intellectual is disappearing and politics intrudes. The preponderance of American writers now work in universities. There is an overproduction of criticism of contemporary writers.One section of the collection is titled, \`Portraits of Novelists'. Robert Stone is a novelist of the highest ambition. At age fifty John Updike was still at the stage of being promising. All the heroes in Updike sound Updikean. Philip Roth has everything but a generous spirit. Cynthia Ozick is a brilliant and quirky essayist and novelist. She has a sense of artistic vocation. She is an original.Van Wyck Brooks, (this is another section) has literary style. Brooks was successful as a young critic. His later work has been considered a failure. He attacked the founding fathers of modern literature. Edmund Wilson was an uncompromising professional. He was lucky in his teachers, Alfred Rolfe and Christian Gauss. He became the last living link to the 1920's. Epstein deems PATRIOTIC GORE Wilson's best book.Max Perkins became an editorial force when THIS SIDE OF PARADISE, a book and author he championed, became a best-seller. Fitzgerald brought Ring Lardner and Hemingway to Scribners. In the end John Dos Passos was neglected. There were no honors. James Gould Cozzens is a faded literary figure. An essay by Dwight Mcdonald damaged his reputation."},{"Title":"Afraid to ask (Series on what is meaningful in religion)","review":"Timely and thoroughly researched, with enough historical data and information to keep the reader interested in the focus of the work. Very well-written and provides the reader with a full examination of the women's movement and cultural/socio-economic and political obstacles and challenges facing women of every walk of life. Even if you're not a big feminist, you'll enjoy the approachability of this book and how it frames issues facing modern women as they try to balance the realities of aging in a looks based society. Many readers, particularly women, will enjoy the writer's approach to the subject matter as it relates to a growing population of older and, thus, disenfranchised women seeking a sense of community in a society that places value on youth culture, even as it denies the inevitable fate we all face-aging and death. This book handles those intractable facts of life with a dignified intellectual honesty."},{"Title":"Afraid to ask (Series on what is meaningful in religion)","review":"The book, Beauty Bound, written by Rita Freedman is a novel that will not only raise your self esteem, but also help to see life from another point of view. A lot of people can relate to this book because it deals with the number one issue in woman's lives. This issue is the constant obsession with trying to be beautiful and perfect.Beauty Bound gives a variety of real life stores from real women who have had problems with themselves. If you were a woman reading this book, it could really help you get over trying to be beautiful and trying to impress others and make you feel like you're not the only one. It will help you to realize that all the material things and looking like models isn't the only thing that matters in life.This book shows you the reality of all the beautiful woman on TV and in magazines. They aren't as perfect in the pictures and movies as they are in real life. The book makes you realize how dumb it is to care what others think of you when all you really should be doing is caring how you feel about your self.The majority of all women have once in their life faced the issue of wanting to be beautiful. Whether you think you have or not, believe me, you have. The question is why? Why do women everyday spend hours upon hours putting on make up and doing there hair? To impress people that they don't even know? To impress people that they do know and who already love them for who they are? The answers to these questions are in this book."},{"Title":"Shadow Dance (A Canadian pocket book)","review":"This is a very good book.

This is because once I loan it out, I doesn't get returned...

It is a very quick (easy) read, that offers a number of reasons why a person can become bogged down with illness (physical and emotional), and how they can use traditional methods of finding peace and &#34;balance.&#34; As an added treat, the book offers a few herbal ideas for the purpose of helping the reader find balance.The book takes a very positive approach, and does rely upon introspect and self reflection.If you are looking for a book that is traditionally pragmatic and that takes a scientific approach - - this isn't likely the book for you.

This book is about a young detective named Nancy Drew and she comes upon a mystery about a hidden map. Nancy must find this map for sake of a friends family which has lost the other half of the map. Nancy must find clues to lead her to the lost map and then to the barried treasure of her friend's relatives. What I really liked about this book was how it was so suspensful and you never knew what was going to happen. What I didn't really like about this book was that when Nancy was on one of her little journeys the author would not tell everything and it could get confusing. My favorite character was definetly Nancy Drew because she is very clever and positive, and can figure out anything. There is one line in the book which really tells me that Nancy is up for anything, \\"Give me a broom and I'll sweep Doty into jail.\\" This said to me that Nancy is really confident. I do have one question after reading this book, how was Spike (the bad guy) so positive that the treasure map acually led to something? This book is very suspensful. Since you never know what's going to happen next you just never want to put the book down. I really recommend this book because it is very mysterious. It is a great book to read for pleasure."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion/The Quest of the Missing Map (Nancy Drew, Book 18-19) (Nancy Drew 2-in-1)","review":"In this story, Nancy again solves a treacherous mystery. nancy becomes friends with a girl named Elle, who is trying to get a job babysitting a small 7-year old. her only problem is she is scared of the city in which Trixie, the little girl, lives in. Then Ellen tells Nancy about a map that shows treasure left by Ellen's grandfather. Her father has only half the map. His long-lost twin brother has the remaining half. Nancy is anxious to find his brother and the lost map, and find where the treasure is hidden. She finds many clues before she concludes that the second half of the map was right under her nose. While she is trying to get the two maps together, another couple is also trying to steal the maps from Nancy to get to the treasure first. Once again, the wise Nancy Drew outsmarts the thieves and gets the two half maps together. They all go together on a trip to get the treasure. Everything turns out just fine at the end, with Nancy rewarded as a hero.I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was the third Nancy Drew book that I ever read. I like to read mystery and suspense stories where you just can't figure out who the thief would be. It is fun to read the end of mystery stories and finding out who the culprit really was. I have read \\"The Boxcar Children\\" books before and also enjoyed them because of the mystery and suspense. My least favorite part is how in real life suspects are usually smart enough to escape, but in the nancy Drew books, the thief is never smart to get away. However, nancy always completes a mystery fairly making sure the right person is punished. When I first started it, I couldn't put it down. My favorite part in this story was when Nancy and her two best friends Bess and George go to a park to have a picnic. They borrowed a small ship model from a man named Mr. Trumbull in which they believed had the second half of the map. They were being followed by the mysterious couple. When Nancy, Bess, and George got to the park, they put the ship moel in the car, and left the door unlocked on the way to the picnic. That was the couple's chance to take the ship. So they sneaked to the car and stole it. When the three friends were done, they came back to the car only to find out the ship was gone. Nancy laughed at that and said, \\"I took the map with me when we left the car.\\" This was my favorite part because at first I thought, why is Nancy keeping the map in the car when she knows there are thieves after her? nancy wouldn't do anything like that. I loved this book very much and hope you will too."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion/The Quest of the Missing Map (Nancy Drew, Book 18-19) (Nancy Drew 2-in-1)","review":"This review concerns the original 1942 edition and the revised 1969 edition which is an edited version of the original. Nancy becomes involved in the search for the missing half of a treasure map and investigates the mysterious happenings at a cottage on an estate just outside of River Heights. This is a pretty good book; more deserving of 3 1/2 stars. The story is intriguing and well-written. One thing that I like about this story is that there are numerous dishonest people also searching for the missing half of the map and you don't know if they are working together against Nancy or if they are working seperately. This is an enjoyable adventure and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion/The Quest of the Missing Map (Nancy Drew, Book 18-19) (Nancy Drew 2-in-1)","review":"Carolyn Keene has managed to do it again.

This fine book boasts great artwork featuring b/w near realistic drawings with a textured feel and excellent expressions from the well drawn characters.

The scenes are explicit and although geared towards a male audience, they are not likely to offend female readers."},{"Title":"Lethal Arrogance: Human Fallibility and Dangerous Technologies","review":"Dumas has set about to doa little scaremongering and he has been successful. The book was written for mass-market appeal and, as such, he takes on a variety of complex technical systems. In so doing he has ignored the academic work of High Reliability Organizations scholars, who argue that at least some complex organizations do not fail, even under conditions of great uncertainty and stress. This seems to be a dumbed down version of Perrow's classic Normal Accidents, a book that touched off an entire debate about whether large socio-technical organizations are doomed to failure. Dumas is excellent in terms of getting your feet wet in this literature, but he shouldn't be taken as the end of the story. His work on nuclear weapons (broken arrows) is quite good (and scary) but the sections on cults and terrorist groups and mentally unstable technical workers is scholarship lite. The question of risky technology usage is an important one and, for that, the book is a good attempt at consciousness raising, but the Silent Spring of accident literature? I don't think so. It reads like a long magazine article for Maxim or Men's Health -- easy to follow and entertaining, but the academic substance seems to be missing. You might think he wrote the thing in a couple of months. Still, pick it up if you want an introduction to this field and something you can read on the beach at the same time. I'd give it two and a half stars if i could."},{"Title":"Lethal Arrogance: Human Fallibility and Dangerous Technologies","review":"Lethal Arrogance is the &quot;Silent Spring&quot; of the technological realm, particularly with regard to those technologies that can threaten great numbers of humans or property. Where Rachel Carson brought to our attention the potential harm we faced as a result of our polluting ways, Professor Lloyd Dumas cautions us that we also risk great harm due to the way we create and handle dangerous technologies. This book should help awaken us to our extraordinary capability to destroy ourselves, if we're not careful. Lethal Arrogance should not only be on the reading list of every American who is concerned about his or her well-being or that of future generations, but should also be read by every technological expert, politician, and particularly world leader. I think this is one of the most important books pertaining to our security and well-being on this planet since Silent Spring."},{"Title":"Lethal Arrogance: Human Fallibility and Dangerous Technologies","review":"Someone has a used copy for sale here for 91 cents.

All of us had to learn that certain things work, and the bombs that we have built and paid for are the most outstanding example of how much faith we have been willing to invest in whatever works about nine times out of ten. I think I looked down in a hole once that must have been hiding one of the number ten, dud bombs, covered with a little loose dirt so I couldn't see what had made such a round hole going down in that dirt after a B-52 had flown over high in the air. If I tend to believe what this book says a bit more than the usual, highly skeptical reader or reviewer does, it might be because of that, or because I never really got to win a war or even call the shots. I liked the observations of this book about the inverse relationship of complexity and reliability most of all.

It should become evident soon after the opening chapter how complex and laborious the life of a professional horse bettor must be to hold an edge over the betting public. Steve is a genuine winning handicapper himself, and reveals what it takes to win. The percentage of winning bettors at any given track on any given day has been estimated to be 5%. (2% remain the same consistent winners day after day). It takes an immense amount of never ending study to remain financially solvent as a bettor. Steve, as a responsible author points this out.

The revised edition's treatment of pace is good stuff even for those who approach pace more technically like Brohammer. Davidowitz's work on charts and how to use them to find key races and trip overlays is more gold for serious players.Years after I first read this, I have realized how great this book is for horseplayers.

In my opinion, the most valuable part of this book is the chapter dealing with ticket construction. Davidowitz looks at multiple scenarios and outlines sample tickets to go with each. For example, is there a race where you like one or two horses fairly strongly and want to play a trifecta? Davidowitz develops several different strategies for betting in that situation, as well as suggests that appropriate amount of bankroll to be used.If you combine the ideas and methods in this book with those in Crists \\"Exoctic Betting\\", you would have a very fine grasp on wagering strategies.One word of caution, this book is definitely for more advanced players.

On page 106 the author states that the official times of races are basically worthless pieces of information. He undoubtedly means when they are taken in isolation.My studies and two publications on racing indicate that, for at least the championship level horses, linear trends are generally highly predictive of overall performance.

One day I was looking at a book about the Spitfire and had an interesting thought, &quot;How did the sport of air racing help advance aviation during the 1920s and 1930s?&quot; To my knowledge, no book had answered that question before. I began asking around to find a person who could answer the question and perhaps write a book about it. Everyone I spoke to suggested Birch Matthews.Birch was an engineer, an air racing enthusiast, and a complete gentleman. I called him out of the blue and this very nice man listened to my ideas very patiently and then explained in a genial way how my idea was flawed. He pointed out very carefully how my conclusions about the contributions of air racing and their result in fighters like the Spitfire were limited and unclear.When he was finished I was convinced that my book idea was dead, but I also knew that I wanted to come up with a better idea just so I could work with this fascinating man. Little did I know that Birch was just getting started. He saw a kernel of truth in my initial uneducated questions and began researching. Weeks later he called me and said, &quot;I think I've found a way to write your air racing book.&quot; As he explained his ideas I became more and more excited. Eventually we reached an agreement and he began writing. The result is this book.Soon after Birch began working on &quot;Race with the Wind&quot; I left Motorbooks to pursue a different career. He and I lost touch but I continued to anticipate the release of his book and watched for it each month. When it finally appeared I was saddened to learn that Birch had died just a few weeks before it was printed. I never was able to tell him how great his work was and how much I enjoyed the short time that I knew him.If you have any interest in air racing, early aviation history, or the fascinating tale of how humans went from flying motorized box kites to the jet engine in less than 50 years, you will want to purchase and read this book.

This first novel of the series does have the markings of a young novelist, but, in this case, that's more of a positive than a negative. A few aspects of the plot would sound silly if I described them on their own, and I don't think a more experienced author would have gone in those directions, but Coleman makes them work - and I have to give him a few bonus points for audacity in the process. In my perception, there's a youthful air of real energy swirling around the pages of this novel, and it gives the story an identity and character all its own. The Warriors Return is not only interesting and entertaining; it's just plain fun to read.The story centers around a group of teenagers who are recruited to help save another world. These fledgling heroes crave the kind of adventure they can't find in their boring home town, so they've organized an Action and Adventure Club. This year's planned destination is Adventure Island - but the Club members never get that far. Instead, they are maneuvered into a fateful rendezvous with Fantasma, the ruler of Mendala. His planet is in major trouble, as an evil fellow named Davron has discovered the ancient Book of War and is using it to unleash horrible, indestructible monsters on his world. More than Mendala hangs in the balance because Davron's ultimate goal is to secure power over dimensions beyond that planet itself. The only individuals who can hopefully defeat Davron are the ancestors of those who defeated the last evil wizard to exploit the Book of War 10,000 years ago - and these young people are none other than the Earth-bound members of the Action and Adventure Club.Mendala is a rich fantasy world, much like Earth yet quite exotic at the same time. Two forms of magic are in evidence there, as are some wondrous geographic locations such as the tunnels of Glorandor and the cloud-borne Rainbow Mountain with its menagerie of legendary creatures. The most striking creatures of this world, however, are the unnatural beasts unleashed by the Book of War - huge rats, flying pigs, rock soldiers, and assorted slimy and exceedingly dangerous creations borne of darkness.There's a slight snafu in the young heroes' transfer from Earth to Mendala, leaving the club members scattered in both time and place. The majority of this first book in the series consists of the young friends finding one another and coming together for their first frontal assault against Davron and his minions. We learn a lot about the planet, its society, and its system of magic through these varied introductions to this strange new world. While it can be a bit difficult to keep so many characters straight in your head as you're bouncing back and forth between isolated groupings of them, I think the author does an excellent job of telling these mini-stories concurrently, always with a view toward bringing everything (and everyone) together in the end. Each character has a distinct story to tell about his/her experience on Mendala - a few are newly-arrived while others are well-established there already (one of them has even become a king). These individual stories really represent rich and quite interesting reads on their own, but they also effectively set the tone for the group dynamics that come later.The magical qualities of this new world do offer some comparatively easy solutions to major problems, but all of the different talents and skills the heroes draw upon are really diverse and intriguing. The sense of danger is also quite real as the heroes are constantly harassed by infernal creatures and attacked and way-laid on frequent occasions. The big confrontation at the end also plays out well, although it carries the feel of what it is - the first major confrontation between organized forces of good and evil in a storyline that will includes additional volumes.As a fantasy fan, I have to say I was really quite impressed by The Warriors Return, and I look forward to the second installment in the Quest of the Seal Bearers series. Coleman clearly has his own voice in the genre and is not simply re-hashing the same old fantasy quests we've read time and time again. These young characters are real and believable in their thoughts and reactions, and that fact allows the book to engage the reader on a personal level. The fact that the heroes consist of high school teenagers may make the book especially appealing to younger fans of fantasy, but fantasy lovers of all ages should find something to enjoy in The Warriors Return."},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"Dark clouds of doom threaten to engulf Mendala. Some 10,000 years ago, a wicked guardian named Multus opened the Book of War and threatened to plunge that planet into an age of evil. After a cataclysmic battle that narrowly averted disaster, the Book of War was thought lost forever. Now, a new threat rises in the land when a man called Davron recovers the Book of War and once again threatens to overwhelm the world of Mendala and, if all goes well, eventually launch a campaign of conquest that will stretch across all known dimensions. The Fantasma, the highest ranking ruler of Mendala, must flee from his mountain headquarters located at the geographical center of the planet if he is to carry on resistance to Davron's hegemony. Thanks to a message he receives from a servant of Elohim, Mendala's deity, Fantasma learns he must pass through a dimensional rift and locate his planet's saviors on an out of the way place called Earth. He'll need all the help he can muster since Davron knows how to use the Book of War to summon up the nastiest looking beasties imaginable, creatures that are invulnerable to all forms of attack except those from animals.As Davron plots his schemes on Mendala and Fantasma prepares to head to Earth, the Action and Adventure Club is meeting in the town of Greengale in order to plan their next excursion. Consisting of some twenty-one members (!) ranging in age from 15 to 18, the kids in this group are thrill seekers without equal. The leader of the gang is one Jandor Mason, a no nonsense adrenaline hound who founded the group to escape the boredom of his small town. Members of the group consist of males and females from all racial backgrounds, and all of them have different talents and attributes that will help them later once they reach Mendala. We've got a musician, an electronics whiz kid, the shy chick, a bossy gal, and so on and so on. We've also got Veda Guardman, the mother of one member and the authority figure of the group who acts as chaperone on their various adventures around the globe. The Action and Adventure Club's latest trip will take them to the Island of Adventure for some unspecified fun. When their plane goes down on an uncharted island, however, they discover their plans have suddenly changed. Instead of rock climbing, they'll be fighting Davron's minions on Mendala. They'll move through a land full of enchanted creatures, strange peoples, and possess mental and physical powers undreamt of on Earth.\\"Quest of the Seal Bearers\\" is a noble effort in the fantasy genre. I'm not too familiar with these types of books anymore; I've read a few Robert E. Howard books and some things by Terry Brooks years ago, but nothing much lately. I remember the formula pretty well, though: a band of heroic adventurers comes together to battle an evil of unimaginable power. That's essentially what we get here. The trick to these sorts of stories is to use imagination to build upon the stock formula, something author A.W.G. Coleman does well in places. I liked the concept of mental powers (called \\"mentus\\" here) mixed with spoken spells called mandamus. Those utilizing mentus abilities can track people from far away with their minds, while practitioners of mandamus can call up fire, wind, ice, and a host of other physical forms to attack their enemies. A few of the adventures faced by several of the Action and Adventure Club members work well too. A town in Mendala called Acme consists of nothing but cartoon characters and structures. Visitors turn into cartoons as soon as they cross the border, and are told upon entry to avoid \\"looking down\\" at all costs lest they suddenly take a nasty fall off a cliff or similar tall structure just as poor old Wily E. Coyote did in the old Road Runner shows. Funny!The drawbacks to \\"Quest of the Seal Bearers\\" are three in number as far as I can see, although other readers might find a few more. One, the number of characters active in the scope of the narrative boggles the mind. There are simply far too many people to keep track of, especially when they scatter upon their arrival in Mendala. I could follow the important ones--namely Jandor, Ashley, Henry, Tabatha, and the native Mendalians like Davron and Fantasma. These characters are easy because they constitute the most powerful and important players in the saga. Once the book delved into the obstacles faced by the other kids, I started having to flip back to see who was who. A list of characters at the back of the book would easily remedy this difficulty. Two, the pacing of the book dragged in spots. The author would start describing a minor adventure that zipped along quite well, and then fail to maintain the momentum when things calmed down a few pages later. Pacing in \\"Quest of the Seal Bearers\\" started to resemble a gigantic rollercoaster--the reader rides high one minute only to descend rapidly the next. It's a frustrating problem but not an unsolvable one.Three, and finally, the story has no real sense of danger in it. Once these kids arrive in Mendala and receive their powers, every one of them is practically indestructible. Even the weakest member of the group can quickly dispatch Davron's foot soldiers, or if they can't do that someone shows up to rescue them in the nick of time. I think giving the reader a sense that any of these characters, even the most powerful ones, could die at any minute would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the story. People fighting an evil this destructive SHOULD suffer casualties along the way. Perhaps that will happen in future installments. I'll give \\"Quest\\" three stars since I believe the author has the ability to fix these problems."},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"AWG Coleman must be a whirling dervish of a person: his writing spins around like a dirt bike out of control, but at the center of his book are enough good ideas that there must be a fairly solid talent present.Spoiler: this reviewer has a low threshold of tolerance for science fiction, whether that be on the written page or the movie screen or wherever it arises to alter reality. It is not the 'fiction' part or the 'science' part that is off-putting. It is the need to make fantastical things seem real in the context of the story that is problematic.The storyline for QUEST OF THE SEAL BEARERS BOOK is best read in Amazon.com's rather succinct distillation on the title page. Planets against planets and teenagers against villains all swirl in endless names and confusing syntax and that is where the mind wanders. Coleman has passages where his skills as a writer surface and one wishes those pages were less brief and infrequent. This book needs a sense of architecture and an occasional briefing of who is who just to keep things straight. Given that, the next volume in this projected series might be more successful.There is an audience for Coleman's work and it probably includes younger readers, folks who enjoy video games, people who still flock to the latest sci-fi movies (they always seem to do well). So this reviewer is at a mindset disadvantage. But then that mindset also gives the opportunity to be a bit more dissecting in search of the good parts. And rest assured, there ARE good parts to this book. A suggestion - why not make the next book something other than sci-fi?....Grady Harp, September 05"},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"Jandor Mason founded the Action and Adventure Club when he was fifteen.

Coleman) for the new world to explore and new people to meet.Reviewed by Wanda C. Keesey"},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"With the long-lost Book of War, wizard Davron can summon creatures who cannot be killed. He invades the mountain command of the world's leader and sends the legal government into exile, then consolidates his gains. But that world is only the beginning of Davron's plans. Using magical powers, he hopes to expand from one plane of existance to the next, until all of creation is under his control. The Book of War was defeated once before, and the planet leader, Fantasma, knows that he'll have to assemble the descendents of the original warriors who defeated the book thousands of years earlier. But the descendents aren't on the planet at all--instead, they're on Earth.The Action and Adventure Club of Greengale, USA, is planning its big annual adventure. They agree to attend a fantasy-adventure resort, but Fantasma's power sends their plane into a crash landing in an uncharted island. Once there, Fantasma explains his dilemma, including the fact that the Action and Adventure Club contains the descendents of the original heroes. The group is sent to Fantasma's world, but something goes wrong--and they are scattered across both time and space. Gradually, they seek to find one another, facing attacks by Davron's armies and Book of War creatures. Worse, Davron captures one of the members and somehow converts her, making her his wife.Author A. W. G. Coleman has many of the ingredients of a successful story. The fish-out-of-water Earth humans in a magic realm is always popular. The powerful and destructive enemy who is aided by treachery in the good-guy camp generally creates the basis for some interesting adventure. And it's obvious that Coleman has put a lot of thought into his world-building with such fun (if weird) innovations as a place where everyone becomes comics, two incompatible forms of magic power, and thousands of years of history. Coleman's prose is workmanlike enough, not distracting the reader from the story.A few flaws keep QUEST OF THE SEAL BEARERS: THE WARRIORS RETURN from reaching its potential. The large number of club members, with frequent scene changes between them, makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what, or to learn enough about the characters to care about their problems. If Coleman had intended QUEST to fit into the humor class of SF/Fantasy, he needed to push the envelope a little harder and give a few more laugh-out-loud moments. If that wasn't his intent, it's hard to understand why he included some of the settings and action. Then there's excessive good fortune of the school-aged club members, coupled with incompetence on the part of the enemy. It's hard to take the adventure seriously when the enemy is so incompetent.QUEST comes close to being truly enjoyable. It has a lot of positive energy and ideas. Unfortunately, Coleman doesn't quite pull them together into a meaningful whole. Still, QUEST makes a light fun read."},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"A great first book which captures your imagination and keeps you interested all the way through.

It's exciting, funny, dramatic and romantic and I'm not saying all this just because I know the Author;) This is a lovely fanticy book and there is something in it for everyone. Read and Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Quest of the Seal Bearers Book 1: The Warriors Return","review":"Thousands of years ago on the planet Mendala, a tyrant named Multus unleashed a sinister force called the Book of War. Using the power of the book, he was able to create indestructible creatures as soldiers in his army. Multus was defeated, but now the Book of War has resurfaced in the hands of Davron, whose goal is to rule Mendala. Davron unleashes his army and all resistance is futile.On Earth, the teenage members of Greendale's Action and Adventure Club have embarked on their latest outing. Somehow, they are transported to Mendala and discover that they are destined to do battle to defeat Davron's forces and destroy the Book of War. Their adventures take them many places on the planet; they fight many battles and assume many roles. In the end, they are momentarily victorious and unanimously vote to remain on Mendala rather than return to Earth.I found the book to be tedious to read, with several plot devices that I found annoying. The first was the so-called indestructible warriors of Davron's army. It turns out that they are not indestructible, when really necessary, a spell was found that disintegrated them. Secondly, there is a bit of secret agent absurdity. There is a building in Sleuthmore, Mendala with a sign on the door, \\"Top-Secret Headquarters of SAM, Special Agents of Mendala.\\" After a grand entrance through a window by a member of the adventure group, he gets up and announces himself by saying, \\"The name is Bond, Mike Bond.\\" I know that the author was trying to engage in a bit of satire, but in my opinion, it fell flat. Finally, the majority of the spells had the form, \\"Mittius Mandamus ****\\" where \\"****\\" is replaced by the desired action. For example, \\"Mittius Mandamus Sleep\\" was used to put guards to sleep and \\"Mittius Mandamus Fire\\" was used to conjure up a fire. The simplistic nature of the set of spells bored me.The action was also not something that really excited me, although I must confess that I generally do not read fantasy. Generally, I find stories where normal people are suddenly thrust into roles as planet-saving heroes difficult to tolerate, even if they are in the fantasy genre. They can only work if there is at least a brief training period like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Absent that, a teenager suddenly thrust into a situation where they must save a strange planet simply would not live long. These teenagers have no such mentors."},{"Title":"Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS (Technology in Action Series)","review":"The majority of geocachers have learned the ropes of this sport by the old Nike motto: they just did it. They may have gone out on hunts with a few more experienced cachers and picked up some pointers from them. They might have sat around campfires at event caches and traded tips. They also might have spent hours perusing the forums and weighing the advice given there against several large grains of salt, but the journey of a thousand caches always begins with the step of simply finding that first cache. No one has ever picked up a manual and read their way into geocaching. It just isn't done.However, all of us would have to admit there are aspects of this pastime that baffle us. We may come prepared with an extensive knowledge of the outdoors but lack the technical savvy to know exactly how to finesse a GPS. We might come to the game as a gadget geek but admit to getting lost in our own backyards. It would take a lot of searching through web pages and libraries of outdoor guides-not to mention trial and error-to assemble information on the various aspects of this game. Thankfully, there's a much better source.Eric Sherman's Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS is a book that brings the fun of geocaching and the thrill of the hunt together with much needed information about how to stay alive in the woods. Sherman has wisely approached this topic with the realization that geocaching itself isn't all that complicated. Instead he has provided us with a guide to all the little incidentals that can make \\"finding a box in the woods\\" complicated.Most of the time I didn't feel like I was so much reading a book about geocaching, as I was reading a book about the outdoors from a geocacher's perspective. From map reading to shooting a baring with a compass to picking out the perfect hiking boots, Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS fills us in on all the other stuff that wouldn't have been in our GPS manuals, even if we had bothered to read them.When it does come to information directly related to placing and finding caches, Sherman writes with the savvy of someone who's been there. Many of his points are punctuated with personal stories that almost any cacher can relate to and laugh about. Photos from the wild and websites are plentiful and give even the newest of newbies enough background to understand exactly what this game is all about.Aside from being an active geocacher himself, Sherman could not have chosen a better technical editor than Kelly Markwell, a man who's name is synonymous with knowledge about geocaching. This is truly a book about geocaching by geocachers.Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS will make a welcome addition to your collection of field guides and outdoor literature. Finally having all this information in one resource makes it well worth its very affordable price."},{"Title":"Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS (Technology in Action Series)","review":"As someone just starting geocaching, I found Erik Sherman's book to be a fair introduction. The meat of the book is found in chapters 6 and 7, \\"On the Hunt\\" and \\"In Hiding\\". The tips and tricks discussed show the thoughts of an experienced geocacher. The specifics in earlier chapters such as how to fold a map are simple and very useful. The instructions on how to use a compass were limited and could use some specific examples. Chapter 5, \\"A Good Walk\\", could be useful for someone with no experience with the outdoors, but are of limited value for someone with experience. The photos that are included may date the book quickly."},{"Title":"Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS (Technology in Action Series)","review":"I've been intrigued by geocaching since I got my new GPS withgeocaching features and being an avid hiker; I've always been looking for ways to enhance my hiking experience.

Sherman goes into the basics of geocaching including the types of events you may be likely to participate in, but goes into some good technical detail of GPS and compass theory. Although I'm quite up on my outdoor equipment, he goes into good explanation of the types of equipment and how to use it. Next there is explanation of various techniques and tips for geocaching. I'm impressed with his constant consideration of the environment and how the sport (or hobby) should be environmentally friendly. Throughout the book there are countless references to internet and resources in print. Reading this book I now have enough foundation and curiosity to go out and try my first geocaching event this spring.

And fun is exactly what you'll have when you try geocaching. It's a high-tech treasure-seeking game that uses the Global Positioning System (GPS).Because geocaching combines the outdoors, puzzles, and adventure, everyone-from kids to kayakers, and retirees to rock climbers-can easily become involved. You'll join a rapidly expanding worldwide network of people who hide containers of \\"prizes\\" in the wilderness, suburbs, and even in the middle of cities, then provide clues for others to discover them.Borrowing from the classic pursuits of orienteering and letterboxing, geocaching can be as easy as a walk in the park or as challenging as scuba diving to a hundred feet. You don't need to be an expert in electronics, navigation, or even hiking to start. With this book, you'll soon understand GPS technology, know how to find your way about, and be able to prepare for your next hike-and-seek adventure!Author Sherman has dedicated this super book to all the people who realize that a technology developed for the military can be used peacefully when you are hiking a million miles from your nearest worldly care. This is one of the most useful books available to support the interests of the countless thousands of geocachers that criss-cross the globe finding and leaving their caches for others.Kudos to Apress for publishing this fascinating book that reveals the ever-expanding world of geocaching.

Sherman gives tips on how to best equip yourself, aside of course from that GPS. These are mostly traditional common sense guidelines for anyone hiking.One thing you can get from the book is that aside from the geocaching, nowadays pure hiking has changed. Many hikers bring along GPS for safety and convenience. Some traditionalists look with askance on this, however.Readers might recall how GPS was originally developed by the US military, and when GPS devices were heavy and expensive.

A large body of work now exists on the theme of social capital. Alexis de Tocqueville is cited as remarking on the civic associations of America in the 1800s. More recently the concept of social capital, if not the exact words, were reported by Edward Banfield in The Moral Basis of a Backward Society (Banfield, 1958). Banfield's book was a study on a poor village in Southern Italy and explored the reasons for the low level of development there. Banfield surmised that the fundamental reason for the village's low level of development was the incapacity of local residents to work together. The term social capital was first used in the 1980s by Pierre Bourdieu and James Coleman, though Coleman received credit for establishing the analytical framework of social capital in his exploration of education (Bourdieu, 1986 and Coleman, 1988). Coleman's work has served as a theoretical framework for studies in education and social capital through to the present."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"This book is very relevant to the question of the effect of culture on development. I have lived half my life in an Anglo culture, and the other half in a Latin culture- very similar to that of Southern Italy. I can absolutely assert that the findings in this book are a true description of 'amoral familism' and the effects on a society. As for a previous reviewer, I suggest he actually live in Southern Italy (or a similar culture) before he omits an opinion that is based on a limited, provincial experience of only living in the US (or a anglo culture). Anyone who has experienced -truly experienced- an anglo and a latin culture will agree with the conclusions drawn by the author."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"Ed Banfield must have been about 42 when this book was published, yet it has a young man's astonishment and a young man's anger. Shrewd and observant as he was, he seems not to have realized what the world could be like until he settled down here in what was then (as, indeed, now) one of the poorest parts of Italy. It shocked him, as indeed it might have, for any number of reasons. But Banfield focused on just one: \\"the inability of the villagers to act together for their common good or, indeed, for any end transcending the immediate, material interest of the nuclear family.\\" Until then, Banfield had been (he would surely hate this characterization) an American innocent-one thinks of the Ugly American in Graham Greene's novel, all good intentions and unintentional mischief. The difference is, of course, that Banfield did not remain an innocent: with his unflinching clarity of vision, and his shrewd capacity for synthesis, he used this inquiry to launch himself into one of the most important careers in political science in the 20th Century.In hindsight, one may be tempted to say that he could have known better. He does quote from \\"Christ Stopped at Eboli,\\" by Carlo Levi. But in addition to Levi, others had seen what Banfield came to see: one thinks of Verga or Silone (one is tempted to add Sciascia, but most of his work came later). Indeed, closer to home, he might have learnd from Norman Lewis' great \\"Naples '44.\\"But this, as I concede, is hindsight. The fact is that you can't think of any other American scholar of his generation in his time who approached this kind of problem in this kind of way.Banfield's encounter with Montegrano clearly informs his later work: his studies of Richard Daley's Chicago and his later, more general work on city politics and on government in general. Superficially, this may appear paradoxical. In Montegrano, Banfield lamented the curse of \\"amoral familism.\\" This might seem to suggest a distrust of families, and a hospitality to government participation (\\"It takes a village...\\"). Yet Daley's Chicago is a community of families and his later work shows a distrust of government that borders on truculence.The paradox is, of course, quite superficial. Daley's Chicago is a community of families, but a community with a vibrant public life. And it is the very corruption of government in a place like Montegrano that adds such plausibility to Banfield's later critique. One thinks of James C. Scott and his admirable \\"Seeing Like a State\\".There is another and wholly different virtue of Banfield's work that deserves mention. This is his use of scholarly apparatus. The blurb on my old Basic Books copy says mentions (appreciatively) his \\"use of T.A.T. materials\\" along with \\"intensive standardized fieldwork Neo-Freudian psychology, and structural-functional analysis.\\" Even the concept of \\"amoral familism\\" bears the smell of the lamp. It is all bound to send the alert reader fleeing to the new Harry Potter. A critical mistake: Banfield not only survives all the academic detritus, he positively transcends it: he is one of the few who can make this kind of analytical structure produce something plausible and interesting.Footnote: for further background on Banfield, there is a wonderful appreciation by his sometimes co-author, James Q. Wilson, in The Public Interest for Winter 2003. Google \\"Banfield Wilson Public Interest moral basis\\" and it ought to be the first hit."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"The point in Banfields' book is not that cultural backwardness explains evry asset of economic growth. The point is that culture is an important part of the explanation. Because of Karl Marx's historical (technological) determinism this important part has been left out. Max Weber wrote about the same ideas as Banfield in The Protestant Work Ethic (1905). Their ideas can now be tested with new statistical techniques proving that culture has strong independent explanatory power relative to policies, institutions or geographical factors. Beliefs and Values in society that creates trust, savings, hard work and entrepreneurship is crucial to economic growth, more so than any other factors. Please read Marini (2004), Tabellini (2005) and Guiso (2006) for good summaries of recent research."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"Edward Banfield's reputation was built on the basis of this book and the research that informed it. While I am confident that he added significant value in his work and writing subsequent to this effort, I am equally confident that in the minds of most of Banfield's fans, at least those with whom I have discussed this book, he was defined by this work. The Moral Basis of a Backward Society is an exceptionally powerful ethnography describing what happens when there is no \\"community\\" even in what is described and thought of as a community, as in the village that serves as the backdrop for this book. Outstanding lessons are observable in this work that are transferable to our current society. When we decide we will work together, there are few limits to what we can accomplish. When we fail to do that, all of us, and the community spirit suffers."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"For those of us that wish to look at the foundations of the case study, Banfield's book is a good start. The only problem is his definition of what constitutes a backwards scoiety. His work was new and intruiging, but it explains the human nature without addressing human nature. By nature, humans are selfish. In the case of an isolated village, the people of Montegrano were not backwards. Instead they were doing what was necessary to survive. They did not organize for the greater good of society because they were too busy searching for food for that day and the next. That does not seem backwards. That seems like survival of the fittest,to use a tired cliche. Whenever examining a case study, we need to be sure that we do not generalize the subject."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"Banfield's &quot;amoral familism&quot; is a convenient way to explain away poverty, but it's a little too convenient. He wants to explain the poverty in Southern Italy, but he never looks at the historical, geographical, environmental or other factors that contribute to this poverty. Where is the discussion of the malaria epidemics that prevented this region from developing sea trade (people who lived by the coasts died from malaria a lot, thus preventing the development of a significant maritime economy)? Similarly, he doesn't like to examine Calabria's geographical isolation from the rest of Europe (all the way at the end of a peninsula) and the fact that there weren't very many roads leading into that place until the 1930s. What about the fact that the allies bombed the hell out of this place a mere decade before this &quot;research&quot; and relatively little of the Marshal plan assistance ended up going there? He also neglects to consider the other invading armies that had visited this place before Mr. Banfield (the Austrians, the Spanish, the French, the Normans, etc.), some of which were still in living memory at the time, as Calabria was on the front line of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Italy during WWI. How is a region supposed to develop economically when a different army sweeps through every generation, and there is no practical way to trade in large quantities with the rest of the world without malaria epidemics and in the absence highways and trains to carry goods? Any kind of sensitive treatment of this subject matter would look at these and other factors, and not just dismiss them as &quot;excuses.&quot; Banfield's &quot;amoral familism&quot; is a convenient way to explain away poverty, but it's a little too convenient. Having spent time in Calabria, I am impressed with how far these people have come since the WWII and the crippling poverty that ensued afterwards. This area is still far from well off, but all the progress that a stroll down Corso Mazzini (a major shopping and business district) would make obvious flies in the face of Banfield's &quot;science.&quot; In order to support his feelings about the poor, Banfield neglects a host of factors that any sensitive review of this region would make obvious."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"This book's main contribution is in the definition of &quot;amoral familism&quot;: the well established primitive behaviour of human beings (present in different extent in any social structures) which may be expressed as the primitive &quot;clan law&quot; that any person should be faithfull to the other members of his/her clan/family independently on how these other members behave. However, the book does not add much contribution to the understanding of the REASONS for the different speeds of development (or even for the cases of social &quot;regression&quot;) of many regions in the western coutries. In particular, this book is totally silent as to the nature of the &quot;civilizing&quot; force which overruns the more primitive associative scheme represented by the &quot;amoral familism&quot;.To concentrate, as the author of this book does, only onto the primitive clan obedience, means, for instance, that even the american &quot;Far-west&quot; communities in the 1800's, or even the Al Capone ruling of Chigago could be ascribed simply to &quot;amoral familism&quot;!!!.This book is totally silent as to the factors that in the history of the richer regions have overturned the primitive associative organization in familar clans into larger social indentity. Is the absence of these factors the real cause of any undeveloped or even regressed society.In particular, this book does not recognise the basic fact that the more &quot;the law&quot; is applied in the same way for everybody (i.e. the more a society is ruled by the law) the more any citizen may recognise himself as a part of the larger social structure rather than searching for protection in the familiar clan. In the most developed societies the leading classes have been (and must constantly be) OBLIGED to follow the &quot;law&quot;, in many cases in consequence of revolutions and/or of the constant pressure of the middle classes and in general of anybody who have understood that the more the &quot;law&quot; is ruling a state the richer the entire society is.In many undeveloped regions the ruling of the law has not yet been realized and the leading classes may still abuse the &quot;law&quot; for their short term economical interesses, thereby preventing the overall economical developement as well as the growth of a &quot;social&quot; coscience.I think that the author of this book has not asked to himself how many americans would regress to &quot;amoral familism&quot; if e.g. the us courts would constantly refuse to enforce the law for the favour of large companies or certain leading social groups (e.g.the wasp americans).Accordingly, he has not investigated the reasons why e.g. some regions have a very corrupted state administration, why some ways of providing international charity have only resulted in an even more corrupted administration, etc... The only message in this book is: the less developed regions have a less developed &quot;social&quot; attitude. This book however does not even recognise that the fact that the &quot;amoral familism&quot; remains (or become again) the leading social ruling is the EFFECT and not the cause of the undevelopment."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"The general question Banfield is attempting to answer in this book is \\"what accounts for the political incapacity of the village?\\" His approach to answering his research question is the case study, an in-depth study of the village of Montegrano, Italy. Within the village, he finds that there is a complete lack of what most Westerners would call a \\"civic-\\" or \\"public-spirit.\\" It is this deficiency that interests Banfield and drives his research. His main argument is that Montegranians have developed a social system of \\"amoral familism,\\" in which all actions are carried out for the benefit of the individual and their immediate family. Others in the community (including the church, the poor, orphans, etc.) are neglected as a result. Interestingly, what Banfield is describing seems to be a public goods problem. But instead of using a rational-actor explanation, he suggests that it is the culture of the Montegranians that leads to their sub-optimal social conditions. Yet he explicitly states the free-rider problem (perhaps without realizing it?): \\"In a society of amoral familists, no one will further the interest of the group or community except as it is to his private advantage to do so,\\" (pg. 85). Doesn't this phenomena bear a more general cultural and social application? It is interesting that Banfield would choose to call this a \\"cultural\\" explanation when this seems to be an individual rational calculation, no matter what culture one inhabits. All in all, I did not find the arguments put forth by Banfield to be very convincing. His \\"syndrome\\" of amoral familism could be much more easily be explained in terms of the rational behavior of individuals, rather than attributing it to the mystic influence of culture. His approach to this study is interesting, but obviously could bear some updating."},{"Title":"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society","review":"This book is anti-Italian racist garbage.

Prechtel and Bly's collaboration on this wonderful insight into the soul of the Mayan people is so much more useful than an anthropological study of the Maya. Prechtel's perspective is that of an insider and reading this book is like reading primary source material. I doubt there is a comparable work available (at least not among the books and articles I have read). From Prechtel's mentor Chiv to his vivid descriptions of Mayan folklore, there is a thread binding the observations in this book that made the reading of it a real and emotional experience. I lived in Guatemala for 2 years as a child and for me reading this book was also a reminder of myself. Far from a dry, rigid, academic piece, The Secrets of the Talking Jaguar is for everyone with an interest in Guatemala, the Maya, justice and spirituality. Thank you Martin Prechtel."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Having traveled to Guatemala 5 times, and having lectured on the devastating civil war that caused untold economic hardship, destruction of cultural identity and hundreds of thousands of dead and disappeared, I read Martin Prechtel's book with interest. I have visited Santiago Atitlan 3 times, once with students, and felt I had a small grasp of the religious practices. But I was wrong. Prechtel's account of his life with the shaman and the spiritual hierarchy of the village is an incredible revelation. The Maya tendency to keep their important beliefs secret, was much deeper and more significant to their culture than I could have guessed. Reading this book is a fascinating and up to now unavailable look at a culture that sees itself as an integral, unseparable part of nature and the universe. The connectedness experienced by the atitecos is something that we in our materialistic, compartmentalized culture have lost, or perhaps never have had. Prechtel offers us the chance to glimpse the underpinnings of the Maya belief system. His writing, that once in while seems overly flowerly, sets the scene to guide us into this magical world. His fascination with his own learning there does not lead him to idealize these indigenous people. There are sharp doses of reality in this book; of diseases and death, and hunger and feuds. To gain an amazing perspective into the lives of a fascinating people, I highly recommend Secrets of the Talking Jaguar."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"I'm astonished that this book is not better known.

Perhaps most remarkable is the luminous eloquence of Prechtel's language -- the book is written in a style that carries something of the flavor of the indigenous oral tradition, a style worthy of the reverence accorded by most oral peoples to the beauty of living language. That so many experiences and insights rooted in indigenous, participatory, oral modes of awareness managed to be translated onto the written page, without losing their ancestral wildness, is something of a wonder.

Please, do not judge a book by its cover or a shaman by his skin. At least read the book's intro by Robert Bly and what he says about &quot;Secrets of the Talking Jaguar.&quot;SHAMANS: &quot;The Mayans call shamans &quot;spirit-lawyers,&quot; that is, men or women who go to the spirits and try to argue them into giving a benefit of some sort to human beings. Mayan tradition does not teach that the Gods want people to be sinless or perfect, but to believe that the Gods love beauty, eloquence, fine clothes, great music, fine poems, bravery, high animal spirits, and gratitude.&quot;TONGUES LIKE PUPPIES: &quot;At conferences I've seen men and women weep when Martin Prechtel talks of the complex and rich village life of the Maya. The listeners realize how much more open their lives in youth would have been if their beauty had been honored as the young ones are honored in Santiago Atitlan, and if they'd had a chance to be kissed by the invisible faces &quot;'with tongues like puppies.'&quot; They also weep when they realize how men and women, though they speak separate languages, can fly together like the two wings of a bird.&quot;INDIGENOUS SOUL &quot; . . . If we can be quiet, this book will be a bucket that drops down toward the water of our indigenous soul. All the words that Martin writes here amount to a meditation on this soul as a natural force. Whether we are Swiss or Mayan or American, the indigenous soul, threatened all over the globe, still lives inside each of us. We can rejoice in its abundance, its ingenuity, its determination not only to exist but also to continue giving its gifts, if we will turn and meet it.&quot;Bly says it all. You will experience a &quot;Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul&quot; no matter what your ethnic background or skin color. The indigenous soul is within all of us.

It's a look at the Mayan culture as never revealed before and is told in a way that will keep you involved and entertained as you become enlightened by Martin Pretchel's remarkable story. It's an incredible journey, one you may not want to end.Pretchel's own journeys of travel and self-discovery are the basis for the first part of the story. He'll keep you smiling(and maybe even chuckling out loud sometimes) with his wonderful sense of humor, as he describes his wanderings and the fantastick encounters along the way. He is down on his luck when out of the blue he is \\"found\\" by an old Shaman who tells him it's about time he arrived. The Shaman takes him to a remote Guatamalan village, that is not yet ravaged by modern civilazation. It becomes the home he has been searching for, the people he felt he belonged to, and while training to be the next Shaman of the village, learns the wonders of a deeply rich and rewarding life. The ways of the villagers may seem primitave, but everything they do and believe in has great meaning,and is never self-serving. Their sense of the earth and everything connected with nature is incredibly intuitive and complex. Pretchel's, vivid descriptions of the ceremonies, the costumes, the land and even the food will bring wonderful pictures of this world to your mind.The detalied description of his training to become a Shaman are amazing and adventurous.This book was a wonderful journey to the \\"heart of the indigenous soul\\". It's a precious history of an important culture, that had to give way to the modern world. I could hardly put it down and wanted to start it over the minute I finished it.

This is not! The writer is very easy to follow, interesting and informative. If you have been having troubles with finding good shamanic studies, this will help a great deal. He explains rituals, calenders, herbs, concepts, and the mixing of Catholic religion into the shaman's beliefs. The details are colorfully written so it was hard for me to put the book down. I will admit the calender section was a bit hard to follow - but it's such a complicated subject that I think the author did the best anyone could have with explaining it. At least he was able to give the reader a good understanding in the end. When most authors try to tackle the subject they leave us thinking &quot;huh?&quot; but this book gets you to an understanding without getting you lost.

Humorous, yet poetic at times, the writer has a gift to share, and he does so with incredible dexterity. The insights into how the Maya lived within nature, their social heirarchy, inside jokes, love of life, and slow victimization by 20th (and 21st) century power-mongers make this account a valuable resource for all human beings.Interestingly, the Mayan calendar, put forth centuries ago, ends within this decade, fodder for Armegeddon-theorists in the last half century. Prechtel's book helps to explain how this happened before his eyes and the role he has come to play in keeping the soul of the Maya alive.This should be a must-read for anthropologists, linguists, spiritualists, environmentalists, economists, missionaries of all faiths, travellers, and policy makers.

The story starts out slowly, and includes a lot of detail about village life in \\"aborignal\\" America that may not particularly be of interest to one who wants to get on with the shamanism, but it shows the level of detail you'll get when he actually does. This is not Castaneda, which is to say it's not a come-on or a gimmick to sell books. The Mayans were/are one of the more profound groups on the planet, and Martin does a good job of getting you inside their heads. If you're up for a real experience, this book is for you.

I think he is right in saying we have all lost something valuable. Ways of living that can probabaly never truly be recaptured.However, having looked up the author on the net, he seems heavily into the &quot;new age&quot; speeking circut today, despite all he was taught when he was younger.

Yet, Prechtel makes a really solid case for Beauty breaking the Glass Ceiling to the Gods: Beauty in the ornate ancient eloquence of their speech (often expressed in food terms of deliciousness and \\"cooking\\"); Beauty in their many layers of opulent, intricate clothing; and yes, Beauty in being drunk out of their gourds from having made themselves irresistibly delicious to the Gods during an income-leveling, life-renewing, inner-twin calling, Desire-Fest with the Gods.Other than having to walk two miles with no shoes to fill a tank with water before going to school, it makes me Wanna Be Maya.

This memoir reads like great fiction, and it arouses in me a deep knowing and satisfaction in life.Prechtel has a series of dreams that spur him to leave the reservation where he grew up in New Mexico. He sets out on a journey that takes him through the Americas where, after a series of synchronistic events, he finds his way to a Guatamalan village, Santiago Atitlan. He recognizes parts of the village from the dreams years before. Upon arrival, he is tackled to the groud by an elder shaman who exclaims \\"You're late!\\" And thus Prechtel's apprenticeship begins.Prechtel's writing is clear, vivid, and evokes so much beauty and imagination. His story is one of spirit finding its home and the heartache of being torn away from it in revolution; it is of the wonder and subtlety that is immanent in all of life; it is of the messages that can be found wherever they are sought with openess and courage.From an anthropological standpoint, I found the book to be a priceless testament to a culture that has been forever changed. Prechtel writes as a member of the community, leaving for the world an invaluable chronicle from a pivotal time in history. From a philosophical standpoint, I found the book rich with meaning, multi-layered and complex. Spiritually, it gives comfort and satisfaction to the deepest parts of me and leaves an imprint long after the book is finished.What are you waiting for?

Readers, interested in shamanism will find many gems... such as description of methods used for \\"stalking\\", cultivating the awareness with which one can track, and call to oneself, animals. One gets to marvel at the multi-dimensional properties of the Mayan language, with its different layers reserved for properly initiated youths, adults, elders and shamans - a language, where meaning is deeply embedded into the invisible landscape of spiritual forces which have shaped the history of the Tzutujil. Atitlan is a place, where those forces are still alive, because they are fed by constant acknowledgement based on gratitude and fear and, especially, beauty. The spirits are fed by beauty, says Prechtel, and by grounding our lives in the awareness of beauty surrounding us we support the benevolent unfolding of the universe. With the aid of this book one also gets to understand the importance of the ancestors and the importance of community for the Maya.Prechtel is also very poignant in describing the revolting habit of X-ian \\"missionaries\\" who are bent on destroying precious and age old connections between indigenous cultures and their environment.

And who would make such a claim? Once again the title of the book provides the answer: a &quot;Mayan&quot; shaman. Later on, however, the book states that the author, Martin Prechtel is not really Mayan, but that he is half Huron. It says that he lived for thirteen years in a Mayan village, where he was eventually elected &quot;chief&quot; of the &quot;tribe&quot;.Given these claims and promises I was astounded to see at a recent book signing that the author is a fair haired and light skinned Caucasian. All of his Indian garb could not hide the fact that this guy is simply not an Indian. As a Native American I was angry. I had to conclude that far from being an account of the &quot;indigenous soul&quot; this book was just a rip-off of Indian culture for the author's personal enrichment, along the lines of another favorite of Native Americans, Beverly Hills &quot;shaman&quot; Lynn Andrews. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the author is a cohort of Andrews, her book &quot;Jaguar Woman&quot; being dedicated to him and having one of his paintings on the cover.If the authors claims about being a Mayan/Indian are imaginations it must be asked how much of the rest of this book can be trusted? I am not familiar enough with Mr. Prechtel or Mayan culture to say for sure and will defer to the experts to decide. However, the author himself gives certain clues. For instance, the dust jacket of another of his books &quot;Scandals in the House of Birds&quot;, notes that he did not go to Guatemala until 1976. From that book it seems as if he was back living in the US by the early 1980s. He apparently was in &quot;his Mayan village&quot; far less than the thirteen years stated in &quot;Secrets of the Talking Jaguar.&quot; Also, according to all the books that I have seen, the Mayans have neither &quot;chiefs&quot; nor &quot;tribes&quot;. The author's insinuation that he is the reincarnation of a Mayan lord only casts further doubt on the book.In conclusion, given the above &quot;inconsistencies&quot; that I found doing only about an hour of research, I must suspect that &quot;Secrets of the Talking Jaguar&quot; may be another fictional (dare I say fraudulent) account, ala Carlos Castaneda's stuff. In any case, it certainly contains critical factual problems. Equally certain is that it grossly exploits Native Americans, in the manner of Lynn Andrews' writings.Betty Ortiz"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar is the story of the author's physical and spiritual journey from the southwestern US to the highlands of central America. There he becomes apprenticed to a local shaman who teaches Pretchel much about indigenous Mayan life, and about life in general.Pretchel writes that we are all part of our indigenous, pre-industrial, &quot;primitive&quot; past, we only have to search to find our roots, as he has done. The story of his awakening awareness of the natural world around us to me was more interesting. Pretchel points out that something valuable has been lost though our lack of deep cultural and familial ties to the physical world. After reading this book, I am convinced he is right.The book is an easy read, and while a little slow at first, it rapidly becomes more interesting as Pretchel becomes increasingly aware of his ties to the natural world, thanks to the assistance of his Mayan mentor, a shaman. As in life, the joy of this book is not so much in the ending, as in the journey itself."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"I give this book as a gift to everyone I know who has read Marlo Morgan's appalling book of lies about the Australian aborigines. Here is a story that actually HAPPENED, has none of the racial arrogance of many \\"new age\\" books where some rich whitey goes off and lives \\"with\\" the natives and grants them recognition. (Morgan's 'Mutant Message Downunder\\" has made +100 million, even though the woman made the whole thing up, stole a whole lot of religious symbols out of some anthropology journal that shouldn't have published them in the first place, stole the end sequence from a film called \\"Quigley Downunder\\", wrote absolutely absurd and stupid things about the Australian landscape and when the real aborigines demanded that she stop spreading lies and saying they want to die out and are no longer real aborigines, and to stop pretending she is the true guardian of their culture, she admitted the fraud, but her publishers sheltered her and told her to keep going.)Prechtel's mother was a native american, and he suffered being brought up on a reservation. This book is a solid dose of reality, not sugarcoated with esoteric fantasy, but full of reality. Grief and beauty are in western culture (he says) seen as a side show attraction, but actually they are the right and left hand of the goddess of life.It is really one of the most beautiful books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Open your mind and heart, and you will learn interesting and wonder-ful things about the Mayan culture and beliefs.

Martin Prechtel is an honest mystic, and the story of how he almost accidentally became a shaman among the Maya people in the Guatemalen village of Santiago Atitlan as it was about three decades ago is inherently interesting. As a dear friend pointed out, the book also has the power to encourage anyone feeling as rootless as Prechtel once did.What surprised me -- and might surprise even Prechtel -- is how much traditional Mayan reverence for the power of words (both spoken and sung) dovetails with theology that Prechtel explicitly rejects in following the shaman path, not so much because that theology itself is or was flawed, but because a traditionalist Mayan shaman welcomed him into village life. The Mayan cosmology described here is often at odds with Christianity, as pantheism must everywhere be, yet shamans who put aside distaste for the cultural heavyhandedness of Christian missionaries would -- one expects -- be among the first to grasp the implications of calling Jesus \\"the Word made flesh,\\" for example. Similarly, anyone with a smattering of theological education will see parallels between the bundles used by shamans and the \\"sacramentals\\" that serve a similar purpose in Catholic theology.Prechtel went native to such an extent that readers can be forgiven the impression that the only good thing to come from European contact with the Mayan people back in the day was that Spanish conquistadors outlawed human sacrifice, but Prechtel seems ambivalent about even that. In spite of a few kind words for a Maryknoll priest serving in the same village, Prechtel also makes the mistake of associating all of Christianity with the so-called \\"prosperity gospel\\" preached by people like Joel Osteen.Nevertheless, those are quibbles. Notwithstanding its hard-earned bias, the book also has redemptive insights scattered throughout. \\"Spiritual amnesia was the price of human cleverness,\\" Prechtel writes, and later, \\"True creativity doesn't just make things; it feeds what feeds life. In modern culture where people are no longer initiated, the spirit goes unfed. To be seen, the uninitiated create insane things, some destructive to life, to feel visible and powerful. These creations are touted as the real world. They are actually forms of untutored grief signaling a longing for the true reality of village togetherness.\\"Readers like me find in statements like that an echo of Augustine of Hippo's famous \\"You have made us for yourself, O Lord; our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee.\\" That's not to say that all religions are the same -- they manifestly are not -- but this modern-day Mayan shaman has written something even non-Mayans can learn from."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Really nice read. It is the kind of book you pick up and read straight through or just in bits and pieces. Good flow... interesting and thought provoking.

Or, perhaps it is... to evolve your thought processes."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"This is easily my favorite book of all time.

I have met the author, spent some time with him, and read about (and discussed with him) his background and it is obvious that he is quite authentic. Reviewer B. Ortiz (see below) has formed a very set and narrow opinion of Prechtel based on the most superficial judgements and &quot;research.&quot; It is really unfortunate that she didn't take the time to check her &quot;facts&quot; before she attacked Prechtel. I suggest that you read the book, research Prechtel if you want to, go meet him if you can, and be prepared for a potentially life-changing experience."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"A treasured gift from a culture exploited and destroyed by the Western/Modern world. Martin Prechtel blesses and honors us by telling his story and those of his people. As he writes, &quot;Possibly my own story will give your stories courage enough to blossom&quot;. This book reminds us of the importance of retrieving and feeding the indigenous soul that lives within each of us.This is not some fabricated tale or fictionalized story of a spiritual journey. This is an authentic, first-hand account told straight from the author's heart. Those with a true interest in shamanism and spiritual healing will cherish this book. The ancient wisdom contained in its pages are a valuable resource that I will refer to often and share with those around me."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Secrets of the Talking JaguarMartin PrechtelThis book is of a certain narrow genre. That genre may have a name, but I'm going to have to just try to describe it: The writer has one foot in each of two very different cultures. He writes to describe, explain, present one of these cultures to members of the other one. There are a lot of ways for cultures to be different, and I happen to think that the gulf between neolithic/indigenous worldviews and the \\"Western\\" world of the 21st century is about as wide as they come.Martin Prechtel got a head start. Son of a native-American woman and a Euro-American father, he grew up on a New Mexico reservation and came of age with a deep resistance to the authorities' forceful repression of all things \\"Indian\\". At 21, with doors closed to him in New Mexico, the young man headed south, eventually coming to rest in Guatemala, where a village shaman asked, what took you so long?Secrets is the story of many years apprenticed to this elder. Prechtel has both the will to live this path, and the words to take us along. His descriptions are deep. Plenty about what's going on in everyday life; and plenty about the non-ordinary dimensions he encounters...also every day. We found Secrets on the reading shelf in a little caf&eacute; in Peru. We kept going back, partly for the food but also to read another chapter.Eliade tells us the Siberian term \\"shaman\\" meant something like \\"one who dreams/journeys in service to the community.\\" There are a lot of books that purport to be about shamanism. What few really communicate is the way this role is integrated in the community. Prechtel gives us that piece. He is not an anthropologist working on his dissertation. Both he and the villagers believed he was one of them, returned home. There are plenty of hair-raising tales, plenty of conscious awakenings; but the unique gift is the genuine reporting from inside the native culture - with an awareness-by-birth of the conscious milieu of the reader, us.Robert Bly has written the Foreword to Secrets of the Talking Jaguar. He says, \\"This book will be a bucket that drops down toward the water of our indigenous soul. All the words that Martin writes here amount to a meditation on this soul as a natural force...(which) still lives inside each of us. We can rejoice in its abundance, its ingenuity, its determination not only to exist but to continue giving its gifts, if we will turn and meet it.\\""},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"Prechtel's journey into the heart of the Mayan culture makes for an interesting and informative read, though it would be a mistake to think (as one reviewer did) that this is the equivelant of a shamanic studies course. It is one man's experience of one aspect of an ancient shamanic culture (the Mayan culture) that has and continues to be diluted (one might even say poisoned) by the unconscious expansion of other cultures. But it is more than a memoir, as the author offers some important observations about the state of our planet and the nature of humanity. I would not get hung up on the idea of magic, gods, or Martin as a shaman, but rather enjoy beauty of the writing and the gift of the tale."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul","review":"First, I want to honor the thoughts expressed in Betty Ortiz's review. From her Native American perspective, I can feel the necessity for her to expose what she deems to be shortcomings in the book, and possibly even the author.As a white male European American, I feel alienated from the world and the culture that I find myself living in. I believe that there was something decided implicitly in the last hundred years of the industrial revolution that assumed that something great or wonderful could be created not with the hand of man connected to the earth and the spirit, but with the hand of man connected to metal and machinery. And one of the requisite implied, and maybe even unstated prices of membership was the act of cutting off the hand of man from the earth and the spirit.In 1968, I was in Grant Park @ the Democratic National Convention. I was seventeen years old. What I learned there is that there are no real detached observers. I wasn't on this side. I was on that side. The police charge clarified my position. Within two weeks I bought Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited to hear &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; ..because you know something's happening here / and you don't know what it is / Do you / Mr. Jones. Well that was me. So I started reading.That was thirty years ago. Some things have changed. Some have not. The main thing that has not changed is the yearning within me for that connection with the earth and the spirit that was somehow traded away some number of generations ago by my ancestors for the supposed benefits of the industrial revolution. &amp; we all lost there. Whites and non whites alike. That seems pretty clear.So, one of the people I've had contact with in this search is Martin. In terms of characterizing him, I'll defer to Robert Bly's use of the word &quot;authenticity&quot; in his Forward to this book. I believe in the authenticity of Martin's heart, soul, and stories. That matters to me. And I need that. A lot. Now.So, with the relative paucity of Czechoslovakian shamans in the world today, I find myself open to the message and stories of Mr. Prechtel.Much like Robert Bly's periodic interworkings with Grimms Fairy Tales, quite surprisingly, I find that I'm not even absolutely dependant on the complete accuracy of this work or it's author. The point to me are the truths illustrated, not necessarily as literally presented. This may be a bit of a stretch but Jesus' parables are not true because they actually happened in physical reality, but because they actually happened in spiritual reality. Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, one of the humblest &amp; bigest ideas of this industrialized time, had a spiritual awakening in the thirties at Townes Hospital in NYC that really has changed the lives and usefulness of otherwise discarded people. Bill asked the Doctor if he thought that it had really happened. The doctor told him that it didn't really matter. It was all that he had, so he'd better hang on to it. It is quite important that he did.So, this is an important &amp; necessary book to me to read, and have available to be read. It illustrates a spiritual truth, vision, and connection to the earth and the soirit that would otherwise be inaccessable to me."},{"Title":"The Burning Women of Far Cry","review":"A friend turned me on to this book while I was trying to decide if I wanted to buy &quot;A Clod of Wayward Marl&quot; from the superb independent publisher Dennis Mcmillan.

Children smoking, talking breasts, and humanoid babies, it's got it all --- and it isn't even science fiction."},{"Title":"The Burning Women of Far Cry","review":"I found this at a local goodwill store and I probably over paid considering it's only a penny on amazon haha. This is a gem of a book. The characters are fully fleshed out and they are all interesting. This is one of the better coming of age books I have read. It doesn't have the gravity that Catcher in the Rye had. It's more of a dark comedy type story that has some serious overtones to it, but not as heavy handed as Catcher in the Rye. I'm not even finished with it but I was compelled to write a review to give the author credit for some great writing. The main character, Jack, has to wade through some murky waters in his teenage years and really doesn't have great male role models to help him a long. So he makes some mistakes along the way and the reader really can't fault him for it, but deep down, he's a good man and remembers the values his mother taught him. I gave this 5 stars because the book kept me engaged all the way through, the characters were well rounded, the storyline crisp and moved along at a good pace and the writer was consistent in sequence of events."},{"Title":"The foundations of geometry and the non-Euclidean plane (Undergraduate texts in mathematics)","review":"Though perfectly clear to the mathematician, Non-Euclidean geometry is surronded by an aura of mystery and mistrust among the general public, and even a good many mathematicians would be hard pressed to explain exactly how the negation of the parallel postulate leads to all those strange formulas teeming with hyperbolic functions and other exotica. G.E. Martin explains everything beautifully, with exemplary clarity and just the right amount of detail. The reader also gets a complete construction of Euclidean geometry starting with the Birkhoff-Halsted axiom system, as well as a wealth of historical information into the bargain.

There is a very simple yet oft forgotten lesson presented by van Dyke. Set against Christmas Even in a brownstone mansion in New York City, the protagonist, the powerful and wealthy Mr. Weightman, has long been - in his own mind - a very generous philanthropist, but most often with self-serving motives. On Christmas Eve he has a conversation with his son wherein the younger Weightman proposes to give some greater meaning to his life than wealth and power, proposing he depart the family industry in order to serve others. The elder Weightman can't see that this makes any sense; it's not a good business decision and doesn't serves the prestige of the family name, the financial standing of the business or the household, nor will it help Junior's future position amongst the rich and powerful.

The book also explains different type of homeownership purposes such as vacation home, retirement home, rental property investment and how to carefully plan your foreign real estate investment. Financing options were also discussed in this book as far how it can be financed through many different options such as equity loan from current home, self directed real estate IRA, mortgages, and more.There are many different topics discussed in this book that I would never have thought of before until I read this book.Tom Kelly has a knack and national reputation for his ability to communicate facts well to his readers through his nationally syndicated real estate columns. He takes no sides and is unbiased and down to earth. While reading the book, I felt like he was my 'mentor' about Mexican real estate.Since I am the listing broker for a development in Manzanillo, I have been to several Mexican real estate related seminars, most of them are good but I have found many more useful references and information in this book to help train my sales team and/to educate our clients and potential prospects. We always recommend our prospects to buy the book because it does the job very well. After our clients has read the book, they have much less questions for my sales team and buy properties with more confidence.

Many requirements have changed to make purchasing in Mexico safe and profitable. While much of Mexico can be a great investment, this book takes your through the proper steps to be successful. As some analysts have stated \\"Mexico is the baby boom generation's Florida or Arizona.\\" This book is an easy read and a book you will return to often for details on financing, rental ideas and taxes. It also gives some opinions on the best areas with the opportunity for appreciation. Mexico is much like to United States. It features many different states, all with their own amenities and cultures. This book gives you a flavor for what you can expect. For example, the state of Colima is the safest state in all of Mexico and has low unemployment. It also features a wonderful, year-round climate and is located on the same latitude as Hawaii.

His overview of tax issues and finding sources of funding for the purchase are terrific. When markets are hot it is critical to have professional agents and notarios working for your interests...especially when the hot market is also outside the USA. Quality referrals to professionals in the part of Mexico you have interest will result in firm deals, faster deals, and legal deals.

As such, he decided that he was smart enough to discern the \\"real\\" teachings of Jesus (the ones he agreed with) from the \\"false\\" teachings of Jesus (the ones he disagreed with). This small book is the result. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, he didn't quite succeed, in fact it is an open question whether anyone COULD \\"succeed\\" at such a task. Though long the unholy grail of Rathernottheists, no \\"original\\" document containing Jesus' teachings before they were allegedly \\"modified\\" by would-be martyrs seeking out a phony cause to die for has ever been discovered, leaving them with the difficult task of sifting through the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The trouble is that as Jefferson apparently found, the task is too great or the cost in banished teachings too high.For example while Jefferson removed MOST of the Gospel references to the miracles of the Old Testament, he left in several of Jesus' references to the Flood of Noah, which reminds would-be secular admirers of Jesus of a big problem: whatever THEY might prefer to believe, according to the only records we have, Jesus DID believe in the miracles of the Old Testament or at least repeatedly and publicly professed to.Other omissions result in unintentional comedy. Jefferson stubbornly refused to include any of Jesus' miracles of healing, but he left in the associated arguments with the Pharisees. Thus, it appears herein that the Pharisees were provoked to homicidal fury by Jesus' stubborn insistence in TALKING about the sick and lame on the Sabbath!One wonders what they'd have done to Him if He'd actually healed somebody!Other problems are caused by the inclusion of at least some of Jesus' teachings about Heaven and Hell and His own impending death, which is rendered purposeless by omitting the resurrection. Worse, this leaves unanswered the obvious question: what exactly transformed the feckless bunch of cowards who so disgraced themselves at His crucifixion into the courageous would-be martyrs who proceeded to shake the world with His teachings? You'll get no answer here.For over a century and a half it was the tradition to give freshman congressmen a copy of this book, printed at government expense. IMHO it might have been more useful to give them a copy of THIS book:The Constitution of the United States of America, but even with its manifest flaws, this book makes for a useful and worthy gift, especially to someone who wouldn't be caught dead reading a Bible or a New Testament. As it says in John 7:46 on page 46 of this edition, \\"Never man spake like this man.\\" Even the allegedly secular teachings of Jesus are so remarkable, so powerful as to produce the desire to learn more, and I don't have to tell you where that can lead!Perhaps God DID and can continue to make good use of the Jefferson Bible after all.Note: One could complain that this book is available online for free. Well, yes, what part of in the public domain do you not understand? However, trying to get away with giving someone a printout as a gift will earn you the nickname of cheapskate. If all you want to do is read it yourself, then by all means stick to the free sites. However, if you are looking for a way to get through to someone else, you are better off buying a copy, and a solitary sawbuck for this sturdy pocket-sized reprint is going to be tough to beat.

Jesus' life revolved not around his teachings but his identity.A prime example is the fact that Jefferson's text ends with a dead Jesus laid in a tomb. If Jesus was wrong about being the Son of God (the core of his teachings) and never resurrected, how reliable could his doctrine really be?This edition includes:- Background on Jefferson's text written by Forrest Church.- Few pages of Jefferson's actual cut-and-paste copies [fascinating]- Jefferson's entire carved text- Index of used New Testament extractsRead with caution."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), a deist, believed in the existence of a single deity who was uninvolved in the daily life of people. He disliked both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament for many reasons, especially because they include unnatural, even impossible events. He felt that some, but not all, of the ethical teachings in the Bibles are worth teaching.He - like Leo Tolstoy in his The Gospel in Brief, and others - decided to cut and paste the New Testament Gospels, with no attempt to retain the order of the Gospel writers, and remove those items that distressed him, including the miraculous birth of Jesus, told with different \\"facts\\" in two of the four Gospels, and all of the other miracles, including the events that occurred after Jesus death. He solved the problem of the frequent differences between the Gospels about what occurred to Jesus at different times - for each Gospel has its own version of the life of Jesus that differs widely with the other three - by selecting passages from each that he thought made sense and blending them together to create what he considered a perfect no longer defective Bible, a Bible that teaches morality.Those who suppose that Jefferson's Bible has any relation to the New Testament are mistaken.Jefferson's well-meant volume is like the work of a foolish scientist who had a lovely wife and three beautiful daughters. He loved them all, but he disliked some physical and mental features in each of them; the eyes in one, the ears in another, the legs in a third and the general approach to life in the fourth. What did he do?As a scientist, he was able to graft the four of them into a single woman, a woman of his dreams, a woman who attracted him physically and intellectually; he had the best of the four people most dear to him. Yet when the new creation was completed, he realized his mistake. His beloved wife was gone. True, her faults were removed, but so too was her personality that was so dear to him. Now she was composed of the best parts of his daughters; and, so, how could he live with her as a man lives with his wife; it would be incest. And he had lost his daughters as well. Now, too late, he realized that despite their human faults, these four meant more to him than any \\"perfect\\" being.Bart D. Ehrman highlights a sample of about a hundred thousand differences between the four gospels in his 2009 book, Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (and Why We Don't Know About Them). He points out that there is something far more significant than these different descriptions of New Testament events; it is the fact that each of the gospel writers wrote his book to offer his readers his unique understanding of Jesus life and mission. These views differ greatly. For example, Mark, writing a little more than several decades after Jesus' traditional date of death, emphasized that Jesus was predicting the advent of a new and better world on earth during the lifetime of those listening to him. In contrast, John, who composed his Gospel decades later, after the death of all of Jesus' contemporaries, stated that Jesus' message was that people should strive to achieve an everlasting life in heaven.Jefferson's perfect Bible retains many \\"flaws\\" that Ehrman disclosed exist in the canonical version, such as the census in its opening verse, which history has shown never occurred, and the curious statement that Joseph had to take his family to Bethlehem because one of his ancestors had lived part-time in this city over a thousand years before he was born.However, more importantly, Jefferson demolished the uniqueness of each of the four gospels. He created a Bible that each of the Gospel writers would reject. He distorted the moral teachings in two ways. First, as we said, he changed the overall focus and intent of the document. Second, by mixing the language of each gospel writer and presenting them in his own chronological order, he perverted the details of the teachings.But the most significant problem with Jefferson's Bible and with Jefferson himself is that despite promising the production of a book of moral teachings, he retained forty episodes in which the Gospel writers insulted Jews. The Gospels were written during a period of strife between the Jews and their sister religion Christianity. Both sides had people who made unfortunate overheated remarks. Many of them made their way into the Gospels.The fact that Jefferson retained forty disparaging remarks in a book touted to be a book containing the best of morality, a small book of only 103 pages, is astonishing and tragic. Such insensitivity reminds us of his similar insensitivity toward his slaves. One wonders how such an intelligent man could make such mistakes. To say that he was influenced by his times is no answer. There were many people of his age and of earlier times who rose above bigotry. Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), in his The Gospel in Brief, wrote his version of the Gospels with the same intent as Jefferson, but his work does not have these statements.Most striking is that Jefferson included the following statement from John 7:1, \\"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Jewry because the Jews sought to kill him.\\" This is remarkable because the statement stands alone. There is no connection whatsoever with what proceeds or follows it in Jefferson's Bible. It is gratuitous. If Jefferson could cut miracles and the supernatural from his Bible, why leave this sentence, a sentence that is not connected in any way to morality?While insisting that he would include the ethical teachings of the Gospels, Jefferson violated one of the five basic ethical commands of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew, not to distinguish between people, to treat friends and enemies alike, to love your neighbor as yourself. In fact, Jesus said that this is the principal command.In short, Jefferson saw himself as more able than those people who preceded him in deciding what it is proper for a good person to read. He failed because he distorted what he intended to improve and he created a work that is an embarrassment to thinking and considerate people and a violation of the basic teaching of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"\\"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\\" (Revelation 22:19)The Jefferson Bible is a book that I read not in search of redemption but out of curiosity. I am a Christian and have been for over eight years. For some time, I revolted against all atheism, and refused to read any literatures against Christianity. But I had discovered as I matured more, that different opinions and beliefs are vital to one's life. I read several books and they were okay, but then I picked up The Jefferson Bible to see what our third President had to offer. I read it open-mindedly; willing to see my convictions changed, as from what I had seen, Jefferson was a brilliant man with much knowledge. The preface provoked me to further curiosity; I found it a bit dry, but it interested me, because of this man's apparent change in life because of this book. As I read \\"The Gospel According to Thomas Jefferson\\" (Forrest Church), I found his history appealing, although a bit confusing. I had always come to the conclusion John Adams had been a Christian, and yet he encouraged Jefferson's efforts in placing \\"the character of Jesus in its true and high light.\\" Jefferson had many encouragers of whom I have never heard of too that were not religious, but materialists, socialists, atheists, etc.Anyways, after concluding that the men of the time of Jefferson were more intent on philosophy that spiritualism, I continued on my research. I studied Jefferson efforts, as he, \\"razor in hand, ... sat editing the Gospels during February, 1804\\" to make Jesus more of a philosopher than a Redeemer. I found that Jefferson's efforts were poor and very disappointingly researched. Jesus, without His leading us to eternal life, has nothing to offer. He had a very few good morals to teach, but each was linked to the Way, and there was no way Jefferson could have depicted them to fit his intentions. I found that Jefferson's Jesus lacked the ingenuity and flowing of readability. Jefferson attempted to only include Jesus' morals and philosophies, but also included several of Jesus claims to being the Son of God, that I would have assumed he would omit. The main catch was that he allowed the verse where Pilate puts up the sign \\"JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS\\" in Jesus' crucifixion, and that he left several mentions of the resurrection. I found that without Jesus Christ's teaching of eternal life, that this work of Jefferson has no authority or reference. It leaves Jesus as more of a heretic than anything else. He refers to God as His Father, and this book portrays Him as one who taught well but lost His mind before His death. It is sad that many consider Jefferson's work a masterpiece. I think Jefferson did his best to portray Jesus in the way he wished (as one who was a great philosopher), but failed.I believe that the only reason for men deeming this as truthful is because they are attacking the truth of Jesus, and will resort to any other than the one truth: that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and He holds to Way to eternal life. It is sad to know how Jefferson and many of his contemporaries end up in the end, condemned to eternal death. For there is no way to Life other than through the Son of God ~ not through \\"Jesus the philosopher\\".I would recommend this book to those curious about Jefferson's beliefs, as they are ingeniously portrayed throughout. But if you are looking to see \\"the true Jesus\\", I am afraid you will be disappointed. Many atheists will do there best to get the most out of it (after blocking from their minds the mention of Jesus' Father and the resurrection as Jefferson did, because He failed to omit it; the Gospels mean nothing without the Truth.), but there is nothing to learn other that Jefferson was lost and so were the others mentioned in the forward, afterward, etc. Jefferson tried to get rid of all that \\"supernatural stuff\\", and though he tried, he only got everything confused. The stuff other than Jefferson's \\"cuttings\\" were well written although a little mislead, so I give it three stars (though if I were going by how much I enjoyed and learned from it, it would be one or two). Does it deserve it? Read it and find out. Good luck.\\"We cannot separate His demands from His love. We cannot dissect Jesus and relate only to the parts we like.\\" --Rebecca Manley Pippert"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson was a man of the (self-described) Enlightenment.

He disbelieved in all of its central tenets -- that Christ was Christ, not simply a &quot;moral teacher&quot;; that He was born of a virgin; that he rose on the third day according to the Scriptures; that He ascended into the Heavens; and that he will come again in glory, to judge the living and the dead, among others.Yet, Jefferson called Jesus Christ &quot;the greatest moral teacher.&quot; How could he avoid concluding that He was simply a liar or a lunatic, in light of His claims to be the &quot;Son of Man&quot; and &quot;the Way, the Truth, and the Light&quot;? Simply, he argued that His Apostles had &quot;made it all up.&quot; The Scriptures, if Jefferson was right, were just one big lie.Pity Jefferson. Having no familiarity whatsoever with the writings of the Church Fathers (knowledge of the works of St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. John the Theologian's student at the end of the first century and author of several surviving epistles mandating obedience to one's bishop, might have spared Jefferson the writing of his tres embarrassing &quot;Notes on Episcopacy&quot;), he dared to declare the Church a cabal for &quot;priestcraft's&quot; sake.Silly idea, that hundreds of thousands of people would conspire to become monks in the deserts of Egypt (routinely 120 degrees in the shade), Palestine, etc. Crazy of Saul of Tarsus to give up a position of esteem among his own people for the life of a peripatetic outcast. The only explanation of these phenomena I can arrive at is that these people thought what they were doing was based on Truth.One can grant Jefferson a little wiggle room, in light of his assumption that Roman Catholicism was the oldest variant of Christianity still extant. Yet, others in his day (including other members of the Virginia elite) knew the history of the Church well enough to be familiar with Greek Orthodoxy. (Why did Jefferson insist on equating papal abuses with &quot;Christianity&quot;?) They, unlike Jefferson, did not have a pathological (&quot;sinful&quot;?) aversion to the idea that anyone knew more than they, that their minds were the limit of wisdom. They didn't live the life of Epicurus on a mountaintop like this red-headed prodigal, supported in luxury by their slaves. They had not all bought into Satan's sin.Jefferson didn't know, as we have seen in the last 8 years, that there is a surviving manuscript in Greek from the first century of a large portion of the Gospel of Matthew JUST AS WE HAVE IT, in biblical Greek. So much for the grand conspiracy to make &quot;Jesus&quot; into God. I guess He was God. What does that mean to Thomas Jefferson, wherever he is now?"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"this is not a bible at all. it is a redacted 'gospel according to jefferson.' it is totally devoid of any spiritual or moral value since the jesus portrayed is not divine. i do not recommend this work of fiction unless it is studied in comparison with the actual four cannonical, historically accurate gospels."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"This streamlined synopsis of the teachings of Jesus Christ is drawn from the gospels of the bible without any religious dogma. The parables Jesus spoke are compiled nicely and provided me with the life lessons which I attempt to live by."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"I have read all the reviews on The Jefferson Bible, and, after reading the book itself, I can suggest that you will get a good feel for the book from the review on February 7, 2002 \\"The First Book on Morals, Ethics, and Character\\" and the one on September 30, 2001 \\"The Religious Side of Thomas Jefferson\\". They both land close to the mark."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"What a disappointment this is. I'd really been looking forward to reading the Jefferson Bible and I was quite stoked to find it at such a great price! I guess one gets what one pays for however.There's two problems with this download: first, there's no active table of contents. With something like the Bible, even Jefferson's version, this is a requirement.Second, and even more vexing, it's quite clear this text was scanned directly from a book and that causes massive formatting issues, along with displaying page numbers in the text. There's also a message that basically reads like an ad every few pages showing the title and the fact that it's from the sacred-texts website.All in all, I really wanted to enjoy this read, but can't. Very disappointed. If they put out a version that at least has an active table of contents, I might download it again, but otherwise it's off to the bin."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"In posting this review, I'm also posting a review of a second new edition that is freshly available:The Jefferson Bible, Smithsonian Edition: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth. That special Smithsonian volume is a reasonably priced collector's item, and so is this Tarcher edition.If you've read this far about the book, you probably know something about the so-called Jefferson Bible. First, he never called it that himself. His final 1820 edition was called \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth.\\" I'm not interested in starting a book-review debate about the nature of Jefferson's faith, but this much is true: In his own lifetime, Jefferson did called himself \\"a Christian.\\" It's also true that Jefferson's interest was in the moral teachings of Jesus and his version of the Bible cut out all miraculous details from the Gospels. You'll find that his Bible, nearly two centuries after he created it, still sparks spirited discussion in classes and small groups.Of course, the 1820 Bible was intended for his own reading and for his circle of friends and colleagues, most of whom could appreciate the Greek, Latin and French columns in his pasted-together composite. His original edition remains a major milestone in American religious history and a book that any Bible teacher should have on the shelf. Of course, today, there are lots of free and almost-free editions of this book with more popping up all the time.The Tarcher edition represents a historical milestone, as does the Smithsonian facsimile. First published in 1940, the new Tarcher version includes the original 1940 preface, so readers can look back on American attitudes toward this document just prior to America's involvement in World War II. Plus, frankly, if you want to actually read the whole text of Jefferson's version, this is a much easier book to read than the Smithsonian facsimile. Among other things, Tarcher doesn't bother to publish the Greek, Latin and French columns, just the English in a highly readable typeface.My strong recommendation: Buy both of these books now, while they're still available."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"I was unaware that Jefferson had written this book, and was happy to discover it and add it to my library. His genius astounds and inspires."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"As the person responsible for the Jefferson Bible on the web... , I found the reviews posted here fascinating, including the very negative ones. Apparently, it is easy to miss the point of the Jefferson Bible. It is not a treatise on religious dogma or analysis, but a personal spiritual guide for those unable to stomach all the hocus pocus usually associated with the teachings of Jesus. Whatever one's feeling about the Bible, it is difficult to see how anyone could consider the purified teachings of Jesus as \\"tripe.\\" Jefferson merely selected passages that spoke to his heart and put them all together in a single collection for his own use. Thousands have looked at his collection and determined that it speaks to their heart also."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson does the right thing by getting rid of all the dogma and supernatural/superstitious CRAP in the gospels and concentrates on the very human message that Jesus brought to us all - that of empathy and a sense of compassion for other human beings, and that Love is the answer to the problem of human coexistence."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"I find it very interesting that Thomas Jefferson took so much time to distill this book from the Holy Bible. That must have been near blasphemy in the early 1800's. It does make for a short and interesting read however and shows that Jefferson was deeply contemplating the Bible as he read it."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Jefferson accomplished most of what Rudolph Bultmann was attempting to do with his program &#34;to demythologize the New Testament...& to translate it into human language without remainder.&#34; Jefferson's work is astonishingly well done, making the meaning of the Gospels exceptionally clear. Moreover, he sets Jesus free from the strange dictates of the Council of Nicea (e.g., the &#34;Homoousian&#34; argument for the divinity of Jesus vs. the &#34;Arien&#34; argument that Jesus was fully man) & reveals the true depth & humanity of the man, who re-presents what it means to be more truly & fully human. I also purchased an illustrated version of this work for my son, who had studied it in college; this version gives additional insight into the depth & rigor Jefferson employed in an attempt clarify the intent of The Gospels, without myth. &#34;The Morals of Jesus&#34; is an excellent piece of work (from an amazing man & Diest) & a text everyone should take to heart & employ daily."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"I had heard for years about the Jefferson Bible, so I finally ordered it. It's pretty small, but he included more passages in it--if this is exactly it--than I would have thought. Jefferson's introduction is the most revealing part. It's definitely worth having. For some reason, I thought it would be a full-on Bible with lined-out portions that he found suspect. One wonders what he'd think now, after decades of archeological research has taken place. One has to assume it would have some influence. He includes the birth and death stories, and the parables. I was a little disappointed that he did not elede any of that finger-pointing in the death story, being a creature of the Enlightenment as he was. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"It's written in the old biblical style of writing which at times can be a little hard to understand. Other than that, it is an interesting take on the life and teachings of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"It gave an interesting insight into how Thomas Jefferson thought. Very Good, and it was enjoyable reading and thinking about"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"While not an American I am a fan of much of Thomas Jefferson's thinking. I found his approach to the Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth a really clever way to structure the teachings of the man many believe is a Messiah clearly and concisely without having to concern myself with what maybe simply propoganda (the miracles) or third or fourth hand renditions given that no portion of the New Testament dates from Jesus time on the earth. I won't be exchanging it for my copy of the KJV but I doubt Jefferson had that in mind when he wrote his book."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson was an amazing genius. So when I had a chance to read his view of the New Testament, I grabbed it up. His version of the New Testament, which is devoid of the magic and nonsense, makes for a more intimate understanding of the life of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"This is a really great book, which gives a remarkable insight into the mind of one of our founding fathers and who he thopught about the christian religion."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Well, first off, this is the \\"Life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\" its not the \\"Jefferson bible,\\" Jefferson would have been horrified if he learned someone took a book where he compiled the moral philosophy of Jesus and called it his bible. I have heard that according to the original preface, it was suppose to be for the native Indians, though there is no evidence of it reaching them, we have no right to create a new motive for Jefferson.Next, Jefferson cutting from a bible and pasting in another book, is no reason for the delight and glee from secularist and horror from Christians. Think about it, Jefferson didn't have a computer where he could copy and paste the moral philosophy of Christ from the bible into a book, so he did exactly what I would do if I had several bibles. I personally once cut verses from a bible to paste in a painting, I suppose 200 years from now, someone will find the painting and think I was some anti-Christian, irreligious, bible hating deist, because I applied my scissors to the Holy Bible!Now as far as the content, so many of reviews just focus and delight on what is LEFT out and yet don't feel any discomfort about what is there. Though it is obvious that Jefferson didn't allow any of Jesus' miracles to be recorded and he didn't include the resurrection of Christ at the end, it is still rather interesting what he did leave in the so called \\"Jefferson bible.\\" There is much more then moral teachings here.So yeah, for a so called \\"Secular humanist\\" among many atheist and a Deist among \\"Christians,\\" how do they make sense of all Jefferson left in? For I suppose they must assume that Jefferson cut out all the supernatural crap he disagreed with, and what is left in the Jefferson bible is the \\"Diamonds from the dung hill\\". The way some reviewers are acting, I suppose we can say what Jefferson left in the Jefferson Bible, he approved of? So what are these diamonds salvaged from the dung hill?I just read the it and inside the \\"Jefferson bible\\" we find many examples of heaven, the fires of hell and both devils and angels. Also, most of Jesus' mentions of the second coming, the final Judgment, the Kingdom of God, salvation, Jesus' mighty works and that Jesus is the Son of God are all here! Jesus affirms the resurrection, Noah and the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. Most importantly almost every reference to prayer from Jesus is in the \\"Jefferson bible\\", even God giving the Holy Spirit to all who ask. We also find fulfilled prophesy; Jesus prophesies Peter will deny him 3 times before the cock crows and later we read of this happening. So yeah, there is a lot more, I could make this into an extremely long review and just post example after example directly from the eBook, of all that shouldn't have survived Jefferson's scissors and bible blotter!so yeah for a so called Deist, it sure seems odd he didn't clip out all mentions of prayer, God's activity on the earth, as well as prophesy, the second coming, angels and demons and the Holy Spirit and Jesus being the actual Son of God, the Christ and the King whose Kingdom is not of this earth. It would be nice to find some explanation for all Jefferson left in there, if he really was creating for himself his own bible without the supernatural. Is not the resurrection, the Holy Spirit, prophesy and salvation supernatural? Oh Hitchen's and Dawkin's, how did all this nonsense make it into this book from your secular saint?O.K with all of that aside, i must say i really enjoyed \\"The Life and morals of Jesus.\\" As far as Jesus' life, its extremely brief, the book is primarily the read letters of the bible, Jesus' teachings all put together seamlessly. I am glad Jefferson did this, it was a pleasure to read Jesus' teachings without the constant interruptions of miracles."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"I mainly purchased this book because of the show I watched on the Smithsonian Channel. They talked about how time consuming it was for Mr.Jefferson to cut apart 4 original Bibles and compile them into one, taking out all of what he thought wasn't necessary, mainly the religious Dogmas. It was actually more interesting watching the Smithsonian book experts unbind the entire book, and put it back together, not only to restore it, but to preserve it. I believe it took approximately one year, so I thought I should at least read the book that they felt was important enough to do what they did."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"The book is not what I expected, I thought it had some personal points of view or Jefferson's own opinion in some nonetheless excellent lecture.

In fact, seemingly impossible. I have, however always been facinated by the Bible, it's history and our attraction to it. The Jefferson Bible was perfect for me. His verson of the Gospels excludes the virgin birth, the raising of the dead, the casting out of demons and even the ressurection! Instead it focuses on the TEACHINGS of Jesus... the SPIRIT rather than the LETTER. For those interested in the teachings of Jesus without all the 'fantacy' I suggest this book at all costs."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Very important item.

Its called \\"the Life and Teachings of Jesus a restatement of the gospels\\" and it is written by Preston Thomas. This book was produced and based on and inspired by the Jefferson Bible, and Thomas Preston in his forward to his book,quotes from and also reprints part of the forward from the Jefferson Bible. Thomas Preston stays true to the spirit of the Jefferson Bible and preserves the legacy and the purpose of why Thomas jefferson created his own bible.The Thomas Preston version is really a very wonderful reproduction of the Jefferson Bible. This version is more complete,detailed, and thorough than the Jefferson Bible.It contains perhaps alot of parts which Jefferson never included in his own version. This version includes all the details of the life of Jesus and his teachings,starting from his birth,and follows all the way through to his resurrection and final appearances. The text of this version is very easy to read and is in modern English. Thomas Preston also provides ample and thorough detailed explanations and footnotes on each page. This version also is written in a chronological order of events that happened in the life of Jesus.Each section is concise,short and contains all the information and details that you need to know,without overdoing it with too much information or too many detailsIts a sheer Joy to read and is a wonderful way to end each day as you read some each day before you turn off the light to go to sleep.Please check out this version for yourself and see what you think of it,it's also for sale right here on Amazon \\"The Life and Teachings of Jesus a restatement of the gospels\\" by Thomas Preston"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Nicely bound and printed.

This is best read with an &#34;official&#34; Bible in the other hand to understand what Jefferson chose to leave out. Jefferson has done a fascinating job of distilling a humanist Christ from the Gospels.

Although the government long supported Christian activity among Indians,[12][13] and in Notes on the State of Virginia Jefferson supported \\"a perpetual mission among the Indian tribes,\\" at least in the interest of anthropology,[14] and as President gave financial support for a priest and church for the Kaskaskia Indians, [15] Jefferson did not make these works public. Instead, he acknowledged \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\" existence only to a few friends, saying that he read it before retiring at night, as he found this project intensely personal and private.[16] It is understood by some historians that he composed it for his own satisfaction, supporting the Christian faith as he saw it. Gaustad states, \\"The retired president did not produce his small book to shock or offend a somnolent world; he composed it for himself, for his devotion, for his assurance, for a more restful sleep at nights and a more confident greeting of the mornings\\" Source: WikipediaIt still is really refreshing to see the concepts in the new testament without the mysticism and miracles.

While it is generally accepted that he was removing parts he thought specious or redundant, his chosen title, 'The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth', implies a different motive, the isolation from the various genres a pure code of morals and ethics.

Rejecting the virgin birth, the annunciation, and even the resurrection, Jefferson wanted to dig down to Jesus' message of absolute love and service. The result is a chronological new Gospel formed by merging select portions of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.An excellent, concise introduction by Forrest Church and an afterward by Jaroslav Pelikan ([see Whose Bible Is It][...]) round out the book.

Think about it, Jefferson didn't have a computer where he could copy and paste the moral philosophy of Christ from the bible into a book, so he did exactly what I would do if I had several bibles. I personally once cut verses from a bible to paste in a painting, I suppose 200 years from now, someone will find the painting and think I was some anti-Christian, irreligious, bible hating deist, because I cut and pasted from the bible!Now as far as the content, so many of reviews just focus and delight on what is LEFT out and yet don't feel any discomfort about what is there. Though it is obvious that Jefferson didn't allow any of Jesus' miracles to be recorded and he didn't include the resurrection of Christ at the end, it is still rather interesting what he did leave in the so called \\"Jefferson bible\\"So yeah, for a so called \\"Secular humanist\\" among many atheist and a Deist among \\"Christians,\\" how do they make sense of all Jefferson left in? For I suppose they must assume that Jefferson cut out all the supernatural crap he disagreed with, and what is left in the Jefferson bible is the \\"Diamonds from the dung hill\\". The way some reviewers are acting, I suppose we can say what Jefferson left in the Jefferson Bible, he approved of? So what are these diamonds salvaged from the dung hill?I just read the it and inside the \\"Jefferson bible\\" we find many examples of heaven, the fires of hell and both devils and angels. Also, most of Jesus' mentions of the second coming, the final Judgment, the Kingdom of God, salvation, Jesus' mighty works and that Jesus is the Son of God are included. Jesus affirms the resurrection, Noah and the flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. Most importantly almost every reference to prayer from Jesus is in the \\"Jefferson bible\\", even God giving the Holy Spirit to all who ask. We also find fulfilled prophesy, Jesus prophesies Peter will deny him 3 times before the cock crows and later we read of this happening. So yeah, there is a lot more, I could make this into an extremely long review and just post example after example directly from the eBook, of all that shouldn't have survived Jefferson's scissors!so yeah for a so called Deist, it sure seems Odd he didn't clip out all mentions of prayer, God's activity on the earth, as well as prophesy, the second coming, angels and demons and the Holy Spirit and Jesus being the actual Son of God, the Christ and the King whose Kingdom is not of this earth. It would be nice to find some explanation for all Jefferson left in there, if he really was creating for himself his own bible without the supernatural. Is not the resurrection, the Holy Spirit, prophesy and salvation supernatural? Oh Hitchen's and Dawkin's, how did all this nonsense make it into this book from your secular saint?O.K with all of that aside, i must say i really enjoyed \\"The Life and morals of Jesus.\\" As far as Jesus' life, its extremely brief, the book is primarily the read letters of the bible, Jesus' teachings all put together seamlessly. I am glad Jefferson did this, it was a pleasure to read Jesus' teachings without the constant interruptions of miracles."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"It's the exact reproduction of Jefferson's edited New Testament.A great addition to my library. For the spiritual reader, not the religiousor dogmatic believer. Jefferson didn't want opinions or detractions fromThe words of Jesus. It is what it is: edited text."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson was no Christian. Like many of the most famous of the founding fathers, he was a Deist, and counted himself a Unitarian, but he often said he was the sole member of a sect including no one but himself. He had confidence in his own reason and conscience. He did admire Jesus, saying, \\"Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and others again of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being.\\" It was Jefferson's view that he himself could sort the truth from the imposture, for he felt that the real words applicable to Jesus were \\"as distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill.\\" He thought about the process of doing so for many years, did a quick job around 1800 and did a thorough one in 1820. His purpose was to make his own version of the gospels, an extraction that would summarize Jesus's life and morals, for \\"I hold the precepts of Jesus, as delivered by himself, to be the most pure, benevolent, and sublime which have ever been preached to man. I adhere to the principles of the first age; and consider all subsequent innovations as corruptions of his religion, having no foundation in what came from him.\\"It was not enough for the polyglot Jefferson to make such a distillation from the King James Version; he also bought a couple of Greek, French, and Latin versions to use, two volumes of each, for his plan was to cut and paste the parts that he found useful into one volume, but using all four languages. The resultant volume is called The Jefferson Bible, although his own handwritten title page gives \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, Extracted textually from the Gospels in Greek, Latin, French & English.\\" He apparently studied the volume of his own manufacture nightly before going to bed, but he was horrified at the idea that it be published, feeling that his political enemies would use his ideas against him (his lofty Deism had produced against him charges of atheism) and that this product of his own conscience was his own comfort. His descendants did not know that the volume existed until after his death.The English extracts of the book were printed by the Government Printing Office in 1904 in a small booklet, and a tradition began of having the book be presented to newly sworn in congressmen. Currently in print is an edition from the Beacon Press in Boston, which is entirely fitting, as this is the printing house for the Unitarian Universalist Church.Naturally it is fascinating to go through the little volume and to see what was important to the genius of Jefferson and what was not. He left out all the Old Testament, of course, and all of Paul's additions (he felt that Paul was the \\"first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus\\"); the Apocalypse, upon which so much of current prophetic beliefs are founded, he said was \\"merely the ravings of a maniac.\\" He must have felt that only the life of Jesus was worthy of study.But even the life does not start out in the way in which we are familiar. The first sentences of Jefferson's Bible have to do with Joseph and Mary going to Bethlehem to be taxed. There is no Annunciation, indeed, no implication that Jesus had any sort of miraculous birth; Jefferson distrusted miracles. Having seen the beginning, I turned to the final pages; I knew how the story turned out, you see, so I did not really risk ruining it for myself. The end is just as worldly; \\"They rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\\" (Matthew 27:60) There is no magical resurrection in this version. The life and teachings were apparently enough.There is a similar lack of miracles throughout. The story in the ninth chapter of John is cut short, when being presented with a blind man and asked who had sinned, he or his parents, to bring on the blindness, Jesus only gives the comment, \\"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\\" This sounds a bit enigmatic to me, and although the blind man may have taken comfort that his condition was not the product of sin..., I cannot think he would be happy at being a display for the works of God. A sighted man would be a better display. Anyway, the episode does not climax with Jesus making mud with his spittle and putting it on the blind man's eyes to bring him vision. One looks in vain in this volume for healed lepers, risen corpses, strolls on the waters, or renewed wine cellars. Such stories were not important to Jefferson; only the life and teachings were.And those teachings, though familiar, are magnificent. Jesus causing the mob self-examination when it was about to stone an adultress is one of my favorites, and of course it is here. There are higher values than obedience to old laws, he makes plain. The widow still gives everything she has, thus giving more than the large sums from the rich. Jesus encouraged love of others, as much as we love ourselves; the love extended to those who have no love for us. The beseechings to do good make me painfully aware that I fall short of the sort of ideal Jesus would want: \\"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.\\" Surely he was being hyperbolic, but even so, I don't come close.I think the exaggeration does not serve him in many cases. \\"Take no thought for tomorrow\\" I think of as exceedingly bad advice. I hold that there is much to be said for thinking about the here and now, but only a fool never plans for the future. Similarly, the enjoinings to abandon one's family or to give away everything one has to the poor are so far removed from the way my world works (and surely from the way the Nazarene's did, as well) that such exhortation is not only futile but argues against itself.Jefferson has eliminated some of the verses that gave me ammunition against Biblical literalists. He includes the story about Peter denying Christ three times before the cock crows, but omits the pesky Mark 14:66-68 which shows Peter got only one denial in before the crowing. He leaves out the Holy Spirit or any verse that would show Jesus to be divine. He does not include any verses that show Jesus speaking with a short temper to his mother, as at Cana. Jesus certainly does not invite anyone to eat his flesh.I was disappointed at some of the inclusions. It is surprising that the naturalist Jefferson allowed Jesus to go on saying that the mustard seed is the biggest of all seeds and that it grows into a plant bigger than all other herbs. Jefferson had no misgivings over having Jesus speak of a literal Noah: \\"Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.\\" Not only does this seem to countenance a holocaust worse than any subsequent one (and against a world of poor animals, too), it makes clear that Jesus took the Old Testament myths literally.The biggest disappointment is that although Jefferson saw fit to cut the story before any ascendancy of Jesus into heaven, he retains many of Jesus's parables of what the afterlife is like. This is not so bad in the descriptions of heaven, but also included are Jesus's warnings about hell... It is indeed a shame that Jefferson's admiration for the ethical system proposed by Jesus includes all of his verses that warn about being burned or tortured forever. Jesus's words make clear he countenances such a system. That's not morals, it's monstrosity.I did like the Jefferson Bible, though, for its brief summation of the stories that have changed the world. I like most of all the idea of Thomas Jefferson with scissors and paste finding what was meaningful for himself in the gospels and cutting out his own version. This was the Jefferson who encouraged, \\"Question with boldness even the existence of a god; because if there be one he must approve of the homage of reason more than that of blindfolded fear.\\" His Bible was an act of audacious redaction: he refused to accept the book as divinely inspired holy writ, and determined that he would examine it carefully to see in it what his own conscience and reason showed was good, and follow that good, and ignore the rest. Would that others would do the same."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson didn't necessarily believe in miracles. But he certainly believed in morals, ethics, and character. His detractors on the Sally Hemmings farce, like author Joseph Ellis, have since been proven to be all wet. Like the other book of the same name, I enjoyed the book, Jefferson Bible, very much. But, it's only half the story, unfortunately. The other half involves Jefferson's values from the secular point of view. The best, perhaps only, book to read for that is (and don't be misled by the title), West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education, by Norman Thomas Remick. It perfectly compliments Jefferson Bible. In any event, This book by Forrest Church is well presented and certainly well worth reading. It's a great read on TJ's religious beliefs, and a five-star effort."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"How many of us have read the Bible in its entirety? I dare say, not many of us. Imagine how serious a thinker Jefferson must have been for him to make the effort to do that. On the other hand, imagine how objective a thinker he must have been to fashion, straight from the Bible, the world's first ever bible of morals, ethics, and character. That is one of his little known, most important contributions to humanity. No less than that, my dear fellow Americans, is the true enormity of his Biblical analysis and editing. The only other book I have ever found that recognizes Jefferson as the first to &quot;write&quot; a book on morals, ethics, and character, and in that sense a pioneer itself, is &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. To gain more insight into the religious/philosophical side of Jefferson, I recommend you go on to reading that book after reading the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Did you ever wonder what the Gospels would be like without all that supernatural stuff? Thomas Jefferson did, and he found out [in around 1820] by using multiple copies of the Bible and a razor blade. The result was The Life and Morals Of Jesus of Nazareth in four languages. The Jefferson Bible reprints the english version of The Life And Morals along with an excellent introductory essay by Forrest Church, Unitarian minister and son of Senator Frank Church, and a decent closing essay by Jaroslav Pelikan. I have known about the Jefferson Bible for years, but finally read it this year on Easter [it seemed like a good thing for an atheist and rationalist to do]. Jesus said some pretty cool things [and some pretty spacey things], and the force of the teachings come out more when divorced from everything else that appears with them in the New Testament. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the teachings of Jesus, or the mind and the religion of the writer of the Declaration of Independence. And if your neighbor starts telling you that the public schools should start teaching the religion of the Founding Fathers, you can give them a copy of the Jefferson Bible."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"\\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth; The Jefferson Bible\\" is Thomas Jefferson's Unitarian idea of what Jesus said and believed. Jefferson's idea was simple, but deeply meaningful. Unitarians believe there is one God and that the notion of a 'Trinity' is mistaken. As a Unitarian, Jefferson had the idea of taking the four Gospels, as they were, and cutting out all mention of miracles or of Jesus being God. Jeferson bought two copies of the four Gospels and cut out and pasted together only those passages that quoted Jesus and showed his life and he discarded any direct mention of Jesus as God or anything about miracles. There was no mention of virgin birth or of resurection. Jefferson rearranged the passages, keeping similar themes together, in a logical fashion. What emerged was a book of sayings from a man, who was a philosopher and a teacher and who spoke to everyone about belief in God and moral behavior.If one reads this short book, one finds, as Jefferson did, the teachings of Jesus, stripped of most of the ideas of others. Jefferson's idea had been very simple. However, the book is a wonderful teaching tool, that focuses on Jesus, separate from all that was not important to Jesus, the philosopher and teacher.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in what Jesus taught, rather than what the various Christian churches teach, today. If you are a Trinitarian Christian (Roman Catholic, Orthodox Christian, or Protestant), I believe that this book will not discourage your own faith, but will help you to understand Jesus and his own teachings."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson (TJ) thought very highly of Jesus as a philosopher but he had no use for the dogma of Christianity as developed by those evangelists (as epitomized by Paul) who followed Jesus. He believed the writers of the New Testament to be uneducated; delivering word of mouth, fabricated and exaggerated information decades after the fact, and did not consider any of it to be inspired by God. With encouragement from others, including John Adams, he decided to \\"reorganize\\" the New Testament, deleting the objectionable parts, leaving only the teachings of Jesus.TJ did this twice - once when he was in the White House, spending only 2 or 3 nights on it after doing his routine daily correspondence - and the more definitive version which we have here, when he was 76, about 1820. Since TJ considered anyone's faith to be a private affair, it's not clear whether he ever expected publication. There are hints that he went to some efforts to avoid public knowledge of at least the first version, probably because the more vocal of his opponents already reviled him as an infidel too impious to be president, and a theological heretic.TJ's Bible, only 46 pages, ended up being a rearrangement of the gospels only, excluding any parts he didn't like - virgin birth, miracles, resurrection, and dogma developed by first century Christians. TJ, in a letter to Benjamin Rush describing his planned redaction of the Gospels, said only, \\"I have a view of the subject which ought to displease neither the rational Christian nor Deist.\\" While contemplating his redaction, he wrote, \\"There will be found remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man. I have performed this operation for my own use, by cutting verse by verse out of the printed book, and by arranging the matter which is evidently his, and which is as distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill.\\"In the second century, Titian wrote the \\"Diatessaron,\\" an attempt to combine and harmonize the four gospels. It enjoyed semi-canonical standing in the Syriac Christian church for centuries. Thomas Friedman has written two books about the Documentary Hypothesis, making the Torah (first five books of the Old Testament) a redaction of several ancient writers. TJ was not the first to attempt improvements on either Testament of the Bible.Careful review of TJ's Bible reveals that it was difficult for him to get rid of all he despised and yet keep all that he liked. Good works were so interspersed with miracles that one could not get rid of the miracle without lessening the value of the moral lesson.To quote from the book, \\"Like other Enlightenment rationalists, TJ was convinced that the real villain in the Christian story was the apostle Paul, who had corrupted the religion OF Jesus into a religion ABOUT Jesus, which thus had, in combination with the otherworldly outlook of the 4rth gospel, produced the monstrosities of dogma, superstition, and priestcraft which were the essence of Christian orthodoxy. The essence of authentic religion, and therefore of the only kind of Christianity in which TJ was interested, needed to be rescued from these distortions, so that the true person and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth might rise from the dead page - the only kind of resurrection TJ was prepared to accept.\\"If this book is to be believed, at least between 1904 and 1956, a copy of the Jefferson Bible was given to each US Senator upon inauguration. As much as TJ believed in separation of church and state, I wonder what he would have thought of this practice.I can highly recommend this little book. It has not only a readable version of the gospels (uniquely shuffled), but a pre-commentary and post-commentary which give a superb view of TJ's religious views."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"The brilliant statesman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and served as America's third president boldly separated himself from the established churches of his day.

Jefferson was obviously not a \\"mainline\\" Christian, but he knew the Bible much better than many self proclaimed Christians.As readers may know Jefferson titled his \\"bible\\" THE LIFE AND MORALS OF JESUS OF NAZARETH. As mentioned in other reviews, Jefferson accepted much of Christ's social teachings, but he did not believe in the miracle stories which he thought were exploited to enhance supersition at the expense of moral conduct.Another interesting feature of Jefferson's \\"Bible\\" is that he wrote this source in parallel columes in English, Greek, Latin, and French. This arrangement was designed to help his children to learn these languages. Such work also demonstrates Jefferson's knowledge of fogeign languages.Some editions of THE JEFFERSON BIBLE have photoplates of these translations which would appeal to those who know these languages.Some editions of THE JEFFERSON BIBLE has essays and comments by Jefferson who passionately believed in freedom of religion. Recent \\"critics\\" have attempted to distort Jefferson's passionate defense of religious freedom by claiming he did not claim such freedom. Essays and anecdotes refute such distortions. For example, some have denied that Jefferson used the phrase Separation of Church and State. It was Jefferson who used the phrase that there was a wall of separation between Church and State. Jefferson argued that only error needed defense of the government and that different views should be brought to the bar reason. Truth would stand on her own. One must reaalize Jefferson's time. Terrible religious persecutions in Europe and colonial America were recent history during Jefferson's lifetime. One must remember that the Salem Witchcraft trials occured between 1692-1693.Jefferson accepted reason as an adequet guide to find truth as mentioned above. Some editions of JEFFERSON'S BIBLE have a well written, well reasoned essay of Jefferson's scathing denounciation of John Calvin. This essay is not only penetrating criticism of Calvin, but Jefferson effectively denounces religious persecution in this particular essay.Thomas Jefferson was a brilliantly talented indivudual. His intelligence is reflected in his constitutional thought, mathematics (mentioned above), etc. Supposedly the late US President John F. Kennedy reflected that when there was never so much intellect who sat at the White House dinner table as when Jefferson sat there alone.

That assumption is based of course on the idea that everything in the New Testament gospels must be taken as if it literally happened, as if the Gospel writers were able to accurately write what Jesus said and did in the same way a reporter could today. Balderdash. ....&quot;Jefferson's Bible&quot; is an attempt--a labor of love--by one incredibly brilliant man to create a gospel that made sense, building on the writings of the original gospel writers (who he unfairly detested but had no choice to rely upon). Was he successful? That's for each person to determine for himself or herself. But whether you are a pure Unitarian (as Jefferson was) or a traditional Christian, or none of the above, the value of his work is in the way he reminds us of the truly wonderful morals that Jesus preached, many of which are overlooked in the lavish doctrinal attention paid to the Resurrection."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"This work condenses the scattered faith documents that are the &quot;Gospels&quot; into a kernel of real truth. It is a truly remarkable piece of work for those of us who believe Christ is more than the charicature that many zealots paint him as today. Jefferson deduced the real message in the New Testament, which was a call to live a better, more ethical life. He saw through the amalgam of Greek mythology, cynic-style homilies, and cosmic-battle cultic material that was mish-mashed together by 2nd century apologists to create a life for a man whose very existence is debatable. Christ is a concept and a model, not a god! Jefferson indeed created a bible that can be used as a life tool, not a tool of oppression and coersion with which one can be saved or damned."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Perhaps the best review is to let Jefferson speak for himself: &quot;To the corruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed, but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself.

The revelation came as a shock to this 90-year old Methodist, who still cannot comprehend why a work of thisvalue went unnoticed for so long.Only one greater question remains: Why has the original wisdom ofJesus been so foolishly ignored- for so very long. And, to paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, \\"If not now. when?\\" Yhe indisputable wisdom of the Rule of Reciprocity has been the foundation of ethical codesfrom the beginning of recorded history. Now,I can comprehend G.B.Shaw's comment: \\"the only thing wrong with Chritianity is that it has never been practiced!\\"I have enjoyed giving this work to many of my freinds who have never known of this inspiring work.

And yet he wished for every freshman member of Congress to have in their possession the words of Christ. What does that say about the original intent of what Jefferson himself coined as 'the separation of church and state' in 1802?Please, I would urge all Americans not only to read this brilliant collection, edited by Jefferson himself, but also the complete, original, unabridged writings of one of our most profound, brilliant, intelligent, and spiritual founding fathers and former presidents, Thomas Jefferson. So many questions about our country today, so many questions about the original intent upon the founding of our republic, can be answered by reading his original words.

Jefferson believed in a 'Supreme (or Great) Architect of the Universe', and that being set things in motion, leaving man to finish them on his own.

Someone found the bible from which he cut Jesus' words and fashioned what we know as the Jefferson Bible from what was missing. The only thing that survives of what Jefferson made is the first page...so, pretty much nothing. Secondly, he produced the book to remove the miraculous, but to provide non-Christians with an overview of Jesus' words. Rumor is he made if for distribution among the American Indians.

The book is, quite simply, a \\"trimmed\\" version of the Gospels found in the New Testament. I would certainly agree that these books require trimming, as this also serves the dual purpose of reconciling (read: omitting) the many discrepancies between them.I feel this book would appeal to three markets: 1) Those interested in the study of Jeffersonian history, 2) those interested to see what the character of Jesus has to say without all the supernatural nonsense muddying things up, and 3) those who are interested in religious curiosities (myself being among the latter).The book is an interesting take on the Gospels, and I feel Jefferson was way ahead of his time.

Jefferson produced this condensed & rational version over many years, including editing in evenings at the White House, after his official duties were complete. I think of it as 'Mr. Jefferson's self-therapy' that kept him sane enough to cope with the pressures of the Presidency.

In December of 1801 after the Capital was built, President Jefferson made a proclamation to have Sunday services held in the Capital building in which Jefferson attended every Sunday until the end of his presidentcy. The Capital held services until the end of the 19th century. Jefferson wrote \\"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazarath,\\" to be a missionary tool to help in evanglizing the Indians. Reading the Words of Jesus Christ without the regular commentary from the Bible was revolutionary in itself but made it easier for the Missionaries to use so that the Indians could get to know who Jesus was.

No, the historical truth is this:This abridged compact version of the bible was created by Thomas Jefferson specifically for use by ***Christian missionaries to the Native Americans.***Around 1803 a Scottish minister pointed out the impracticalities of having to print and lug around the entire bible, most of which you can't really understand until after you've been a Christian for many years. He suggested that if the missionaries were going to be successful then they needed a compact version of the scriptures.So! Jefferson created this compact abridged version for simplicity of transport and ease of understanding the life, the miracles, and the teachings of Jesus Christ ***for missionaries to the Native Americans*** ~ and this ingenious volume transmits a basic working knowledge of the Christian Faith for beginners.It really is that simple. I read these other reviews and want to crack up laughing: what a bunch of nonsense, lies, and re-writing of history. Seriously, people! America's founding fathers WERE Christians and this country WAS built on Judeo-Christian morals and beliefs and... the Bible. Deal with it lol!Oh, and another thing of note: Thomas Jefferson ***continued*** his missionary activities to the Native Americans even after becoming President, going so far as to authorise the use of federal funds to finance missionaries to the \\"Indians\\" and the building of churches for the \\"Indians.\\"This abridged \\"missionary bible\\" is still a good idea for any new Christian or anyone that is curious about the Christian faith but does not want to slog through the entire library of sacred books that make up the entire bible.Avoid the Smithsonian version of the Jefferson bible: they skillfully pick-and-choose from his 19,000 different letters, isolating text and stitching together a false image and understanding of Jefferson.

It's very interesting reading this collection of Jefferson's favourite verses from the Bible, categorized chronologically from Jesus' conception until his death. I am begrudgingly giving the book 5 stars rather than 4 because I want to support and encourage this type of thing, however I found quite a few typographical errors in the beginning of the book and they used a quote from Wikipedia which makes my skin crawl as I have a particular loathing towards it when it's cited as a legitimate source. However, this is my own bias getting in the way and I didn't want it to reflect on the actual content of the book.

So, the reader of this volume is free to seek out an explanation elsewhere that suits him.Apparently, Pastepot Thomas razored out the portions of the gospels he approved of, consolidated them in more or less chronological order, and excised the mystical/miraculous portions leaving, as he said, the life and morals of Jesus of Nazarus apparently portraying a mere mortal, albeit of gigantic stature.This, to me, provides insight both into the mind of our third President and contemporary political action groups who wish to return America to the Christian nation under God which would actually restrict religious freedom, a premise probably contradictory to our founding fathers, many of whom may have been deists and who did believe in more profound religious freedom.Had President Jefferson completed his \\"gospel\\" 1900 years ago, it might had fit into the concept of midrash mentioned by Earl Doherty in \\"The Jesus Puzzle.\\"An interesting and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"This book can be used with bible study groups as an opposing viewpoint- Jesus is viewed by Thomas Jefferson as a person who had high morals.

Jefferson examine the writings of Mark/Luke/etc and realized that the only thing that can be trusted, are when the three of them testify to the SAME effect (i.e. the resurrection section and immaculate birth are not taughted by Jesus himself, and they vary between the three accounts). He also points out the main issue: Jesus did not write his own teachings down, and unlike Plato, etc. much of the things we have today in the Bible are written years later, from HUMAN memory.

I think that distilling the ethicalmessage of Christianity from its mythical elements was certainly a foremost concern of his. Today, we cansee that the ethical teachings of the man Jesus, are not so different from the ethical teachings of mostmajor religious philosophies. I do not think that the Jefferson Bible was a plug for orthodox Christianitybut rather a call for a religious universalism that had yet to be developed.It is also interesting that the Jefferson Bible is published by Beacon Press, the Unitarian-Universalist publishingarm.

Jefferson's Bible provides such an occasion, for no doubt Jefferson questioned some of the claims of the church that he felt to be unreasonable. That's the bind. We are attracted to Jesus but often repulsed by the Church. It is only fitting that we reclaim Jesus in any way that we can. Jesus is the chief metaphor revealing humanity at its best. Through this metaphor we learn of redemptive love. Jefferson found his lens by which to connect with Jesus. The rest of us must find our own lense--and one way we can do this, perhaps, is by trying to understand what others have done. Jefferson has left us a personal \\"testament\\" by having extracted those parts of the New Testament that spoke to him. Those parts of the Scripture are for him now \\"framed and on the wall\\", so to speak, and because the book has been published, his favorite Scripture portions are spotlighted for us in this book. I'm not sure he meant his special portions of the Scripture to be on public display. Perhaps each of us who are interested might find our own set of very special parts of the Bible?

He is one of the most enigmatic of American heroes. All the ambiguity of Jefferson is well documented so I will not go into that here. I also have to state that I have a curiosity about religion and spirituality without embracing any denomination or sect. This made the Jefferson Bible doubly appealing to me. It was an opportunity to get a glimpse of Jeffersons thoughts and beliefs as well as seeing Jesus in a different light. I greatly appreciate being able to read about Jesus removed from the rest of the Bible. This secularizing of Jesus will probably be viewed as blasphemous by some Christians but I found it to be most rewarding. It was great to just view Jesus as the wonderful moral teacher that he was without having some overbearing, self righteous religious fanatic screaming and ranting incoherently. This book brought me closer to Jesus simply by not having to listen to all the negatives trappings many of his so-called followers have tacked on to his message.

I have nothing but respect for Jefferson on having the guts in his time to think for himself and see the logical fallacies in believing in the super natural aspects of the gospels. In reading this I see a lot of similarities to the Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in 1946. Jefferson would have been pleased.

He didn't realize at the time that this project would take him, on and off, sixteen years.In 1820, however, Jefferson finished, and the book has been in print ever since (though for most of its twentieth-century existence, only available for purchase at Monticello). Recent years have seen a groundswell of interest in the Jefferson Bible,\\" as it is known, and a number of new editions have appeared. Mine has an introduction by Forrest Church and an afterward by Jaroslav Pelikan. I mention this because, in fact, there's no real reason to review the text of the book itself; if you've read the Bible, you've read this (although reading this may put some of the Gospels in an entirely new light for you).Church's introduction is a wonderful, wonderful thing. He recounts much of the history of Jefferson's project, and some of the cultural influences that caused him to abandon it and take it up again later, in the process painting a picture of a few of our founding fathers. It's wonderfully readable, not nearly the dry, boring text one so often finds in introductory pieces, and it alone is worth the price of admission here.Pelikan's afterword, while not quite as fascinating as the introduction, is also quite valuable. Whereas Church focuses on the construction of the document, Pelikan addresses its theology, specifically in comparison with authors contemporary to Jefferson. Church puts the book into context with American culture, Pelikan with European.It's fantastic stuff. Highly recommended. ****"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"First, and foremost from my perspective, I liked that Jefferson focused on the man Jesus and what He taught.As I travel my spiritual path, my focus is also on the man Jesus, what He taught, how He lived and most of all how He treated others.

Very interesting and attractive book"},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Thomas Jefferson's \`wee-little book' as he called it, is dense with meaning and reflection. It reflects a couple of core matters. First, it is the picture of Jesus as Thomas Jefferson viewed and admired him; one of history's greatest teachers of ethics & morality. Jefferson seemed fully impressed by Jesus' not yet fully developed ethical system because it demonstrated his moral genius as a reformer in Judaism and, because his teachings exceeded religion, philosophy in general.There was one problem for Mr. Jefferson. Jesus' moral genius lay encumbered between the pages of a large book filled with, to Jefferson's eyes, primitive stories of miracles, healings, and divine proclamations which were anathema and completely irrational to the Enlightenment mind. So called divine revelation was abhorrent and out of the touch to evident natural design uncovered by the emerging sciences. Deism, which viewed God as setting the laws of nature in order or tuning them up, and then stepping back, was the outlook for many at the time.So that Jesus, the great moral reformer, might be gleaned clearly, Jefferson took two sets of Gospels and, with scissors and glue, cut out those verses from the Gospels expressing, what was best and, for him, true of Jesus' teachings. That meant, no miracles or talk of divinity on Jesus' part. Instead, the focus was on living an ethical life and our simple duties to God, and others. The task was, for Jefferson, as easy as separating diamonds from a dunghill, to paraphrase a statement of his. As with any portrait of Jesus, this portrait also mirrors the portrayer; and is good insight into Mr. Jefferson's ideals.First, how does this version of Jesus fare? I can speak only for myself, but for me Jesus loses nothing. He comes across just as charismatic as the Young Reformer and willing to intellectually tangle with the religious authorities of his times. In fact, having isolated the other qualities, Jesus' skill as a teacher and teller of parables may be better able to shine through; which was Jefferson's hope and goal for himself.As intriguing and practical as this Jesus may at first sound, be warned in advance that Jefferson does not omit, but in fact, includes many of the \`hard sayings' of Jesus. In fact, stripping his Teacher Jesus of Divine Entitlements and demanding belief as the gateway to salvation, he is now more concerned with people's moral behavior and how they treat others, specifically, the poor. And, those tied to their wealth, or blind to the plight of others, face being \`cast into outer darkness.' Of course, the Jesus in the full Canonical Gospels made these statements (as, again, that's where Thomas Jefferson retrieved his material), but now such statements may stand in greater resonance so isolated.At the beginning and sometimes end of many editions, there is a preface and introduction regarding the history of the Jefferson Bible and what steps led Thomas Jefferson to edit his own version which is enjoyable and insightful. All, no matter their beliefs or backgrounds, should read this book as a reflection on the thoughts of one of America's Founding Fathers, and, of course, author of the Declaration of Independence."},{"Title":"The Jefferson Bible being the life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth\\"","review":"Arrived within in one minute and is just as advertised.

Jefferson was a deist who emphasized only the moral teachings of Jesus, and excluded the miracles, the resurrection, the letters of Paul the Apostle, and the Book of Revelation. So this is a highly simplified version of Jesus' Gospel. This edition is adequate, having a good introductory letter that spells out some context for Jefferson's edition of this Bible. The page numbering is sparse and sporadic, and some typos are evident.

This is not just another book on Lean.

There is great advice and hard-hitting commentary on why companies are failing to get the full benefits of Lean. Check out the Lean Math Chapter where Offshore Outsourcing is compared to a Lean alternative.Executives and managers have a huge responsibility and they are not (from what I exerience) living up to it. The authors explain why engagement is critical as well as commitment. Management should read this book and then ask themselves a lot of tough questions. Also, the whole discussion on education and institutionalization is right on the money.This book shows why you need to change and how to do it. It focuses on the whole Enterprise and not just Manufacturing and explains why Lean is not a new fad and why it will not go away.You are going Lean or you are not going anywhere, and this book shows why you need to do it before you are forced into it by your customers or your competition.I hope these guys write another book.

McMurphy is my favorite character in any book I have ever read and though Nicholson is one of my all-time favorites, even he couldn't come close to touching him."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A novel that celebrates the counterculture and the aspects on the fringes of society, \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a novel that mythologizes the individual (even the dishonest or vulgar individual) over the restraints of society. I have mixed feelings about that message.The battle between being true to oneself and giving into societal expectations is identified here as the battle between one's mind and the \\"Combine\\" as personified by the \\"Big Nurse\\" Ratched. The action takes place in a mental institution where most of the patients have voluntarily committed themselves, a key but often overlooked plot point, somewhere in Oregon in the early 1960s. Keeping in mind the time period is an important consideration in enjoying this text, as the book is extremely misogynistic (only 1 minor female character is presented in a halfway decent light) and the ideas of nonconformity were a much bigger deal in 1962 then they are today. To take the novel out of its original context is to loose some of the enjoyment of reading it. Be careful to not judge it by today's standards.Ken Kesey was obviously a gifted writer, and he has some truly unique ways of crafting a text to resemble the scrambled mind of a person enduring electroshock therapy, and he was a clever user of figurative language. He was also gifted at crafting character, as the text has four (to my mind) that stand above and beyond the book they inhabit. The first is the novel's narrator, Chief Bromden, whose dry and insightful narration has the right mix of intelligence and self doubt to keep the reader on the edge of their toes. Another delightful and well rendered character is the mental ward patient Harding whose intelligence and wit serve as a nice foil to McMurphy's vulgarity and broad humor. Harding is a man who loathes what he truly is, and watching him mask that pain and self awareness is one of the most touching aspects of the novel. The \\"hero\\" and the \\"villain\\" of the piece, R. Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are nice personifications of abstract ideas and Kesey endows each with a depth and realism that is instantly recognizable to anyone who has paid even the remotest attention to human nature. The passive aggressive animosity and unhappiness inherent in Nurse Ratched is unnervingly real, and the chaos and self destructive behavior in McMurphy is equally impressive. The reason I think these two characters stand out to readers is because there are bits of both of them in most of us. The war between those two poles comprises not only the major conflict of this text, but also of many of our lives.There is a lot to digest in this book, and it will yield rewards on rereading it years later. Enter Kesey's world. It might not be a fun journey, but it is a worthwhile one!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A lot of things have been said about Ken Kesey's tale of a ward full of mental patients that runs like clockwork under the leadership of the Big Nurse, Ms. Ratched, but I think the most amazing facet of the tale is the voice of his narrator. Chief Broom is one of the disturbed patients in the ward, and it is through his foggy and sometimes completely irrational eyes that we watch this tale unfold.As a former student of psychology myself, I was continually surprised by how real and multi-faceted each of the characters are, both patients and staff. I think a fun game for freshman psych majors would be to diagnose each of them.Kesey's book is important on a sociological level as well. The Chief's theory that the universal Combine keeps mechanizing people until they all act in a regimented manner is cautionary, and quite relevant to the time period in which his work was written. Kesey himself actively fought against this Combine in his own life along with his band of Merry Pranksters and their antics and acid. It is fitting that his protagonists are rebellious against a stifling microcosm.What makes a person mentally ill? What is the cure? I'm not sure anyone really knows, but Kesey begins by asking the right questions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I love books and have a few by \\"Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century.\\" Very durable and last well throughout the years. Mine was brand new and arrived in perfect condition. Definitely happy :)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Last year in English 3 this was one of the books our teacher listed for our silent reading. I didn't get to read it, but now that a new year has started and considering I have more time on my hands I searched for this in the school library expecting a good read. Now that I'm finished with the book It's safe for me to say I really enjoyed reading this.First off I've never seen the movie of One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, but want to after hearing it praised as being one of the greatest movies to be created. After reading this book I'm REALLY curious now.The story is basically about this crazy, messed up mental asylum run by this evil b**** of a nurse known as Nurse Ratched. She runs this place with a smile, but don't be fooled because shes really a wolf in sheeps clothing. Seriously I think she's got bigger mental issues than the supposingly crazy people shes supposed to be \\"fixing\\" for society. Then comes Randle McMurphy! A big, red-headed, man who faked his insanity so he can avoid serving out his sentence in the hospital. I can guarantee you out of all characters he's the one, most likely, only character you'll love beside Chief Bromden. In all her years of working at the ward the \\"Big Nurse\\" is in for a challenge with this guy. He brings a fun and an rebellous, carefree mentallity into a place thats all about control and order.Everything is described in first-person by Chief Bromden, An half Native American man who fakes being death and I think mute as well. I at first found it strange because hes not the true protagonist, but after awhile I got used to it. Plus later on I grew to really like the Chief and felt he became somewhat of a hero in a way. Its not that often I read books with a first-person narrative by someone other than the protagonist. This actually got very confusing at times though, because in some scenes in the book the Chief is experiencing odd hallucinations brought on by a machine in the ward. On other times the story will suddenly bring up a flash back of his life too. This added to my confusion in some areas because the transition into these flashbacks just felt off.What I really love about this story is that it makes you think. How can you tell if someones sane or insane? Are the methods of helping mental patients really ethical? Is society what makes a person what they are? It brought up many curious questions. After this I really want to check out the movie now. It'll be interesting to see how this was put on film."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book for high school students and above. This book takes place in a mental institution and tells you about the things that go on in there. You will be surprised by what goes on in there and how each character is special. This is kind of an emotional book but if you can take it, then it is a book for you. There is also a movie for this, but is kind of different from the book. However, the book provides more details and is what the author (Ken Kesey) envisioned a metal hospital would be like. Strongly recommended for those who like to read a good book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you've ever wondered why more people don't eschew the crowd and think and act for themselves, than this is the story for you. Giving forth its wealth of ideas over repeated readings, it's message is of boundless importance while ever so creatively told. Salient among its presented ideas is the power of fear, and how crippling it can be to our endeavors. But, what happens when that individual comes along impervious to fear? Why aren't there more such folks???Though the movie of the same name is good, it pales next to the actual novel. One of the masterpieces of the 20th century, it should be near the top of every thinker's reading list. Five full stars!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel was unlike anything I have ever read in the past. The narrator gives a different prospective from inside a 1960's mental institution. Chief Boredman is a veteran at the Oregon clinic. He is the silent eyes and ears of the place. Everyone else believes that he is dumb, blind and deaf,yet he watches everything. The ward is run by a very strict Nurse Ratched. Nobody defies her because of fear of electroshock therapy, which is looked down upon society yet still practiced in the ward. The whole dynamic of the ward changes when a gambling man named Randle McMurphy is admitted. The first rebellion takes place when McMurphy rebels against the television schedule. After this, McMurphy encourages others to follow his lead and rebel against Nurse Ratched. The changes McMurphy makes to some paitents allow them freedom and impendence. In another case, McMurphy damages and drives one patient to a more insane state than before.For the most part I really enjoyed this novel. If I were to write this book I probably would have had a happier ending. Positively thinking, it would have been a better ending if McMurphy and the patients rebelled against Nurse Ratched and won. Also, if McMurphy didn't get drunk and fall asleep the whole plan to escape would have worked out a lot better. This is upsetting and I wish this would have worked out better in the end. I would recommend this book to people interested in psychology. A certain maturity age must also be required to enjoy this novel.

But there's plenty of cuckoos. This was a really great book, lent to me by a friend. I'd heard of it (and seen the parody of it on the Simpsons) and enjoyed it from page one.This is a interesting look in psychiatric/mental hospital care in the sixties. I cannot help but wonder what would have happened to Chief if he had been put in a mental hospital today - nearly fifty years' difference. It's amazing that at one point in time, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were considered acceptable therapy, but it's good that we don't have that anymore, especially lobotomies - look at what happened to poor Rose Kennedy.Anyone who has spent time in a mental hospital in the last decade would be interested to read this book - they might even consider themselves lucky. The characters in here are well-crafted, and it's hard to not like McMurphy, and it was also cool to see the Chief slowly come out of his shell. The ending is sad in one way and satisfying in another, and this is a definite classic book. Heck, both the book AND the movie that came from it need to be read/viewed. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is a poignant and striking reminder of just how blurry the lines between sanity and insanity can become. Few books are able to allow the readers full access into a man's mind in a way that makes them lose themselves, but this one does so in an achingly simple way. It will leave you with little sense of satisfaction, but with that sensation of wonder and regret that you feel after reading a book that you know may well be one of the best you will ever read. I dare you to read this book without letting it gnaw at your understanding of freedom, or sanity, or yourself. But One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel that you must experience, one you must sit with and absorb, before trying, if you must, to make any concrete sense of it. And we, as readers, must allow ourselves, and our sanity, to be lost as we read. You may just find, as I did, that in doing so you begin to see the sanity in a group of men who are, undoubtedly, insane.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a ward of an Oregon mental institution. The book is narrated by Chief Bromden, a half-Native-American who is so used to being ignored that he allows himself to be mistaken for deaf and dumb for years. The novel tells the story of what happens when the ward, run by the brutal and tyrannical Nurse Ratched, is turned upside-down by the arrival of R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy feigns insanity in order to be transferred from a work farm to the mental institution. Though Bromden is the narrator, the protagonist is clearly McMurphy, whose larger-than-life attitude and refusal to accept society's terms make him something of a celebrity on the ward. His battle against Nurse Ratched and her sadistic staff, puppets of society's machine that Chief Bromden calls the \\"Combine,\\" begins to change the other patients, and, if you let it, just may change you, too.This novel takes you on a journey with a group of men who, though labeled insane by the outside world, are insightful, enlightening, and engaging. In reading it, you will discover a world of sadism, cruelty, and an odd sort of beauty, all through a somewhat jarring juxtaposition of poetic language with the cold, concrete atmosphere of the ward. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel in which the lines between reality and the surreal aren't just blurred - they're not there to begin with. \\"But,\\" Bromden says in the beginning of the novel, \\"it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Last year, when we read Heart of Darkness, I could not get over the awesome similarities and connections between the book and the movie based on HOD: \\"Apocalypse Now\\". Boy, I am glad to read another book that was inspiration for a wonderful movie. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has been one of the most enjoyable summer reading books to date. Like HOD, there are a few changes between the movie and the book. The most noticeable change is the perspective- it completely changes the way the story is told. The movie looks at the asylum from McMurphy's eyes. But the book peers at this bizarre world from Chief Bromden's perspective. And I have to be honest, I like the ways the book lays it out much better. I am almost finished with the novel, and I can't wait to see where it takes me during the last pages. Hands down, I thoroughly enjoyed this read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Above all, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a brilliantly twisted take the struggle of a hero against the world. The villian, Nurse Ratched, is a perfectly honed tool of the social conspiracy; the hero, McMurphy, is an Atlas of a man with the courage and pride to take on an army; and the narrator, Chief Bromden, is a silent, all seeing, giant of a wise man. Each of them have enough chinks in their armor to keep things interesting, but they are each great stylized heroes that, in another setting could be comic-book super-heroes.The book is also an invictive against conformity - against the machine of post-war US culture taken to grotesque extremes. I suspect that a great many of those extremes were real, and there is a sad reality, if not to the characters, than at least to the mental institution that is the dismal, sterile setting for the book.Ultimately, the comic book high gloss sheen of the battle takes some of the sting out of the societal critique, but its still pretty potent. Kesey is a great eloquent writer, and though this book certainly was both a product of and defining factor in its era, it remains even now, a relevant and gorgeous book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Absolutely loved this book, I was surprised that it's so funny and since it's set in such a strange atmosphere out of nowhere I just found myself laughing out loud (which is unusual for me!).There's amazing atmosphere throughout - at different stages I would find myself with a constant smile on my face at some of the things the patients get up to and at others the feelings of helplessness really come to the fore.The characters are amazing, Kesey really has a skill for dialogue and ... well everything!I'm sure the story has been well enough explained already (hopefully not giving away too much) but basically Chief \\"Broom\\" a patient on the ward for almost 20 years is telling the story of the ward since the admission of McMurphy a gambling hard talking workman who apparently chose the asylum over a work farm. Broom is deaf and dumb and so has some insights into places and things he has overheard that people haven't realised.The story is brilliant and I was quite shocked at some of the developments and some very tragic twists.This is a must-read book, don't miss out!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew Over the Cukcoo's nest is my favorite book. It is the only book that I have read twice, and that is something I would definately recomend with this one. Everthing about this book is perfect. The theme(rebellion), the ending(Even if you figured out part of it), and the charachters are all unequaled in any other books.The story of Randle Patric McMurphy and the the other inmates of the institution is something that will stay with you. After I read the book I was moved.After I read the book the second time I watched the movie. I got pissed. The movie left out and changed some parts that I though were great, for instance much of Cheif Bromden and his schizophrenia. His mental illness and his memories help reinforce the idea of rebelling angainst the cold mechinized society that we live in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There isn't much else that I can put here that other reviews haven't already said. This novel is a true treasure, and deserves it's place among the American classics. However, a word about the edition. I found the print too small and the ink was often smudged on many pages. If you want to buy this book (which you should!), I would shop around for a book with pbigger print and better quality. Besides that, bravo Mr. Kesey!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have never read a book so quick as 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'.I just couldn't stop reading .It is filled with great humour and it drags you into the story.The characters are extraordinary and what i liked most is the struggle between the system and the individual.That is something very realistic because we see it in our every day life.I can recommend this book to everybody and I guarantee you won't get disappointed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is phenomenal. The way that Ken Kesey has developed the characters drew me in to the book, and made me eager to see what would happen as the plot developed, I could hardly put it down and was always dying to pick it back up. At times the book is sad, at times hilarious, but all the way through it created a real emotional connection for me. This, in my opinion, is one of the keys to excellent fiction. Another of the keys to excellent fiction is when the reader can read it as a metaphor for larger issues and ideas. This book is packed with themes that question what insanity is, in a world that seems to be insane (another one that would tie in pretty well with this is Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\"). The whole book deals with issues of authourity and control, and the efforts of powerless people to regain control in their lives.I believe this book is based on Ken Kesey's experiences working as a janitor in an asylum or mental health institute. His life and personality are fascinating, he seems to have been an absolutely amazing man. Another amazing book, which is based on Ken Kesey, is \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" by Tom Wolfe... it depicts the adventures of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who drove through America taking loads of acid and giving it to people they met along the way. I would highly recommend \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" to anybody and everybody, and I would also highly recommend not to watch the movie. I couldn't even get through it, and it really is a great example of a movie that does injustice to the book it is based on. If you must watch it, read the book first so that you don't know the story and ruin the experience of reading this excellent book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was an excellent read and comes strongly recommended by me. It is full of confusing yet attention grabbing twists that will keep you entertained throughout the whole book. The book is about a man named Randle McMurphy who is sent to prison, but is then forwarded to a insane asylum for fighting too much. McMurphy has no complaints over his move, feeling that the hospital will be better than any prison yard. Upon his arrival he opens up immediatly and shows his true colors. He comes into contact with other patients at the hospital and gains their trust as a leader, and so he becomes the leader of the men. On his quest for power he encounters a rather large obstacle, the dictator, Nurse Ratched, who is the head of the ward. After spending several weeks at the hospital he decides he needs to escape and also decided to take one of the other patients with him. After various escape attempts --foiled by Nurse Ratched-- and resulting in the death of a fellow patient, by being over electricuted in the punishment chair. He finally finds one that he thinks will finally work, he gets the chief (another patient) to help him get out one of the windows of the hospital. But then the unthinkable happens and this is where i stop summarizing the book and tell you just to read it your self to find out what happens with McMurphy and the chief. So if you want a good read that tricks your mind and gives a sense of inspiration than this is a book for you to read. Ken Kesey is an excellent author and i would have to say that I found this book to be my favorite of his. So for an excellent read, check out this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall I think this book was alright. The beginning was very boring and kind of confusing. It took a while to get used to the whole 'fog' thing but once I was acccustomed to it the reading became much easier. I think it was very interesting that one man, McMurphy, could crack the toughest person in the ward, Nurse Ratched. I really liked the turn around the men made throughtout the book. They were very helpless in the beginning but once McMurphy showed up, he gave them the courage to stand up for themselves. Bromden made the biggest improvement. Most of the men in the novel had a 'weakness' for overpowering women. I also don't think the fact that the author was on drugs when he wrote the book helped him at all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What a way to bring forth the insanity of the 1960's. Back then mental institutions we're more like state of the art torture dungeons, or at least that's how Kesey saw them as. The characters in the book represent certain aspects of society at that time. Most notable is the relationship between McMurphy and Ratched. Ratched is supposed to represent the majority of society, the government, the buisiness class. McMurphy represents the opponent to those, typically hippies and beatnicks who do not want to conform to society and it's rules. He constantly goes against Ratched and rallies the other patients behind him to reassert themselves as human beings and not just little pawns the Nurse can boss around."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Julie GuerreroThe novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; by Ken Kessey, was one of the best books I have read ever since my high school years. It was the only novel that kept me interested in what was going to happen next and I couldn't put it down for second. What I enjoyed the most is the way the main character, McMurphy, performed his role and the way the author set up the story. The novel is about a man named McMurphy who goes into the world of the mental hospital and objects and refuse to obey the rules. He then takes over the Big Nurse who had the power of authority and McMurphy leads the other patients around him to experience fun and happiness. McMurphy does this by promoting gambling and he sneaks in women in the ward. His only goal in this novel is to reduce the other patien't fears toward the Big Nurse and to forget about the rules for once and have fun. Overall, this is a very interesting, enjuyable and a funny novel, and I defintely recommend it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When it comes right down to it, it's not that the book was sad, but what it had to say about our society. All along I knew that McMurphy wasn't going to win, but I wanted him to. I rooted for him to get to the nurse; I wanted to see her crack. But it didn't. Instead we spent the whole book watching these people break out of their shells, to revolt against authority, and they don't. After McMurphy disappeares, they all give up and go home. I wanted them to stay and fight."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"And believe me, I really did enjoy it! The book is really something else.Written in 1962 by Ken Kesey, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST establishes what people face day to day, the Establishment! We in our society deal with rules, policies, and laws -- and this book throws those same laws right back in the faces of those enforcers. The hero is Randle Patrick &quot;Mack&quot; McMurphy, a man sent to an Oregon state mental hospital after causing problems in a prison farm; the other is the villain (or should I say villainess) in the guise of the &quot;Big Nurse&quot; Mildred Ratched, who dominates the entire hospital. McMurphy fights against Ratched and her system, and eventually &quot;waking up&quot; the patients on the ward.We meet other patients -- the Acutes: Harding, Martini, Scanlon, Cheswick, Sefelt, Fredrickson, the stuttering Billy Bibbit, and the narrator of the story, the supposed deaf and dumb Indian Chief Bromden, as told through his eyes.The book takes many liberties in defining the realities of a mental hospital. But it actually is much more than that. It's about the freedom of the spirit, the right to make your own choices and not be bullied by the Establishment, or dare I say even the government! McMurphy embodies that spirit, that certain rebel within us all that will not stand by and let other dictate our lives. Of course, in the end, there is a loss felt by everyone including McMurphy, Nurse Ratched, the patients, and the entire staff of the hospital.Needless to say, this book is very different from the 1975 Oscar-winning film that starred Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, both of whom won Best Actor and Actress that year -- and the film winning Best Picture. But the film doesn't haven't the endless description by the Chief as the book has; in fact, the Chief doesn't say a word until half way through the film. Kesey even went on to denounce the film and say that it completely ruined the idea of his book. However, many would disagree that the film ruined book and vice versa. (But to be honest, I did find the film much more accessable than the book.)My one complaint is, as always expected from a book, the endless description from the Chief about the hospital, about McMurphy's nose, about Nurse Ratched's breasts, about his papa and his boyhood in the Dalles. Does it really matter? Quite frankly, does anyone care to know this?Here's a lesson to everyone: UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUT A FACE ON THE CHARACTERS, DO NOT WATCH THE FILM VERSION BEFORE READING THE BOOK! You'll just get bored with description and subplots.But CUCKOO'S NEST is a very good book! I would recommend this to anyone who like that story of the underdog against the system. This book is definitely an interesting read and a good study on both the human spirit and heart."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found tihs book very intriguing especially with the multiple themes that were repeatedly used throughout the book. The most important theme I discovered was the faint line between reality and imagination. Constantly, this line is blurred as the attendants and nurses at the mental institution turn perfectly normal and sane patients into the insane. Particularly Nurse Ratched, she carries reality in her viewpoint and intends to change whatever she imagines in her mind into reality. Furthermore, the overbearing dominance of Nurse Rathched also emphasizes the importance of females in this book. The females in this book tend to carry a very strong presence among the males and belittle them to the point where they become extremely insecure about their sexuality. Constantly, new themes are brought up throughout the book, which is what I find most interesting. Themes lead to more themes, which leads to even more themes and all together the motifs create a fantastic book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"*on my mom's account because I haven't bought anything from my own*I'll admit, when I first started reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I was totally uninterested in the story. Of course, that may be because I was reading it in a camping chair outside of a pre-teen girl's bathroom at 10:00 at night while wearing three pairs of pants and two sweatshirts, drinking tea. Yes, it seriously was that cold outside. For those of you who are wondering what in the world I was up to, I was on night patrol at my camp.Anyways, that night I got to page 60 and then didn't begin reading it again until about a week ago. And, all of a sudden, the story took on a whole new light to me. I found the story at times uproariously amusing; at others, really depressing.What stuck out to me most in the story was Chief's relationship with McMurphy. Before McMurphy's arrival, Chief was a total outcast, not just because people thought he was deaf and dumb, but also because of his Native American heritage. Yet once McMurphy enters the story, Chief is included in everything that goes on the ward. Without McMurphy's fishing trip, Chief never would have shown his fellow inmates that he is not deaf. McMurphy awakens Chief to a whole new way of living and it is Chief's gradual awakening that propels the story forward."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book deserves to be a classic and may remain one for quite a long time. The first reason is that it is an adventure book in a strange country, beyond all frontiers and borders, in a psychic world, that of an asylum. It is full of suspense and typically the fight between two people, an inmate, a man, on one hand, a nurse, a woman, on the other hand. Both white with the rest of the personnel being black and the rest of the inmates being europeans, except for one who is an Indian. Clear cut adventure and action with blood, violence, wit and enough sex to be appealing. The second reason is that it is an extremely detailed trip down into the psychiatric health system, into the institutionalizing of all displeasing people, all disrupting people, all disquieting people, in one word people that cannot live in society without causing some kind of a stir. All types are studied here and all cases are refused as being the results of some repressed personal sexual drive. It may be the case, but most of the time it is just plain repressed individuals, rejected individualities, refused personalities. They are locked up away from society for this society to go on thinking all its members are beautiful, clever and brilliantly aware of what the future will be and what they have to do to make it come faster. But that is not all. The novel is an allegory too, an allegory of what changing a society may be, of what historical change may mean. The allegory follows a pattern. Change can only come from the rebellion of the victims of the dominant social order, the Combine as Chrief Bromden calls it. This is the typical revolutionary pattern. But Kesey adds the fact that this rebellion of the main victims can only come if some particular person arrives among them and wakes up in them the energies they need to become rebellious, to recapture their freedom from the Combine. The pattern of the Savior, the guru, etc. But this pattern is defeated in a way because the Combine's strategy will be to isolate this leader, victimize him in order to reduce his influence, or even destroy him if necessary, in this case with a good old lobotomy that leaves him a vegetable for everyone to admire in fear and awe. And yet things will fail for the Combine, because in any modern democratic society people are individuals and they use their individual rights to vote with their feet against the Combine. In a word the Combine fails because everyone runs away from it and leves it alone in the battlefield which is no longer a battlefield but a plain empty wasteland. That's how the Combine is forced to accept change and to change. This optimistic ending is contained in the symbolic last scene or episode, that of the self-liberation and escape of the Indian Chief. He finds out and we find out with him that nothing was wrong with him, except that his presence was disruptive for the plans of the Combine that required his village to be bought up and its inhabitants to be scattered and taken care of with good old fire-water. And that is the last level of allegory : the repressed past of a country, people, culture, individual will always finds its way to freedom and regeneration, and then the whole world will have to make do with it. The Combine, the establishment of any society, can always sacrifice some people, leaders or not, on the altar of their established power, sooner or later this established power will crumble under the pushing from those it has repressed and exploited since it took over from another establishment before it. Cyclical instating of one establishment against another and of its falling down in front of a third one. Is there any meaning in these historical cycles ? No one knows and no one can know, though quite too many people pretend to know and have a ball of crystal in the back of their eyes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is phenomenal.

All of the patients, in this story, have the same daily routine and never stir up trouble with Nurse Ratched. But soon everything changes when Randle Patrick McMurphy enters the hospital. He knows that the Nurse isn't as strong and powerful as everyone makes her out to be. He then begins to expose some of the policies of the ward and wants the Nurse to just break and lose her temper. Soon enough, the other men start to look up to McMurphy and notice that they are just as strong.I enjoyed reading this novel and highly recommend it for all types of readers. It is not only an easy read, but also gives great detail on Kesey's experiences with mental patients in the institutions. Also, I think that this novel portrays great individuality and rebellion against conformity in the 1960's."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In Ken Kesey's, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, there is one conflict idea that is the main subject of the book. When Randle Patrick McMurphy walks onto the ward the first day, the head nurse, Nurse Ratched knows that she is dealing with a very mentally and physically strong individual. Throughout the novel McMurphy tries his hardest to get the best of the nurse. While doing this he forms a very strong bond with all the other men on the ward. They start to look up to him and see him as sort of a savior. He supports the other patients by showing them that they are not as crazy as they believe they are. By bending some of the Nurse's rules, McMurphy is giving the men a strength that they have been lacking for most of their lives."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Well from what I actually read from the book, it was pretty slow. The whole beginning was boring and it took a long time for things to actually get moving in the story. From 150 or so and up, it gets more interesting because the chief talks and the Nurse starts to crack. I was mad that the Nurse was so uptight about the patient watching the world series. It was only for a few hours for about a week and that was it. That made me mad but overall, I guess the book was decent. It just needs to start faster and things need to happen without so much description."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an amazing book; I honestly wish that I would have read it long before I saw the movie. Try as I might, I still cannot help but picture Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher whenever McMurphy or Nurse Ratched were \\"on stage.\\"Much more complex than the movie, the novel works on many levels. The characters are gripping, and the psychological undertones amazing. I read this first in high school, again in college, and twice during adult life, and each time I see something new in it that I hadn't seen before. In short, it is a modern masterpiece.The book is told from the Chief's viewpoint. Chief deeply troubled psychotic, and pulling this off is Kesey's tour-de-force. Every utterance of this schizophrenic character rings true as he moves from the \\"fog\\" of fear into the real world. Not only does this progression make the novel more interesting than the movie, it makes you question certain elements of the movie.For instance, was Mac a savior, or simply a dangerous whacko? The movie points towards savior, but the savior interpretation is merely the interpretation of a troubled mind yearning to be free in the novel. The nurse, too, seems less intimidating when you move back from the Chief's interpretation of her. I imagine that she was more humane than his inner fears and the fog that stands between him and the world would allow him to see. Once this is understood, the characters of Mac and Big Nurse become less \\"cut and dried,\\" and more real, more vital and much more ambiguous. And Kesey's true purpose seems to surface. The actual characters of Mac/ Big Nurse are not important; how they react on the Chief's psyche is.Seen in this way, the novel traces one of Joseph Campbell's grand mythic themes: The liberation of the masculine psyche from the chaotic rubble of the mother dominated chaos (can you tell this interpretation is based on my college paper?). This journey, which Campbell describes in his \\"Hero With a Thousand Faces,\\" is a man's major mission early in life. To be free, a male must liberate himself from the feminine and establish himself in the real world. Mythic literature the world over teems with this theme. A man's inability to liberate himself from this dark, restraining yet safe world is a major cause of many psychoses. Kesey has managed to bring that myth into the modern world, and the effects are just as amazing and relevant as the original myths were.By the way, I received an \\"A+\\" on my college paper, which took the novel apart along these lines. I hope that a student here or there stumbles on this. There is ample room for exploration in this book that seems so simple on the outside, but so deep and complex the deeper you dig. This is, after all, the mark of a truly great work of art.At the same time, don't let all this \\"noodling\\" ruin such a perfectly enjoyable book.

It's amazing that a book can be so good, it's like you actually new the characters at some point in your life. That's what Kesey was able to accomplish, and I thank him for this rare piece of a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It is repeatedly said that the patients are in their 30's to 50's but when I read this book it sounds as if the caricatures are just teens 17, 18, 19, 20. I think this is a significant fact and shouldn't just be looked over. I think that the style of writing portrays the characters by giving each character similar problems that teens have now.All of the characters are searching for themselves in some way. Something that is common for all teens to do while they are trying to fit into society and become adults. It may be how they feel about sexuality like Billy or Harding, or they feel small like Chief they are searching for a part of themselves that they have lost that they need in order to fit into society and McMurphy is the person who does what he can to help them out.McMurphy plays a surprising and amazing character to me. He is like a friend that everybody whishes they could have. He is smart and funny, but he also has a charisma that draws people to him. He isn't afraid to test the boundaries, and he has a wining attitude that says to everybody things will turn out just like he says. I enjoyed every seen in which McMurphy showed up, his character brought hope and courage to the patients, he worked with them and gave them back what they had lost peace by peace with all of his tricks, and jokes, and laughs, he gave them back the strength and courage they lost. He brought them out of their pacified state of mind allowing them to think for themselves even when they were standing in the face of their enemies. All of these characteristics can be found in teens today, but it is a rare treat to be such a natural leader, the way McMurphy is portrayed.I remember one line in the book over all the rest its when McMurphy is talking to the patients after his first day, and he says, \\"your all just as sane as everybody else out in the world\\" that is an interesting thing to say in his situation being in a mental clinic and all that, but coming from a personality like McMurphy's its something I am able to believe.There was only one seen that I didn't like where McMurphy showed up was at the end and it was not even him who I was mad at, it was the Head Nurse. There were times when I found her character to be pleasant, humorous nonetheless. To go as far as she did in the end, to sentence him to such a life, a life worse then death, to prove that she could just to \\"win\\" and have the last say, that was sickening to me. She knew as well as everybody that McMurphy was as sane as anybody but went against the \\"combine\\" and made his living that way. I think that is justification for what the Chief did. In fact I think that if McMurphy was there he would have told him to put that pillow over his face, I know he would have because after his operation he was no longer McMurphy he had no personality left he was no one at all just a shell with a face.The only thing I would really change with this book to make it more appealing to newer audiences is the characters ages. The characters are much older then they are made to appear. There personalities don't support the ages that they have been given, and it throws me off a bit. I notice the book is much more enjoyable to me if I picture all of the characters are what I believe them to be, based on their personalities. For me they resemble teenagers but for others they could resemble something else. I think that by taking out the ages of the characters it creates a much more personal bond between the characters and the reader because you can believe them to be what ever you want instead of having them be generations older. But that could be part of why they are in the clinic in the first place. If they aren't pertraied as adults to the world, but they are of the same age as sesoned adults then what are they? Other then that I enjoyed reading the book after I got through the first few chapters that made me sick to the point that I couldn't continue to read if the book was going to continue on as it does in chapter one. But when McMurphy is introduced everything changed and I could hardly put the book down. His character adds so much to this book and there is always enough humor to take along with the darker side of what happens in the world."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I personally think that the book was a real interesting book.

Only one other time has a film done that-1992, \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" And it is interesting that both of these films differ who tells us the story from his own perspective-on of a very small and unimportant manner from the book in the same way.\\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\" is a book that sustains itself by allowing the reader to be inside the head of one of the characters and it is he, a very large Indian who everyone believes to be mute and deaf, that we learn about life in a mental health institution in the 1950's. The book is a masterpiece, an American Classic. So is the movie. both are remarkable works of art but if you have seen the film you have not read the book. And if you've only read the book, you've not seen the film. The two stories teach different things-or rather approaches different parts of our soul to teach the sam thing. I am not sure which."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The misogyny, the racism, the classism, the discrimation and prejudice against the mentally disturbed. This book has it all. There's a study where a researcher admitted himself to a mental institution to examine the way patients are diagnosed and treated. I wonder if Ken Kesey did the same thing or just wrote a story based on a worst case scenario. The pitch must have been something like &quot;ok let's see, how about a rebel rousing, conniving, tough but sensitive extravert who is placed in a new environment with a bunch of men who are used to bowing to authority and let him tussle with the powers that be to prove himself to the group. Been done before? Ok, how about at a MENTAL INSTITUTION?- Hey, pay dirt!&quot; Historically, mental patients have been treated poorly, heavily medicated and operated on to make them more docile, although that's not even the point of this story. The ideas of freedom and humanity that are portrayed here are interesting because the oppressed patients turn around and oppress others- namely the blacks and other women in this story. Dominance is gained through oppression and this book enforces the idea that only the white male has the ability to control his destiny. Don't agree? You must be a white male."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I was expecting a little more from this book. I found it hard to follow at times but overall I did like it. In my opinion, the movie is much better."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I saw the movie on TV for the first time in a long time so I thought I needed to read the book and wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I don't why I waited so long to read this book. When I did finally pick it up, I was not hooked. Admittedly I was a bit confused with the Chief narrating - I was not sure what was real and the pace was a bit slow in the beginning. But as I continued, the book started to grow on me, as did the characters, including Chief and of course McMurphy. I loved McMurphy's antics against the Big Nurse, his sacrifice, and Chief's growing strength - all which I think the author used very well to depict society and conformity.If you have not read this book, DO IT!! I took one star off due to the slow and confusing beginning. But probably when I do a re-read, it will make a lot more sense.Now I am off to watch the movie...!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#65533;s Nest is about a man named Randle McMurphy. He is a mentally sane person, but he fakes insanity in order to escape a short jail sentence he is serving on a work farm. The person who runs the place, Big Nurse, hates McMurphy for weakening control, for he said things that made the other patients who usually didn&#65533;t do anything want to do anything. Because McMurphy did this, Big Nurse wanted to finish off McMurphy by having him lobotomized. This crucifixion inspires an Indian patient; a schitzoid called Chief Broom, to break out of the hospital.I enjoyed this book because it gave me a sort of picture of what it is like inside a mental institution and how it works and what it does to people. Although the book is told in the point of view of Chief broom, the story still is very well written. I do think that if I was the author, I would of written it through the point of view of McMurphy, and tried to explain how he got there in the first place before starting the story of what happened while he was in the institution. I also enjoyed how they described McMurphy and used dialogue to describe his personality.I recommend this book to anybody who is at least in his or her teens, for this book would probably be good for the interest and reading level of a thirteen-year-old. I also recommend that the reader be a fan of a sort of adventure/horror story. The book uses details that give you graphic pictures, and it might not be appropriate for some people or for young children.(...)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School back in 1978 and I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. It concerns a former prison inmate by the name of Randall McMurphy who cons his way into a Mental Institution thinking that his life will be a lot easier there. Then he has to listen endlessly to the complaints and whining of his fellow patients who have the choice to walk out anytime but they choose to stay and be subject Big Nurse's unusual form of Therapy which McMurphy describes as a \\"Pecking Party\\".Gee. These guys all look pretty normal to me compared to some of my old teachers!!!I give this book 5 stars because for some reason my English Teacher decided it was worth reading then 60 students all had to go out and buy a copy which no doubt would have made the author very happy!!!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While Kesey's Nest is imaginative, it hardly seems the world-bending peyote-inspired trip that Kesey and reviewers claim. The novel is solidly constructed, but tends to run shallow at times. The Freudian reduction of all psychology to sex is perhaps titillating (see climax), but is banally anachronistic (hopefully). Kesey's McMurphy, like Kerouac's Moriarty, is a character of astounding vitality and transcendant humanity; and it is Kesey's portrayal of McMurphy's tragically madcap antics that makes this book worth reading. The episode of the \\"psycho-ceramic\\" salmon-fishing expedition is particularly hilarious. Some of the details of the psychiatric ward are haunting, but Kesey doesn't depict the fragility of sanity or the horror of power as poignantly as others have. Kesey's absurdity is too entertaining to be that disturbing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"did you see the movie?no?well ok then ill tell you.this is the book that made ken kesey[hippie extrordinairre] famous and funded his acid tests.anyhow,the movie follows the book quite well which is good.its all about this guy who fakes insanity in order to be released from a work farm and put into the funny farm.only its not so funny there and he decides to rebel.it will take you through a range of emotions from hysteria to balling your eyes out.its a great book everbody should read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a very good book. I read it because my dad told me that the movie was very good. So I read the book. This book is very detailed. I recommend this book anyone who enjoys reading and loves to read new and interesting books. This book was real interesting to me because it pulled me in. I was into this book very much. I was like one of the characters in the book. The author was real cool about this story. I recommend this book to family, friends, and strangers. This book got me interested again in reading. Now I would like to go pick up another book like this and read it because it pulled me in. The understanding of this book was easy. I just kept on reading and reading this book. I think that the movie is going to be much better because it gives a visual presentation of the book. But if you already have a good imagination then you don't need the movie. If you visualize this book as you are reading it then you are in good shape because it becomes more fun and more interesting to you. Believe me, I really hate reading but this book changed that.

The story was well written and the plot consistent, but I often found myself wanting to throw the book away. It starts off promising, explaining a mental ward and a new guy starts a stir. I read farther though, and started to realize this was not what I expected. There are constant halucinations by the narrator Chief Bromden, and the new patient McMurphy does not cause as much trouble as the start of the novel makes it seem he would. Often, I would crave some action or atleast good drama, and I would end up falling asleep cradling the book. I am not saying there is no plot development or scenes of action, people die and events occur, but I was not very impressed with the book as a whole. Ken Kesey needs a little more action and a lot less filler in this book. For me, he barely kept my attention and interest. Unless you like to read a muddle of strewn thoughts and little action, I don't recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Chief Bromden main character and has been a patient in the Oregon psychiatric hospital for ten years. He suffers from paranoia, hallucinations and delusions. Bromden spends his life and hospital time in fear of an imaginary force called the combine. The combine is force that attempts to control society and pushes people into fall into conformity. The reason that he makes such a good narrator is that he pretends to be deaf and dumb and sits and listens and is able to hear things that are not supposed to heard. The hospital patients are separated into two groups the Acute's, who can be cured, and Chronics, who cannot be cured, they are all male. The hospital is controlled by Nurse Ratched, an extremely strict woman. She encourages people to stay sick by creating traps that the patients fall in to thus causing patients to stay sicker longer. There are treatments for patients that do not follow the rules, they are sent in to receive electroshock treatments and lobotomy, even though these treatments are no longer favored by the medical community the hospital still uses them, because Nurse Ratched uses them to stay in control, she uses them to create fear in her ward. Randle McMurphy arrives from the Pendleton Work Farm he seems to be \\"normal\\" he is calm and cool and introduces himself as a man who loves women, cards and drugs. Although it does not seem like McMurphy and Bromden would have anything in common but it turns out that Bromden lets McMurphy in on the fact that he is neither deaf nor dumb and when McMurphy was a child he did the same thing. Although other patients tell McMurphy that there is no defying Nurse Ratched he attempts to deceive her and question her power. Other patients follow his lead and begin to work with McMurphy with things such as refusing to clean. McMurphy eventually learns that involuntarily committed patients are stuck in the hospital until the staff decides they are cured. When McMurphy realizes that he is at Nurse Ratched's mercy, he starts to follow the rules. He sees the power of the electroshock treatments 1st hand and becomes genuinely frightened of the hospital staff. McMurphy arranges a fishing trip for himself and ten other patients, he shows the patients that the outside world is not as scary as it seems and he shows them how to be \\"men\\" by teaching them to catch big fish on their own. McMurphy and Bromden get into a fistfight with the hospital aides when they are attempting to defend George Sorenson. After this incident they are both sent in for electroshock therapy. The patients try to get McMurphy to escape, but he has arranged a date for Billy with a prostitute named Candy, and he refuses to let Billy down. McMurphy bribes Mr. Turkle, the night aide, to sneak Candy into the hospital and they have a party on the ward. Billy has sex with Candy while McMurphy and the other patients smoke marijuana and drink. The aides discover the mess the next morning and suddenly the hospital is crazy, when Nurse Ratched finds Billy with Candy, she threatens to tell Billy's mother. Billy freaks out commits suicide by cutting his throat. McMurphy tries to strangle Nurse Ratched and for revenge she has him lobotomized, and he returns to the ward incompetent. After this they no longer find Nurse Ratched powerful and the patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out of the hospital. Bromden murders McMurphy in his bed and since he has recovered he leaves the mental hospital by breaking through a window."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This review is for the Penguin Books paperback edition, 2003, with illustrations by Ken Kesey and introduction by Robert Faggen. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, first published in 1962, was Ken Kesey's debut novel.The setting is a ward at a hospital for the mentally ill, probably in the late fifty's. Chief Nurse Ratched has absolute control over her ward. Through insinuation and intimidation, she has oppressed the patients, aides, junior nurses and even the ward doctor into wimps. We see this through the eyes of the narrator, Big Chief Bromden Jr., a half-Indian who pretends he is a deaf-mute. The staff ignores him, and allows him to clean the staff room during their meetings. He's the all knowing fly on the wall.Enter the new admission, Randal Patrick McMurphy, the roughneck gambler who got himself transferred to a mental hospital to escape the rigors of a prison work farm. McMurphy considers most of the patients essentially sane, and cannot understand why they have allowed Nurse Ratched to dominate and humiliate them. McMurphy rallies his fellow inmates towards mutiny in a long battle to undermine Nurse Ratched's authority.Weaved into ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a social commentary on the mid-century ideas for treatment of those who could not or would not conform to normality. The novel, and the subsequent movie and play, undoubtedly helped popularize the need for change. Although that is behind us, this entertaining and often hilarious read remains."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Having read Cockoos Nest as least three times since the 1970's I want to look at Cuckoos Nest from another angle. Popularly seen as a struggle against the Establishment this novel was the darling of the 60s generation. I have to admit, after my first reading I saw Nurse Ratched as the Establishment and Murphy as the Free Spirit who comes against it. But older and wiser now, I see it differently.This is not a novel against the establishment but against tyranny. The Establishment is presented benignly- it is the county police who arrested McMurphy, it is the jails across the Pacific Northwest that McMurphy was a frequent visitor, it is the doctors who are intimidated by Nurse Ratched it is the nurses who just try to do their jobs. These are not evil people; rather they are people who are trying to make the world we live in a good place to live. McMurphy, for the most part, is getting just what he deserves- he is a con-man who gets caught. Only in trying to manipulate the system for his own ends, does he find himself in the domain of Nurse Ratched and begins his epic struggle against tyranny. As we read this novel it is clear that Nurse Ratched is the anomaly. She misses the bad old days of the mental hospital when she ruled with an iron hand- she intimidates the doctors, nurses, staff and patients for her own ends. It is only in his encounter with Nurse Ratched that McMurphy becomes a hero.But McMurphy is a tragic hero. He does not understand the power that Big Nurse wields. The object of war is victory, not making a statement. He makes a statement and loses the war- Billy commits suicide, McMurphy is lobotomized, and the rest of the acutes are traumatized. Throughout the book, McMurphy is warned by others than Big Nurse of the consequences of his behavior; yet, he persists until, in the end, he loses.One more observation, the language of this book is beautiful. It grabs you by the throat and drags you into McMurphys world. Not an easy book to read, but well worth the effort. Speaking about language, one sentence had over 170 words in it. Wow! It takes a master at the English language to pull off a feat like that and keep the readers interest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you haven't read this book - DO NOT see the movie, just read this book.

If you want to know THE axial figure who straddled the Beat Generation and MY Generation, then you must read Kesey.

It will make you feel confused. It will make you feel smart. It will do whatever it is a book has to do to keep the reader's fullest attention. Not only will you enjoy reading this book it will move you emotionally.In this book I believe Kesey is trying to make two points:The first one is that being a leader not only allows yourself to be great but also brings out the best in others. Secondily, never try too hard to beat or defeat something or someone who has a higher power of authority than you do. You may win some battles but never will win the war.Kesey demonstrates these points in an enjoyable way in an incredible book. That you must read to believe!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's anti-establishment novel has proven itself through numerous printings and cover art changes. The truth is that this is a work that should be recommended reading at every college campus. Using a classic formula of good vs. evil, overlord vs. underdog, and man vs. society, Kesey takes readers through life in a now outdated, but largely stereotypical model of a mental institution. His humor is wicked and the characters are unforgettable. You will find yourself wondering if you are merely a cog in the wheel or if you, too, have been persecuted for being an individual. Find out where many modern cultural references originated and read this book. Questioning authority is necessary today--possibly more than ever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an American original, and a true classic of the literature. It is a book that is at once disturbing, tragic, vibrant, hopeful, and poignant. It is a rather complex work, and exists on several levels: brilliant allegory, biting satirical fable, or social, anarchistic, or nihilistic literary masterpiece. The book does not seem to have much in the way of an actual meaty plot - suffice it to say, it is probably more than you expect; it certainly was in my case. I recommend the book to the general reader - although it is not really an easy read (it contains some dialogue which takes some time to get into the flow of), you will probably get through it pretty quickly. This is one of those books, though, that has a deeper and more far-reaching resonance than its mere surface meaning. It has a mood and a mode of foreboding that will stick with you long after you have turned the last page. Although I have not seen the rather renowned movie which is based on this work - and although Jack Nicholson seems like the perfect actor to play McMurphy - I doubt that it contains the wealth and depth of vitality and resonance that this book does. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a true classic of 20th century American literature, and comes as a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Wow. This book will fill your heart with laughter and then shatter it into a thousand pieces. Kesey's command of descriptive writing, and of getting a person emotionally involved with the characters, has few equals. This book will suck you into the hearts and minds of a group of men in an insane asylum, their &quot;Bull Goose Loony&quot; Savior, and their perpetually enemy, Nurse Ratched. It is told from the position of one of the patients of the asylum, and the deep philosophical introspection is interspersed, or combined with I guess, his manic hallucinations. The patients fishing trip is some of the finist writing I've ever seen, and the conclusion will leave you with a broken heart as well as hope for the future. You will fall in love with Big Chief and McMurphey and Harding, and hate the Big Nurse and the other members of the Combine. Who is really more insane? The broken men or the woman who wishes to keep them broken? Breathtaking writing. This one'll get inside your head. Absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"...the book is better.I had to read _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ for my Literature and Film class, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a book &quot;for school&quot; as much as I enjoyed this one. I'd never seen the film before I read it, and not knowing the plot presented in the movie was definitely worth it.If you've seen the movie (and even if you haven't), read the book for Dale Harding. Those who've seen the film will remember him as.. a rather dislikable character at odds with McMurphy throughout. He was done a -great- disservice in the film, and was by far my favorite character - I read it mostly to experience scenes with him.Ken Kesey's prose is quirky and elegant - with such descriptions of physical idiosyncracies that I've never seen so accurately written - such as the way he describes Harding as trapping his pretty hands between his knees and folding his thin shoulders about his chest like green wings. It's difficult to understand at times, since the narrator, Chief Bromden, is also a mental patient on the ward and sees things differently than a sane person would - but anything he says that's hard to grasp at the beginning slowly becomes clear as the narrative goes on._One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ is made brilliant by a number of things: the beauty and eccentricity of the prose, the development of character, the layers of plot and subtext, and the subtle messages, meanings, and morals scattered throughout the pages in such a way that you learn them but don't realize they're there. I highly recommend this book - it's one that will stay with you again and again, and is warranted a second and third time reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although it often makes critical short lists, I find it difficult to get worked up about Ken Kesey's 1962 ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, mainly because it so deeply rooted in a late 1950s/early 1960s mindset that it fails to transcend its own era. It also has several flaws that tend to undercut its own statement.McMurphy is a rough and tumble gambler, con man, and all around huckster who is serving a short sentence at the county farm. Tired of field work, he feigns insanity in order to gain transfer to the state insane asylum, where the food is better and the work is less--but in doing so he runs afoul of Nurse Ratched, a relentlessly controlling woman who runs her ward with an iron fist. At first McMurphy is amused by the woman and her rules and takes pleasure frustrating her. Too late does he realize that both his treatment and ultimate release are entirely in her hands, and the two embark upon a collision course that will ultimately destroy them both.The great strength here is in Kesey's narrative. The novel is told through the eyes of Bromden, a half-Native American ward patient who has spent many years alternating between his own mental illness and Nurse Ratched's all-encompassing control, and who pretends to be deaf and dumb in order to escape the ward's horrors. Bromden is a fascinating creation and his telling of the clash between McMurphy and Ratched is beautifully wrought. Unfortunately, neither McMurphy or Ratched are greatly engaging or sympathetic characters, and as the novel progresses they become little more than symbols for the emerging clash between the counter-culture and the establishment.CUCKOO'S NEST is frequently described as a comic novel, but in truth there is little humor to the work; there is instead a pervading sense of irony which--like characters and story--becomes less and less subtle as the novel progresses. And Kesey tends to undercut his own allegory by ultimately showing that not all the hospital wards are run in the same way as Ratched runs her ward, a fact that blunts the sharpness of the story's point. My own take: read it, certainly, but bear in mind that you really had to be reading the book in about 1963 or 1964 to get the full juice of it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A very good dramatic fiction that reflects the viscosity of Keasey's non-conformist, open experimental approach to life in the American culture of his era. The Native American narrator who, not by his own intention, was perceived deaf and dumb, therefore ironically is an unhindered witness of all proceedings, is a brilliant choice. The representations of patients in their various stages of immobilization as well as their voluntary status and the artificially consensual and rather staged criticisms and convictions of each other in their so called therapy meetings are also quite effective form of social commentary. The stories of characters flow very smoothly and writing is excellent as well as entertaining without being overly dramatic, or overly autobiographical which is not always common in the books by such huge personalities or icons."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Seeing this book on the shelf for many years, I had a preconceived idea of what it may be like. I thought it was going to be detailed, dry reading about those living in a mental institution. I couldn't be more wrong. This story was told as a first person narrative and gave the reader the opportunity to drop any stereotypes he or she may have concerning mental illness. The characterization was fantastic. The ending, for me, was quite a surprise. The characters and story will stay with me for quite some time."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a cruelly brilliant novel. And that jarring juxtaposition between cruelty and brilliance is what makes the whole thing tick.Cruelty is personified in the book's antagonist, an Army nurse who uses her position and her bureaucratic influence to sustain a reign of quiet terror on her inmates. Brilliance is embodied by the protagonist, an irascible rebel who uses his wit and sheer zest for life to instil courage and a sense of self worth in those same inmates. The contest between them is a struggle for souls. It mirrors the larger struggle we face between the spiritual death of slavish conformity and the spiritual vitality of chaotic abandon. Sometimes, to live at all, one must live madly.And it is all shown to us so naturally that we never know we are learning it until we pause for reflection and thought. This is the sign of a great writer.The book also has faults. For one thing, it is sexist. The women are either emotional fascists, like Ratched; or spineless, like the other nurses and Bromden's mother; or tarts, like Candy. It would have been nice to see a woman with substance and backbone as a counterpoint to the depressing figures cut by the female characters. Moreover, there is a rather misogynistic subplot hinting at Ratched's repressed sexuality and old maid syndrome as the reason for her sadism. The women are placed in positions where they lord it over the men, from the obvious to the barely perceptible, and we are vaguely made to feel that this is against the natural order of things. Kinda cheesy, and frankly, a cheap shot by the author.But the book was written in 1962, before writing had become stilted and sanitized by political correctness. Perhaps it is the more honest for being what it is: a story set in a men's mental institution being run by women.This book isn't really about mental institutions or old maids or the politics of the sixties or even the virtues of rebellion. It's really about power. Power to live, power of control, power to transform and, in the end, power to escape from whatever makes us small. This theme is the skeleton. The story fleshes out the bones. In its way, it is Orwell's 1984, brought down to the level of a single institution, Big Brother replaced by Big Nurse, Winston replaced by McMurphy, and the totalitarian state replaced by the totalitarian cuckoo's nest.It isn't a cheerful read. There is tragedy and loss. Some may find the book depressing. I found it inspiring. If you can step back from the characters, the setting and the plot, and look at the author's world as a coherent whole, Kesey is telling us that the Ratched's don't prevail. The cost may be painfully high, but if we are willing to pay it, we can triumph over the spiritual strangulation that Big Nurse wishes on us all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you like to laugh and enjoy stories of rebellion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the book for you. A rowdy gambler and brawler fakes his insanity to escape the toil of a work farm. He arrives at the state hospital to find himself, along with everyone else in the ward, under the control of the Big Nurse. Immediately, he makes friends with the other patients there and conceives a plot to overthrow her. Ken Kesey does a great job of painting an interesting picture of humanity and teaching you lessons about individualism in this masterpiece. Full of suspense, humor, and emotion, this book will keep any reader excited about the next page. As a high school student, I recommend this classic to anyone. Understanding the vulnerability of those who are mentally handicapped and the inhumanity that caretakers are capable of is something we all need to be aware of.

And with little wonder; Ken Kesey does a brilliant job making setting and characters very vivid. Yet he doesn't take pages at a time (see Charles Dickens) to do so. In order to appreciate this novel, you must read every word... if you think you missed something, go back and read it again.

Read it!Now on to the subject I wanted totalk about. There is a customer review by a 6 year old girl (from 1997) telling the story in her own words. I would like to inform anyone who cares that the events the little girl spoke of were not true to the book. They were scenes from the movie with Jack Nicholson. The movie and the book are very similar, but there are very huge differences, one being the fishing trip. The &quot;little girl&quot; told the movie version. In the book version, the patients have permission to go on the trip, and Doctor Spivey accompanies them on the trip...This really is a wonderful novel and I hope everyone will read it AND see the movie to see the differences.

And it does reflect how primitive some psychiatric practices were 40+ years ago. But it is really not a story about psychiatry as it is a political, and possibly even religious allegory. It is the struggle between good (freedon) and evil (repression.) If anything, the setting is similar to the Gulag in Solzenhitsen's (sp) works. And if you want to read the book that could have been the great american novel, read Kesey's Sometimes a Great Notion. In many ways, it surpasses Cukoos Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is about a group of mentally demented men that encounter a total change in routine when a man named McMurphy enters their ward. The ward is run by a nurse who can't stand to see disorder and disagreement from the patients. She is refereed to as the \\"big nurse.\\" Everyone of the patients is scared to question her authority, except McMurphy. Through-out the story he is trying to buck the system and create a more comfortable situation for the other patients who would never attempt to do the same. There's an assortment of hilarious confrontations between the patients and the staff that will surely put a smile on your face.The style of writing that Ken Kesey demonstrates in this novel is magnificent. The story is told from the view of an Indian man on the ward who is considered to be deaf and mute but actually is not. It's amazing how Kesey showed the corruptness about the ward through the eyes of this particular individual. It will make the reader feel disgusted at times and warm-hearted at others. Kesey's novel will enlighten readers with a hidden and unexplored part of the American culture."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey offers an excellent portrayal of what it would be like to be in a mental ward only a few years ago. He doesn't try to make it seem like a nice place; he writes about what might be the harsh and awful truth. The plot of this book is always going up and down, keeping you interested and wanting to read more. The plot involves the conflict between the inmates and the ward staff, particularly &quot;Big Nurse&quot;. This conflict is seen through the eyes of many characters, especially &quot;Chief&quot; and &quot;R.P. McMurphy&quot;. R.P. is a small-time criminal who thinks life in a mental ward will be easier than hard labor in prison. He learns that life in the mental ward isn't close to what he anticipated; it's a lot more nerve-wracking. The characters Kesey creates are full of personality and each one is very distinct. Chief seems quiet and subdued because he pretends to be deaf and dumb, but we eventually learn how deeply the ward has altered him. R.P. McMurphy is loud, abrupt, and commanding. He has silent battles with the nurse to see who is really in charge of the ward. With the amazing plot and outrageous cast of characters this book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Even though One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a metal institute, it is more an allegory about goodness overcoming oppression and tyranny than it is a story about mental illness.The book contains an interesting assortment of characters:The most noticeable character is Randle McMurphy: a fun loving, gambling, free spirit who went to the asylum to avoid finishing out a sentence at a hard labor camp. He arrived and injected life into a place that had been devoid of it for long. The patients had become complacent by the routine, strict rules, and the ever-present threat of shock treatment or lobotomies if they stepped out of line. The drugs they were constantly administered clouded their consciousness and numbed them emotionally. Bromden called it the fog, and McMurphy was constantly trying to lift them out of the fog.The narrator of the story is Chief Bromden: a seemingly mute half-Indian whose has a case of extreme anxiety. His dad, once a mighty chief, was reduced to a miserable alcoholic once the government took his tribes' land and homes. Gradually, McMurphy teaches him to have courage and believe in himself. Bromdon has an extravagant imagination and describes many of the events that occur with very colorful and creative metaphors. This adds to the richness and enjoyment of the book.The villain in this book, Nurse Ratched (Big nurse), is very controlling and manipulative. A warm and caring faade is always displayed to the patients, but in reality she only wants absolute control of everybody and everything in the asylum. She has carefully selected her staff for that purpose. She constantly has a caring smile on her face, but do not be fooled. Everything she cunningly does or says is to secure control.Throughout the novel, big nurse and McMurphy constantly butt heads. The patients, led by McMurphy, gradually become more defiant, which results in a shocking climax at the end. This novel was an absolute joy to read. I could relate to the fears and insecurities many of the patients struggled with. Most of the acute patients were not crazy just sort of stuck, unable to overcome certain difficulties and were comforted by the security the asylum provided them. A life lesson to take away from this novel is that even though society, government, political pundits etc. say they are doing things for your own benefit, they may actually doing them for more selfish and insidious reasons. Another important message to take away from this novel is that no matter what pain and problems life has thrown your way, have courage to fight on. Oh and don't forget to have fun along the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'm enjoying the novel, but have noticed quite a few typos, missing periods, etc. I don't know if it was just transferred to the electronic version sloppily, or if the print edition had the same errors."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a wonderful read. It tells the story of a sane man committed to an insane asylum and its consequences. If nothing else, it certainly serves to question what is actually meant by insanity. Indeed, at times, the borderline between sanity and insanity is very grey.Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle McMurphy, a small time criminal who has determined that an institution for the insane is a better place than a prison and hard labour. However, his appearance at the asylum serves as the beginning of a series of events whereby the system is stressed but, in the end, grinds down the likes of McMurphy. No matter how hard he tries, McMurphy cannot beat the system. Ultimately, it is the system that wins.Ken Kesey has written a roller coaster of a story. A ride of ups and downs that is really quite compelling. It is told by Chief Bromden, a half caste American Indian who feigns being deaf and dumb but is, nonetheless, a keen observer of events. But Bromden is not deaf and dumb. It is simply that people believe this to be the case. McMurphy is the only person who realizes his secret.Rather than outline the plot here in greater detail, I recommend this book to all readers of modern literature. Yes, the system wins but, along the way, it is vigorously challenged. It is people like McMurphy who are the essence of a free society. They are prepared to sing out if the emperor has no clothes."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book, one of my all time favorites. However, it is a little bothersome that when I look for it my Kindle its filed under Chuck Palahniuk, who is a fine author, but who also had NOTHING to do with this writing of this book.Seriously, what the heck, you should fix that Amazon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey creates a world that should be surprisingly dissimilar to our own, but is not. The setting is located almost completely in a mental hospital. The world that is described might as well be the mirror image of our own society. His style and his relationship with the characters that he picks apart for us is astonishing.Kesey is an amazing writer who digs deep into the character of \\"Chief\\" Bromden. He hints lightly at the experiments of the past and of the future that were performed and would be performed on patients in mental facilities around the world. One of the most common hints is to frontal lobotomies which becomes significant much later in the story. The horrid concept of a lobotomy is also accompanied by general authorial gestures to disorders. Some are obvious like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder while others can only be guessed at. The world outside the mental hospital, which tends not to be much different form the inside, is populated by nature but also a definitive presence of repetition, stagnation, annexation of creativity, and replicas. This theme is represented in the system that the mental hospital is run as.Our narrator, \\"Chief\\" Bromden pretends to be deaf and dumb so that he can secretly acquire information during his stay, which is inexplicably long, on the ward. Unfortunately, what he does with that information is nothing. Even when McMurphy arrives and he begins to drag Bromden out of his shell he continues to stay quiet about the intel he gathers. He is quiet, sensitive to his surroundings when he's not hallucinating, yet unreliable because he cannot, at first, tell what is reality and what isn't. Frankly, I believe that this is never actually resolved since reality is a perspective, like an opinion, that not everybody shares the same truths to. At first he hallucinates repeatedly to escape from the problems of this world, the ward, and says at one point \\"You were safe from the enemy, but you were awfully alone.\\" McMurphy, however, would change that.Before getting into that, however, the system should be reviewed. The system should be run by the doctor but is instead run by the Big Nurse. Three \\"black boy's\\" are like her henchmen in the process. The boy's work like a tripod and can rarely function without the help of the other two. They are sinister but it's made clear that they should not be. The system outside of the mental hospital and the system inside run by Nurse Ratched created them.Nurse Ratched is and should be hated by the reader. There is this love/fear/hate of Nurse Ratched when it comes to the perspective of the incarcerated psychotics on the ward. However, she is, in total, to be hated. She has a false smile slapped on her face constantly, embodies machinery and ice imagery, and encourages betrayal and absolute order on her ward. She digs into the minds of the weak like a needle and wiggles around in there until the world complies to her. However, Bromden and many of the other men on the ward soon realize that she should be pitied. It's a fleeting thought, but she should. She, like the black boys and the actual \\"psychotics\\", is a product of society. A product of the system. One of her main problems is that she tries to hide and subvert her feminism to get by in a masculine world and to hold all the power. She knows no other way of existing and that, in of itself, is sad. In a more obscure fashion, McMurphy attempts to not only help the men on the ward but also Nurse Ratched. She just fails to listen.All this talk about a McMurphy character! He is our cure. He is what we secretly wish to be but can never have the courage or the strength to become. He looks at a system and laughs at it. He can show you who you are and never be wrong about it. He sees past the fogs of life to the point of the matter and drags it to the surface kicking and screaming because true reality is the ability to look at yourself and accept. He, unlike the system, is constantly moving and sociable. He does not stay stagnant and has this zest and rambunctious attitude that makes us wish we were kids again. His smile counteracts and ridicules Nurse Ratched's while reaffirming his stance on life.Kesey does not speak of nature much in this novel. Nature is only painted during a few scenes and it is normally beautiful. McMurphy is the representation of nature throughout all other scenes. He is, literally, a force of nature. He is chaotic, unpredictable, often calm, sometimes storming, and he makes SENSE. In an insane world he is the pivotal point in which truth can be found. Because of this he turns into the father figure on the ward. It would not be a stretch to say he is Jesus-like. The boat scene is where he has 12 members following him, like 12 disciples, and he smiles and laughs watching them come into their own skin and realize their own potential. The men begin to depend on him and only at the last is their self-dependence being seen in the other characters. In truth, he helps them to stand on their own so that his bigness, as Bromden would put it, could be transferred to the others. Then they can make it their own and become who they need to be.The novel is replete with descriptions worth rereading ten times over and a sense of awe and degradation and hope that is rarely combined in such an eloquent fashion. It follows a trend like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and moves at about the same pace. Dystopia moves to Utopia but not without its losses and pain."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Few books have the iconoclastic make up of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" Most of the book was written while he was under influence of LSD which he took with government authorization -- how weird. The story is told through the eyes of a silent Indian who fools the staff into thinking he is deaf and dumb. R.P. McMurphy is put into the asylum after committing criminal acts to be evaluated. What Kesey creates with the asylum is a huge metaphor that works on several levels at once. The narration is solid and moves the story with ease. With a 1960's type of metaphor McMurphy questions authority and fights it with humor. The other 60's metaphor is the head nurse who unreasonable and by the book. She is inflexible and represents the forces that be. The two clash and all those about the asylum are subjected to the good/evil, hippies/establishment forces. The evil force eventually smashes McMurphy, but he is set free. The real metaphor is in the ending. Definitely one of the classics from one of the classic icons of the 60's. It will sit well in any library."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There's some futility in reviewing a classic, canonical, and authoritative work of art. Society has already decided that the novel bears merit, and who are we to write, many years later, anything to the contrary? And if a review is positive, isn't it expected? These concerns are included as the subjects of this book--established and licensed authority and attempts at coup, what are or are not taboo behavior and ideas, all of which eventually leads us to make judgments and draw a line between sane and insane, prudence and folly--and these ideas are part of what makes the novel enduring.The structure of the novel is likewise unique. The first-person, past-tense narrator (Chief Bromden) is in a mental institution pretending to be deaf and dumb. How reliable can we consider this narrator to be, especially when another character (Randle Patrick McMurphy) seems to be the protagonist? It's McMurphy's actions--and the ward nurse's reactions--that truly guide the plot of the book. What can we know of the truth secondhand from such a cagey narrator?Some of the novel's criticism of chronic healthcare is still relative today. I work in a nursing home and rehabilitation center, and I have seen firsthand how difficult it is to care for people with mental and behavior disorders and diseases. Sometimes the decisions we make are not between sane and insane, but between safety and danger, dignity and indignity.The book pokes serious holes in early psychology and psychiatry, especially the brutal history of the latter. But more fundamentally, the book asks us to consider how well one can truly know another person. I cannot recommend the book more."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are books. Then there are books that get into your skull and stay there, their characters and events gnawing away at your understanding and valuation of life like ideological termites. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is one of the latter.I first read Ken Kesey's 1962 masterpiece in high school, where it reduced me to emotional rubble on more than one occasion, somewhat like \\"Cool Hand Luke,\\" which I also first saw in high school. The book has its flaws, I suppose, if a preponderance of archetypal names and images combined with a tendency to let metaphor tread too closely to allegory are flaws (which, for reasons not entirely known to me, I'm more willing to forgive here than in, say, the works of C. S. Lewis). Some would consider its raw images and descriptions a flaw, though having worked myself in a state hospital as a teenage volunteer orderly I can't imagine a more sanitized story ringing true. And any cinephile would have trouble disentangling Jack Nicholson's incarnation of Randle McMurphy in the Milos Foreman film from any of the imagined portraits of Kesey's protagonist produced by reading the book--regardless of which happens first (even now, I can't re-read the final pages of the novel without my head involuntarily playing the Jack Nitzsche score from the final moments of the film, as Chief Bromden smothers his lobotomized hero, then breaks free of the asylum and escapes into the mist).(Spoilers follow) The plot is deceptively simple: a clever, but endearing nonconformist manages to avoid a hard labor sentence by feigning insanity, but consequently finds himself subject to the Orwellian forces of an asylum and its tyrannical and sadistic staff. Locked in an unwinnable war with the machinery of institutional society, reproduced in microcosmic intensity by the controlling Nurse Ratched and a host of sympathetic inmates, McMurphy manages to escape only as does the protagonist of Terry Gillam's \\"Brazil\\"--through protracted resistance that is ultimately as self-destructive as it is self-affirming.The parallels to contemporary society--especially the paranoia-producing social ills and remedies characteristic of cold war America--are as biting as they are banal. The real force of this novel derives from Kesey's keen observation of human character and its tragic response to institutionalized power, both power possessed and power endured. The corrosive ends of enlightenment and capitalist aspirations have never been better (or more frightfully) explored, with more believable and emotionally devastating results (to my mind, the only close contender is Joseph Heller's more subtle and ironic \\"Catch-22\\").Despite its unsanitized descriptions of conditions and behavior in a mental health institution, this is a book every thinking person should read at least once. And if you think you have the courage of an Ubermensch to stare into the abyss, then you should not only read it, but come to philosophical terms with it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this book in my senior year of high school and it really affected me. I was moved by the characters and their struggles in the ward. Randall Patrick McMurphy is one of the most vivid characters ever made. You cheer for these characters all the way and really care about what happens to them. This is a classic and every kid should read this book. I think if your kid doesn't like reading, he'll have more of an appreciation for books after reading Cuckoo's Nest. 5 Stars all the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss HerThis book is about the human spirit. It will affect you in such a way that you may never see things quite the same again. That's a good thing. Because it forces us to grow in its affect upon us. It forces us to look at things we choose to ignore and by doing so, it can't help but bring compassion out in the reader! Prisoners, the mentally ill, the homeless, (this book kind of is about prisoners and the mentally ill) are brilliant people in there own way who have lost the power to run their own lives and are subserviant to those who could.. enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book. I can say that without qualification. It is one of the few books that I wished was longer, just so I could keep reading.If you've seen the movie, that's all the more reason to read the book. The movie adaptation is to this book as a movie trailer is to a movie.The book takes place in a mental ward, with a wide variety of mental infirmities represented. These inmates are controlled fairly easily by the hospital employees until McMurphy arrives. McMurphy is one of those who feigns insanity to avoid prison time, and so is not nearly as docile as his counterparts.None of this is new to those who have seen the movie, but the book tells this story from the eyes of Chief. Early in the book Chief is silent and uncommunicative. The way he explains what transpires shows the extent to which he is out of touch with reality. He talks about time standing still, fog that overtakes the ward and about wires going from the hospital into the back of the heads of the nurses, etc. These are all signs of psychosis, but they also give insight into the dynamics of the ward.As Chief regains himself, partly through his relation with McMurphy, his descriptions of the ward slowly become more realistic.It's really a fascinating and beautiful.

At first when I read the title of the book, I immediately prejudged that this book would be about insanity and the people inside. While that is just a small part of the book, it becomes an insignificant fact that you forget as you read the novel further. This novel is a fun read that just gets better as you move forward and explores more than the insane. It also explores who they are there, why they are there, and how society perceives them. It is also about freedom, and Randle P. McMurphy is just the person to show the inmates what freedom is about. Misadventure after misadventure, the fun never really stops for this dysfunctional group once McMurphy joins their ranks. Overall, I enjoyed this novel because of it's humor, suspense at every misadventure, and sense of liberation. Most of all, this book turned out to be better than what I anticipated.

Many of us think that insane people should be put in meantal wards as it would help them, but does it really help them?

It also shows us that it does not take more than one person to make a difference."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read the book a few years after seeing the movie, and after finishing it I saw the movie again. I must say I lost a lot of respect for Milos Foreman, the director. The movie is from a whole different perspective from the book, in which you almost feel sorry for Nurse Ratchet.

The book delivers some memorable lines. It's question is &quot;Who is really insane?&quot; The novel looks at human nature and shows the psychology of certain people. In McMurphy, We see a good man, A basic symbol of American entertainment. Someone who believes in having a good time. In Nurse Ratched, We see everything we don't want to be. She is a symbol of the negativity of human society. Someone who enjoys life by making others suffer. The book looks at human society and it really makes you think who is really bad"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"STORY BRIEF:McMurphy was at a work farm prison. He arranged to have himself transferred to the asylum - supposedly because it was easier and had better food than the work farm. Miss Ratched is the nurse who runs the ward. She is powerful like a dictator. She represents the System. She demands conformity and submission from her patients and will use evil and fear if she doesn't get it. The men on her ward are cowed by her - like rabbits. McMurphy is a loud, laughing (sort-of-con-man) who organizes card games and other activities for the men. She wants McMuprhy to conform but he refuses - even when he knows he will suffer at her hand. She has power over McMurphy because she determines when he may be released and what treatments she will give. She can order electric shock treatment and lobotomies if she wants.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is tragedy - there is no happy ending. It is not an entertaining escape. This was assigned reading for my teenage son, and I read it out of curiosity. I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore and forced to read things like this. Unfortunately I regret my curiosity. It was no fun, but I can see value for classroom discussion with topics such as: the all-powerful system - you can't win but you can effect changes for others - although you may suffer or die as a result. All choices represent loss.During the first half of the book my reaction was dreary. The second half was better. There were some interesting characters. There were some interesting events.One interesting scene had a patient observing \\"Never before did I realize that mental illness could have the aspect of power.\\" Gas station workers were making fun of the patients until McMurphy told them (a lie) that these patients were murderers which frightened the gas station workers. The patients then began \\"hard staring\\" at other people in nearby cars which frightened the other people.One line that stayed in my mind (I don't know why) was on page 67. McMurphy says \\"As near as I can tell I'm no loony. Your nurse don't know this; she's not going to be looking out for somebody coming at her with a trigger-quick mind like I obviously got.\\"I wanted to know more about McMurphy's background, why he got arrested, and why he went to the asylum.CAUTION SEMI-SPOILER:For me I couldn't get past the tragic ending. Yes a few good things happen to a few people, but too much bad happens which depressed me. The evil power continues to thrive. There was no justice. Sure the evil one suffered a couple of minor wounds, but evil wins in the end which depresses me.DATA:Story length: 279 pages. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

The Chief, nevertheless, hears everything around him and is very aware of the ramifications of his confinement.The ending is a tragic one, an ending that the reader will despise, but it is effective.The scariest part of this book is that I can easily see a nurse like Ratchet working in a hospital today. In fact, I have been involved in the mental health field for years as a volunteer and peer counselor and I have met at least one or two mental health professionals who were like her- drawn to the field for the power over others it brings, and ready and able to abuse that power.This is a classic novel that is emotionally difficult to read but I still strongly recommend it to any reader."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Here we go: Society is a bunch of &quot;bull goose loonies&quot; in a mental institution.

Ken Kesey has one of the most unique and thought provoking styles of writing I have had the pleasure of reading. His descriptions and deplictions of the characters and situations are amazing in the sense that he sees things as no one else would, and writes things like no one else would think to. By writing the story in Big Chief's prospective, he allows the reader to dwell in the mind of a &quot;deaf and dumb&quot; man who hears everything. I loved this novel not only because of the expressive and original text, but because it completely took over my life!!

Since then, I fell away from the &quot;essential classics&quot; that jr. and sr. high had taught me, books like Moby Dick, which, are good, but no 16 year old will ever admit to and I picked up Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot;. This one novel was what turned me on to Kessey. I looked at Kerouac websites and there were Kessey links, and after a year's worth of teasing my pal about the book he'd chosen for a report, there was no way I could've forgotten the title. I read about Kessey, and of coarse, his bus, Furthur, and the Acid Tests, and Neal Cassidy and all that fun stuff. I wondered about the book and bought it and read it. It was no mistake. With colorful characters like McMurphy and the Chief, a world of chronics and acutes, Kessey unfolds a surrealistic world that mirrors modern socioeconomic hierarchies. You have the haves, the staff, and the have nots, the patients. The staff rules over the patients like a regime, and within this hierarchy lies another like a set of Chinese toy boxes. The Chief's got no money, McMurphy's a gambler, the other patients don't know that McMurphy is swindling them, and so on and so forth. I began thinking that you really can't judge a book by it's cover, or, in this case, title, the more I read it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable stories I've ever read. The characters are so full of life, and the narration is exceptional. Kesey does an incredible job of fleshing out RPM; it's one of the few times where I've felt that I had a full view of a literary character. I recommend not even seeing the movie. I watched it after reading this and was quite annoyed, especially with the emphasis the film put on the boating trip - zzzzz..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Yes, we know. Jack did an excellent job in the movie. But the book is an extraordinary and provocative look at how people can overcome their fears and shortcomings with just the right push in the right direction. Told through the character of Chief, we get a new perspective on life in Nurse Ratchet's ward. This incredible work should be required reading for all high schools (as it was in mine!), and anyone who loves the movie. True, the movie differs from the book but in glorious ways. Such as Jaws, The shining and others. They have their differences but each pleases=the book and the movie."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a brilliantly narrated book that describes an era in our history with a magnificent truthfulness. It is a very deep story riddled with symbolism and double meanings. The characters are beautifully portrayed by showing both their weaknesses and stregnths. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is not only the tale of a group of mental patients, but also describes human nature and what lies in all of us. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have to admit, I saw the movie first before I read this novel, Im just a really big Jack Nicholson fan. But then I found that it was originally a novel, so I decided 'What the hell?' and I gave it a read. The book just blew me away. Not that the movie is any better or worse than the book, but the book gives so much more, like the Chief's visions in the night, and more of his background. They're like two versions of the same story, and they're both impeccable...."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Has to be considered one of the best American novels ever. Has there ever been a character like RP McMurphy. A Christ like figure who leads a the patients against the tyrannical rule of Big Nurse. This should be one every high school reading list. I just wish Ken Kesey would have or will write more."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is probably one of my favorite books, and it didn't take me long to read. I like the set-up of the characters and the way the Indian changes at the end. It was a very wonderful book that I recommend for everyone. I gave it 4 stars because there were some long, breezy parts."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book had some disturbing images and portrayed accurately the primitive psychological treatments available at that time. I got the impression, however, that Kesey underestimated the horrors of mental illness. His point is you have to be able to laugh at the world but mental illness is not that funny and at times the jokes were in bad taste. Medicine today is improving treatment for people with schizophrenia but we must always remember to not pigeon hole people into categories and treat them as human beings. Thats the beauty of Kesey's story: we are all human beings no more no less."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is rich in symbolism. On one level, we see through Big Chief's narrative, a clouded view of the world, and try to interpret his observations with the view point of a more sane person. On the other hand, we too should realize and appreciate that our viewpoint is never perfectly clear, and as a &quot;crazy&quot; person sees things differently than a &quot;normal&quot; person does, so too might two supposed normal people. McMurphy is also a goldmine for a symbolism. I don't think there is any ambiguity that he is the hero of the novel. He rescues the inmates. But we can also consider what else he is the hero of. As stated above, no one sees all things as they are, and so everyone can be viewed as insane. McMurphy is a hero of clarity. He makes his fellow inmates break the boundaries of our thinking. Ken Kesey does the same for his fellow humans."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I saw the movie version on this book first and thought it was good so then I read the book. The book is SO much better than the movie. Telling it through Chief's eyes adds so much atmosphere to the story that is COMPLETELY lost in the movie. And, while Jack Nicholson did the best he could, he really just didn't look the part. When I read the book I always pictured a big, red-headed Irishman, sorta like a lumberjack. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is one of both depth and understanding,it offers the reader an inner look at the workings of human society showing not only the catogaries society creates and imposes on us, but also the workings behind those catogories. It shows one mans plight against the machine, a machine which we created and fed, that on the wrong side of is both deadly and unstoppable. A very good read!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I was forced to read this novel a few days ago while knowing nothing about it (I have not seen the film version). I have to say that this is one of favorite novels of all time. It is extremely deep with many meanings and viewpoints on society. Kesey is a master writer here, I just pray that this was not a one hit wonder, which I feel it may be.

From now on I will not start reading any book that was wrote by an auther on drugs. The beginning of the book was very hard to understand and it couldn't keep my attention. I started liking the book when McMurphy was trying to get the nurse to let them watch the world series and she wouldn't, so then he punched a window out. Its really hard to understand why some of the patients are actually in the institution, because they don't have to be. Like Harding he has succeded on the outside life, because he has a good looking wife, even though she might have been the reason he is in there. I just mean that he can live out there by himself, and not be in the institution. I don't recommed this book because it is hard to follow, and wasnt that interesting."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found that I could not really ever get into this book. It took about 5/6 of the book before I actually started to get a bit interested. I did like the rowdiness of McMurphy and how he shook up things but I do not necessarily suggest this book to anyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"this book has a strange perspective, it is narrorated by the chief in the book. it has some skizofrinic parts in it but it gives an eye opening idea on how things in society are.

I cant argue those of you that adore it. Yes I see the sybolism...no I dont think Kesey is a bad writer..in fact he is a wonderful writer... I just dont agree with the book. still..Kesey has done his job. If a writer gets any type of a reply from his readers..does that not mean that they are at least reading what he wrote?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Over all I feel that this book to me wasn't one i would have read on my own. I really couldn't get into it or find a pattern or relate with any of the concepts that went on in this book. The title describes this book very well. It is crazy, hard to follow and written in a way that puts all of what we were taught in English classes to shame. I feel the simplistic writing it how it actually would have happened is a mockery of writing. The plot was hard to get into and a complete dissappointment in the end. I really feel that this book is a shame and really dont think it should have been published. It got the point through but you could only find it after you corrected the language and grammatical errors in the book. To me that is not how i want to read a book. I understand and can comprehend hard books and books that leave stuff to the imagination, with no problem. But i absolutely could not get into this book. I do not recommend it for any type of reading. Not relaxation, leisure or school reading. The only way I suggest you read this is if you are shallow minded and can forget everything you've been taught since the 1st grade. 2 thumbs down says adams and eber. J.A/3PD"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book only deserves one star for the fact that it gave me something to occupy my time for a minute. It was so hard to get into. I love to read, I read constantly. But I've never read a book that I hate with every fiber of my being, until now! I would like to have a book burning."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This wasn't a very easy book to read. It was kind of difficult to understand. Although, I was able to manage with reading about half of the book. It's hard to understand because the story is being told from the view of a mental patient. Bromden is often hallucinating and it's hard to know at times whether he's talking about the real world or if he's in his own world. Then there's McMurphy. Sometimes I wonder about him. He doesn't seem as though he has any mental issues. He just seems like a normal guy, always trying to get what he wants, when he wants. He often messes around with the other patients and takes advantage of their disabilities. Not only does he mess with the patients, though, he also tries to play games with Nurse Ratched as well. All I know is that if the book was a little easier to understand, and things were a little more clear I would have finished reading it because I did think the plot was rather interesting, but it just wasn't easy to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book broke the mold. But it appeals to a different type of reader; the taste buds required to enjoy this novel are absent in our reading pallets. When we started reading this book I thought that it would be good because it was is a classic but I was wrong, it had a horribly slow start and was predictable. However, once the book got going it was all right, some passages are captivating, but then the next couple droll on so we lost interest. The story starts out in a mental hospital where the staff has everything under control when a new patient is introduced into the hospital. It's about then when things began to go haywire. At first nobody listens to him but as the book goes on he begins to rally support and one by one he wins over the acute patents and eventually the narrator of the book. When the new patient whose name is McMurphy finds out what the Big Nurse is trying to do to him he decides to play the game her way so for the rest of the book he tries to push her buttons, get her goat, and she doesn't ever take the bait. Then McMurphy organizes a deep sea-fishing trip with his aunts, which are really prostitutes only one shows up and the Dr. goes with them, once they return things are different... If this kind of stuff I guess it would be a good book, however like I said we don't like this kind of book. However I must say that I kind of like the style, how the narrator compares everything around him to a metaphor or a simile. It makes you think a little more, I think it would be cool to be able to talk like, I don't know why I just do. Now that I've reflected back on the book I realize its not as bad as I thought it was but I still would have rather not have read this book, I would have read a better book, but I guess that's the beauty of reading books, you don't know which ones you will like until you read them. For those of you out there wanting to read this book I suggest that you think back on the books that you have read and have liked, and compare it to other reviews as well as what mine says about the book then if it sounds like it would be something that you would like go for it. I gave this book 2 out of 5 stars because it had a slow start and in my opinion that is what makes a book or brakes a book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is about a group of men in an asylum. Everything on the ward is run tight and strict by Mrs. Ratched, until a man named McMurphy shows up to show the men how to laugh and live again. Kesey's story of friendship and loyalty is easily related to everyday life. It was a fun and interesting book to read, and it definitely kept you awake with all of McMurphy's games and hysterical fiascoes to upset Mrs. Ratched, and amuse the other members of the ward. Through all of this he touches each member differently, personally, and in their own way. Mrs. Ratched tried to blame the death of Billy on him, but nobody believed any of it. They trusted McMurphy because he had helped each of them grow so tremendously, especially Chief. He was a completely different person at the end of the book. He started out so shy that people thought he was deaf but throughout the book he opens up more and more, first to McMurphy, who knew better than to doubt his mental or physical strength. Inside his rough exterior was someone with more feelings than any of the other men, and he proves that in the book, without losing his trouble-making image. Kesey tells a great story about standing up for yourself, while still being able to keep things funny at the same time. He also tells a story with a sad, yet understandable end. Even though it may have been difficult to follow while trying to translate the words and meaning of a man from an asylum, that is what keeps the reader interested. It was unique to see it through the eyes of Chief, rather than knowing the whole truth from the narrator. Sometimes the truth symbols, and hidden meanings were complicated to find, but the story is understandable on many levels, so the message is still revealed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Few books as radical as Cuckoo's Nest can stand the passage of time with such resonance. Kesey weaves intricate symbols together with a mastery that I have seen rarely duplicated. Unless one really pays attention, it's quite easy to get lost. Some symbols, the McMurphy/Christ associations, are rather easy to identify whereas other will fly right over your head if you're not careful.Bromden's schizophrenic fog, Billy's emasculated studder, Harding's irrational fears, Nurse Ratched's starched ball-cutting uniform - all ripped to shreds by Mac's calloused hands and his insistance on self-reliance and non-conformity. A truly brilliant work that will change the way you think about your relationship to a cold and mechanistic society that lumbers forward at your expense."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As I commented on one young reviewer's post...there should be a rule stating that if you have not read the book then you should not be allowed to write a review for it or even rate it. Most of the poor reviews and low ratings for this novel are from ignorant teenagers whose reviews are barely coherent and furthermore who have not even actually read the book beyond a few pages. Rant over, thanks.Moving on, I have owned this book for several years but simply never got around to reading it until now. Things to keep in mind: I did see a stage production of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I have never seen the movie. I am not going to summarize the book, I will just get to my point. I will say that Cuckoo's Nest is not by any means a breezy read, and I also had a little bit of difficulty in the beginning fully comprehending some of what was going on mainly because it is not written in any typical fashion and yes, it is written from the perspective of a mental patient whose perception is not always clear...or is it? Not only that but Kesey was volunteering to take part in LSD testing during the time he wrote the book, which he wrote from his experience working in a Veteran's hospital. The first portion of the book is a bit slow, but once you get past the introductions, so to speak, and adjust to the style of the narrator's prose it takes a turn and you can't help but care for these characters and feel what they feel and go through and how they change and evolve. You might even see some of your own experiences or selves in the situations in Cuckoo's Nest, mental patients or not.I finished what started as a difficult read within two days and it turned out to be one of the most rewarding novels I have read in a long time. I actually cried; this is now one of only three books that has ever hit me in such a way! It's an inspiring and sad story about the power of ideas, spirit, conformity and freedom. Although it may be a little rough at the start, I highly recommend getting through that part and finishing the story...you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a masterpiece of desperation. It flows from cover to cover. Everyone can relate with the great McMurphy as he tries to figure out oppressive authority. He wages war, not just against Nurse Ratched, but against all of societies ideas that have kept these people from venturing out. The people society deems as insane are really those who are sane who understand the insaneness of society. Sit back and be prepared to laugh and cry and dig every line as McMurphy throws his big shovel into the very dirt society has tossed over these characters, as well as you and I."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is more than a social commentary: it is an allegory-like hyperbole of the psychopathic obsession of the 1960s. The decade marked a drastic proliferation of books that looked at psychiatry and mental illness but garnered little diagnostic or therapeutic value. Despite the prestige of these publications that usually attuned to academic standard in intellectual circles, none of such literature had the widespread impact of this novel written by Kesey who worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital in Menlo Park, California. He participated in government-sponsored drug experiments during his employment with this hospital and became sympathetic to the patients and began to seriously question the boundaries that had been created between the sane and the insane.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is an unforgettable story of a mental ward in which the despotic Nurse Ratched reigns over the doctor and all the inhabitants. She exercises a somewhat cultic tactics to render her patients completely submissive. In what she embellishes a Therapeutic Community, an outwardly democratic entity run by patients, she imperceptibly manipulates them into grilling each other as if they are criminals. She has over the years has welded an insurmountable power over the ward that even the doctor is rendered frightened, desperate and ineffectual. She has no need to accuse or to enforce obedience because all it takes to maintain that tight grip of power is insinuation, which allows her to force the trembling libido out of everyone without an effort.The Nurse's unchallenged tyranny begins to whittle as McMurphy, a 35-year-old Korean veteran who has history of insubordination and street brawls, resolves to oppose her every step of the way and raises the racket in her ward. His defiance is justifiable: he is surprised at how sane everyone is in the ward. Nobody and nothing in life have got much of a hold on this boisterous personality, who knows that there is no better way in the world to aggravate somebody (like the Nurse) who is trying to make it difficult for him than by acting like he is not bothered. McMurphy's fun-loving arrival at the ward brings about a different shade of opinion among the staff and the patients. The latter come following him as if he is their Savior, for he is utterly different and has not let what he looks like run his life one way or the other.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is narrated by a patient in the ward, a Columbia Indian whom everyone thinks deaf, mute, and unintelligible, but who throughout the years of his commitment has overheard all the trickery of staff meetings. He epitomizes the mishap of the erroneous boundary with which the sane separates them from the insane. McMurphy's arrival and his friendship with the Indian Chief spur him on to recover his own identity and rebuild his self-esteem. The novel examines the notion of madness in the sense of its own and in the sense of the term being patronized by mental institution. The narrator's seamless observation and eagle-eyed description of the ward illustrate salient flaws of such a mindless system that targets only at reducing patients' mental capability. Kesey considers whether madness really means the common practice that confines to a mindless system or the attempt to escape from such a system altogether. Like its audacious protagonist, the novel itself is a literary outlaw."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I knew this book as one of the anthems of the sixties, bringing to the fore the themes of rebellion against arbitrary authority and the rejection of conformity. But I did not actually read the book till recently.I found that Kesey's \\"sixties\\" novel passes the test of great literature. It transcends its moment in time and gains universality. The struggle between the individual and the demands of society is nowhere portrayed as sharply and brilliantly as in this novel. McMurphy is a bit extreme, as is Nurse Ratched, but the interplay of extremes is fascinating.Do not ignore the fact that Bromden, the narrator, actually shows serious signs of mental illness. His constant references to the \\"Combine\\" and his fear of the \\"fog\\" are paranoid delusions. It's an amazing tribute to Kesey's skill that he chose to tell the story this way rather than in a more conventional mode of narration, and that he succeeded."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a modern classic and an excellent novel. Cuckoo's Nest follows the life of Chief Bromden as he silently observes the antics of the patients and staff of Big Nurse's ward in an insane asylum. Cuckoo's Nest is well written and after the first 50 or so pages I was hooked.This is the type of book that raises a large number of questions about our society. On one level it treats the issue of man vs. machine as the inmates square off with the emotionless staff at the asylum. On another it will cause you to question who really is insane and are those people insane because they are truly mentally challenged or do they simply see the world differently than the majority? Kesey shows how even the insane remain human and desire freedom and emotion and thus follows the tale.While very different in approach, this novel shares some central themes with the modern &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. This connection is revealed in perhaps one of the most thought provoking statements of the novel &quot;It's the truth even if it didn't happen&quot;I would recommend this book to all who can stand a serious, thoughtprovoking read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You don't need me to tell you how great this book is. It is a nice easy read, entertaining, but also a bold display of technical mastery of the novelistic form. I shouldn't like it actually. I spend a lot of time dispelling myths about the practice of psychiatry, myths promulgated in part by the popularity of both the novel and movie. They might not have been complete myths at the time, I suppose. We are told that Ken Kesey wrote the book while working at a psychiatric hospital, and in fact gave himself a treatment of ECT in order to write accurately about it. What a sport. I don't want to waste time on this side-issue or sound defensive, but do feel obligated to say that ECT, as used today, is an extremely humane and effective treatment for certain patients, particularly those that do not respond well to medications. It is not used punitively. Okay, that's out of the way.It is hard not to get swept up by the charisma of the Randle Patrick McMurphy, the protagonist who resists the bureaucratic order, who draws out and rejects hypocrisy, who demonstrates that laughter and joy are not only therapeutic but necessary for emotional survival.Nurse Ratched's power derives from the institutional ammunition dump. Tranquilizers, stifling psychiatric argot, seclusion, and sadistic orderlies, all creating the illusion of harmony (sterile harmony, but harmony of a sort). RPM's power comes from vitality, humor, impulsiveness, aggression, and brusque candor, amid the other libidinal trappings. In the end, though Nurse Ratched has proved McMurphy to be \\"simply a man and no more,\\" though she is able to reduce him to vegetative wilt, she has not won the battle. McMurphy's spirit was never broken. He was just a person, not a deity, not a superpower. He had all the weaknesses and limitations as anyone else, but he refused to be governed by those limitations. His humor and courage remained intact and had infiltrated the culture of the unit.The legendary circumstances in which this novel was written, well-known and well-characterized in multiple other forums, only add to the thrill of this book. We have a novel mythologizing a guerrilla attack on societal conformity and hypocrisy, and this novel in and of itself was part of the leading edge of a culture attack. And the novelist himself becomes a McMurphy in the merry prankster assault. Nice foreshadowing, both internal and external to the binding.Also, by the way, I owe a personal debt, though a remorseful one, to this book. Back in a day when I indulged in more vices, I used to keep novices in the poker game- long after they were exposed and disheartened- with a paraphrase: you can't quit now, \\"if you quit now, how are you gonna win your money back?\\"Great book. Buy it, read it. If you haven't re-read it recently, what are you waiting for? Marc Libman told you."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Be prepared to change mentally, emotionally, as well as physically, after losing sleep to read this book. As readers, we enter a world with which many of us are unfamiliar with: a mental institution. The story is told by one of the patients, Chief Bromden, who has schizophrenia. As a result, one gets a sense of what the disease really does to its victims. For the entire ten years the Chief has been there, he has been making everyone believe that he is deaf and gives way for an insightful and understandable read. We are drawn into the imaginative, uncertain, and unfortunately scared minds of the patients as a consequence of fear and hatred set in by the Big Nurse, Miss Ratched.Soon, a new patient, Randle McMurphy, is brought into the ward. The institution and its patients would never be the same. From him, the other patients are introduced to his world of gambling, breaking rules, drinking and many more surprises. For the first time in the Big Nurse's dictatorship-like care a patient has challenged her authority. Inevitably, McMurphy's touch of the real world gives the other patients laughter, something to stand up for, courage, a sense of purpose, and hope.I could not recommend a single book more. On the few times I put the book down, I would fall asleep guessing what would come. The definition of freedom is reiterated when reading about the physical, mental, and emotional state the patients are in, as well as bravery when they attempt to win their freedom back. This book will find a spot close to your heart. Be prepared to find yourself shocked, laughing, and crying with the patients. After reading this book, you will not be the same."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"For a book written by a paid volunteer to use hallucinogenic drugs, a book written by a man who at some points while writing was under the influence of LSD and peyote, and a book that funded the writer's San Francisco to New York road trip on psychedelically painted bus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest turned out perfectly normal, in fact even clever and stimulating. Considered a masterpiece by many, this novel is an extremely insightful satire of the society of the 1950's. Just as the drugs and psychedelic bus may suggest, Kesey could in fact be considered a founding-father of hippie-ism. His \\"hippie\\" attitudes shine through with this book, which in many ways challenges numerable aspects of authority and society. The setting is inspired by Kesey's work at the Menlo Park, Virginia hospital, where he was introduced to LSD by a government-sponsored program researching the effects of hallucinogenic drugs. This experience led him to continue his drug use, and further developed his opinions of society, which we can read about in this excellent book. The story starts when R.P. McMurphy is admitted into the mental ward, transferred from a work farm. He's a self-proclaimed gambling champion and womanizing sex machine, a rough-around-the-edges cowboy of a jokester. McMurphy is the one person who stands up to Nurse Ratched, the symbol of the cold oppression and conformity in society. The book is the story of the patients' struggle against the strict policy and rules of the ward. Under the leadership of McMurphy, who sings, laughs, walks around wearing only a towel, and does anything that he can think of which will disrupt the cold order that Nurse Ratched has on the ward, their adventures include everything from rowdy poker games, to a fishing trip, to a completely against policy late night party in the ward, complete with alcohol, marijuana, and prostitutes. The books end is sad, but realistic and a reminder of the control society ultimately has The narrator of the book is the paranoid Chief Bromden, a 7 foot something giant of an Indian who fakes deaf and dumb in order to hear everything and yet remain safe. It is his narration that keeps the book interesting. Bromden, always standing in the corner with a broom, is able to see and hear everything that goes on in the ward. He is extremely insightful and the style that Kesey uses to portray Bromden as a character is very entertaining to read. Bromden, a paranoid schizophrenic, at some points in the story, hallucinates. The imagery that he provides is usually mechanical and he often talks about seeing fog from a machine that the nurse controls. His hallucinations are metaphors, he describes the ward as having hidden mechanical components, and frequently he sees fog that represents confusion and fear. He depicts society as a combine, a giant machine, and all of the patients at the hospital are broken parts needing repair. They are parts that didn't fit into their place in the machine, didn't fit into the conformity of society. Not only is it an entertaining read, but also a compelling cautionary story. Kesey is giving a warning about a society centered around conformity. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is Kesey's investigation of the control of the 1950's society over the individual, bringing into play themes ranging from the importance of laughter and sexuality to the definition of insanity. The book's ending gets mixed reactions, but it is realistic, and a reminder of the control society ultimately has. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a fantastic book, a highly recommended read, both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It has been a while since I've read a book like this. I should phrase that differently; it's been awhile since I've had a good read. Ken Kesey's book had an interesting setting-it was unlike any other book I've read before.I have to admit that this book caught me off guard. I honestly was not too intrigued at the beginning, especially with the thought of reading through the eyes of a hallucinating narrator. But as I continued to read the novel, I found myself enjoying Bromden's hallucinations. The symbolism was mind-boggling. Also, the Kesey's intelligent choice of using Bromden, a man pretending to be deaf and dumb, as a narrator allowed the reader to read conversations that would have been otherwise kept from other characters.Kesey did an excellent job with his characters. McMurphy has got to be one of the most peculiar characters I've read about. Yet, he's one of my favorite characters of all time. I've never read about a character who could challenge authority like McMurphy did. Kesey was a genius-his characters are all so original. I mean, who could come up with characters like the Big Nurse and Harding? They're all so real in a sense. And even despite Bromden's description, the Big Nurse has very realistic qualities.The ultimate question that I asked myself at the end of the novel was: what really is sanity? In Kesey's novel, it seemed that society set the standards for sanity, and everyone had to conform to them. So basically, those who are unusual, or not normal, are insane. Those who cannot fit into society are simply labeled as insane. However, how does this truly constitute sanity? Society has ever changing standards, so what really determines who is sane and who isn't? Kesey's novel causes the reader to ask such questions. It all boils down to, were the characters in fact insane? I think what Kesey was trying to get at with his unorthodox novel.Despite the fact that I was not very interested in Kesey's novel at first, it proved to be a very worthwhile read. The time spent reading it was not a wasted amount of time-I actually enjoyed reading it. I advise everyone to read this classic novel-it just may be one of the most interesting books you read your entire life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best books I've ever read. And I don't use that statement lightly, because I have read some excellent books. I loved this book for so many reasons...Kesey breaks all kinds of barriers in a reader's mind. I was literally pacing around as I finished the book. I was so involved in the character's lives, I cared so desperately about what happened to McMurphy, it was as if I was in the mental ward, watching all of this happen. I felt like an Acute, sitting with my deck of cards watching the lives unfold around me.The other thing that this book left with me was the desire to question. From day 1, McMurphy questioned. He questioned the rules, questioned Big Nurse, questioned the Black Boys, questioned the system. His desire for dignity in the ward inspired the other inmates to question the system, and ultimately question the value of their lives. I loved getting to know Randal Patrick McMurphy, and I can't wait to read something else by Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel tells the story of an asylum. Buts its much more than that- its a commentary on Society in general (personified by Nurse Ratched and the attendants who work for her). At the center of the story is Randall Patrick McMurphy, seen through the eyes of Chief Broom. McMurphy brings new life to the mental institution, opening the eys of its inmates to a wider world. Through challenging the iron will of Nurse Ratched, McMurphy allows the men to see that it is not them who are crazy; that, rather, it is Society (the machine) which has put them there against their wills. It is a powerful, tragic story, one the ends with a death, but at the same time a promise of something good. I highly reccomend this one."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The novel is told in the first-person from the POV of Chief Broom. Early on, it becomes clear that he is the \\"unreliable narrator\\" in the Edgar Allen Poe sense. The Chief may be faking deafness, but it is obvious through his descriptions that he is a schizophrenic who suffers from hallucinations. It is up to the reader to sort out the \\"real\\" from the \\"imaginary.\\"Although Broom and his fellow inmates are insane, they are still good people and they do not deserve the treatment they receive at the hands of the evil Nurse Ratched. She is one of the most memorably evil villains in all literature. Even though she is only a nurse, she is in complete control of the entire hospital. What she wants is for everything to run like clockwork. She does not want anyone to ever \\"get better.\\" In walks Randall Patrick MacMurphy. Like Hamlet, MacMurphy fakes madness (in order to get out of a labor camp). He soon sets himself up as the ward's personal savior (there is a lot of Christ imagery) and engages in a war with Nurse Ratched.This is a great book that is really about non-conformity; the tyranny of people who dictate what is \\"normal\\" and what is not. The only flaw is a strain of misogyny that runs through the subtext. There is a lot of talk of how men shouldn't be bossed around by women and how they should be kept in their place. Granted, this is the characters speaking and not Ken Kesey, but the message is there. After all, this is a book that culminates in an act of violence against a woman. It's a shame because it is a great book and just because Nurse Ratched is evil, there is no need to extend the message towards women in general."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I guess that I did ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST in reverse. I saw the movie about four years ago, and then I saw the play last year. I have just now gotten around to reading the novel.For those of you who saw and enjoyed the movie version with Jack Nicholson, I would recommend reading this book. The book tells the story of his committal and experiences in the insane asylum from a completely different perspective -- that of Chief Bromden, the deaf-mute Indian. Having the story told not from the point of view of the main character, but from that of a person committed by the state for the same mental instability that R.P. McMurphy is faking, puts the entire story into a new, and very interesting, perspective.Even though I had already experienced this story more than once, I was still captivated through the entire book. Even though I knew before I opened the book how it was going to end, I was on the end of my seat until the very last sentence. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. However, this book is not intended to be flipped through at the dentist's office. Although the reading itself is not at all difficult, the content must be read together and savored."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a novel written by Ken Kesey regarding a mental instituion. The story is told from the point of view of one of the patients named Chief. Chief is a Chronic, meaning he is in the ward for life. Chief, along with the other patients, live out their days at the hospital under the close watch of Nurse Rached. Everyday was routine; nothing changed. Things were so montonous that the patients had even forgot how to laugh and be happy.Things all changed one day though when McMurphy came to the ward. People say he wasn't really crazy; he just thought that a mental instution would be a good place to relax for a few months. A bed to sleep, free food to eat. Right from the start, he began to challenge the nurse and the rules of the institution. McMurphy fought back againist their way of life and their restrictions. Pretty soon, a power struggle erupts between McMurphy and the Big Nurse.At first it started just as a game, but as McMurphy slowly realized the more horrific side of the hospital, things began to get rough. The other patients don't know what to do. They like the way McMurphy makes them feel about themselves, but they are scared too. They are scared of the power that the Big Nurse possesses. More importantly, they are scared of what will happen if McMurphy wins."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the greatest novels written. Certainly Kesey's best and the best to come out of the counterculture movement of the 60s. The book is told from the point of view of Chief, who has schizophrenia. This causes the pov to be skewed, and a certain amount of distrust in the narrator (is Big Nurse really that bad, or is it Chief's illness?) It's a heroic story, McMurphy being our (anti)hero. There's so much going on in the book, you could write a book analyizing it. I will say that if you liked the fiction of the Beats or Hunter Thompson, you'll definitely like this novel. It is also told in one of the most intersting voices - along with novels like Huck Finn, Great Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye. This i definitely one of the best novels written.I have the Viking Critical Edition of the book. Besides a great introduction, a chronology of Kesey's life, and the text, there are also three other sections, topics for discussion and paper, and a selected bibliography.Section 2 contains letters from Kesey, and selections concerning Cuckoo's Nest from Kesey's Garage Sale. There are Kesey's sketches of what he visualized the characters to look like and an early draft of the opening sequence of the story. There's also an excerpt from Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.Section 3 contains literary criticism of the the novel, and these are some great selections of the work done on Kesey's novel.Section 4 is called analogies and perspectives. It contains scientific articles on lobotomy and shock treatment. It's a great addition to a critical edition, and one that you don't see done elsewhere. There are also excerpts from Dale Wasserman's play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ellison's Invisible Man (chapter 11), Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, and Jack Kerouac's On the Road (where Sal and Dean meet). And there is a sketch of Neal Cassady written by Kesey (taken from Kesey's Garage Sale), which is great to compare with Kerouac's Dean Moriaty.Cuckoo's Nest is one of the masterpieces of American literature, one everyone should read. And the Viking Critical Edition is a great edition to have. I'd recommend getting this edition of the book, but if not, at least pick up another edition. This is great stuff."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I thought the movie was interesting, so I read the book.Then I read it again, and again. I just can't get over howgood it is. The book and the movie are very similar, but thebook is so much better. The most compelling difference is thatthe book is told in first person by the Chief, who isdelusional.The character development is amazing. It's like I know each one personally. This is the best and worst that humanity has tooffer. I can't recommend this one enough."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey brings the goods with this delightful and intense masterpiece. I read it in 2 days and will never forget it! This book has the power to change your life as it has mine. You must go into the book with an open mind and be willing to read between the lines as there is much depth and symbolism within the humor and drama.Kesey, before he began his acid road trip as detailed in Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, wrote this gem which focuses on the classic struggle between conformity and individuality, between good and evil, and tests the limits of sanity and insanity. Anyone who needs a shove telling them to stand up for themselves and what they believe in despite the overwhelming invisible forces of conformist society should read this ASAP. 1st person narration from the rather unique perspective of a dillusional 6 foot 8 Columbian-Indian, Chief Bromden, or Chief Broom as the orderlies refer to him as, who pretends to be deaf and dumb, makes the read flow smoothly.Although not for the politically correct or faint of heart, this esoteric novella enlightens and entertains throughout the whole ride and shows why it's a timeless classic. It's in my top 5 best books of all time - period. Check it out - it will leave an indelible impression."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel came out around the time the original Beat Generation was somewhat dwindling. Some consider (and I think rightly so) that it mutated into the hippie counterculture, but I'll leave that up to cultural historians. Any way you take it this is a monumental book. It certainly was an inspiration to me, a little lost &quot;weirdo oustider&quot; wandering the vacant shallow halls of high school, watching how it seemed everyone else &quot;fit in.&quot; Then, after reading CUCKOO'S NEST, it became clear to me how much more important it was to be myself, even if that meant not being part of the &quot;in crowd.&quot; Of course, there is literature out there that denounces being individuals, such as Eugene Ionesco's RHINOCEROS, but hey...I'd rather be alone than feel phony. Anyhow, as I'm sure other reviews have noted, you HAVE to read the book first or else all you will see when you read the name &quot;RP MacMurphy&quot; is Jack Nicholson's face. Also, a funny symbol I noticed: in the part of the book when the patients are all on the bus which MacMurphy drives off, I thought it was symbolic of Kesey (I think it was him anyway) and his bus of &quot;merry pranksters.&quot; I'm not sure what they were all about or what they did, but I remember hearing about them. A fine book that challenges so many thing: individuality vs. conformity, what is insane/sane, who decides? This is one powerful story you won't forget anytime soon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What can be said about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that hasn't already been said? All the verbal accolades that have been deservedly heaped upon it still don't seem to be quite enough. How do you express the inexpressible? When Ken Kesey created Randle Patrick McMurphy, Nurse Mildred Ratched aka Big Nurse, Chief Bromden and a slew of other quite memorable characters, Kesey created something unique in the annals of American literature. He made off-kilter characters likable and relatable. Characters who would normally be considered pathetic whack-job losers in the eyes of the wider society become heros of sterling character and brilliance. He created a brotherhood or fraternity out of a grey, dismal and depressing psychiatric ward, overseen by a cold, willful, emasculating, calculating, manipulative, shrewish, dominating and downright nasty woman: Nurse Mildred Ratched, Randle's and the patient's enemy par excel-lance.Wanting to avoid the labors at a work farm, McMurphy chooses to be loony enough to qualify him for a stay at a mental institution, where he will have good food, a comfortable bed and a bunch of easy suckers to con out of their money while gambling. He is a rule breaker in every sense of the word, much to the displeasure of Nurse Rathched, who values consistent and rigid routine. A place for everything and everything in its place. And McMurphy does everything in his power to get under her skin. He tries to inspire the other patients who have been emasculated by her to rise up against her cruelty. He tries to make them men, strong and sharp, as he perceives himself as being. For a while, he breaks through the barrier of their self-imposed exile, the negative impressions they see when they look in a mirror. When the cracks slowly happen, a reversal happens. The patients become strong and Nurse Ratched becomes weak. As a reader, you find yourself cheering for McMurphy and the patients; you want them to win, to succeed, to thrive, and they do have their assorted victories. In a fight of wills, battles are won, but the war is not yet declared. Nurse Ratched sees McMurphy for exactly what he is, a con man who took the easy squeezy lemon easy way out of avoiding jail time. So she has fun with him, watches and analyzes him. She has weapons at her disposal to keep the patients in line, namely electro shock treatment (ECT) or even worse, a lobotomy procedure. And she can make it happen, for the doctors and staff at the institution are either intimidated by her or in some respects, are just like her but to a lesser degree. The patients are trapped, and McMurphy says, I don't think so.After a couple of humorous victories, McMurphy learns that Nurse Ratchet is the one who has the true authority over his freedom, that she is the one who decides who leaves or who stays within the dismal confines of the hospital. With that knowledge, he does a complete turnabout and becomes a stellar patient, behaved, cooperative and non-combative. Nurse Ratchet loves every minute of it, savors her power over people; it is her water, her nourishment. And she will simply not let go of it. She will go to any lengths to protect it, for it is the only thing she has. And while there are many characters that pepper the novel, it is the voice of Chief Bromden who is the narrator in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is perceived as deaf, dumb and hopeless, but he sees more than the other patients, because he is none of the aforementioned. He is the sole \\"coherent\\" witness who gives the testimony to the light that McMurphy brings and is; he has an acute contemplative yet simple insight which McMurphy draws out, and the two become fast friends. As the novel progresses, McMurphy forgoes his good boy behavior and his submissiveness to Nurse Ratched, who would only thrive the weaker he would become. It is then and only then that the true rabble rousing McMurphy rises and retaliates, despite the known punishments that could be inflicted upon him. Receiving warnings from his patient friends, he does not listen and goes on the disobedient warpath, doing any and everything to aggravate his nemesis. Then it hits a climatic peek that can actually drain a reader with hopeful anticipation.One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest was a thoroughly engrossing read, a novel that fully represented the man vs man literary motif, or, in this particular case, the woman. One can obviously go deeper into that analysis. Kesey's novel reminded me so much of Don Carpenter's famous novel Hard Rain Falling, for the two novels are set in the Pacific Northwest, are about prison life or a kind of prison life and have that man vs nature, man vs. man element to it. They are both gritty novels in their own unique way and the traits of the characters are not always easily likable. Yet, you root for them regardless, because you think, Hey, that could easily be me. Besides the book, the movie was absolutely fabulous, and Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson definitely deserved their Academy Awards. But books are always better, so treat yourself to a great and wonderfully loud reading experience."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Everyone longs to be free and accepted for who they are. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is an extraordinary novel that portrays this wonderfully. It all starts with a mental asylum; Chief, the narrator of the story, tells us about the atrocious nurse and the melancholy patients. Everyone just sits around all day, and follows the same schedule day by day until Randle McMurphy shows up. He would be considered the protagonist of the story. He doesn't have the same beliefs as the malicious, ancient nurse Ratched. He tries everything in his power, all day and every day to change her revolting rules. He does succeed some but you can only accomplish so much. She is the head of the asylum and he is just a measly patient. Who do you think would win? There are many themes in this novel. One of the main themes is freedom. It is what some of the patients long for and what others don't think they deserve. You will see the theme of freedom in this novel often. Another core theme would be rebellion. Rebellion is McMurphy's middle name, but in this novel that isn't bad. He is just trying to get everyone to be actual people again by showing them how to be normal. For example, he wants them to laugh, watch the World Series and play cards. Also, the ending was not my favorite, but I do believe it was an outstanding ending that shows us what our world has come to and what society can do to you. Other than that, I truly liked this book. You laughed sometimes, and wanted to cry sometimes, and occasionally you would want to yell at the nurse. Ken Kesey did a great job tugging at your emotions. I believe everyone should read this book. I believe this because it shows you how blessed you are to be free and it tells you to always be yourself; to stand you for what you believe in. Any book by Ken Kesey would be a winner. Furthermore, this book needs to be read and heard."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Such a sad book!

His lessons on the psychiatric ward parallel his childhood experiences of having the white man coerce the Columbian Indians out of their land. Chief narrates while Randle McMurphy transcends the hegemony of the combine by introducing outrage, empowerment and purpose to the lives of the mental patients on the ward. McMurphy is a charismatic leader who becomes the \\"bull-goose looney\\" of the ward through his personal magnetism and moxie.One lesson of the book is that behaviors of the oppressed contribute to their own dominance. By wanting to remain safe and anonymous, the inpatients retreat like \\"rabbits\\" into the fog (anonymity). The ward is sterile of humanity with the daily activities specifically regulated to confront the patient with the futility of life. Nurse Rachted demonstrates the power to make things worse, so why risk emancipatory efforts? However, through McMurphy, the inpatients discover that it is not society or even Nurse Ratched that makes them crazy. As Harding states \\"though I used to think at one time, a few years ago, my turtleneck years, that society's chastising was the sole force that drove one along the road to crazy, but you've caused me to re-appraise my theory. There's something else that drives people ... down the road...It is us.\\"Part 4 is largely allegorical. McMurphy is portrayed as a Christ figure, sent to the ward for the sins of others, sent as a man to be slaughtered like a lamb for the sins of all men. According to Chief, \\"McMurphy was a giant come out of the sky to save us from the combine...\\" who \\"...doled out his life for us to live...\\" When going through his shock treatments, he was given the choice (temptation) that if he rebuked himself and he would be set free. However, McMurphy chose to sacrifice himself for the others and set them free.One aspect of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest that may be an abomination to the feminist movement was the presentation of the climate on the ward as being a matriarchy of repressed sexual libido. Apparently, for Kesey, emancipation entails full expression of sexuality including socially condemned activities such as pornography, rape and prostitution. Many of the men's mental illnesses were deeply rooted in ineffective relationships with women that were exasperated by Nurse Ratched's castrating group therapy sessions. Apparently, for Kesey, the liberation of society comes at the cost of women's liberation."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of the residents and staff of a mental ward, centered around the power struggle between McMurphy, the new, sane patient, and the dictatorial Big Nurse.The novel is written in the present tense, which is often problematic, but here it works well enough. The use of Chief Bromden as the narrator is problematic at times, and the reader may find himself repeatedly skimming or skipping entire pages of mentally-unbalanced monologues. The end of the novel seems rushed, and as a result the impacts of many of the novel's climactic events are diminished.All in all, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is an interesting read.

I never read the book because, well... I'd already seen the movie. But the book was highly regarded and since I hadn't seen the movie in at least 20 years, I thought it was time to read Kesey's novel.Ironically, reading the novel has ruined the movie for me.After reading the novel, I felt compelled to re-watch the movie and was surprised to find how superficial it seemed to me. Kesey was not happy with the movie version of his novel (despite all those Oscars). I had never understood why, until now. The very essence of Kesey's characters were gutted by the movie (not just their physical appearance but the very core of who the characters are and what they represent). Nicholson's performance, which seemed like a tour de force before, now seems superficial to me.The novel is written from the perspective of one of the patients (the Chief) who everyone on the ward believes is deaf and dumb. The Chief is essentially a \`fly on the wall', observing all that happens, virtually unnoticed (at least initially). His tenacious grasp on reality (his hallucinations and paranoid delusions may be the result of drugs he is forced to take, mental illness, or a combination of both) provides a fascinating perspective and allows Kesey to use the Chief's altered sense of reality as a source for much of symbolism in the novel.The movie may be good (possibly even great), but the novel is much richer, more complex and profoundly tragic. R.P. McMurphy is the ultimate doomed rebel. This is one of the best novels of the 20th Century (despite its inexplicable omission from Modern Library's \`Best 100 Novels of the 20th Century')."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a worthwhile read because the characters and the ending are so terrific. When you read about the conflict between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy, you can just FEEL the tension between them as if you were one of the patients sitting in the dayroom. I think Nurse Ratched is described incorrectly, though. I don't find her cruel so much as ignorant and inhumane. She doesn't go out of the way to torture the patients or anything, but as a nurse (one who helps and tries to cure patients) she doesn't treat the patients, or consider them as human beings at all. To her, they are just walking disease, no personalities or desires, just \\"sick loonies.\\" McMurphy, although clearly a simple hooligan and not a mental patient, may be an instigator, but he sees that these \\"patients\\" are more than their diseases. They are men just as those out in the street, but emasculated by an ogre. He is regarded so highly because he put the \\"men\\" back in the men, which Kesey's definition of manhood is boozing and womanizing. He shows the patients that they aren't as sick as they may be told to think and that they have what it takes to be out in the real world. Even though the book came off, to me, as a tad misogynistic (the women in this book are either soul-suckers, i.e. Nurse Ratched, Harding's wife... or are loose floozys), the David/Goliath struggle in this book is fantastic and the ending is the icing on the cake. Great book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey provides a powerful, humorous, and entertaining tale about life in an insane asylum, circa 1960. Although the inmates certainly have non-trivial mental issues, it is the authoritarian rule of the hospital and its matriarchy that proves the most damaging to their psyche. The ruler of the inmates, per se, is Nurse Ratched (the \\"Big Nurse\\"), who proves herself to be a controlling, conniving figure who uses a divide and conquer technique to assert her authority at all costs. She uses shame, guilt, and unbridled fear to keep her inmates in line, not to mention the antiquated \\"treatments\\" of electroshock and lobotomy.The foil to Nurse Ratched is McMurphy, a scrappy Irishman and con artist who fakes insanity to escape a prison work farm. Little does he know that the insane asylum is far more repressive than his prison work camp. Yet, McMurphy uses humor as a powerful weapon against the forces to be and it is he, not the odious staff, that produces the stunning turnaround in confidence and self-awareness of the inmates. Although he may have his own financial motives, McMurphy proves ultimately to be a martyr, whose own suffering benefits the other inmates in untold ways.The events are told through the perspective of Chief Bromden, a towering 6'7\\" Indian, who pretends to be deaf and mute. It is up to the reader to piece together the puzzle of the Chief's history, as he flashbacks to his days in an Indian village on the Columbian River and the Army. Although suffering from hallucinations, the Chief provides insight into the conditions and state of mind of the other inmates. The Chief perceives society as whole as a Combine, a vast mechanized factory that has dehumanized its victims. Through vivid dreams and his imagination, the Chief depicts the damaging effects of a non-tolerant society on those who dare to be different and non-conformists. It is ultimately McMurphy who lifts Bromden out of his fog of obscurity and back into the realization that he is a mighty man.Repressed sexuality plays a large role throughout, as it is the realization of one's own sexuality that proves to be the most therapeutic element in the treatment. Of course, the Big Nurse attempts to repress all sexual expression and shames those who partake of it. Her shame is so severe that she goads one of her patients into suicide for daring to lose his virginity. However, once this wall is broken down, the patients are able to become men again. Yes, they are still men with mental problems, but their confidence has grown and they are able to assert themselves in a sometimes hostile society.This novel is a true classic. It provides suspense, humor, and a powerful message about society. Superb."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Jack Nickolson played the role of R.P.

Being a giant, half Native American man in the 60's, no one has ever really recognized the narrator, Bromden, as a human being. However, by acting deaf and dumb, he knows everything that goes on in the hospital, since no one finds any need to keep quite when he is around. He knows so much that he can even tell you that the hospital is entirely boring. Everyday is exactly the same at this hospital in Oregon. That is, until a man by the name of R.P McMurphy enters the ward and turns the place upside down. A witty, gambling addict, McMurphy brings the patients to rebellion against the leader of the ward, the Big Nurse.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes you on a journey through the lives of the hospitals patients by way of the mentally ill mind. Except for hallucinations, seizures, and the hospital's constant sanitized smell you would think that the characters were ordinary people, which they are. Kesey brings the reader into a world where few travel; a place where most people would think that no one has a mind. He shows the true side of a mental asylum, not a house for animals, but a place where real people with real problems can go for help. It is a humorous, but tragic story of those in need of a few laughs, friends, and a medical miracle. It is a heart-wrenching story, but with a slight twist to it. You can never tell what will happen next and will be captivated by the exciting adventures of the patients."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" tells the story of a Psychiatric Ward from the point of view of \\"Chief\\" Bromden - a half-Indian schitzophrenic. The book paints a bleak, dark institution, run by the Big Nurse - an emasculating ex-Army nurse who enjoys revelling in the misery of those under her care more than helping them. It introduces a number of characters, all patients - many of whom are probably are not crazier than your average nerd or weirdo. The drudgery and misery permeating the halls of the institution change forever, when a gambling rebel-rouser named McMurphy arrives on the ward, after faking insanity at a work farm. McMurphy turns the tables on the dark totalitarianism of the Nurse - whom he calls a 'ball-cutter'; severely affecting her ability to bully others (especially him).McMurphy's zest for life forever affects those around him. While superficially a selfish gambler, McMurphy time and time again proves to be a great friend and ally; the best therapy that the patients have ever been exposed to. This irks and angers the Nurse to no end - driving her to all sorts of plots to undermine McMurphy's authority and influence.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is not the average run-of-the-mill book, as it attempts to tell the story from the point of view of a mentally ill patient. It does that surprisingly well, however, and the reader is often left trying to figure out whether what the protagonist is seeing/feeling is actually happening, or whether it's a figment of his imagination (which is how schitzophrenics must feel).For those who have not read the book or seen the movie - I cannot recommend this story enough. It's great on film, and it's even better in print. It's difficult to recommend this book enough, without betraying some of its best plot lines, so if you've read this far, do yourself a favor and read the book.For those who have seen the film - think of the book as the 80% of the story that the film never covers. If you like the film, you absolutely must read the book - it contains a significant amount of background that the movie could never cover - in addition, the book has Bromden as the main character - not McMurphy. Whether or not McMurphy is the protagonist in the book - that is probably arguable - as no one affects the setting of the novel as much as he.---In terms of publishing I do not recommend the Signet series paperback, as it contains a number of glaring spelling mistakes. Buy another edition."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest depicts a certain Native American's (Indian's) last months as a patient in a west coast mental hospital, sometime during the late 1950's to early 1960's. Kesey's first person narration and life-size characters highly intensify both the absurdity and the validity of human existence, making this novel a classic.Chief (\\"Broom\\") Bromden's narration permits the reader to view through his eyes the horrors of the ward that the Big Nurse (Ratched) and her black boys control with such precise efficiency. The Chief introduces the reader to the other Acutes and Chronics - and to a new Admission by the name of McMurphy. The reader knows, just when Chief Broom does, that McMurphy is quite different from the other patients on the ward; McMurphy's presumptuous style makes it impossible for him to be classified as either Acute or Chronic - or insane, for that matter. Because Chief Broom has remained silent for so long, everyone considers him deaf and dumb; but it is through him that the conversations of staff personnel are heard and interpreted. The reader quickly acquires an understanding of the patients' fear of the Big Nurse and of those around them. The Chief's perception of McMurphy and his knowledge of this ward are far greater than that of any other, effectively giving the novel a limited and, therefore, ultimately powerful perspective.Kesey's characters are superb conceptions of real living beings. Most of the patients develop from timid \\"rabbits of the rabbit world\\" to stronger, self-assured humans who realize that they can take charge of their own destiny. The most notable of these are the giant Chief \\"Broom\\" Bromden (a Chronic) and the Acutes Harding and Bibbit. Having been huddled within himself for years, Bromden evolves from a fearful, silent broom-pusher into a man who feels as big inside as he is physically. Harding, ashamed of his own feminine mannerisms and sexual preferences, develops into a clear-headed, intelligent individual and eventually leaves the hospital with his wife. Bibbit matures from a stuttering, thirty-something year old child into a happy, giggling adult - or, at least, almost. The exceptions are Big Nurse and McMurphy. Both display an iron-core strength; both manipulate the other characters to their own advantage; both pit themselves against each other; and both are inevitably broken. It is this conflict between the two strong characters that allows the weaker characters to find strength in themselves.Both Chief Broom's interpretations and the characters in the ward magnify the novel's powerful emotional charge. The Chief sees the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched as something bigger - something a man can't ever win, something a man's got to keep fighting - but he doesn't ever state exactly what that something is. However, he realizes that control of one's life lies within the self and that as long as a person keeps laughing, keeps smiling, then just maybe that something can't win either. Bromden realizes that for all its absurdities, life is essentially good. While he finally states he has \\"been away a long time\\" in the context of his childhood home, the reader gains the impression that it is really life he is returning to.Kesey's novel, although dealing by an extreme with the insane, gives all human life a resounding stamp of worth and value. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest keeps the reader on an emotional pendulum: laughing at McMurphy's pranks, recoiling from Nurse Ratched, strengthened by McMurphy's courage, defeated by the patients' helplessness, and cheering for their victories. It appears that for Kesey, a person without a spirit is just a blank, empty shelll. His regard for meaningful life stands strong and clear."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I love this book. I think it is absolutely genius. It just...I can't describe it. There is no other way to explain how I feel about this book.Just to add, the Penguin \\"Great Books of the Century\\" edition is the best to get. Not only does it have a beautiful (shiny) cover with an illustration of Chief Bromden, it is a sturdy and light copy. Plus the text is well spaced (unlike the mass market edition; the text in that edition hurts my eyes, it's so small and cramped). A great edition to keep of a great book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"After being told by one person after another that Ken Kessey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a terrific book, I decided to read it for myself. The first several pages of the novel started off a little slow because I was unsure of where the novel was going, but very shortly after I found myself becoming more interested and attached to the novel. Furthermore, towards the end of the book, I found myself feeling like I knew the characters and felt almost a bond with the character McMurphy, as well as some of the other characters.The novel begins with the main character, McMurphy, who has moved from a prison to a mental hospital. The reasons for him coming to the mental hospital have nothing to do with him being insane, but rather that he is trying to escape the terrible prison work farm that he was in before. Upon arriving to the mental hospital, McMurphy learns about Nurse Ratched who uses force, lobotomy, and \\"electroshock therapy\\" to control the patients. Because Nurse Ratched is an evil lady, the patients of the institution do not speak out against her because they are scared of the power that she carries, the power that she has to hurt them, and the fear that they carry about not being in conformity with all of the other patients. The novel continues to show McMurphy's desire to disobey Nurse Ratched's authoritarian control as there are several incidents that occur while he is staying there that jeopardizes his life, and ultimately ends up jeopardizing his friends life. During his stay at the institution, McMurphy meets many friends, and teaches some of them how to stand up against the evil nurse and how to show their own individuality. Throughout the novel many people, including some of the guards, begin looking up to McMurphy and the way he never becomes submissive to Nurse Ratched's control. The novel keeps the reader intact at all times, with an urge of following McMurphy's every move. The main themes of the novel deal with ones freedom, as well as, the power that conformity has on taking over a person's life.Ken Kessey's style of writing is remarkable. Although the novel is sometimes difficult to read and has many underlying themes and messages about mankind (that can sometimes get confusing), Kessey's writing is beautiful and allows the reader to enjoy the book to its full extent. Also, the book teaches a great deal about human nature and the way that mankind acts in specific situations. I highly recommend this novel to others, for its strong impact that it had on me and in addition, the way that it made me think about the issue of conformity and freedom. In the beginning, I could not seem to understand why many people recommended this novel but after reading it, I just want to tell everyone about it so that they can have the pleasure of reading it, and hopefully have a similar experience to the one I had."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I enjoyed \\"One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" because of its ability to address critical issues in society that deserve to be contemplated. One central idea is freedom vs. confinement. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are the two central characters of the novel. McMurphy represents individuality in the asylum. He does what he pleases no matter what society thinks. Ratched could represent efficiency, order and control at all costs. The fear of Nurse Ratched's control makes the patients easy victims of her rule. These patients chose to give up their freedom to be in the asylum because they are not able to cope with the problems and pressures of society. It turns out that the asylum isn't much better than the outside world. There is an enforcement of strict compliance to accepting authority.Another issue that the novel addresses is power vs. authority. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched choose to display their power on the patients in different ways. McMurphy treats his fellow inmates as equals. He accepts them for what they are and offers chances for them to forget their problems. A McMurphy act on his conscience by doing what he thinks is right. He is a metaphorical 'Jesus character.' Nurse Ratched uses her power in physical discipline and control. The other weapons that she uses are the therapy treatments. They are run like 'medieval torture sessions.' The men break down with the continuous onslaught of questions by their peers. She is able to torment and humiliate the men in this way. McMurphy represents a thorn in Ratched's side. Authority (Ratched) ultimately prevailed in the end. The shock treatments and lobotomy on RPM show the extent of what Ratched will do to maintain her control on the ward. One cannot win when they battle the system.The final issue that the novel addresses is individuality vs. conformity. Most of the men have not lost their minds. They may have lost their way sometime in their lives. Their placement in the asylum worsened their problems. Most of the ward members questioned themselves so much that it caused them to lose confidence. This is a result of their problems and the asylum. RPM is a challenge to the system because he demonstrates individuality, courage and determination. Society has labeled the mental patients as rejects. Ratched's obsession with following the rules can also be considered an illness.If you enjoyed the novel, be sure to check out the Oscar nominated 1975 film adaptation directed by Milos Forman. Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher give Oscar winning performances as Robert Patrick Murphy and Ms. Ratched."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a novel displaying pure linguistic genius reflecting on the thoughts of the author, Ken Kesey. His views portrayed in the novel were a direct result of the era of which it was written. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest was written in a time when the world was questioning the authority of governments and felt quite trapped by the idea that life was so easy to rule and could be thrown around however the forces that be pleased to do. Kesey's crusade for mental and spiritual freedom is metaphorically identified in the novel to his exact lifestyle and views of society. The novel is written in a mental hospital from the view of a mental patient named Chief Bromden. The chief is a veteran of World War II and plays himself off as deaf and dumb. The patients mainly keep to themselves and do not expose their views on society and the ward itself. Nurse Ratchet is the head nurse and symbolizes all authority and government. She is the sole reason that no one in the hospital speaks their mind and are somewhat trapped. One day a stought young buck named R.P. McMurphy walked into the ward off the street looking for an easy way out of a conviction for battery charges. As soon as he walks into the ward everything changes. His charisma and energy transforms the mental ward from what might as well been a graveyard into a ruckus of mixed opinions and outbursts towards the authority of the combine. Before McMurphy came to the ward, the patients were to scarred to speak out in fear that they would be punished. When McMurphy arrived at the ward his ways of defiance and playful conduct baffled the nurse and changed the wards view of authority. As the combine becomes more and more intolerant of McMurphy, Nurse Ratchet gives McMurphy a frontal lobotomy and shows the combine just how in control she is. The novel is a magnificent display of society shrunken into a small example. There are hero's and villains and the general population. The book is a fine display of 20th century literature and in my opinion taught all over the nation. To me One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest symbolized the fight between an under-powered hero and his people against one sole villain and her power of controlling the combine. This novel is quite good but very hard to interpret. It takes a huge amount of analogy and without it would not be close as magnificent. Prior to reading this book set aside some time so that you can fully understand it. I strongly recommend this book for everyone to read and also strongly recommend that everybody see the movie as well. Whatever you do, do not rush read this book. Parts may even have to be read two or three times until fully understood, Even though a bit hard to understand to a younger audience the material is basic just the linguistics complex."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"not only is this book emotionally competent, the compelling storytelling, likable characters and kesey's delightful sense of humor keep this one far from the &quot;typical drug induced, anti-establishment 1960's paranoid novel.&quot; i may also note that it is neither paranoid, nor drug induced! Careful reading will reveal that this book is not centered around male chauvinism! To understand this, you mustn't glance over McMurphy's discovery that it was not solely Nurse Ratched who was responsible for their malcontent, rather the enitire institution and &quot;treatment&quot; of the &quot;mentally ill&quot;! Other tips: When reading, do not focus around petty vibes you may pick up. You don't have to agree with McMurphy's lifestyle or egotistical ways, but empathizing with what he ultimately stands for (which may be difficult for some) is vital for the full comprehension of this book. hopefully, all of the english AP classes in the world will conduct valid discussions on the book for the sake of mistaken students who missed kesey's profound message. Let me rephrase the advice of a previous reviewer: &quot;if you often misinterprete and delude yourself from the themes of novels, don't read it.&quot; it will be two years before i am old enough to take an AP class! heesh. i can definitely imagine Ratched presiding over a vast communist empire!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I found this book so intriguing from the moment I picked it up. It held my attention from beginning to end. Although I found some of it hilarious, other parts completely shocked me. The ESt given to Mcmurphy and other patients, the pure hypocrisy of the treatment of the so called &quot;insane&quot;. This book not only tells the plot from the eyes of a so called lunatic, but makes the reader wonder how insanity can possibly be defined. Who's to say that one man is any crazier than the next. The paradox of giving a man EST so he is a brainless vegetable, just so he no longer exemplifies characteristics that society deams &quot;not normal behaivor&quot; was very frightening. The end shocked me, but was very fitting to the novel. Kesey is an amazing writer who has sustained the test of time. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a laugh and needing some intellectual stimulation"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The story is famous--a sociopathic prisoner fakes his way into a psychiatric hospital, and galvanizes the mild, oppressed patients, empowering them against the controlling head nurse. The book is sometimes seen as a stirring fable of human individuality triumphing over over stultifying conformity. But despite the engaging plot, the book relies on its share of cliches. The book almost romanticizes sociopathy and rebellion, casting the non-conforming protagonist McMurphy as a martyr. In real life, when a sociopath like McMurphy does enter a psychiatric unit to avoid a prison term, the results are quite different. These individuals exploit the mild mannered or more dependent patients, disrupt routines, raise the stress level by their manipulations, con the staff for medication, and take enormous resources away from patients who are there to get better rather than there to avoid incarceration in a prison. They can also be quite charming, and others (such as Kesey) may be prone to romanticize the type, and indeed media tends to find a prurient interest in the bad boy. Despite its intellectual problems, the book can be praised as being part of the movement to humanize psychiatry. Read today, though, the underlying ideas seem less sophisticated than that of a TV movie. It is more entertaining than insightful.

My fingers smeared the ink while I was trying to hold the little book open. Better to find this at a used book sale or yard sale."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am generally a fan of anti-establishment books such as Catcher in the Rye and Catch-22. Despite the fact that I really enjoyed the movie, I did not enjoy the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At times, I felt Kesey's writing was long-winded and verbose.The plot uses a mental hosptial and its megalomanical nurse as a metaphor for an overbearing government and sociey's attempt to control people. I also am curious if the theme of male versus female was premeditated. Is Kesey trying to suggest men are controlled/dominated by women? Unlike the movie, the book is told through the eyes of the Chief. While this perspective gives the story a different perspective, I had to force myself to continue. It seems as though a lot of the book should have ended up on the editing room floor. Pages at a time had nothing to say but continued elaboration.I must admit, my concept of the book is largely influenced by the movie. Despite modest differences in appearance, I could not help but picture Jack Nicholson as McMurphy. It stands as one of Jack's best performances.Kesey Has certainly written an influential and entertaining book. However, this is one case where the movie is better than the book. The pacing and tone difference between the two is like night and day. After reading it, I am surprised that this book is often required high school reading. I seems to be a poor choice to exemplify non-conformist thinking."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall, I really really liked &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.&quot; I loved the writing style and I easily got caught up in the novel. The experiences of Big Chief, McMurphy, and Big Nurse changed my perspective on a lot of things as I was reading it. It was the type of book that was hard to quit reading. I think that Ken Kesey used wonderful language and descriptions that completely captured the feelings of the patients at the mental hospital.

I can understand why it is a classic and would recommend it to anyone who has any brains and could make sense of the book. Even if they didn't have a brain I would still recommend it to anyone if they didn't have a brain (although they would probably be a patient in the book).

I have seen the movie a few times and just finished reading the book. The story is told from the believed to be deaf and mute Indian, Chief Broom.

He tells the story from his perceptions, distorted and warped that they are due to his own mental illness. When the storys main figure, Randall McMurphy decides that he has had enough of a prison work camp he feigns insanity to complete the rest of his term at the institution. When McMurphy meets the 'Big Nurse' of the ward the battle begins betweem him and her, it's a battle between their two minds over who will break the other.

The Hallucinations began by being a bit too intense, but plot develops and the character evolution is brilliantly done. The story flows, twists, turns, and leads you down an immensely psychological journey. The main characters where awesome, and the ending is just chilling. Although each strand of the story is cunningly woven and brought to a conclusion, the book asks more questions than it ever hoped to answer, and certainly that is the purpose of art. If not for the wild hallucinations it would have been a five star classic."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"this book is a great example of the conflict man has with others.

The Chief had been confined mostly because he was a mis-unnderstood Native American. Previously he had shown the ability to attend university and do technical work in the service, but now he was pretending to be deaf. Eventually he gets his self confidence back, taking matters into his own hands in the final scene.The chief and 20 others live in a state hospital under the tyranical rule of Nurse Ratched. All is thoroughly controlled and dominated by the nurse and her rules until a ruly Irish laborer named McMurphy shows up. McMurphy's plan of attack is to take on the nurse and liven things up by introducing fishing, fighting, gambling, drinking, and basketball to the ward. The fishing trip is one of the greatest scenes in modern American literature. Everyone contributes to his abilities and the trip is an incredible success for our gang of misfits.Eventually McMurphy realizes that he can not beat the nurse, she has the power to control his destiny. As his violent streak becomes more uncontrollable, McMurphy is subjected to the horrors of 1960's mental health treatment, to his ultimate demise."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"People sometimes pity Kesey for having been a one-hit-wonder. This first book of his is a masterpiece. And the rest? Basically forgettable. I labored throughSometimes a Great Notion (Penguin Classics)and beganSailor Song, but neither really worked for me. But this book is a real work of art--a sensational creation from start to finish. It is undoubtedly one of the best novels of the 20th century. The characters are memorable, the world is vivid, the themes are elegant. Kesey evokes a great struggle between freedom and bureaucracy, between the individual and dogma. You might expect that the treatment is obvious or heavy-handed, but there it is done with skill and care. (And, if anything, it softens the often scandalous treatment of the institutionalized mentally ill.)But there is more: there is Kesey's fantastic penetration of madness itself. He peels back the rational mind that keeps most of us sane and gently lowers us into the confusion of schizophrenia. The powerful interplay of characters, the surprising endings, and the moral struggles give this novel strong engines which carry the reader through the story and continue to motor in the mind, long after the book has been put down."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The author takes you on a journey through psychosis, but the narrative is still coherent to the reader. The tale is told from the perspective of a Native American fellow that is hospitalized. Although his sanity is slightly compromised, he is still real sharp and views things objectively.

It's absolutely brilliant, and one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A truly rare thing.

McMurphy finds himself, has widely been portrayed as a figure of evil, or at least one of obedience to the law because it IS the law. Never in the work, suspiciously, are we given the opportunity to question whether Ms. Ratched truly doesn't have the patient's interests at heart. Instead, we are treated to innuendo about her obsessive need for control and order, perhaps leading some to question the sanity of Ms. Ratched. Regardless of the truth, it is a welcome question, offering a depth of thought not common in heralded classics, in my view.McMurphy, naturally, was the most interesting character in the book, by turn pensive or outrageous, obedient or mischievous. Our much beloved anti-hero, who can stand up to the grinding forces of the corrupt mental health institution and remain himself. But is he? At several points, \\"Chief\\" Bromden, our unreliable narrator, points to the haunted and hunted look in the eyes of our protagonist, wondering if, perhaps, he is tiring of the fight.Perhaps. Or perhaps our illustrious mischief-maker, our perpetual Loki, has not the heart for making mischief. Perhaps our dear Mr. McMurphy actually wishes merely to conform. At several points, the statements of the anarchist seem to suggest that he feels himself something of a figure of destiny, like Achilles in the movie version of Troy. Perhaps, just perhaps, his fate is NOT his own to make, nor that of the grinding Combine. Perhaps it is rather in the hands of his fellow inmates. McMurphy gives himself freely in a futile chase to remind them that they are men. In return, they take from him everything that he has. Not to speculate too wildly, but perhaps there is something a bit messianic about the book, where an uncontrolled man comes into the midst of the community, bucks the authority, teaches the people that they are human beings with dignity, and ends up giving everything for the people he has adopted.At the end, one must wonder what would have become of Our Protagonist if, perhaps, he had found himself in a more supportive clime, perhaps under the control of the nurse from Disturbed. Or perhaps even better, if he had found himself in a formless place without outside influence to worsen him. He might have become anything, and he might not have burned himself up, approximating the candle that they needed him to become, leading the way through the darkness, back to humanity, back to manhood, back to grace?The other characters are all interesting as well, including Harding, whose alluded to homosexuality, Billy Bibbit's social avoidance disorder due to his mother's reverse Oedipal complex, and Sefelt and Fredrickson's epilepsy has led to their voluntary commission to the ward. These characters, more than anything discussed in their treatment, tell a sad and compelling tale of the state of mental disease in the 1960's. These people don't need ECT or a lobotomy. They need help, and they certainly don't get it here.There was very little done wrong in this book. Perhaps the most grievous thing was the treatment of \\"Chief\\" Bromden's paranoid schizophrenia. At many times in the novel, it became necessary for me to simply go, \\"All right. We get that Bromden is an unreliable narrator, and that he is hallucinatory. The hallucinations, as a matter of fact, do little but detract from the remainder of the novel. It is fine for the character to be unreliable. He is in a mental institution, so we probably ought not take everything he says or thinks at face value. Nevertheless, the utter lack of realistic symptomology for this character detracts from his otherwise compelling impact.This was a truly good book, and I will return to it again and again. The search for meaning and for leadership here, for a sense of self in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform, and R. P. McMurphy's final act of heroic surrender, all make this a book worth reading for anyone who is interested in what makes us who we are.B+Harkius"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While reading the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest written by Ken Kesey, I was drawn in by the writer's unusual point of view. Through the voice of Chief Bromden, a mental patient in an asylum, the story tells of harsh treatment and the blurred line of what is sane and insane in this life. The character R. P. McMurphy enters the scene, changing and questioning all limits and preconceived notions of how things work in the world. He represents hope, and how it can change any situation, even one of suppression and evil.The story starts off on a usual day in the asylum. The Big Nurse is introduced. She is a harsh, stern woman who sets the clockwork of the unit ticking seamlessly. There is no escape from the dull life of the patients. That is, until R. P. McMurphy enters. He is clearly sane, but in this setting he sticks out, making you question what exactly is sane and insane. Throughout the story he gives and gives to his fellow patients, restoring them with some degree of dignity and respect for themselves. The Big Nurse questions his motives, and along with the scene, she sees him as malicious and conniving. Yet, the patients, ranging from Chief Bromden, the paranoid and hallucinating Native American, to Dale Harding, a former college-graduate, grow to love Randle McMurphy. As the two forces, freedom and restriction, collide with each other over and over again, the story takes a turn for the dramatic, climactic events that harrow your soul and hook you into the story.Personally, I loved this book. It was not an easy, light read by any means, but it is among the classics with its ability to change your view on life. In the beginning, the facts of the patients' lives are so harsh and sobering, it was hard for me to push on and continue reading. But with the help of Randle McMurphy, I was intrigued by the course of events that played out with the new character. Though it has many adult themes, I believe that, as a teenager myself, many other teens would like this book who are interested in reading different books besides the clich&eacute; teen love story. The book questions authority. What is organization and where does the control start to become ultimate power that does not benefit the lowly? Where do scientific procedures and inhumanity separate? This book does have light moments however. The characters are so faulted that they seem seamless. The internal view of their quirks and misgivings makes you realize that they are not so very different from you and with this realization, you stop seeing them as separate individuals from your life, and they start to represent a whole. And with this change of mind, you see them as human and what is being done to them as inhuman and brutal. You start to care for the characters you once saw as \\"freaks.\\"The book is powerful, giving you an intimate look at others and yourself. It is moving in a way that I have not seen before and the connection that develops between you and the characters will surprise you in the end."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"okay ... I haven't read this book since high school, about 5 years ago. I remember enjoying reading the parts where the cheif is having his psychotic breaks. There was one passage where he's cleaning a wall and imagining that he's whiping sludge and slime off of it. I've never tried getting baked and writing down everything that comes into my head ... but if I did, I'm sure it would be interesting to read later. This book was like getting an inside glimpse of what it's like to be insane. I thought it was awsome and would love to read it again. I'm sure it'll bring up bad memories of homework and worksheets but I'll give it a try. Like I said, I haven't read it in a while so I don't remember what the underlying theme is. I do remember relaing to the patients and the way they viewed the staff, like they were otherworldly or something. If you think my review is stupid it's cool ... I'm no intellectual but I did appreciate this particular book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this classic novel. It really opens your eyes to that specific time period and to the world in general. \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" reminded me of \\"Brave New World\\" by Audulous Huxley because of the fact that everyone is different and if you don't fit into that mold, you are taken out of view, so to speak; and made to be better or \\"normal\\".You can't help but fall in love with McMurphy. He is a character who has so much spirit and life. He brought that to the other ward members. This story is one that everyone should read because it makes sad, happy,and angry.Mrs.Ratchard was a horrible person. I watched the movie shortly after reading the book and she's not portrayed the same way. In the book it's easier to envision her. She is an egregious woman, purposefully controlling the men and their masculinity. \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is all about that, women controlling men's masculinity, demeaning them.McMurphy befriends all of the ward patients but he pays attention to one in particular;Chief Bromden, a gigantic Columbia indian man who is thought to be deaf and mute. No one pays any attention to him especially the nurses. Chief really knows what's going on around the ward.Not only do you get to know Chief, you also get to know Harding, a man who voluntarliy committed himself, Billy Bibbitt; a stuttering 30-year-old man who looks like a young boy, Cheswick; a overally sensitive guy, etc.I highly recommend this novel. Its truly enlightning. You enjoy the characters, happy when they are happy, upset when they are upset, and so forth."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The story is told through the eyes of Chief Bromden, (a six foot seven big Indian) who has everyone fooled that he is deaf and dumb. He is trusted by the doctors and nurses, since, he doesn't pose a threat of telling anything he over hears,on them. Bromden tells of the orange-red haired man named Mc Murphy, who comes into the patients world and lifts them out of a fog. He brings hope and laughter back into their worlds of constant routine. Nurse Ratchet, is a menace to the mental ward. She controls everything that you may do and even say. Bromden and the other patients are terrified of her. McMurphy changes the patients views of Nurse Ratchet, they begin to see her as no threat to them. When McMurphy sneaks Candy ( the prostitute) in for his friend Billy, they get caught. Thats when everything hits the fan.She does the most inhuman thing to McMurphy. There is no happy ending to this story. But does leave you with a knot of pain."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Depicted from the fog of a silent but intentive patient, the story of other cases develop and give insight to the world of the mentally ill. The book brings out the classical, but cliche ideas that things are not always what they seem, the grass IS always greener on the other side, and we are all nucking futs. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest challenges readers to form their own opinions whether or not the patients in the book really need the strict rules of their head authority figure, Nurse Ratched or if they're really insane. It lets readers see the different aspects of different thought processes from different characters. From the crazy and brave personality of McMurphy to the timid but opinionated character of Chief Bromden, we get a sense of who these people are from their actions. I found in the beginning, that the novel was tough to get through, with all of Bromden's hallucinations, but it became an easier and more interesting read later on. Honestly, when I first started reading it, I WANTED to put it down, but now, I find how Kesey writes and formatted the novel is unique and interesting. I didn't take liking to the format or thought processes of the narrator. The characters become more and more intriguing as the book continues. I've realized that I've grown to like the structure better. I'm stuck on whether I like the story or the way it is written.In any case, whether you're a basketcase yourself or as \\"normal\\" as they come, I think most would find this book to be interesting and original. You may not like the topic, but the characters and order of the book may reel you in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Aren't we all insane? To me labeling something as \\"sane\\" is a waste of breath. The entire world and every being in it has same crazy truth hidden by layers of \\"normalcy.\\" We judge those who are insane because we do not want to see the human spirit unmasked. Nurse Ratchet has worked tersely to recover those who have removed society's bindings of normal. I really liked this novel but it was more the ideas that it questioned that I enjoyed than the actual writing.I envy Mac Murphy for his bravery and confidence to challenge authority. I wish I had the audacity to do the same, to pull back my veil and reveal my true insanity. Overall I think this novel deserves praise for its own audacity and ability to challenge literary normalcy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"McMurphy is the new guy in Bromden's ward who comes to save the inmates from the Big Nurse. From the moment he steps into the ward McMurphy is trying to lighten the spirits of the inmates. He starts off small by greeting everyone in the room when he first arrives, but he does not stop there. He continues his crusade by sticking up for individuals in group sessions and by gaining privileges such as the tub room and a basketball team. Why does McMurphy go out of his way to give the inmates a sense of freedom? McMurphy has plenty to lose when he invokes the Big Nurse's wrath. Not only can he be sent to the Disturbed Ward, but he can also receive shock therapy or be sentenced to additional time in the mental institution.The novel is told from the perspective of Bromden, a half Indian patient who pretends to be deaf and dumb. The patients of his ward have slipped away from themselves and into routine. When McMurphy is brought to the mental asylum the Big Nurse's ward is turned inside out. After sometime the patients warm up to this interesting Irishman and their lives are changed forever through their escapades.This is a great novel. I love Kesey's portrayal of the metal ward from the \\"Chief's\\" perspective. Kesey's style allowed me to relate to a group of people that I would normally have trouble identifying myself with. I enjoyed this book completely from cover-to-cover. I am extremely glad I read this novel; I just wish I had done it sooner. I enjoyed the novel so much that I would never consider watching the movie. Although I have heard a great deal about the movie I do not think I would ever watch it. I doubt that any performance could ever do my image of the crazy Irishman and the tall \\"Chief\\" justice."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey sees no good end in sight in the battle of the sexes. This novel, set in a mental ward, depicts a group of powerless and despairing men controlled by a feminine society personified in the domineering figure of Big Nurse. The story's hero, a fast-talking manly man named Randle Patrick McMurphy, whose assertiveness is his sanity, enters this world to liberate the mental patients and restore their lost manhood through such activities as deep sea fishing, substance abuse, and sex with prostitutes. Masculinity in the novel is usually defined in terms of sexual prowess, referred to as \\"whambam.\\" A man's maleness is proportional to his whambam.The mental ward is clearly a microcosm depicting the wider world, in which encroaching technology and bureaucracy succeed in elevating women at the price of men's masculinity, so that the men of the story are left without a place, able to find refuge nowhere but in their own psychoses, which ironically play them into the hands of the System, the Establishment, or as Kesey's narrator calls it, \\"the Combine.\\" This notion of a need for wildness and untamability as a core necessity for men's mental health is a prominent theme in American thinking, derived in part from the concept of \\"frontier,\\" a place of untamed wilderness where men can escape the effeminizing effect of civilization. Since the disappearance of the frontier, this sense of masculinity lost has, in some circles, grown more frantic. Kesey injects his modern myth into this situation and succeeds in producing a dynamic and fascinating, if grim, story.There is little hope for a happy ending. This battle of the sexes, as Kesey depicts it, can end only with the complete emasculation and disempowerment of the male or the humiliation and subjugation of the female. A macabre vision indeed. While the face of menacing authority is consistently female, Kesey appears to cringe on occasion from the full import of his work, producing a few likable female characters and one criticism of the negative way a certain character treats his wife. Nonetheless, these brief sections hardly mitigate the novel's forceful theme. No notion is ever suggested of male/female cooperation, let alone equality.It is evident that this book has resonated with a surprising number of readers, given its distinct anti-feminist tone. Undoubtedly this is the result of Kesey's masterful prose, his provocative ideas, his endearing characters, and his superb blend of comedy and tragedy. This is an enduring work, and a thoughtful one, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As many, I learned first of this story thru the excellent Milos Forman movie. My dad had the book at home so I decided to read it. I was on my early teens and I still remember it like it was yesterday. It stirs a lot of emotions and makes you think on the way our society deals with mental illness.I have read it again now twenty years later and the feelings and emotions are still there.Timeless."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As is usually the case when I see a movie before I read the book, I couldn't help but picture Jack Nicholson when I read about Randle Patrick McMurphy. Considering how good the movie is, though, this isn't a bad thing. My only complaint about this book is that I didn't read it sooner. Hilarious, touching, infuriating, and haunting, this is the complete novel. Although the story is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden, a supposedly deaf and dumb half-Native America mental patient at an asylum in Oregon, this is really the story about McMurphy and how he changes the lives of the patients around him as he competes in a game of wit and will with Nurse Ratched. It's a classic clash between authority and rebellion, structure and whimsy, and mindless traditionalism and common sense. What's most amazing is that Kesey has created a handful of unforgettable characters in this one story, but has balanced them so well that they serve as perfect complements for each other's idiosyncrasies, and none of them overshadows the others. I loved every page of this book. It makes my top ten. I'd give it seven stars out of five if I could."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In the beginning, I didn't like this book.It made the work of psychiatrists look like horror, rather than help. However, once I was able to get passed the miscalcuations of what psychiatrists did in the book, I really enjoyed it. I especially liked the end, but I won't give anything away! It is a delightful commentary on some different philosophies of life. It also made me want to make a difference in the world, the way McMurphy made a difference for those men."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of a man, R. P. McMurphy. He has the choice of going to jail, or an asylum. He chooses the asylum. While inside he sees the horror of the institution, and it's leader Nurse Rached.I was originally apprehensive about reading this book, because I had seen the movie before. The reason I made the decision to go forward and read this novel, was due to the change of prospective from the movie to the book. The movie is told from the third person, while the book is told from the perspective of the Indian Chief. This difference adds a great amount of depth to the novel, that the movie doesn't have.While the movie is a classic, so is the book. What makes it worth reading for fans of the movie, is the elements of the plot that Ken Kasey put in the book, that unfortunately are not in the movie. due to these differences, I highly recommend reading this book for the changed perspective that it casts on the movie. It makes the movie so much better."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was a very interesting read. Never giving much thought to the way mental health hospitals worked myself, I found it very eye opening to see just how wrong one could go. Yes I know the book is fiction, but it was very believable. MY favorite character was Randal McMurphy. \\"Is he really insane? Or is he just faking it to get out of the work camp and to make some quick money off these crazies?\\" You won't find out until the end if his intensions are noble or not. I really loved this book. The men on the ward break free from the over powering Nurse Ratchet and McMurphy leads the way. The book is never boring. The Patients are constantly testing the Nurses patients and control."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I chose this book to read as my selection for this section of four weeks around. My Teacher, Mr. Hoest was impressed that I would choose such a strong book as this. If I had not ever seen the movie, I think I too would have gone for something easy. This book was very,... different compared to most books.The Plot was interesting because of how it started off and caught you off guard beginning with the Chief just cleaning. Then, it slowly edged into McMurphy becoming the new patient and what the Cheif thought of him. I originally thought it was in the view of McMurphy (Because the Movie was like that, I believe?), but it was in the view of the Chief and that was different to me. I just assumed it was in the view of him I guess. I figured it was him talking about his experiences with someone but it wasn't. My favorite character was definatly Harding. I didn't think he even belonged in that insitution. He was the odd Acute out to me. The Big Nurse was a good \\"Antagonist\\" because she was the head on the ward and I was glad that eventually McMurphy could teach them to stand up for what they thought was right instead of always backing down in fear of the Shock Shop or getting moved to the Disturbed Ward. I did however have to read some parts over to understand them. But that's not at the fault of Ken Kensey. I am a bit young to be reading something like this. I loved the book, and I'm sure that I read it over again when I'm older."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Expressive style. Sad, horrific story of power and vulnerability.

It gave a wonderful yet somewhat depressing look into the lives of mental patients during the sixties. It also showed how rebellion only got you deeper into the hand's of the government.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest illustrates a modernized battle of good and evil. For centuries, there have been stories of peasants and commoners against tyrannical beasts and monsters, but this story offers a twist of plot and persona.Instead of being the usual fairy tale, this book presents a realistic look at life in a hospital, through the eyes of one of the patients, a \\"chronic\\" Indian named Bromden. \\"Chief\\", as he is called by some of the patients on the ward, does little more than mop and clean and listen to conversation. Bromden hears and knows everything that goes on at the hospital, and even many of the things that none of the patients know, mostly because everyone believes him to be deaf, and will pretty much say anything around him. The main conflict exists between the head nurse, Nurse Ratched, whom the patients call the \\"Big Nurse\\", referring to her size and the intimidation she has over them, and the patients themselves, and a new patient named Randle Patrick McMurphy.From the time he first enters the ward, McMurphy butts heads with the Nurse, trying her patience at every chance he gets. Randle begins to represent the most liberating force that the other patients have ever known, and he finally gives them the strength to stand up for themselves. Soon he comes to the realization that to get out of the hospital, he must conform to the rules instead of breaking them, and in the end he is consumed by the \\"Combine\\" of society, to meet an inevitable fate. At the same time, he ultimately becomes a savior to his \\"followers,\\" the patients on the ward whom he befriended during his sentence.Not only is this book a story of triumph against authority, but also an analyzation of what modern society can do to people. The danger of conformity and need for individuality are both revealed in the story, as well as the pain that can be caused by ignorance, shown by the emotions felt by \\"Chief,\\" and McMurphy as well. They both have underlying emotions not seen by anyone except in a small slip of a facial expression or a bad choice of words, and both work hard to cover it up. McMurphy, especially, wants to keep up a strong front in order to keep the trust of the others, but he is slowly being eaten away by the pressure that is now on him to do this as he attempts to get on the good side of the Big Nurse at a last chance of being released. He desperately wants to get out, unlike many of the others who are there by their own admission.Centered mainly around the actions of the \\"acutes,\\" the book gives a funny and interesting look at the lives of people most of us only hear about. Sometimes, it feels better to get away from the mediocre \\"real world\\" and go to a place where nothing at all is what someone would call \\"normal\\", and this is exactly what the book, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest can do. This book is plausible fiction at it's finest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a good read, and its fun to see everything through the eyes of the chief, but Cucoo's nest is one of my favorite movies, and i prefer watching this then reading it.

It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief Bromden looks out the window for the first time.I have never read a book dealing with mentally handicap, and it was an eye-opening reading. The idea that the handicaps were treated this way is disheartening, and the thought of continuous poor treatment is overwhelming. Ken Kesey did an exquisite job of portraying the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched for the upper hand - an endless game where the power hungry witch eventually came out on top. Despite his selfless and somewhat blind attempts to obtain equality and respect, McMurphy was perhaps responsible for the saving of at least one life - Bromden's.Over all I see why many people have considered this book to be a classic.

AWESOME!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I read this book in high school, I knew it would be \\"important\\" in my life. I couldn't quite put my finger on what made it so compelling. Twenty years down the line, I understand completely what I liked so much.Kesey wrote this book after having participated as a guinea pig in Veterans Administration studies of psychedelic [chemical substances]. He also worked in a mental hospital and even underwent electric shock treatment, just to see what it was like.As I see it, McMurphy and Bromden are alter egos, both aspects of Kesey. The charming, redheaded, muscleman is quite transparently Kesey. He is an old-fashioned Everyman. In the regimented, industrial world such a man is both a legend and a throwback. There is no way for him to regain his former dominance, though, by his strength or his machismo. He has to go inward and find something else.A key passage is the one in which Bromden notes his surprise at McMurphy's \\"feminine side.\\" The side that paints pictures and writes letters. The part that is other than the mythical Everyman, and that must be awakened fully if a man is to escape the Combine.Bromden, with his hallucinations and fog, is the new Ubermensch, call him Psychedelic Man. His visions are not truly out of touch with reality. They are always symbolic of the spiritual and psychological realities that the earthy Mr. McMurphy can't put his finger on. Once Bromden finds his voice, his escape is inevitable, and so is the [end of life], literal and/or symbolic, of McMurphy.What I found jarring, and what I think dates the book, is the reliance on certain ...types as metaphor -- \\"the frigid woman\\" (Ratched), the wise, inscrutable Indian (Bromden, whose mother is a white \\"Ice Queen\\" who emasculates his father), and the black boys carry much of the message via established ...types.Overall, the book is a rich modern version of the ancient myth of awakening."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In Ken Kesey's, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, there are four very important factors that contribute to the developement of the novel.Setting, flashbacks, ominiscient point of view, and the use of Symbolism. Like always, I feel that setting is very important to a novel. In a lot of cases, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the setting almost takes upon the role of a whole new character. The novel is set in the Pacific Northwest, in a mental institution. The mental institution has a great deal of meaning for it is the backbone of the theme. Kesey, who wrote the book in 1962, tied in a lot of his own experiences and uses, in a sense, flashbacks. Kesey grew up in Oregon and worked with patients in a mental institution. A lot of the narrative is developed from experiences in his life. The most obvious literary device, however, is the use of symbolism. Developed from where the book is set, the mental institution, symbolism is abundant. The most important is the meaning in which Kesey tries to get across. Using the setting, many will agree that he uses the mental institution to symbolize the oppression which is present in modern day society. His main idea, it to get us, the reader, to really question the meaning of sane or insane. Kesey uses the problems of today and ties them into problems that Chief, McMurphy, Billy Bibbit and even Nurse Ratched face in their lives. One thing that I thought was brilliant on Kesey's part was choosing chief as the narrator. Pretending to be deaf and dumb, he has access to information that the other patients do not. This makes him a great narrator. This demonstrates somewhat of an ominiscient point of view. I really enjoyed this novel and I love the Movie. I am sure everyone who has read it found it interesting. If you can understand the four literary devices I described, you will enjoy One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey definitely out did himself in this book. A wonderful piece of fiction that goes throught he life stages of a con-man out there to do some good. The book is written wonderfully, and manages to keep readers entertained and involved till the very end."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was for the most part pretty good, however, I was still a bit disappointed in it. Having read some of the reviews on this board I was expecting more from the book. But it just never pulled me in until the end. There were some good parts, but for the most part I would say it was just an average read that I was glad to have over so I could start on something else."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The great American novel, so often heralded as yet to come, is exemplified by and established as &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot; Like the characters of the novel, the plot, set in a mental institution, uses a small segmented environment in order to view America and the world as a whole. The multi-layered metaphors, such as man vs. machine, and the intense plot confrontations, such as McMurphy vs. Big Nurse, combine in a brilliantly written novel with omniscient prescence. McMurphy, the gregarious, fiery, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; styled cowboy, is the true hero of the American west; he is forced to confront the evil, machine wielding Big Nurse, in a Christ-like act of equal parts benevolence and selfishness that typifies the All-American struggle between the nature we must tame and monsters we create to do so. It is an excellent book that, if read for depth, is thought provoking, and, if read for simple enjoyment, is entertaining."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I liked this book because it was very different from other books that I have read in the past. My favorite part of the book was the fishing trip. They all became good friends and the all trusted McMurphy after the time they spent on the boat. I also liked the part about the party because for the first time they finally thought for themselves. It was the first time that they didn't depend on Big Nurse to make all of their decisions for them."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Everyone must be familiar with the movie based on this novel by now. It's one of the very few cases where both the novel and the movie (while differing in places) are excellent. I've read this book a number of times, and each time I find it just as enjoyable.It's written from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden, who seems to have a paranoia that given many of the circumstances of his life, have a basis in reality. He's witnessed the crushing subjugation of his people to powers beyond control, his father formerly a strong native American Chief bent and twisted under the weight of it and reduced to alcoholism. Bromden is physically large and powerful, but his beliefs have seen him put away in a mental institution, where he does not speak or give any clues of his intelligence. He appears to be deaf and dumb, but these are his defences against what he calls the Combine.The mental institution however has become a microcosm of his fearful perceptions of the world at large. Presided over by a nurse (Nurse Ratched) who to all appearances is there to help, but whom exercises a dominating control over the inmates and if anything, contributes to their mental health problems.A new inmate comes to the institution, who is everything Bromden is not. McMurphy is loud, gambling, womanising .. a fist-fighting free spirit. He's no hick however, as the Chief sees glimmers of another side to him. McMurphy takes on the nurse, and so directly challenges the Combine.This is tremendous writing. The characters are rendered deeply and convincingly. I would rate this novel as one of the best of all time."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A leadership seminar: power struggle in a mental ward. Alternative wolves fight over rabbit control. The rabbits are sans wham bam, as they sadly concede. (We are all rabbits and we need a good strong wolf to teach us our place.) One of the wolves incites them to grow above themselves. This leads to where it always leads when real power is one-sided and monopolized.What is this novel from 1962, which is included in several \`best books' lists? Is it an allegory on fascistoid systems? Is it Kafka moving into real life? Is it anti-capitalist (as some comments by the narrator, Chief Broom, suggest)? Is it anti-government in general? Or just anti-authoritarian? Is it anti-feminist, as per the attack by our anti-hero McMurphy? (Rape seems to be the only weapon against female wolves? Impotence is women's victory?)Or is it a realistic attack on mental institutions and their practices?Frequently one is disappointed by a film after a book that one liked. Rarely is the film better. In this case here, I had watched the film decades ago and remember that it was one of Jack Nicholson's best performances. I never wanted to watch the movie again though, hence I have no idea if I still like it today. It never occurred to me that I might want to read the book on which the film was based. Good films can do that to me, take away the motivation for the original.For reasons unclear to me, I bought the book now. It is worth while. I just can't figure out if I like it. It must have created a storm when it came out. Its language and subject seem unusual for the time. It seems, according to Wiki, that the novel got adopted by the big movement of the sixties and became something of a movement icon.We enter a micro-cosmos of fascism. The staff in the institution has absolute power and uses it without checks or balances. Inmates are encouraged to spy on each other, as in all proper fascist/communist systems. Inmates have no real chance to be heard, whatever they do proves that whatever is done to them is for the bettering of them.(You have no chance, make sure to use it!)This place even shaves Santa Claus.We watch the world through the eyes and language of Chief Broom, the chronic inmate who pretends to be deaf and mute and is nearly 7 feet tall. He has been the longest \`serving' patient. Only Big Nurse Rat-shed was there before him.The institution's population is structured by status of illness: there are acutes and chronics. The first may come out, the latter never. The treatment that the first receive can make them chronics. But the technicians are learning. There is enough material for learning by doing. The ward is sheer horror.Chronics are either walkers, or wheelers, or vegetables. The words require no explanation.The Chief watches a new admission: \`hero' McMurphy, upbeat, noisy, extrovert, jumping to the top of the patient pecking order, which is no big achievement for a rather sane petty criminal in an environment of harmless people. McM is not really such a nice character, and we side with him against Big Nurse in the course of the developing war only by default. The underdog always wins our sympathies.The book also plays on racist themes. The narrator is a half Indian, which is supposed to absolve him from accusations of racism, maybe. It so happens that the SA team or camp guards are black men, who are on the leash of the she-wolf. There is an undeniable anti-black attitude with plenty of derogative vocabulary. Is a novelist justified in taking real language from real life even if it is offensive? I would think that this language is justified and has its rightful place in a realistic description of society.Chief Broom's world view is rocked by a creature like McMurphy, who fights even when he can't win, and who is sure to know who he is. The Chief takes a look at his own self in the mirror and wonders how it is possible that anybody could manage such an enormous thing as being what he was.In the final reckoning, without wanting to post a spoiler, I concede that the Chief has been set free by McM's heroism.But even more final is that I can't honestly say that I like the novel. Respect, ok, but like? Not really."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of my favorite all-time books. I've read it 5 times.It works on so many levels, and the characters are warm, perverse, individual, violent, confused, insightful, scared, desperate, manipulative... I've found myself laughing out loud at hysterical sequences perfectly described with a truly unique form of writing.It brings a real sense of huaminity to those that are contained within mental hospitals, and brings a new level of understanding inside oneself.The book has changed every time I've read it, and while it's incredibly easy to read, there is so much to see."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Randle Patrick McMurphy is a gambling fool, as he dubs himself in the opening chapters of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Not anyone's standard idea of a hero in the typical novel setting, R.P. McMurphy is easily one of the most original and entertaining characters in all of literature. That may seem like a bold statement but those who read this and don't laugh at least 350 times are utterly devoid of humor. Ken Kesey's bestselling novel takes place on a psychiatric ward in an asylum somewhere in Oregon, a place under the rule of the sadistic Big Nurse, a large-breasted, manipulative woman who oversees the most cunning and precise control of her wing of the hospital with a disturbing and dark devotion. Dedicated to humiliating her patients in group meetings under the veil of therapy, manipulating hospital staff and the doctor of her floor with implications of losing their jobs if they do not comply, and backed by an army of staff aides ready to abuse and subdue any patient who steps out of line, Big Nurse has all the surefire signs of a dictator, until R.P. McMurphy strolls into her ward. A gambling, womanizing, drinking Irish swindler who faked his insanity simply to avoid serving out his full term at an incarcerated workfarm, McMurphy is the cure for the dreary and dark hospital's glooms, instantly invigorating his mentally diminished hospital-mates and even some of the staff with his seemingly unbeatable sense of humor and a will which refuses to be hammered down by the Big Nurse's iron fist.While McMurphy's smooth-talking, fast-paced manner in which he carries himself all begin to show true therapeutic progress in the patients with whom he shares the ward, Big Nurse is none too taken with him and the two soon begin to [...] heads over who holds the throne in her part of the hospital: the tyrannical, control-freak head nurse or the drunken brawler of a life-loving Irishman. Although Big Nurse retains the power to submit any seemingly violent patient to inhumane electric shock-therapy sessions and in the worst cases, lobotomies, she must have just cause for doing so, and McMurphy soon begins to realize there are certain boundaries he must work within if he wants to win the hearts and minds of the ward's patients. Beginning as sport though, the contest soon turns bitter and the two characters begin to develop a true power struggle over who is really running the hospital.Told through the eyes of Big Chief, a committed Columbian Indian who feigns being deaf and dumb to avoid the clutches of the evil hospital's grasp, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is both an exercise in good humor as well as a lesson in life and tragedy. Kesey's command of similes and metaphors are untouchable by just about every writer out there, and his constant ability to use them over and over, yet never letting them get stale, is wholesomely original and impressive. The book has one of the saddest endings I've ever read, and the whole thing might be a metaphor for how the system works to beat down the individual into submitting into the ways of the flock, but most readers will just enjoy the massive amount of characters, all of which are original and developed and contribute an integral amount to the novel's development. It doesn't matter what genre you're into. Just get this and you will not only not be disappointed, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A colorful tale of unexpected oppression and refreshingly unique characters, the psychedelic novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is an entirely singular work. It explores the life of one Chief Bromden, an Indian and White hybrid who, due primarily to the harsh effects of a hypocritical and cruel psychiatric ward, has lost control of his mind and senses.In the novel, Miss Ratched (a name which means to crank up the tension), runs the ward. She employs a strict schedule, has complete control over her patients. The Big nurse can ratchet up the pressure, or bring it to a low. She has the ability to speed up time, in Chief Bromden's state, and to slow it down. This utter control is the goal of the Combine. It represents a society intnet on producing a generation of \\"vegetables,\\" people who are helpless, totally subjugated, and free from any ability to express individual thought or expression.As the novel progresses, and more clues are given, the Combine takes on a more direct meaning. It becomes known as a community or society. It consists of all the poeple who want conformity, want things done in only one way. They do not like change. They do not like individualism. They don't like freedom of expression. So, they surely do not view Randle P. McMurphy from a positive perspective.The Big Nurse's goal of neurotic subjugation, coupled with her brain-scrambling tactics, perpetuates the Chief's state of hallucination. To gain his permanent withdrawal means her simultaneous victory. It is not until Randle P. McMurphy, Ken Kesey's enthusiastically unique character, arrives that the fog shrouding Chief Bromden's eyes begins to recede and he starts to regain his sensory awareness. Thus, this shock-shop veteran lands on a transient vehicle of conciseness, one which treks the darkest, most fear-instilling corners of his mind until, against all odds, the bright light of reality shines through the illusions before him.The story is extremely interesting and powerfully creative. At times, it is difficult to be sure, as a reader, what exactly qualifies as truth or illusion. It is actually more intriguing this way, in that it is up to the reader what they decide to partake as a reality."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a most humorous and disturbing novel and though I can understand why it has been banned, I disagree with the ruling because this book is just too good to ignore. The book deals with themes of control versus freedom and the classic battle between good and evil with a most appalling conclusion and an unusual climax location; the book climaxes only a few pages before the book ends adding only more to the shock and horror one will know upon completion. Miss Ratched, nicknamed Big Nurse, runs a rigid schedule that is compared repetitively throughout the novel to the systematic and never changing operation of a machine. Randle Patrick McMurphy, on the other hand, is a boisterous, red-haired man with a mission of disruption and chaos for the ward and the freedom for the patients to actually be able to make some basic decisions for themselves. The humor in the book is most certainly dark, but nevertheless hilarious and makes the book quite a joy to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In Ken Kesey's debut 1962 novel, con man Randall McMurphy fakes mental illness to avoid serving his time in a prison work camp for a statutory rape charge. (\\"She was fifteen going on thirty-five Doc...\\") The story begins when McMurphy is transferred to an asylum in Oregon. He quickly establishes himself as the \\"Bull goose loony\\" (alpha male...I guess) and introduces gambling, drinking, women and other real life pleasures to the ward. The other timid inmates enjoy these new freedoms, but they go against the harsh rules of Big Nurse Ratchet. The conflict between Nurse Ratchet--backed by the full force of the state--and McMurphy escalates to the very end.This book is funny, well written and at times inspirational. It's definitely could be described as a \\"Modern Classic\\". I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's artistry is spellbinding in its dark humor, dry intellect and over-the-top imagery. The novel is a modern masterpiece whose theme, though outdated, should make any thinking person reconsider the realities, limitations and stereotypes to which we've become accustom as members of society. The characters are rich and engaging. There is both genius and compassion in McMurphy's chaos; beauty in the Chief's dillusions. Never have I read a novel whose daring impressed me so, a novel that instilled such humility in me concerning my perceptions of others and their motivations. Though I am too young to understand much about the politics of the day, I appreciate the opportunity the author has given his readers to catch a glimpse into the minds of an unusual breed of people whom we would otherwise never know or understand."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Extra points for creating an antagonist (Nurse Ratched) who can be beyond evil without giving off the appearance of it. An uplifting story about the triumph of the human spirit in the most dire of situations, but at the same time tragic in the costs of what it takes to get there. A must read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey closely examines the cultural world of the mental hospital and the machine that runs it in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.&quot; His running commentary on life in 1960's America is an introverted inspection of the American government and all of its toadying subordinates. It gives a fine look at the attitudes that led to the upheaval that occurred in this most turbulant decade. Kesey uses his own sabbatical in a mental institute as a study on fellow inmates and most importantly, a study on himself and his beliefs. This book will instantly become one of your favorites"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"To fully appreciate Kesey's work, one must have the keen eye to recognize symbolism. This particular book overflows with it. McMurphy might be the main character, but Chief also plays a vital role. He (although mentally ill) views the world as a &quot;machine.&quot; While reading, if you look hard, machine imagery abounds (from the dreaded, prime machine of Nurse Ratched's fingertips to Chief's dream about his friend's machine entrails). The fact that the book is set in a mental institution could not make more sense. Chief views the world through innocent eyes and sees it for what it really is: greedy and control-oriented. After reading this novel, Kesey will have you wondering whether it's the outside world that belongs in a mental institution!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A short summary for those of you who are unaware: In the late 60's a psych ward takes on a new patient by the name of R.P. McMurphy, up until this point the ward has been run with an iron fist by Nurse Ratched aka \\"Big Nurse.\\" When McMurphy enters the ward he instantly befriends the patients and befuddles the staff while making it his personal mission to bring Big Nurse to her knees. What follows is a psychological game of chess between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchet with the stakes being the mental stability of the rest of the ward.This movie has always had a special place in my heart, so it is only natural that eventually I would get around to reading the book. Even though it appears as though the movie was about as faithful to the book as I have ever seen... there are very subtle yet profound differences between the two. The predominant difference is the point of view. The movie, takes the viewpoint of McMurphy where as the book is from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden. Now either the Chief is more disturbed than we are first lead to believe or there is some CRAZY stuff going on in that hospital. I would have to say that a few of the scenes in the book had me puzzled until I realized that good old Chief wasn't exactly playing with a full deck. What we see through his eyes is very disturbing, surreal, and at times the reader finds themselves mentally translating what he is relating into something that we can comprehend as physically possible.There are many themes in this book, the one most people bring up is man vs. the corrupted establishment, but threaded through are also the themes of self reliance, the state of the mental health industry back then, society's blaming anyone who goes against the establishment on mental illness, the power of society in bringing down the individual, then we also touch on the treatment of Native Americans, and a very interesting male vs. female battle. Though I'm not entirely sure what I was supposed to walk away with in regards to all of these themes, this was still a very well written book. The version I read was 278 pages but took me a full week to read. I'm not entirely sure why, but for being so short, it really does read very slowly. I recommend reading this book, it is truly a modern classic, if one still considers the 1970's modern. Either way this is an excellent read and it is extremely engaging, particularly once McMurphy and Big Nurse begin their mental game of chess... each trying to out do the other while maintaining complete composure. It is such a violent and hate filled battle to be fought so subtly. Each play is genius, but the players are never to be out done by one another. Read the book, then watch the movie, both are stellar examples of their craft."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of R.P. McMurphy, a con artist who goes from life on a prison work farm to life inside a mental hospital run by the evil, conniving Nurse Ratched. By refusing to follow \\"ward policy,\\" McMurphy joins forces with the other patients and makes it his sole objective to defy and defeat Nurse Ratched, whatever the cost may be.After purchasing the movie version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I wanted desperately to read the novel because I felt that it too could prove to be a classic. It was. Kesey's book is vivid, alive, and shocking. It provides an insightful look at life on a mental ward in the early 1950's and 1960's. If you are ever in a book store or a library and happen to come across this novel, don't hesitate to pick it up. Every second spent reading will be worth it. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am a true science fiction and fantasy fan. I don't do a whole lot of reading, but when I do, it's almost exclusively in that genre. However, I reluctantly purchased this book for a college literature course (which I put off until my last quarter of my senior year in college, too) and it just surprised me how much it sucked me in.I couldn't stop reading it. There are no discernable chapters, so I kept going and before I knew it, I was 1/3 the way through.This book is definitely worth a read. There is definitely an underlying message, but I'll leave that to you (or your literature teacher) to decide. It's funny, entertaining, exciting, and sad all at the same time.There is also some language in there; be aware this book was written in the 60s. You have to look past the &#34;bad words&#34; of the narrator and see the book in the cultural context in which it was written. That's the only way you'll enjoy the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an amazing book.

I have read a lot of fiction, psychology, philosophy, and religion in my day, and this takes the cake as probably the greatest piece of writing (fiction-wise, if not of all of literature) that I have ever had the privilege of reading. It is a masterpiece. Do you hear me? *shakes fist in the air* A MASTERPIECE! I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone and everyone for any and every reason. It is that good. Like damn."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was the last book I read before the end of the year, and it definitely makes my \\"Best Of\\" list. I have seen the film several times, but the book differs in a very key way. The narrator of the book is the presumably deaf/mute Chief Bromden, and his running commentary gives the book a different flavor from the film. His status as being supposedly deaf and mute gives him access to the asylum's dirtiest secrets, and it is fascinating to see the action through his eyes. \\"I had to keep on acting deaf if I wanted to hear at all,\\" he states.It is interesting to look at Chief Bromden as a possible unreliable narrator in the novel. We know from page one that he is in a mental hospital, and the Chief has had several rounds of treatment in the \\"shock shop.\\" He even has episodes where he returns to his youth in his mind, filling out his fascinating backstory. Bromden played high school football and is partially driven mad when his father, the first \\"Chief Bromden\\" in the book, is swindled out of his tribe's land on the Columbia River, where they have speared and net fished the salmon going upstream at Celilo Falls for generations. Ultimately the Dalles Dam is built, covering the entire area with water in 1957. Celilo Falls is an interesting bit of history in itself, and it makes for fascinating reading.Bromden tries to give a factual account of what is going on inside the hospital to the best of his ability, but that account is somewhat slanted because we see it only through the lens of his illness. He is paranoid to the point of thinking that there is a \\"Combine\\" that manipulates and controls individuals in subtle ways, such as machinery in the floors and walls. His paranoia is exacerbated by Nurse Ratched's very real iron hand in the running of things on her ward. In a critique of the novel, author Richard Gray explains that Bromden's vision \\"may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote Emily Dickinson... \`Much madness is divinest sense.'\\" Traditionally an unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility has been severely compromised, usually to deceive the reader. Although Chief Bromden is clearly delusional from his schizophrenia (oozing walls, buried machinery, shrinking and growing people), he is at least trying to tell the truth as he sees it, for the greater good of the other patients.Bromden reveals his ability to hear and speak to McMurphy, a free spirit who cons his way into the hospital faking insanity, thinking that time spent there will be easier than the jail sentence he is serving. McMurphy immediately locks horns with Nurse Ratched and bucks the system in a classic clash of the individual against the establishment. Chief Bromden and the other patients take heart at McMurphy's antics, and finally begin to come into their own as people instead of being scared and manipulated by Nurse Ratched, who only seems comfortable when wielding ultimate control over them. After a wild after-hours party on the ward near the end of the novel, one of the patients named Harding says that he is nearly ready to leave on his own, with all \\"the traditional red tape,\\" and that the others are \\"still sick men in lots of ways. But at least there's that: they are sick men now. No more rabbits, Mack.\\"Author Ken Kesey's inspiration for the book came from the time he spent working as an orderly on the night shift at the Menlo Park Veteran's Hospital, a mental health facility in California. He saw how the institution worked and interviewed patients. During his time there he also volunteered for Project MKUltra, a covert research operation by the CIA's Scientific Intelligence division experimenting in the \\"behavioral engineering of humans,\\" which included experimentation on subjects with psychoactive drugs such as Peyote and LSD. Kesey's experimentation and writings eventually went on to influence the counter cultural movement in the United States and elsewhere in the mid to late 1960's.One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest is a great and entertaining read with timeless themes that give you a lot to think about long after finishing the last page. Author Ken Kesey's portrayal of the struggle of the individual against authority holds as much power in today's deeply divided social and political climate as it did upon publication in 1962. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It a great book and I encourage others to read this book it's sad it funny beautiful and it will keep you reading"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"absolutely fabulous book - right up there with &#34;On the Road&#34;!!!!!

If you've only seen the movie, read it. Many little (and one big) detail make it much more engrossing. The book was written from Chief's point of view, which makes makes much more sense of it all, especially if you consider the ending. Totally recommend."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey creates a grand story using literary skills, a good sense of dialogue, and unbeatable characters. The story is told behind the observant and quiet eyes of Chief Bromden, who springs the words to life as if the reader were listening to him speaking around a campfire. The Chief tells of his experiences in a mental institution ruled by the guileful Big Nurse who is challenged by the boisterous and charming newcomer, Randle P. McMurphy. McMurphy fills the ward with life, adventure, and defiance towards meager rules, going against the status quo of not only the Big Nurse, but also the shrouded controllers and manipulators of the world. The battle is packed with ups and downs and many surprises which lead to a realistic and inspiring ending. Though, the novel isn't a complete roller coaster of excitement. In fact, whenever McMurphy isn't in the scene, the pace of the book tends to slow down. The narrator, Chief Bromden, often delves into the description of major themes such as shrouded tyranny, fear, insecurity, and the importance of individuality with great detail and many literary devises. This leads the reader to think over many things while also enjoying the action and comedy throughout the novel.Reading intensely through the novel, I appreciated every aspect it had to offer. The enjoyment of reading and ability to connect it to my life has further inspired me and I hope one day to match the story's natural goodness with experiences to come."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, illustrates the fight for control between two powerful characters. Nurse Ratched is a dominant female in the novel and due to her position and job she requires control over others. She has authority over the patients in the mental institute until McMurphy becomes a patient and poses as a threat to Nurse Ratched's ultimate control. Nurse Ratched's presence in the novel displays her sense of power and dominance over the other characters and McMurphy's attitute and personality go against her traits. Previous to reading the novel, I had already seen the film version and had preconceived ideas of how the characters would be portrayed in text.

He suffers from paranoia, hallucinations and delusions. Bromden spends his life and hospital time in fear of an imaginary force called the combine. The combine is force that attempts to control society and pushes people into fall into conformity. The reason that he makes such a good narrator is that he pretends to be deaf and dumb and sits and listens and is able to hear things that are not supposed to heard. The hospital patients are separated into two groups the Acute's, who can be cured, and Chronics, who cannot be cured, they are all male. The hospital is controlled by Nurse Ratched, an extremely strict woman. She encourages people to stay sick by creating traps that the patients fall in to thus causing patients to stay sicker longer. There are treatments for patients that do not follow the rules, they are sent in to receive electroshock treatments and lobotomy, even though these treatments are no longer favored by the medical community the hospital still uses them, because Nurse Ratched uses them to stay in control, she uses them to create fear in her ward. Randle McMurphy arrives from the Pendleton Work Farm he seems to be \\"normal\\" he is calm and cool and introduces himself as a man who loves women, cards and drugs. Although it does not seem like McMurphy and Bromden would have anything in common but it turns out that Bromden lets McMurphy in on the fact that he is neither deaf nor dumb and when McMurphy was a child he did the same thing. Although other patients tell McMurphy that there is no defying Nurse Ratched he attempts to deceive her and question her power. Other patients follow his lead and begin to work with McMurphy with things such as refusing to clean. McMurphy eventually learns that involuntarily committed patients are stuck in the hospital until the staff decides they are cured. When McMurphy realizes that he is at Nurse Ratched's mercy, he starts to follow the rules. He sees the power of the electroshock treatments 1st hand and becomes genuinely frightened of the hospital staff. McMurphy arranges a fishing trip for himself and ten other patients, he shows the patients that the outside world is not as scary as it seems and he shows them how to be \\"men\\" by teaching them to catch big fish on their own. McMurphy and Bromden get into a fistfight with the hospital aides when they are attempting to defend George Sorenson. After this incident they are both sent in for electroshock therapy. The patients try to get McMurphy to escape, but he has arranged a date for Billy with a prostitute named Candy, and he refuses to let Billy down. McMurphy bribes Mr. Turkle, the night aide, to sneak Candy into the hospital and they have a party on the ward. Billy has sex with Candy while McMurphy and the other patients smoke marijuana and drink. The aides discover the mess the next morning and suddenly the hospital is crazy, when Nurse Ratched finds Billy with Candy, she threatens to tell Billy's mother. Billy freaks out.... McMurphy tries to strangle Nurse Ratched and for revenge she has him lobotomized, and he returns to the ward incompetent. After this they no longer find Nurse Ratched powerful and the patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out of the hospital....."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Bob say's this was a good book.Bob liked this book. Bob say that the book is full of humor from the battles between the big nurse and Mcmurphy.to how stupid the people in there are. Bob say's go buy this book"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a great example of women's need to control man. It shows through the actions of Nurse Rathet how powerful and controling women want to be. Although a &quot;man&quot; is usually figured to be the dominant sex in life, women clearly show in this story that they are just as powerful as men. Randall Mcmurphy who is the protagonist in the story is the person who takes the role of the male in the story. However, Nurse Ratchet has no intentions of giving up her control over the combine to Mcmurphy. The stories climax is the &quot;dual&quot; betwenn Mcmurphy and Nurse Ratchet. This story clearly shows america's psychiatric society in the mid 1900's and how man and woman often clash for the right of dominance."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You cannot get better than this. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it makes you see."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a modern masterpiece, or so I've heard, many times, from various sources. So I gave it EVERY CHANCE in the world. But I have to be honest, I found it an utterly shallow raving about how the \\"modern matriarchy\\" [whatever that is] has \\"cut off men's balls\\". I read a bunch of reviews that hail this book as subtle and insightful and say that it really challenged stereotypes and drew characters fully and sympathetically. I thought it was quite the opposite. The characters were flat, two-dimensional, and predictable. The rambunctious, \\"life-loving\\" hearty male. The repressive, bureaucratic older woman emasculating the poor men in her charge. The sympathies were clear. The \\"good\\" characters, even when they raped teenage girls, were simply expressing their zest for life. The bad character was so bad that no one could even \\"get it up for her\\".The only thing \\"new\\" was the recognition that the mentally ill were human beings worthy of basic dignity. I'm not even sure that that view was (in 1962) quite as radical as everyone is making it out to be. It was more like a mid-century trend to reconceive deviance.And please, those of you snapping up to write a knee-jerk response chiding me for \\"political correctness\\", desist! All I am saying is that I doubt an author purporting to expose stereotypes serves his work well by resorting to yet more stereotypes with such gusto. Kesey could have made the UNSYMPATHETIC characters more human."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are books that are great reads. Then there are books that are great to read and discuss. However \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is more of a great book to discuss.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a story set in an asylum in what appears to be the 1960's. The asylum is run with precessions by the female nurses and their black orderlies. The men in the asylum have all been beaten down by life. Now they are beaten down by a system implemented by their matriarch, Nurse Rachet. Along comes Randall Patrick Macmurphy, a boisterous charismatic convict, who thinks he's outwitting the system by pretending he's crazy. Over time Macmurphy becomes the inmates patriarch and ends up fighting Rachet for control. How the book ultimately ends hints at the author's cynical views on men, women and society.The book's narrator is Chief Bromden, a half-breed Indian, who (unlike Macmurphy) is actually crazy. Understanding his train of thoughts, as he describes what is not only happening to him but to the other characters, is probably one of the more difficult things about this book. It does help to read an abbreviated version (i.e. Cliff notes) or read the book as a group (i.e. high school lit. class).The themes of this book, I feel, are actually more powerful than the writing, female domination, male empowerment, societal systems, etc. In fact, it's likely to provoke a discussion that's far superior to the experience of reading \\"...Cuckoos's Nest\\".(3 and a half stars)"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have read this book twice. Once in high school 20 years ago and again last year. It stills has the insightfullness of the King of Hearts and all the depth. It is too bad that this book is so well written.

I know that many people say, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\"... but maybe if the cover was more interesting, I could at least study the cover. The book itself did not draw me in. Personally, I don't care about Chief Bromden's \\"psychotic\\" episodes where he hallucinates into some fog. I was surprised because usually these kind of books interest me. I like to learn about how the human mind works, but McMurphy's constant perversion with the nurse annoyed me a bit. There was sexual tension between them that needed to be released, and wasn't. I didn't finish the book so my judgement calls might be wrong, but so far from what I read this book is nothing too interesting or too great.

In this book, Mcmurphy is the leader of a group of wierdos in an insane asylum. Mcmurphy inspires a character named Chief Bromden to come out of his shell and become a more assertive person. The asylum is also broken down into two groups, Acutes and Chronics. Chronics are the hopeless and Acutes are the people that actually think. In this whole asylum there is one person in charge, Nurse Ratchet. She is a prude and has many confrontations with Mcmurphy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If there was ever a more apparent need for a 0 stars rating, this is the time. The time I took to read this book could have been used for much better things. I could have been reading the newspaper, watching tv, or playing some video games. Anything would have been better then reading this P.O.S.. The narrorator, Bromden, is gay and is constantly talking about how he wants to touch other men, I don't know about you but a book with that crap in it isn't for me. Also, the fact that all these people are just staying in this mental hospital when they don't have to is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.

The book, which was followed by an excellent movie, is a shear masterpiece. Told in the first person, by a mental patient who masquerades as being deaf and dumb, this novel explores the daily lives, and struggles of a group of metal patients in Oregon.Yet, it is so much more.It serves as a microcosm of Kesey's view of society.

I think it's not really the subject matter that is so beautiful -- you know, individuality vs. authority, tho that is a good starting point -- it's just that Kesey has such a wonderful grasp on language that it leaps off the page and grabs you by the throat time and time again. By the way, if you like this book, and haven't read Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,&quot; it's got great descriptions of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters going all over the country creating sheer havoc while Kesey was working on this novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"More than any other book I've ever read, Mr. Kesey's book helped me cope with life.

Seen through the eyes of a madman, this book leads us through a whole different world; a world where paranoia runs rampant and chaos is second in command only to The Big Nurse. The book opens with a vivid description of &quot;the fog&quot; that clouds the truth, consciousness, paranoia, and terror which imprison the mind of Chief Bromden, a chronically insane Indian and the first person narrator of the book. Scene by scene, the plot unravels, separating truth and insanity to reveal an extraordinary war of the mind; the power of strict, systematic control, verses the power of rebellion. Any of the acutes that lived on this ward could state in a heartbeat the ultimate source of power; The Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched. That is, until convict Randall Patrick McMurphy convinces the courts that he is a madman, laughing his way from the prison farmyards to the nuthouse dayroom, &quot;bucking the system&quot; at every bump. When Ratched meets McMurphy, it's battle from the start. The Nurse uses her strong intimidation, backed with logic, reason, and &quot;the system&quot;, against Randall's boisterous rebellion, fueled with chaos, brawn, and temptation, both striving to attain the support of the deciding party; the acute insane patients and those chronics who are still enough there to vote the outcome. The magnificent war the follows stretches the mind to comprehend and tickles the imagination. At every turn in the plot, action is pursuing, leaving the reader to contemplate while providing nonstop laugh-out-loud entertainment. Kesey ties together the shoes of character, theme, and conscience, giving them a quick shove from behind to create the shocking climax that will change the book completely."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'm an 11th grader in High school and Im one of those slackers that doesn't like reading at all.

We see the psychiatric ward through his eyes and cheer him on as he conquers the lonely comfort of the fog. Kesey simultaneously removes the veil of fog from the eyes of his readers.

McMurphy, a very spirited patient, takes over not only his ward, but the Head Nurse and other patients as well. He takes extreme measures to make the other patients basically come out of their shells and stand up to Nurse Ratched. The story is told by a schizophrenic patient called Chief Bromden, who all of the other patients and authoritative figures believe to be both deaf and dumb. The battles between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are what bring the story its most interesting points.I found this book to be quite hard to read. The words got kind of confusing at times, and the descriptions of different things seemed drawn out. Most people find this book fun to read, and I think I would have too if I wouldn't had had to read it for school. That always seems to make a difference. I would recommend One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to anyone who enjoys books involving mental hospitals, interesting plots, medical studies, or the main character always fighting for what he believes in."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful book that reveals the cold hard truth about life in a mental institution. Seeing the ward through the eyes of the main character, Chief Bromden, gives new prospective to what you think you know. The thing that makes it most interesting is the fact that it is so real you feel as though you are there on the ward, forced to be part of their daily rituals. Ken Kesey paints a picture that makes you want to believe that what Chief Bromden is experiencing is what is actually happening. But at the same time the language Kesey uses makes it hard to decide whether or not things are really happening to Chief. You find yourself thinking, 'This is all a hallucination...isn't it?'You begin to form an almost personal relationship with each of the characters throughout the book. The relationship between the two main characters is powerful and intriguing. The problems each character is experiencing are problems we have all had, just not to the same extent. This familiarity is what makes the book so easy to relate to, it takes what we all experience and expands to an almost unbelievable level."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It's sad to think that so many people have only seen the movie - I think I was lucky in that I read the book first.

The movie fails to vividly depict the Chief as schizophrenic. Overall, the movie couldn't tap the novel's layered, visually stunning look into the dynamics of defining and categorizing insanity. Better then Prozac Nation which is what our generation got-- but I'm interested in Short of a Picnic, the one about all different mental maladies in a collection. Also, Nicholson doesn't have red hair, like Kesey's envisioned, but his performance was a worthy approximation of the character's spirit."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Since reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest recently, it has rapidly become my favourite book. Kesey has managed to tell a story whilst making a complex political allegory, and that is incredibly refreshing. The characters are so vivid, both loveable and sometimes vile, and Kesey finds the balance between making their exploits humorous, and not patronising the patients of the asylum. McMurphy is a classic hero, but far more complex than most so-called Christ-like figures in literature. The Chief however steals the show for me. The writing during the time he tells how alcoholism is destroying his Father is incredibly moving. Using the Chief as the omnipresent narrator is a superb device employed by Kesey, as it allows a unique, personal and sometimes confusing insight into all the proceedings. Like all great literature, it makes you think, but does it with a unique sense of humour and character, and handles its heavy subject matter with ease: this is a simple read but devastatingly effective. The end of the book is both sad and yet also happy. That adjective sums up the book perfectly- happysad."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kessy is a wonderful collection of similes, metaphors and parallels that make all the different characters the unique characters they are. All of the characters bring certain traits to table and that's what makes this book what it is. This book takes place in a mental ward that becomes disrupted when Patrick McMurphy is admitted into it. He turns the usually calm regulated world of the ward upside down and spins it all the way around. He defies the Big Nurse whenever he can and loves it. He turns lots of the other patients against the big nurse and it turns into a full fledged rebellion going fishing illegally with a girl who turns out to be a prostitute, having parties until the wee hours of the morning with prostitutes, and finally killing McMurphy, the leader of the rebellion because he becomes a vegetable. This book is the best one I've read in a long time. Ken Kessy brings the characters to life and makes you feel like your right in alongside Chief Bromden and McMurphy. It's a very good book and I suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is perfect, about a few people in a mental institution, who strive to overthrow the combine of society. It feels real, yet not real at the same time. Happy and sad. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey is a fascinating writer. He draws you in with a unique story with several implications. It kind of makes you wonder who really belongs in the ward. McMurphy provides his peers with encouragement and hope. The horrid Nurse Ratched is a character you'll just love to hate (reminiscent of Rebecca's Mrs. Danvers...or at least I thought so).If you have seen the Academy Award-winning film with Jack Nicholson (and you'll be a bit surprised to see a much younger Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd), you know how great the story is. However, the book is undoubtedly better than this great film. If you haven't seen the film, begin with the book.I only hope Ken Kesey's other books are this good (apparently he died a few months ago)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's first book is widely regarded as his best and is a witty and subtle look at the \\"machinery\\" and \\"fog\\" that is society. Well written and very addictive, this book is ostensibly about mental patients in a ward dominated by an oppressive and evil nurse. Yet it is really an allegory on many levels. It works as a biblical allegory because, although R. P. McMurphy has a shady past and his behavior is by no means perfect, he does indeed try to set the men free by freeing their spirits. Throughout this book Kesey uses imagery and symbolism to drive home his point. The indellible image of McMurphy on a cross-shaped bed about to be shocked into submission further proves this. It works as a societal allegory. Nurse Ratched and Co. are the ruthless enforcers of an invisible code, their power coming from apathy (or ignorance) on higher levels, or it is given willingly because nobody else will get their hands dirty. There is a lot more to this book, it is an engrossing and memorable experience. If you are thinking of renting the movie instead, I actually would recommend seeing the film first. Why? Because, as is always necessary, the film preserves the same themes from the book and has virtuoso acting from everyone, especially Jack. The woman that they got to play Ratched is excellent too. If you watch the movie first, it works as a good intro to the deeper, more complex book. Anyway, this is a book with a message that is still relevant today and imagery that will envelop you as sure as diving into the deep end of a pool. Enjoy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Those looking for an elaborately conceived dominatrix fantasy set in a mental hospital in Oregon can hardly do better than \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" one of the twentieth century's most infamous period pieces, ranking with \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Slaughterhouse-Five,\\" and \\"Naked Lunch\\" in the category of comic violence rendered as artistic expression and social commentary.The events of the ward in which the principal action takes place are narrated by \\"Chief\\" Bromden, a hulking half-Indian who often lapses into anecdotes from his childhood (the novel's title refers to one of his grandmother's rhymes) and whose pretense of deafness allows him to eavesdrop in sensitive administrative discussions while performing his janitorial duties. From Bromden we get a clear picture of the clinical division of the patients--Acutes who are \\"still sick enough to be fixed\\" and Chronics who are \\"in for good\\"--and of the methods used to care for them and keep them in line, which include occasional electro-shock therapy and lobotomies.The ward is in the hands of Nurse Ratched, a strict disciplinarian just short of a tyrant. We learn very little about her background, but it is obvious she has much experience as a psychiatric nurse because she is masterful in the way she browbeats and controls her patients (all of them male) through psychological methods like imposition of guilt and deprivation of privileges, while the orderlies act as a sadistic sort of police force. The only other figure of authority is a meek male doctor named Spivey, who is decent enough to fraternize, if not sympathize, with the patients.One day a new patient enters the ward--a petty criminal named Randle Patrick McMurphy who is apparently sane but is feigning insanity to get out of incarceration at a work farm. Jocose and gregarious, he warmly introduces himself to everybody in the ward and encourages them to have more fun, which to him means card gambling and taking the guys out on a fishing trip. Of course, his measures conflict with Nurse Ratched's rules and result in what is essentially a struggle for power; she tries to diminish his influence on the other patients by hinting to them that he's really only taking advantage of their gullibility and making money off of them.One criticism I have is that the main characters are not as fully developed as they could be; Bromden, the Nurse, and even McMurphy seem somewhat thin for the considerably demanding requirements of their roles. More appealing to me were two other patients--the sententious Harding, who has a knockout for a wife and observes the folly of the ward with a cheerfully ironic sense of humor; and Billy Bibbit, a bashful, suicidal stutterer with an overprotective mother. I would have preferred Harding over Bromden as the narrator, but of course that would have necessitated changing the tone of the entire novel.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is often said to be allegorical in its depiction of the rebel versus the establishment, but that aspect of it doesn't really interest me because Kesey doesn't even try to be subtle about it; no, I think the novel's value is in the sheer momentum of its narrative, which burns like the fuse on a stick of dynamite. Even for those who have never seen Milos Forman's fantastic 1975 film version of the novel, the sense that the story is leading up to something big and explosive is palpable and pulsating."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I must admit that I had seen the movie before I read the book. Unlike some of the other reviewers, however, I don't think this greatly influenced how I saw the characters-maybe it is because it was a rather long time ago that I saw the movie, and just recently read the book. I think the real reason, however, is that Ken Kesey's writing and descriptions totally immerse you in his view, HIS characters, that these characters come alive themselves, without my own avatars needed.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in an Insane Asylum through the eyes of \\"Chief\\" Bromden, a half-Indian half-white-man who keeps the appearance of being deaf and dumb. The main character, however, is not the Chief, it is Randal Patrick McMurphy-a wild fun-loving individual that likes his life to be his own. However, the authority, the Big Nurse, will have nothing of him living by his own rules on her ward. This escalates into an all-out war between McMurphy and his love of life against the Nurse with all the power.This stpry is truly one of my favorite stories ever. It weaves such a beautiful tale full of points that make you look at yourself and your own actions and ways differently. This is a life-changing novel, written by a true psychological artist."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Don't watch the movie before you read the book! This book has a little bit of everything in it and it's funny, catchy and crazy all at the same time. I'm not going to describe the plot like everyone else, just read this. It takes hardly any time to read but it's a great book and the author describes things very well. Make sure you know what all the words mean (ie. the diagnoses, etc) before you read though!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest, by Ken Kesey, is a novel about rebellion over power and control. Set in a mental hospital, the novel is told thru the eyes of a Native American named Chief Bromden. One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest is a story about how fear can make you do what others tell you to do and how hope can change things around for you. Two of the central characters of the novel represent these emotions, namely, Nurse Ratched, fear; and McMurphy, hope. By following the interactions of these two personalities, the reader sees how their behavior can change the lives of others.All patients in the psychiatric ward are classified as being Acute, able to be cured, or Chronic, those who behavior leads to electroshock therapy or lobotomies. The staff in the mental hospital is mean and cruel and is led by the Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched. But things change when a new patient, Randle Patrick Mc Murphy arrives. Mc Murphy is different than the other patients as he constantly refuses to do what he is told. He openly dislikes Nurse Ratched and eventually convinces the other men to do the same. This is easily seen when Nurse Ratched turns off the power to the television and Mc Murphy has the patients sit with him and watch the blank screen. When McMurphy learns that Nurse Ratched decides when he can leave the hospital, he begins to follow the rules better. However, the suicide of another patient puts McMurphy back on the rebellious track and he smashes a glass window to get at cigarettes. McMurphy takes some of the patients on a fishing trip despite Nurse Ratched&#65533;s warnings of danger. Ratched becomes furious at McMurphy for defying her power and tries to get the patients suspicious of him. This works for a while but then McMurphy and the Chief get in a fight with hospital aides who are mistreating another patient. McMurphy and the Chief both receive electric shock treatments for this action and are now seen as heroes by the other patients. Some of the Acutes now feel strong and are ready to leave the hospital but they see that McMurphy is becoming weak and plan his escape. But McMurphy is unwilling to leave since he promised a friend, Billy Babbitt, a chance to have sex with a prostitute. When Nurse Ratched finds Billy in bed with the prostitute, Billy kills himself out of fear of punishment. McMurphy becomes furious and tries to strangle Nurse Ratched. He is sent to be lobotomized and when he returns, the Chief suffocates him. The Chief then escapes from the hospital. Chief&#65533;s escape from the mental hospital is a victory for McMurphy. Even though he has died, McMurphy has made Chief free and able to resist authority.Although confusing at times, One Flew Over the Cookoo&#65533;s Nest, is a good story to read. The reader can learn many lessons. Following authority without thinking can be bad to any individual as it leaves one with little individualism. Also, rebellion can be a good thing if it maintains your freedom and your rights."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Truly a literary magnum opus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kessey, is a book one will never forget. The daring novel brings a many subjects and criticisms into light on the world stage. It discusses subjects ranging from the wounds society has inflicted on traditional masculinity, to the treatment and role of women in our twisted civilization. The novel confronts these controversial topics subtly through the footprints of the story, using the setting and characters as a representation backdrop. The mental institution, a micro universe mirroring the crazy world we inhabit today. The story is told through the eyes of \\"Chief,\\" a Native American who willingly enrolls himself into the hospital posing as a deaf-mute. As the story evolves, the chief evolves as a human being, taking the reader along for the ride. And I suggest this ride for anyone with an open mind. This isn't the average novel; therefore I don't recommend it to the average reader. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a psychological masterpiece that pulls you in, takes you through the \\"Shock Shop,\\" locks you in solitary, and throws you right back out. This novel will change the way any reader looks and thinks about life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I read this book it was so confusing in the beginning but, in the end that is what made the book so wonderful. This book really shows you how to expand your way of reading a book. The main character McMurphy gave people hope; he taught others how to not get pushed around and fight back. Letting them know that they have rights. I felt that he was a very strong leader. He set the bar for others.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the real reason about why there are no more \\"Cuckoo's Nests\\". The author showed the whole country about the punishment that these inmates were getting. Just with this simple book he changed the whole counry. I am glad that he wrote this book because not many writers would have the courage to write something so powerful. The real question is \\"Was getting ride of Mental Hospital for the good or bad?\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"when I first picked up this book to read for extra credit in English, I thought &quot;hm, interesting...wonder what it's like.&quot; the girl next to me was also reading it, but she quit after the first three chapters...I finished it...and loved it. no joke. It was like I found myself in the world of someone who, like me, observed rather than acted. The time setting is one of my favorites and the overall plot was great. Another of my favorite 'the struggles of human nature' kinda novels. a great read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I first watched the movie, then read the novel. With respect, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. Milos Forman (The director of &quot;One flew over the cukoo's nest.&quot;) made the movie magical and as entertaining as it can ever get. However, the book is filled with deeper details and themes. In the book, Chief bromden is describing Mcmurphy's behavior and in the movie, we see in perspective of the patience. Either way, it's a masterpiece. I would definitely recommend you with the movie rather than reading the novel in this particular case. I know that some books are far better than the movies but this one is different. Jack Nicholson and the rest of the crue FLIES OVER the CUKOO'S NEST. They are unbelievable. Most importantly, without the book, this movie wouldn't have existed. Thanks to Ken Kessey for his eloquence and passion in bringing this book possible. Wonder lies within you Ken Kessey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"After reading &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,&quot; I was generally satisfied with the story line. The serious novel is told through the eyes of Chief Bromden, an Indian perceived to be deaf and dumb. With the arrival of patient R. P. McMurphy, the mental hospital receives a brutal touch of reality. Loudmouthed, rebellious McMurphy struggles in his attempts to make the hospital's patients assertive. He constantly rebels the authority of the hospital's nurse, Miss Ratched. After hampering Miss Ratched's stolid authority, McMurphy gains the patient's trust. His continuous outbursts are often comedic. Chief Bromden dangerously sheds his cover and communicates with the other patients. During a trip away from the hospital, the patients show a great deal of evolution. Nearing the end of the novel, the plot builds to an unexpected conclusion. In this novel, Kesey relays several adult themes while keeping the novel fun and fast-moving."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The first time that I read this book was in theback of a Grayhound bus from Chicago to San Francisco.I was a sophmore in college and coming out to visitmy brother for the summer.

The idea that the handicap were treated this way is disheartening, and the thought of continuous poor treatment is overwhelming. Ken Kesey did an exquisite job of portraying the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched for the upper hand - an endless game where the power hungry witch eventually came out on top. Despite his selfless and somewhat blind attempts to obtain equality and respect, McMurphy was perhaps responsible for the saving of at least one life - Bromden's."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Simply brilliant.

I will consider purchasing again and encourage others to do the same.Great way to build a personal library! Thanks!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A half-American Native American named Chief Bromden narrates the story. He's been in the mental hospital since the end of World War 2. He deceives everyone by pretending to be deaf and mute, however he is not. He believes society is just like a machine-always being controlled-and calls it \\"The Combine\\". A criminal named Randle McMurphy is sent from prison to the mental hospital for being charged with battery and gambling. He was also charged with statutory rape. He is sent to the mental hospital thinking it is an easy way to complete his time sentenced. Although, he soon realizes it is not as easy as it seems. Nurse Ratched is an unfair and cruel woman. She is the head nurse of the hospital and does not think twice about restricting her patients from their medication or essential needs.The main conflict, or serious argument, that was continuous was the way all of the patients were treated as if they were not real people. The conflict being character vs. machine. The patients are treated as experiments; Nurse Ratched is not in the least bit interested in actually helping them. Shock treatment is used with the patients to help solve a dispute, however it only destroys them.One of the prime plot events that occur in the story is when McMurphy arranges for a boating trip with the other men. He wants them to know that they are true individuals rather than just being seen as a \`patient'. When you're a patient, you're just like everyone else. Nonetheless, he takes them out into the real world so that they can see that they are and can be independent. Another major plot event that took place was when McMurphy found out he was one of the only people from his group that was actually committed to the mental hospital. The other patients were there by choice. They had the freedom to walk out any time they pleased but they chose not to. They were all there in the hospital because they chose to be, which makes an impact on McMurphy. Nurse Ratched has brainwashed them so much they don't even realize what is happening to them or that they have lost their individuality.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! I loved that it was nothing like anything I have ever read before. Something I absolutely enjoyed reading about was the way McMurphy wanted to be independent no matter what, and he wasn't going to let anyone annihilate him. I just loved reading about the way the patients thought of themselves as crazy, but McMurphy was not going to let them think that about themselves. He knew deep inside that they were each a unique individual and tried to bring life back into them. I found it extremely interesting how Nurse Ratched continuously tried to suck the life out of her patients while her job was to try and help them. The patients were so brainwashed by her actions, they began to believe she was nice and trying to assist them. She is an evil woman who wishes malicious things on her patients.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading it! It's so unique, that you have never read a book similar to this before. You get such different perspectives from different people, and how their outlook on life is. If you've ever wondered what goes through the minds of mentally ill people, then this is definitely the book for you. Even if you have never wondered that before, if you read this book you will not be disappointed! Throughout the story you get attached to the characters, and there is such great suspense throughout the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I literally just got finished reading the book about 15 minutes ago and felt obligated to write a review on it. Not on the basis that I felt I had to but more so on the fact that what this book has to offer is tremendously endearing and lasting. I came into the book having all ready watched the movie before hand but trust me, the movie is good but does the book no justice what so ever. The vivid mental images this book aides you in crafting is a testament to how well written and constructed the book is. I personally felt as if I was one of the characters walking alongside Chief and McMurphy as they endured all the day to day struggles of being in a mental ward. Let me just say that as well as the aforementioned claim relating the book and the movie is very true, I would also like to add that they are VERY different and because of this I recommend the book for all 3 reasons I am about to state.1. You want to read the book, and then watch the movie.2. You have watched the movie and in effect would like to read the book.3. You have the slightest notion that you might be interested in reading a book, PERIOD!!!And with this mentioned I would like to leave the rest to you fellow Amazon buyers, I certainly hope that this one will not fly over the cuckoos nest of your book library."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"after seeing the movie of the same name and saw that it was based off of a novel i searched for the novel until now i have found it and i am very happy i found it"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What makes Nurse Ratched one of the most memorable villains in all of literature is that, the further we read, the less clear it is what exactly makes her so evil. When McMurphy shows up at the mental ward, the setup of the battle of good vs. evil couldn't be more obvious: He's big, brash, and rebellious; Nurse Ratched is cold, controlling, and manipulative. Ostensibly she is in charge of the mental ward, but her influence runs deeper than merely setting the patients' schedule and telling them what they can and can't do. Somehow, she has the entire mental ward, including the staff, cowed. McMurphy aims to fix that.He is mostly successful at implementing his agenda. He wins the patients' rights to play cards, watch the World Series, and leave the hospital to go fishing, but none of these victories seem to have any weight. Nurse Ratched maintains control, and she wears McMurphy down with kindness and patience. Over time, he begins to question his own motives. He, along with the reader, loses clarity of purpose.Who is Nurse Ratched, and what is the source of her power? Author Ken Kesey gives us several clues. She's about 50 years old, never married, and, by the inmates' description of her, quite beautiful in her youth. But she is completely asexual. By my read, she possesses but one feminine quality, which she executes with nun-like precision: motherhood.That is key. A woman is not a mother without children. But ask any mother, and she will tell you the hardest thing she ever did was let her children leave the nest. Some mothers, in fact, do not let their children leave. We hear of successful grown men who continue to live with their parents. We condemn those men, and rightly so. But also deserving condemnation are the parents who enable them, specifically the mothers who keep their grown children in perpetual dependency.Whether Nurse Ratched is fulfilling her biological instinct or just relishes power over others is irrelevant. The effect is the same. She keeps the inmates of the mental ward dependent on her care. No doubt this is made easier by the fact that the mental ward is populated by weak and disturbed minds. It works on the staff and, temporarily, McMurphy, because dependency is a seductive state of mind. The success of Europe's post-war socialist politics speak to that fact.But the purpose of a mental ward is to rehabilitate its patients so they can reenter society. Unlike women, who become women naturally, men must learn to become men. By denying her patients the freedom to become men, she is robbing them of any chance at rehabilitation. McMurphy, who enters the mental ward as a man, becomes like a child, and when he tries to reclaim his manhood, Nurse Ratched has him lobotomized, rendering him literally infantile, the ultimate form of dependent."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It was a very good nice book.

Written in 1962, it reflects the strong sense of conformity during the fifties and also the ineffectiveness of drugs during the psychedelic sixties, and the author himself was paid to take LSD in a government-sponsored experiment he volunteered for before writing the book. Narrated from the perspective of Chief Bromden, a half-Indian who fakes his muteness in order to hear the secrets of the ward, the book keeps the reader going the whole way through with some cynicism, but also humor. The movie is also wonderful, winning five Oscars and starring Jack Nicholson."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One of my fondest memories of English class in high school is reading this book. Coupled with a teacher who was passionate about reading and literature, of course. Ken Kesey is a master at creating unique quirky characters that have a purpose and a place in his stories. This is a great inside track into the life of patient in a psychiatric hospital - seeing things from that perspective is interesting and eye opening. But more than that the moral of this story is touching and relevant and really stuck with me. This is a classic and a list topper for all high school book lists!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the only books I've ever called perfect, but it really is. The character development is perfect, the character interaction is spot-on, the metaphors and similes are perfectly chosen. The book is not too long, not too short, never lags, remains interesting even when the author veers of the primary plot into the subplots. There's just enough \\"showing\\" and no \\"telling.\\" This book's metaphor is wonderful as well (to me, I feel as though the hospital symbolizes America, the staff symbolizes its government, and the patients symbolize the people--and more specifically what happens to the people when they try to \\"speak up\\"). Of course, when a book is perfect it can mean many things to many people. There's simply nothing wrong with this book. I've read it four times and haven't found a flaw yet. Probably because it's perfect!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I know this is going to sound weird, but this is one of the most positive, beautiful books I've ever read. I know, it seems to be one tragedy after another, especially ultimately for our hero...well, my hero...one RP McMurphy. But what would you have done? Left those men there like that? What's that one quote from that other book, \\"no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his brother\\" (or something like that). When I have it to give and I see someone is in need, this book comes to mind. It's made me walk around with some kind of glow ever since I read it about 15 years ago. I hope it will help you be more of a \\"just listen to what people have to say, and don't pass judgement\\" kind of person too(if you're not that already).While all this is going on, Ken Kesey doesn't let up! You get the feeling he's as excited about writing the book as it is to read. No detectable style, just real great storytelling. With the emphasis on real. This is my favorite book of all time. Oh, I liked the movie and am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, but even he's not the material's equal. Get a copy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of my favorites.

He threatens the status quo, and hence the power structures embodied in the tyrannical head nurse.A struggle develops between the two, as various escapades escalate to the not so pleasant conclusion. Rather well done."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"You know the plot. Rebellion against authority. You've seen it re-hashed a hundred times, but never treated this well. In Cuckoos Nest, Kesey has made the authority palpably evil - malicious and vindictive. He's made the innocents perfectly pitiable. He's made the rescuer a brash brawler fueled by testosterone - not admirable, but respected all the same.The Big Nurse embodies the tyranny of small minds who gain power, absolute power, over those who are helplessly subject to them. She rules with cold authority over her ward of mental patients, twisting them inside so that they'll never escape her machinations until Randall McMurphy appears in the ward, having conned his way in to avoid work detail in prison. Thus begins a battle of the wills that is full of high comedy and tragic results.Even told through the perspective of a giant Indian mental patient, McMurphy's acts are not glossed over as the pranks of a fun-loving mischevious kid. The hatred that he and all patients on the ward have for the Big Nurse seeps out of the pages. McMurphy's goal is to make them into men, not cowering rabbits, and his final Pyrrhic victory transforms the men around him.This is a modern classic that you will not be able to forget."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was at first slow, but as I read on, I realized how well written it is. Wanting to see what I was getting myself into, I read a brief summary and decided that it was going to be a tedious read. As I was reading, I thought my assumption to be correct until McMurphy was committed and brought some excitement to the ward. From there on, I could not put this book down. I became intrigued by the behavior of the patients. It was not until I finished the book that I realized what I read could have actually been complete nonsense. The novel is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden, one of the three patients that are actually committed to the asylum. I began to question the accuracy of the observations seeing that he could have been biased towards McMurphy and made him larger-than-life since he was one of the other committed patients. Then, I began to question the entire novel because the situations that seemed so peculiar, even for an asylum, because the narrator may have actually been insane. Not only was he committed, Chief Bromden was also a chronic, considered to be in a more serious state that the acutes, which further discredits his account. Regardless of the accuracy of Chief Bromden's narrative, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was really well written and incited me to really think beyond the surface."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I absolutely loved Ken Kessey's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. While I have to admit that at first I thought the book was boring and slow and would have to force myself to finish it, I was extremely pleased at the turn the novel takes when McMurphy is first introduced. When he arrives and challenges Nurse Ratched's authority, the novel takes a turn and becomes a both exciting and capitvating story. It brought back memories of 8th grade English and mob mentality and the way in which just one individual has the power to make change as well as the recurring theme of one versus the many. In the ward the patients are obviously the many, yet it's Nurse Ratched who controls every last detail of their sad lives. McMurphy's boisterous and determined personality gives Kesey's book the right amount of light hearted fun to balance out the gloomy reality of the patient's lives. While shocking, the gripping end provides the appropriate amount of closure to the novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I first read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest about two years ago and was fascinated and stunned by its story then. In reading it for a second time, it has forcefully nestled itself into place as one of my most favorite books.This novel tackles essentially every single \\"black and white\\" theme that, as an English student, I have ever been told to take note of. The following themes run rampant: feminine vs. masculine, nature vs. nurture, individual vs. public/society, the societial \\"machine\\", reality and perspective -- all that wonderful literature-nougat. But Kesey's novel is not just the ironic setting of these themes in an insane asylum, but rather how the presentation of the themes reflect upon modern society. This makes Kesey's novel not only effective on the level of eerie and palpitating language, but as a tool of modern social commentary.In the 'insane' microsociety of a mental hospital, where the patients are kept on their inability to assimilate into normal society, the rules and paradoxes of normal society persist. This in turn shifts the scrutiny onto modern American society, giving Kesey's novel the combined force of an eloquent and engulfing story and the persuasion of a social/political activist.The movie is also well worth the rental, if not just for a young and crazy Jack Nicholson/Danny DeVito."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I started this book having to work hard to understand what was going on, but as the plot and character development progressed, I found that it was not just because I had my head stuck in summer break- the transitions that the narrator swings through in tense, place and time do wonders for the reader to understand the process that Bromden is going through. They start in a place where his thoughts and analyzations of his surroundings are so removed from reality that the reader has to trudge through pages, maybe even rereading a few, to get at what he is actually seeing. That was overall my favorite aspect of this book, seeing Bromden became more and more aware and interactive with his environment and friends through his own admission of it as well as the literary style involved in his metamorphosis."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest offers a powerful indictment of society's skewed perception and treatment of the mentally ill. The most striking aspect of the novel is that despite the fact that dictatorial Big Nurse renders the patients in the ward powerless as she forces them to accept their rank as weak and inferior members of society, Mc Murphy is able to revolutionize their way of thinking--he transforms them from spineless individuals lacking conviction and self confidence into fearless challengers of hierarchy and conformity. In addition to assessing the psychological effects of social rejection and questioning the validity of society's characterization of insane individuals, the book contains characters and underlying themes which lend it broader political and cultural relevance. Kesey ultimately proves that regardless of how thoroughly establishments seek to wield power and impose conformity upon the populace, the indomitable human will cannot be extinguished."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I rather enjoyed the book, \\"One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" While many parts are somewhat tedious, there are a few humorous scenes and the ending is both surprising and fitting. Ken Kesey's novel is a poignant tale about one man willing to fight against the norm. In an insane asylum, the \\"God\\" of the lunatics' world is Nurse Ratched. Ruling with an iron fist, she goes unchallenged for many years, until a new inmate, Patrick McMurphy comes in. Breaking every rule and for once brining humor and laughter into the patients' lives, McMurphy sets the asylum upside down. Despite attempts to break his spirit, McMurphy goes on trying to change, even though the odds are against him, although he is far from being a hero. Loud, gambling, whoring, and drinking, McMurphy is far from the typical hero. Despite his faults, he still manages to change and touch many people's lives through his infectious laughter, and his unwillingness to give up. While it was a struggle to read the beginning, the ending is worthwhile."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of my favorite books that we have ever had to read for school. Ken Kesey gives the reader a brilliant and personal insight into the lives of those labeled \\"insane\\" by society and their incessant struggles with the Combine, their families, each other, and themselves. Along with this uncensored portrayal of the insane asylum is an underlying and inspirational message of strength through determination. Towards the end of the novel, Chief Bromden writes: \\"If you don't have a reason to wake up you can loaf around in that gray zone for a long, fuzzy time, or if you want to bad enough I found you can come fighting right out of it\\" (249). Although these words are written in relation to Bromden's recovery from a shock treatment, they apply to the rest of the novel and life. This book is brilliant and enjoyable- I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I've read that Kesey (a definitive 60's icon) was upset that the popular movie by the same name didn't follow the format of the book: being narrated by Chief Bromden. Even so, I thought it was a great movie with one of Jack Nicholson's best performances. Now about the book.The book contained deeper aspects, such as the Combine and the Fog and vivid descriptions of hallucinations that let the reader into the psychotic mind--if anyone would want to...I think the benefit of the book lies in helping shed light on mental illness, how mentally ill people can be harmed by opressive institutions and on the theraputic value of uplifting the human spirit."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey depicts lives of two very unusual characters who are both living in a state of denial. Although the novel's point of view is by a character named Chief Bromden, whose life is cloaked with mystery and pretends that he's both mute and dumb, making him less and less noticeable. Then we are introduced to a redhead menace who, like Chief Bromden, fakes his madness to avoid paying dues through work. Although he's open with the fact that he fakes his sanity, while the other patients dare not bother questioning his sanity. Not because McMurphy treats the other patients but the fact that they think that McMurphy is their savior, the one that will pull them out of the \`fog'. Through series of events Bromden and McMurphy's interaction grew and became friends when McMurphy's conflict with the evil foe, Nurse Ratched. Their conflict grew to the point where McMurphy rebelled and planned to escape from the institution with Bromden, but rebellion can only go so far and consequences were right behind McMurphy. The author's persuasive voice causes the readers to feel what the narrator's, Chief Bromden, feeling, seeing, and his knowledge about a man who sought freedom from a capitalized world that they lived in. This particular author makes the readers have ease with the pace of the novel without any hesitations. I personally recommend this novel to anyone who adores novels that makes them feel as though they are having a conversation with the narrator (i.e. The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger and The Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers). One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest, is an amazing, compelling novel that makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew over the Cuckoos Nest is a story of the life of Chief Bromden, a Native American patient of an insane asylum. He tells the story of his experience through the eyes of an individual that hides his identity by living a little white lie; pretending to be deaf. The characters treat him naively, being ignorant to the fact that his act of playing dumb is only an escape for him. Not till the day that Mc Murphy checks into the ward and causes a disturbance resulting in the individual characters revealing themselves to the rest of the ward does Chief Bromden learn more about himself, his past, and his potentials. Mc Murphy challenges the boundaries of everyone's personalities and engages with their extremes. The individuals that were once hiding behind their rejection from society now learn who they are and how to achieve their prospective. They make themselves heard, and learn to experience. They learn to engage and interact with another and their surroundings. Mc Murphy, the leader of the pack and cause of disturbance to the ward, takes advantage of his role. His entering upon the asylum is based on attempt to escape from the outside world, and therefore claims to be in need of help as an excuse for his lack in character. He is portrayed as the Hero; he has no inclination of leaving before his job is done and before all limits are tested. Not before it's too late does he realize what his intentions in life really are, but his chance freedom has already passed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a look at the characters in an insane asylum in Oregon. A man named McMurphy comes onto the ward, faking being insane to get out of jail. The books is basically his interactions with the patients and how he rebels against the Big Nurse. It is incredibly detailed and is really a great book to read. In addition to reading this, I also recommend that you watch the movie starring Jack Nicholson. It is good to see two different perspectives on the story."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Expressive style. A sad, horrific story of power and vulnerability. Get it in hardback."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. A fascinating, lurid, and disturbing look at the inner workings of a mental institution, this book had me in its grip right from the first page. This is a seminal work in the history of American counter-culture in the second half of the twentieth century, and is a watershed moment in American literature in general. Along with _Siddhartha_ by Herman Hesse, this is the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and in my expert opinion, the greatest work of fiction ever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I have never read a book that has changed the way I think more than this one has. This book truly made me think about the way I think and act, and how society has such a large impact on my life. It is a very personal and insightful book about the way society changes the way we think and act, and how we have to be ourselves and find our own place in society.The story is told through the eyes of an Indian who pretends to be deaf and dumb so that no one will bother him. He tells the story of a new patient who is introduced into the ward. He is nothing like that of the others, and his name is RP McMurphy. He quickly becomes the leader of the patients, always trying one scheme or another to get on Nurse Ratched's nerves. Through these \\"battles\\" of sorts, McMurphy eventually comes up with a showdown with the Nurse.When I first got this book, I started reading it and felt totally lost. My English teacher had recommended the book, and so I chose it as my book for our project. But after reading the first few chapters, I didn't understand anything that was going on. The Chief's viewpoint was so very unique, and I have never read any other book that is like it. I then made the decision to watch the movie first. I know most people are totally against this, but it actually benefited me. I thought the movie was excellent, and already I understood so much more about the portion of the book that I had read already. I quickly zipped through the rest of the book, stumbling much less than I had before.If there was ever a movie that was so similar to its book, it is this one. And because of this fact, it made my reading of the book much more enjoyable. I hope that you will go out and buy this book, and the movie, as both are truly classics."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey uses both shock and humor to express his exasperation with the paranoid and oppressive society we live in. He also brings to our attention the unjust conditions existing in mental institutions at that time. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, is a great classic and still highly regarded book today. The book takes place at an insane asylum, where Randle McMurphy tries to take over Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is a man from a work farm that comes there because he got into to many fights at his farm and thought to be insane. Really, his purpose is to get out of his work duty and relax in a nice building out of the sun. When he gets to the ward right away he gets in a battle with Nurse Ratched challenging her authority. He does not like how she has total control over everyone in the hospital. This book kept me entertained trying to think of what McMurphy was going to do next to the Nurse.The book is told through they eyes of Chief Bromden. It is interesting reading the story from his perspective. He is a really tall and big Native American man. Everyone in the hospital thinks that he is deaf and mute but really, he does it to protect himself. He is considered one of the vegetables on the ward but Randle finds out his secret and takes him out of his mute state. In the end though, it's like the old saying, \\"everything that goes around, comes around.\\"There are many other characters that add a lot to this story including the horrible Nurse Ratched and Billy Bibbit. I would recommend this book for everyone and if you have to read a classic for school, this is the one. It kept my interest all the way through the book, and that is quite odd for me."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one that should be read by any dedicated reader. Although the beginning two chapters are a little difficult to get into, the rest of the book picks up a lot of speed. Parts of the end of the book are a bit confusing, but it adds to the plot. This story of a mental ward and the people that are there gives excellent insight into a whole different world. The characters were very well developed and easily loved or hated. Kesey did a marvelous job delving into the minds of those on a mental ward. He gave a veiw point that is both rare and enjoyable."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had heard so much praise of this book, I just had to read it. I approached it excitedly... yet, I thought, perhaps I would be disappointed, perhaps I wouldn't find it such a good book as everyone else?Guess what, I did.Even though it was written some while ago, it's still pretty modern. Ocurrences, events, memories, they're here, breathinga and alive, in this day and age, in our society. Much has changed, fortunately, but much still needs to reform, to be thought over.Read it. You'll never be the same again"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One flew over the cuckoo's nest, written by Ken Kesey, is an in-depth look at the disturbing and controlling world of a certain psyciatric hospital. The Book is written from the perspective of a patient on the psychiatric ward, Chief Bromden, a large Indian who is smarter then he lets on.The theme of the story is that the system (or the \\"combine\\" as it is called in the book) is not always just, but questioning it can be hazardous to your health. The patients on the ward suffer under the rule of the tyrant, \\"The Big Nurse\\". She is the protagonist of the story, while the antagonist is a much more likeable charachter. Randle Patrick McMurphy is a gambling man who likes to laugh. He is redheaded, Irish, and doesn't conform to rules.Of coarse this stirs up some... comfrontations, you could say. You could also say that he blatently disreguards the overly established rules of the ward simply to get a rise out of the strict enforcer. What ever you call it, the confrontations provide the basis of the book and the most entertaining moments. In the end the other patients on the ward learn a lot from McMurphy's antics. They learn to live again after their long solstice from anything the least but stimulating.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. On a scale from one to ten I would rate it an 8. It lost points because of the ending that I thought could have been better. My favorite aspect of the book was McMurphy. He was clever and funny, but knew what his limits were on the ward. He seems like the type of aggressive person that I could get along with well in real life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is simply breathtaking. It will leave you stunned at how good it is. I cannot recommend it enough. Five stars does not come close to doing its brilliance justice. Read this book and be amazed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a good book but the end seemed rushed. It was neat how the Chief narrated, and because he was a permanent inmate in the hospital, he was very insane. It's written in a phycadelic manner because he has so many hallucinations. The part about Santa Claus made no sense though."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read Cuckoo's Nest as an assignment for my english class. Though the book has a relatively slow start, it's end is unexpected. And it's effects are something that will remain in your head for years."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What is the world you see when you read this book? It may not be real, but that doesn't make it any less true. Here is a place where feelings become sensations and overpower the &quot;real world&quot;. On the face of it, the action takes place in a lunatic asylum. It could just as well be our world. It's populated by a lot of characters that feel more sane than the keepers of the place. The maker of all the rules - the Big Nurse - is the scariest of all, in her confidence that this is entirely her world, run as she likes. Enter Randall Patrick Macmurphy. Rules? What rules? They don't exist as far as he's concerned. This world is just another to be moulded to his liking. Within a minute of his entry, he's run up against the Nurse. Every inmate sees something new about life- it's possible not to follow someone else's rules and live to tell the tale. The Nurse's world cracks up, bit by bit. R.P.Mcmurphy too realizes the extent to which it's possible to fall into the games life creates. This is one character you'll remember forever - and the lesson he preaches. All the inmates - you included - learn that the game is a game only as long as you know you're playing it. Get caught up and you're just a token on the board. Ken Kesey talks through Chief Bromden - an indian who plays at being deaf and dumb in an effort to run from the game. Grammar is an easy prey to the Chief's onrushing thoughts as he struggles to keep up with the speed of events around him. The prose sparkles with electricity as he &quot;sees&quot; his feelings and expresses them as events. Hostility in the air becomes a chill, and the sensation of death is falling into a furnace. This is a book that reads like walking through a &quot;hall of crazy mirrors&quot;. You look back on yourself and don't know whether to laugh or cry."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Why does a certain book become a classic? Sometimes being a besteller is the key, sometimes it is awarded prestigious prizes by literary commitees, and sometimes a film adaptation cements its fate. All this is true for \\"One Flew over a Cuckoo's Nest\\"; however, the fact that it has contributed a phrase into the common vernacular means it should definitely be required reading.The story is quite compelling as we follow Chief Bromden's account of what happens in a Midwestern mental institution run by the infamous nurse \\"Ratched\\" when a spunky newcomer enters the scene and attempts to challenge authority. The narrator has pretended to be deaf and dumb for many years, and he has been able to act as \\"a fly on the wall\\" in various situations. The new guy on the block is McMurphy, a flamboyant, boisterous and randy jailbird with a temper to match his red hair. However, even though McMurphy is the delightful protagonist and provides the most fun for the reader, it is Nurse Rathced who remains the most memorable character - not much unlike Big Brother in 1984 (another must-read novel that has provided a whole set of commonly used terminology).The language is cleverly descriptive - the sound of the starched nurse's uniform is \\"like a frozen canvas being folded\\", and the feel of the institution atmosphere is quite haunting. However, I did feel that it often became a bit \\"wordy\\" at times in the sense that most everything was spelled out. There is little subtlety, and even the symbolic attempts are a bit heavy-handed. The notion that McMurphy can be seen as a Christ-like figure who rebels against the establishment and ultimately must pay the ultimate price for his followers seems a little bit contrived when the \\"treatment\\" table is described as a cross and the electric sparks are likened to a crown of thorns. However, the story as a whole, greatly makes up for the occasional overstatements.The other aspect I found quite fascinating was the portrayal of race and the accompanying stereotypes. It has an honest narrative feel unlike many modern novels where it is quite rare to have a sympathtic character such as Chief Bromden matter-of-factly use what must be considered racial slurs. I often found the descriptions uncomfortable; however, I appreciate the unpolished presentation. Like other elements in the story, it seems dated, yet true to the historical context.I recommend the book both as a chilling account of outdated psyciatric \\"treatment\\" ideology, as well as for the chilling, yet sharp descriptions of an unforgettable villain..."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I watched the film years ago, it was compelling and memorable - a brilliant story. Then i found the book at an airport - i thought i should read it. The book, (I dread to comment in this way) was as good as the film. It was well written, the characters well formed, the narrative well balanced, in fact as good a book as any. HOWEVER my opinion i think was jilted because i had the images of the actors in the film in my head as i read the book. How could anyone forget the contorted face of Nurse Ratched and the idiot smile of b b b b b billy from the film? I hope everyone will pay their respect to the writer and read the book first. It is a great book and should be enjoyed for itself. That the film was just as good, may mean that One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest will never reach outside a generation of readers, in the same way that Catch 22 will (although that made a great film as well).

The book is about life inside a phsyciatric hosptal which in this case isn't very nice. The narrator is chief a Native American who is supposedly dumb and deff. The chief is considered a \\"lifer\\" meanin the hospital has considered him un helpable. He will have to stay at the hospital for the rest of his life which is unfair. The nurse in charge is Nurse Ratchett who no one dares to challenge. She is an extremely mean person who has no care for the patients and treats them horribly. Everyday they live the same daily routine which they don't like. This doesn't matter though because no one challenges Nurse Ratchett. The turning point of the story is when a new patient is admitted, Mcormick who faked insanity to get out of prison. Mcormick gets much more then he bargained for. The author does a great job of deeply describing the characters leaving nothing out. Reading \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\" i felt like i was there. Mcormick is the best character in the book and one of the best in any book i have ever read. He has a very unique personality which at times is hard to figure out, which makes him very interesting. This book takes you deep into the mind of Chief and the other characters. The best thing about the book is that one minute it's funny and the next it's sad. It's very weird one minute you're cracking up the next your feeling bad for the hardships the patients endure. The patients go through severe mental and physicall abuse. Chief goes through mental abuse especially as no one knows he's not illiterate and def. I would recommend this book to just about anyone it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Initially, this book was very difficult to grasp. That was because Chief Bromden hallicinates using an image of fog, and you can't tell if he's telling the truth or not. Once Bromden becomes more comfortable around the hospital, with the help of McMurphy, he stops his hallicinatory acts. McMurphy is a hero to all the patients on the ward. He made them realize that they do not have to follow the norms and can speak their minds. McMurphy's rebel against Nurse Ratched is classic. Rebellion is a huge part of his personality, and considering that he is not insane, McMurphy doesn't feel that he needs to follow her rules.It's a tough book to get into, but once you move past the fog, it is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"To begin with, this book was fairly hard to follow. The narrator, a deaf/mute Native American, goes through hallucinatory episodes in which everything is surrounded by a foggy mist. This is in reference to his time in Vietnam, where he was so mentally affected by the horridness of the war, whenever he feels threatened or in danger, the fog takes over. As the book progresses, it becomes easier to distinguish between reality and his hallucinations. As in every book, there is an antagonist and a protagonist. Nurse Ratched, who plays the part of the antagonist, is a controlling factor in the book. She has the upper hand for everything that has to do in the ward. McMurphy, obviously, would be the protagonist. He is fighting for the rights of the patients in the ward, along with his own freedom. It is a little unrealistic that anyone would be able to get away with the stuff that McMurphy gets away with, but it makes the book just that much more interesting to read, and the whole time you are rooting for the rabbits, and against the wolf!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Yes, there's plenty of Christ imagery in this book, but people have been doing that since Elisha.Yes, Broom Bromden's narrative was conceived during a rather intense LSD session, but that doesn't make this book any less inventive.In the end, read this book not just because it's one of the few that not only further broke down our preconceived notions of what a novel should be and one that forces you to think, but mostly because it's a great read.Ryan Brenizer"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One more quick note: if you plan to read this novel, keep your eyes open for Christ imagery.

McMurrfy is the main steer of the film but drags people of the Nut House in with the story. His whole pleasure at the institution is to: one make jokes to keep his new buddies on their toes, two hastle the leade nurse of the institution which he only does because she is a men old ass goblin, three act like a total ediot,four make things harder for the nurses, five run off and escape, and six make things harder on himself. Finally the bitch nurse drives a guy named Billy (one of McMurrfy's buddies) to slit his own throat. Then McMurrfy almost chokes her to death until a kuhn, knocks him into oblivian. So a day or two goes by and no sign of Murrfy until one night Chief (his best buddy) saw him being put in his bed. So he checks it out and it comes to find out he got half of his brain cut out. Chief couldn't bare it so he puts a pillow on his head and pushes down until he Murrfy was dead. Chief pays his respects by picking up a whole washing sink off the ground and throws it through the window and runs off. All of the people start cheering and Chief runs away.

'Kesey' focuses on the occupants of a mental hospital - a microcosm of the outside world - and whilst reading about the redemption of the in-mates after years of mental torture and abuse the reader is forced to assess how much society controls his own life, and more specifically, whether he has any choice in it.The imagery is beautiful and the moods and emotions of the in-mates are consigned to writing in an easy mannor which would shame most of today's writers.

I grew up in Oregon during the 50's and 60's. Kesey does such a wonderful job of evoking the feel of the state and the times.

I visited mental hospitals and talked with the Head Nurses in my area, and it was really quite interesting that they often did not find the character of the Big Nurse out of line at all, that her actions were completly justifiable and McMurphy was, indeed, nothing but a trouble-maker.

This story wouldn't come from a mind of a contemporary writer, because by our time the issues have change. Have they?Ken Kesey's \`One Flew...' is usually read as an allegory of the individualist. Free-spirited McMurphy is the rage against the machine --personified as the nurse Mrs. Ratched. After the new patient is admitted into the hospital the \`fatal attraction' is instant and mutual. They both represent different things, and fight for different sides.The story is told by Chief Broom an Indian --or a Native American, pick which one you prefer-- that pretends to be deaf and dumb, just to be left a lot and not be bothered by the other inmates. As he is an almost invisible presence --at least before McMurphy arrives-- he is allowed to some \`privileges' that the other ones are not. He can clean the meeting room white a meeting is taking place, and he can hear --although the staff thinks he cannot-- what is being discussed. Having this character as a narrator gives the reader the chance of knowing the inside side of the story; at the same time one can have the required distance with the Chief's observations and comments.Sarcasm is one of the Chief's chief use of language. He has a unique mind to comment the events around. For instance, at some point, talking about the hospital he says that \`there is something strange about a place where the men won't let themselves loose and laugh'. Besides, even being considered a lunatic, he has a very down-to-earth view of reality. When thinking about the nurse after she has another big fight with McMurphy, the Chief tells to his readers: \`to beat her you don't have to whip her two out of three or three out of five, but every time you meet'.This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it. But it is not impossible either. This was the purely 60s way of thinking --and one must be grateful to that, otherwise the world would be even worse.There is a movie version, directed by Milos Forman and staring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. The author Kesey abominated the movie --and reportedly never watched it-- because the Chief is not as important in the film. However, it is still a good and interesting movie.A contemporary writer would probably tackle the issues in another way, not so plain and sincere as Kesey did, creating a metaphor that will last until the day we have master and slaves. And, the last time I checked, it is not going to end very soon."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is so well written I can call it flawless without giving it a second thought. I can see why Kesey had a problem with the way the screenplay was put together. Kesey himself couldn't have done this book justice as a screenplay. This one of the few \\"classics\\" that deserves all the hype it gets. If you read it once you'll end up reading it five times."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Out of all the books I've read in my life, Kesey's \\"willing\\" masterpiece is nothing sort of perfect. Heavily emotional and compelling, Randle Patrick McMurphy is a beautiful character, \\"capable of doing no wrong\\". McMurphy is far from the average American, in that he willingly goes against the system (The Combine), and although he meets his fate in the end, his influence in the rest of the men in the ward is impenetrable as the book ends with Chief Bromden breaking out of the sanitary ward into nature, wild and free where life does not run on a schedule.I won't say too much more about this book, but I definitely recommend either buying it here on Amazon or, if you don't have the dough, borrowing it from your local library. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest does have the potential to change your life...and change your heart."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book. Ken Kesey has a great insight into how our minds work and the societal breakdown that people can suffer. None of his main characters are \\"crazy\\" per se, but just unable to handle the \\"outside world\\" mentally and emotionally. But these men are smart and will give readers and insight to themselves that they may have never realized if it weren't for this book.\\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" is told in the narrative of one of the asylum residents who plays \\"deaf and dumb\\" to everyone around him so he is able to get closet o people and hear their conversations.The story is based on Nurse Ratched's strict orders and rules for the ward and MacMurphy's determination to break down those rules. This battle of wills is charming and amusing and will keep readers turning the pages to see how each battle is won."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is one of the best books, if not the best, I've ever read.It translates many things people feel but don't know how to express- for example, &quot;The Combine,&quot; or &quot;fog.&quot; Chief Broom is schizophrenic, which allows the book to be written in a very interesting matter. But most importantly it is beautifully written.One of my favorite quotes:&quot;It started slow and pumped itself full welling the men bigger and bigger. I watched, part of them, laughing with them- and somehow not with them. I was off the boat, blown up off the water and skating the wind with those black birds, high above myself, and I could look down and see myself and the rest of the guys see the boat rocking there in the middle of those diving birds, see McMurphy surrounded by his dozen people, and watch them, us swinging a laughter that rang out on the water in ever-widening circles, farther and farther, ntil it crashed up on beaches all over the coast, on beaches all over all coasts in wave after wave after wave.&quot;&quot;"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"the topic explored in one flew over the cuckoo's nest is not innovative by any means, it is touched on in other novels like a clock work orange and 1984, perhaps more clearly. the detail that sets it apart from these other novels, though, is the setting. placed at a mental hospital, it allows the book to dabble in the socially taboo subject of dementia, daring to explore the effects of government intervention and ostracism. this is not a book that makes you feel particularly happy or enlightened, but an excellent read nonetheless."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A book is a book, but nevertheless there seems to be always something special about one. There are those books that are incredibly boring, and others that grab the reader and touch their hearts or perhaps chill them to their bones. But &iexcl;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&iexcl;s Nest&iexcl; is something in between all of this. Not something that feels too extreme, yet more of something that makes the reader wonder.Taking place in the a mental ward in the sixties, the story is told through the thoughts and eyes of a Native American Indian chief Bromden, who escapes into the fog which is created by his own paranoia till the new patient Randle Patrick McMurphy arrives. The boisterous McMurphy brings a spark into the depressing mood of the hospital, breaking the monotonous pattern of life in the ward and challenging the authority of the Big Nurse Ratched.But to tell the truth, the plot was not what interested me but rather the characters themselves. Each was so vividly described from appearance to personality; all were well defined and varied from one person to another. Perhaps it was just the fact that each of them had various different mental disorders that made them act the eccentric ways they do, like Bromden who is lost in his fog, hiding from the world and Harding who&iexcl;s sophisticated speech contrasts with his squeaking laugher.But to come back to the point, the book really is something that seems somewhat enigmatic to me. Perhaps it is just that I read too much fiction, but the line between the delusions and hallucinations of Bromden and what is really happening in the ward are blurred. Creating a soupy mixture of reality and illusions, which at some points confuses me (that&iexcl;s why its four stars not five).As a reader I found myself wondering what it all was; what was the root of the problem, why was it attacking Bromden and various other questions. Here the human trait of curiosity is played on, and I found myself falling deep into the storyline seeking to satisfy my inquisitiveness. Undeniably a very good read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of the few cases where the much more commercial movie is actually better than the book! But don't get me wrong, because the book is very good too! Like the movie, its about a man who pretends to be crazy in order to escape a jail sentence but instead of focusing on him, the book focuses more on the character of the Native American, his fellow in-mate. It gives insights into the character's past that the movie tends to ignore and this makes the ending of the story make more sense.a"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book, put simply, shattered me. Anyone who says that they &quot;understand&quot; the book and think its morals are quite wrong is quite mistaken. This book does not present you with clear morals to live by, in fact, I don't think any book does. A book is nothing more than a story... it is left to you to draw from it what you like. As I reached the end, I began to realize that this book like no other shows you that some times the fog is so thick in every direction that you are not elft with any clear &quot;right&quot; option. When the inmates were runnig around drunk through the ward, I thought that this had to be the happy world Kesey meant to show, and that there was a clear moral to the book after all. However, my good state of mind was bashed apart immediately when Billy broke down in front of the nurse. It proved that the world is, however much we like to ignore it, a very dark place, no matter how you choose to live. So, in the end, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is probabley the best written piece of work with the best, most well-executed, and very rich story I can remember reading. It ultimately proves, to some degree, as Scanlon said, &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't...&quot;"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"For a book written by a paid volunteer to use hallucinogenic drugs, a book written by a man who at some points while writing was under the influence of LSD and peyote, and a book that funded the writer's San Francisco to New York road trip on psychedelically painted bus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest turned out perfectly normal, in fact even clever and stimulating. Considered a masterpiece by many, this novel is an extremely insightful satire of the society of the 1950's. Just as the drugs and psychedelic bus may suggest, Kesey could in fact be considered a founding-father of hippie-ism. His \\"hippie\\" attitudes shine through with this book, which in many ways challenges numerable aspects of authority and society. The setting is inspired by Kesey's work at the Menlo Park, Virginia hospital, where he was introduced to LSD by a government-sponsored program researching the effects of hallucinogenic drugs. This experience led him to continue his drug use, and further developed his opinions of society, which we can read about in this excellent book. The story starts when R.P. McMurphy is admitted into the mental ward, transferred from a work farm. He's a self-proclaimed gambling champion and womanizing sex machine, a rough-around-the-edges cowboy of a jokester. McMurphy is the one person who stands up to Nurse Ratched, the symbol of the cold oppression and conformity in society. The book is the story of the patients' struggle against the strict policy and rules of the ward. Under the leadership of McMurphy, who sings, laughs, walks around wearing only a towel, and does anything that he can think of which will disrupt the cold order that Nurse Ratched has on the ward, their adventures include everything from rowdy poker games, to a fishing trip, to a completely against policy late night party in the ward, complete with alcohol, marijuana, and prostitutes. The books end is sad, but realistic and a reminder of the control society ultimately has The narrator of the book is the paranoid Chief Bromden, a 7 foot something giant of an Indian who fakes deaf and dumb in order to hear everything and yet remain safe. It is his narration that keeps the book interesting. Bromden, always standing in the corner with a broom, is able to see and hear everything that goes on in the ward. He is extremely insightful and the style that Kesey uses to portray Bromden as a character is very entertaining to read. Bromden, a paranoid schizophrenic, at some points in the story, hallucinates. The imagery that he provides is usually mechanical and he often talks about seeing fog from a machine that the nurse controls. His hallucinations are metaphors, he describes the ward as having hidden mechanical components, and frequently he sees fog that represents confusion and fear. He depicts society as a combine, a giant machine, and all of the patients at the hospital are broken parts needing repair. They are parts that didn't fit into their place in the machine, didn't fit into the conformity of society. Not only is it an entertaining read, but also a compelling cautionary story. Kesey is giving a warning about a society centered around conformity. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is Kesey's investigation of the control of the 1950's society over the individual, bringing into play themes ranging from the importance of laughter and sexuality to the definition of insanity. The book's ending gets mixed reactions, but it is realistic, and a reminder of the control society ultimately has. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a fantastic book, a highly recommended read, both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"this was a brilliant book. once again, ken kesey establishes wit, courage, and remarkable tactics in his words. well done."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Earlier publication, arrived quickly and in promised condition.

It's fantastic with strong, memorable characters, lashings of pathos and humour - and it's very thought provoking.Choosing to see the story unfold through the fog-filled eyes of Chief Bromden was a masterstroke, a dimension the movie, for all its greatness, couldn't even hope to capture.I'm glad though this book wasn't in the mainstream when I went through school. Being forced to read it and analyse it to within an inch of its life would have sullied what I find now to be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, written by Ken Kesey, grasped my attention from the very first chapter. The story takes place in a mental hospital, located in Oregon. The patients live a dull, routine, and orderly life, until a man named Mr. McMurphey introduces some life into the hospital with his charismatic and energetic personality. He formerly worked on a farm, but supposedly pretends to be insane in order to avoid all the manual labor. Although his arrival appears to be positive, the head nurse, Nurse Ratchet, has a problem with him trying to take control of her own domain. The novel deals with a power struggle between the two and the challenge that McMurphey faces when trying to get the patients on his side. An additional twist added to this book lies in the narrator, a psychiatric patient named Chief Bromden.The characters are well developed and are interesting to read about. Each patient is given their own defined characteristics and their behaviors are a representation of the harsh and controlling influence of Nurse Ratchet. After being provided with key facts about each of the patients, you begin to question whether or not some of them are actually mentally ill. This ties into the many topics discussed in this book including what makes a person insane, a person's desire for power, man verses man, man verses machine, and many more. The plot thickens as McMurphey realizes that the day he gets released is determined only by nurse Ratchet. He is confronted with the problem of choosing between working toward defeating Nurse Ratchet and saving these men or submitting to her demands in order to leave the hospital as soon as he can. Aside from a creative and intriguing plot, the story includes impeccable writing and entertaining dialogue - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A fantastic page turner from a literary genius. As someone who was at one point (and subsequently kicked out of) a mental hospital, this book proves an all too accurate (and often hilarious) commentary on society's dismissive behavior toward all who don't fit the common definition of a \\"sane\\" human being. More than a story of friendship and self discovery, this book remains an entirely valid commentary on the human mind and social stigmatization as well as the rare, selfless act of martyrdom too often absent in the modern world. Through the hardships and strife, the message of this book is clear: learn to love yourself, learn to love others, and take control of your destiny. Beautifully written and packing a punch only Randle McMurphy could throw, this book will leave a permanent impact on anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am a student at Lindbergh High school and I have just finished reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo\`s Nest which was in my opinion a very good book. I know Ken Kesey has written other books but this one was the only one I have written so far but based off this book I know the others will be well written too. My grandpa showed me the movie which got me interested in it but when I found out Ken Kesey were not satisfied with the way the director filmed it, I wanted to read the book to get a better understanding of the story. In my opinion I liked them both but if I had to pick one I would pick the book.What I liked about the book was how there were a variety of characters with different personalities and even better was that they were put into a mental institute. The character that I enjoyed the most was McMurphy but I enjoyed the Indian just as much because of the stories he told in his past life before he was put into the hospital. The character I disliked was Mrs.Ratched which I am sure no one enjoyed but if she wasn\`t in the story it wouldn\`t of been as interesting. Mrs.Ratched is the complete opposite of McMurphy which makes the story more appealing because everything he does is in spite of Mrs.Ratched.Besides being a good book, it also seems realistic because the book was written through Ken Kesey\`s Experiences as well. It wasn\`t a science fiction or fantasy, it was written about real life characters and events that could have really happened. I read about how Ken Kesey has worked at a mental institute and talked to many of the patients at the hospital and to him all the patients seemed normal which made him think that maybe they were not crazy they just lived in a society that thought they were. I liked the book because it was realistic and it was trying to show people a message about life.The book comes off as an ordinary story but when it starts to pick up it begins to be more interesting and things start to happen that you wouldn\`t expect to. The very end was the most interesting and saddest part to me because McMurphy ends up dying. At the same time the Indian gets to be free and try to find his family that he\`s been away from for so long. To be honest, I was shocked to see McMurphy get put through that surgery and basically become a vegetable because of his behavior. I thought that McMurphy would escape with the Indian and they would become friends or it would end with that general idea.Another significant part of the book to me was the writing because of how descriptive it was about everything the characters, the hospital, and any item that was talked about in the hospital. In the very beginning it describes Mrs.Ratched and her briefcase that she is holding filled with her papers for work. So many things were said about her and the briefcase that after she was described I had a perfect image of her and that made reading it more enjoyable because I could imagine the story in my head.One Flew Over the Cuckoo\`s Nest was a very interesting book to me and I thought it was a great story with a lot of sad and happy moments. The book was creative and very very descriptive which makes it more enjoyable and easier to understand. There was not one moment in that book that was dull or hard to understand even during the dialogue were there was no action because of how entertaining and interesting the characters are in the story. I enjoyed the book and even the movie."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I recently heard an NPR conversation about the 50th anniversary of \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest\\"; the conversation referred to author Kesey's displeasure over the movie. I decided to read the book for the first time and then see the movie, which I had seen years ago. What a great read and what a great movie. Like most book-to-movie productions, the movie lacked the depth and nuances of the book and there is a key perspective shift from the book to the movie that I won't describe (it is such a pleasure to discover the shift by reading and watching.) Differences notwithstanding, both the book and movie are classics and thoroughly enjoyable and disturbing, and the stories behind the production of both are fascinating as well. A must read-and-see, so glad I am so glad I did it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Sure, I had seen the movie a few times, like everybody, and so I figured there was no pressing reason to read the book. But lately I have been getting interested in Kesey. There was an interesting article about him and his fight to make his son's death (in a car accident on an icy road) meaningful in a literary journal a couple of years ago, and I also saw the documentary \\"Magic Trip\\", which shows clearly that Kesey was a ringleader of the avant-garde group that was ushering in the counter-culture explosion of the 1960s. (Apparently he eventually turned his back on the movement he did so much to create, but that is another story.) I decided it was finally time to read something by him.I quickly discovered that this novel was much more than a good template for a movie. Nor was it merely a popular novel by a young man who became a cultural icon. This is a Great American Novel. Not only is the story and the main character fascinating and richly drawn, the prose hums with energy and color. The descriptions are full of detail (the author worked in a mental institution for a while, and knew what things were like). Kesey was capable of some very nice prose, but things never get stuffy. The story moves along nicely, and there is a lot of insight into the minds of, not just the troubled men depicted here, but men generally. My guess is that he was influenced by Kerouac and Burroughs, and probably by some traditional Western novelists too, such as Wallace Stegner, who was the director of the writing program at Stanford, where Kesey got his MFA. One of the interesting surprises here was how well Kesey wrote about the sights and sounds of rural Oregon, where he was raised and where he spent most of his life.I won't bother going into the plot or the characters of Randall McMurphy or Nurse Ratchid here, since they are so widely known. There are some interesting secondary characters who get a fuller description in the book. Professor Harding, the erudite but sexually confused and cowardly gentleman, is a bigger player in the book, as is Chief Bromden, who narrates the tale. There are large sections of hallucinatory prose in which the chief lets his twisted fantasies run wild which are fascinating to read. He also thinks back a fair amount to his childhood in a rural Indian village which was wiped out to make room for a dam. Billy Bibbitt seems very much the same on both page and film. In fact, the screenplay does a masterful job of condensing the story. A couple of incidents are cut out and others conflated, but for the most part it stays very true to the book.The themes are fairly clear from the beginning. Society breaks people down, robs them of their freedom, and forces them to conform. Lunatic asylums are mostly places where the mentally weak have come to lay low and avoid dealing with a world that has no use for them. This harsh, cold, overwhelming pressure to conform is personified by \\"the big nurse\\" (as Nurse Ratchid is called) a manipulative, heartless bitch who has no love for her patients or desire to cure them, but wants only to make them give in and follow the rules. (I am sure by the way that feminists would have some issues with this book, since the women in it are mostly either kindly prostitutes or Nurse Ratchid - but it is important to point out that the book takes place in a men's mental hospital. I would hope that Kesey's female characters were deeper in other things he wrote.) \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" presents a rebellious young man's view of the world to be sure, and the author was a rebellious young man when he wrote it. This way of thinking was a big part of the 1960s ethos - personal, individual freedom from social mores and restrictions was seen as an unquestionable good. Kesey was one of the people who put it into words and images and characters, and he did so brilliantly in this novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The mixed reviews baffle me a little bit, for there is nothing mixed about my feelings for this brilliant novel. I can somewhat understand ones initial boredom with the novel, for it is written slightly longwinded, but the prose is so genuinely engaging that its style quickly becomes its biggest drawing point.Many know of \`One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', not as a novel but as an Oscar winning motion picture starring Jack Nicholson. While the film is brilliant on just about every level, it all started here, with this fantastic novel. Ken Kesey had inside knowledge of his subject, having worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital himself, and this knowledge is present on just about every page. He beautifully (albeit tragically) filters through the lives of the patients and the staff, exposing the darkness (masked in humor at times) that permeates the lives of those living in such conditions. The novel pits two very strong willed and independently centered individuals against one another in a game of \`good cop/bad cop' as either one attempts to attain complete control of the ward.First we have the ruthless Nurse Ratched who establishes order through an iron fist. She forces and manipulates and destroys those in front of her, namely the patients as well as fellow staff. She degrades the men in her ward and blackmails the doctors, all the while carrying a sense of duty, as if her actions were for the betterment of those around her.Next we have McMurphy, the rookie patient who is a Vietnam vet with a history of violence and insubordination. He opted out of the work camp and chose to serve his time in the mental ward, hoping for a quick pardon. He uses his time to try and selfishly dethrone the evil Nurse, masking over his actions with the air of sincerity, as if his actions were for the betterment of those around him.The novel is narrated by the Chief, a large patient thought by all to be deaf, dumb and unintelligible. This allows him to watch everyone and judge accurately, for they are open around him, thinking that he cannot understand. He takes us up close and personal, letting us into everyone's circle and exposing their true intentions.What I remember most about the film was that it left me conflicted as to my thoughts on insanity. The film painted so vividly the thin line that runs between the stable and unstable that I found myself wondering if we all weren't just a little insane. The novel does this very same thing, just to an impressively grander degree. Each character is fleshed out in a way that his mental imbalances come across in subtle waves, and then violent crashes, almost hiding them before our eyes only to explode before us. We start to see them as normal human beings, and this scares us because when they do expose their weaknesses we are stunned. The reverse can be said of the seemingly normal ones, like Nurse Ratched and McMurphy. Both characters come across abrasive and childish throughout, only revealing their calm and controlled presence in rare splashes of reality. This allows us to see them as the monsters, as the crazy ones, only to be chilled once again when the fact that they are in fact that \`normal' ones sets in on us.We see them, yet we don't truly see them.Kesey's brilliant novel has been hailed by many, and the film adaptation swept the Oscar (rightfully so). Both are fantastic examples of the supreme style of manipulation, allowing us to see what we want to see only to crush us with the undeniable reality of it all."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Multiple people told me before I read this book and while I was reading it that it's a great book and one of the best they've ever read. With only twenty pages left, I agree that it is a well written and very interesting. I would recommend it to almost anyone that is looking for something different to read.I didn't have any idea what this book was about before I started reading it. About halfway through the book, I could almost say the same thing, I wouldn't be able to summarize what had happened at that point. This book is not hard to read or understand, but in the beginning not very much happens. Mostly beginning introduces us to the characters and allows the reader to get to know them, and it also describes the setting, which is a mental institution. The characters are all well defined and unique; they're very interesting to read about.Ken Kesey writes in a descriptive way, but not to the point that it's boring. Actually this book isn't boring at all; it's the type of book that keeps you turning the pages. For most people, the situations and characters aren't familiar at all, and it's hard not to become intrigued. Of all the classic books that I have read, this is by far the best one."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is easily one of the greatest novels ever written. Chief Bromden is, by far, the most humanizing narrator I've ever read. Though this novel is an unyielding social criticism, it's also a very effective one in that it forces the reader to empathize with confined characters while realizing the authoritarians' actions - particularly those of Nurse Ratched - seem even more villainous due to the demoralization which is felt when one is corrected or otherwise censored without being capable of understanding what it is they've done to deserve such.A beautifully written and timeless novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a very good read.

Hearing this story through the eyes of \\"Chief\\" Bromden and witnessing his emergence out of the black is truly a moving experience. Nurse Ratched may be the most terrifying villain in the history of literature mainly due to the fact that her subtle torture of the patients is so believable and frustrating.It is truly an outstanding and timeless work of art."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is the Great American Novel. All other classic American literature pales by comparison. Most classsic American novels fade over time (Catcher in the Rye comes to mind in this category) or they are historical footnotes, of a time and place, like Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck or some of Hemmingway's work. Important, yes, but they read like history and lose some of their relevance.But Cuckoo's Nest reads better today than it did 45 years ago. Who is insane and who isn't? What is the bureaucratic Combine up to in the 21st Century? And who exactly fits in neatly to Society, and what are we going to do with those who refuse?Perhaps most important of all, Cuckoo's Nest is laugh out loud funny, which makes it very American, and makes it stand as tall as Chief Bromden to the other American classics. I mean, outside of Mark Twain, name an American classic novel which tackles a very serious subject and does so with riotous humor? Only one in the 20th Century, and that honor goes to Cuckoo's Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There are some books I feel every teen should read.

It is a story that will survive many more generations."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Great book. I hadn't read it since the 60's!So much better than the movie. It was our book club's September reading. A wide range of women from 40-75. It was all agreed upon that this book was worth reading again."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I enjoyed reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey because throughout the novel Randle Patrick McMurphy helps the other men realize they're not as crazy as they thought. He tries to make shortcuts through Nurse Ratched's rules. Also, he tries to get the best of her to prove she isn't as strong and powerful as the men think she is. The other men on the ward start to look up to McMurphy and begin to believe he is their savior."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I believe that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gives a different perspective of what the every day person thinks of a psyciatric ward. I myself did not find this book a real interest grabber. It draged alot in the begining and alot of the humor really wasn't that funny.One creative aspect to this story was the hallucinations that the narrorator Cheif Brodem has. Kesey uses the fog as a get away. But also as a life turner.Many of the characters in the story also did not a appiel to me. Normally there is one person you can some what relate to, but not in this case.Big Nurse to me was over exagerated and non realistic.I guess I give Kesey credit for his thoughts on paper and his imagination but I don't believe that him himself sober and not on LSD would make any type of writer."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall, I think that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a good book. I liked the way McMurphy was constantly trying to break down Nurse Ratched. Before McMurphy came along nobody ever tried to do that to the nurse, and I just thought it was pretty cool how McMurphy just came in and was a complete rebel and didn't believe that the nurse should be so overpowering to the men. McMurphy defenitly acted as the savior to all the men. He was the leader for the men to go against the rules of the ward, he help the Cheif finally regain the courage to talk to other people again and overcome \\"the fog\\", and he also helped Billy Bibbit out with his sexual problems. There were some messed up parts in the book like when the man cut his balls off to commit suicide and in the end when Billy Bibbit slit his throat because he didn't want his mother to know that he had sex with a prostitute. The ending was very superising and I didn't expect that McMurphy was going to have a lobotomy and be taken down both by the nurse. Overall I think that the book was really good and I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What I do not like about this book is the fact that they are living in a dictatorship enviroment. These chronics and acutes are put through a lot. They have no choice of what they want to do. They have to follow Nurse Ratchets every order. I feel that the only thing I like about this book is the fact that McMurphy stands up for himself and that he teachers the other people in this nut house how to stand up for themselves as well. The book has a good story line I am just not into reading about crazy peoples problems. I have enough problems of my own."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is a little interesting. The words are very small but it can be very interesting reading about what goes on in mental institutions. The book takes place at a mental institution where the patients are split into Chronics and Acutes. Chronics are worse than the Acutes and need more help. Things get a little rowdy when a man by the name McMurphy comes in as a an Acute and basically tears the place up. Some people do not like him but others are inspired by him. He can be tough and controlling and shows the nurse what he can do. He tries to beat the nurse but at times seems to not be able to. Chief Bromden is the narrator of the story and is classified as a Chronic in the story. He plays off being deaf but really isn't. He later accidentally shows that he is not deaf."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Unfortunetly I have not gotten far enough to write a decent review. But from what I heard and what I have read so far, it is pretty decent. Chief Broom goes through many experiences throught the text. His personality and his character eventually grows from a very shy, \\"deaf\\" man, up to a man that can make his own desicions. The characters go through the institution with an attitude that they will soon get out. They know that they ultimatly know that the Nurse decides when they will leave. They dont tell this to the main character, who is trying ever-so-hard to get by with his 2 month sentence. Through conflicts, the loss of friends, and proving himself, he goes around defying the rules and arrouses the other patients to step up for what they believe and get them to stand up for themselves. I would recommend this book to people who want to read about a person going through his life in an instituion and wants to be free."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Overall, this is a decent book where all the inmates are affected by a new person by the name of McMurphy. Everyone changes once he enters the ward. Everyone starts to think for themselves and stand up for what they believe. This turns out good for some people, and bad for others. One of the main characters, Chief Bromden, is a large Native American who is thought to be dumb and deaf. Over the course of McMurphy's stay, he comes out of his shell and actually speaks. There are other people who come out in different ways. For example, Billy Bibbit is a shy man who stutters, and McMurphy changes him. He finally gets a woman and then Nurse Ratched, the \\"bad person\\" of the story, finds this out and threatens to tell his mom. He ends up committing suicide. Ratched represents repressed life while McMurphy is very outgoing. I recommend this book to any person in high school or above. This book is complicated to read in the beginning, but over time it gets easier. This is a decent book to read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Great characterization and writing style. The characters were well developed and portrayed, the antagonists were destestable, and one really cared for the protagonists. McMurphy, the novel's hero, was wonderfully 3-dimensional. Though not perfectly good, one was able to look past his flaws and see the depth of his character--the good he did in the asylum/hospital greatly outweighed his past wrongs. The people in this novel were realistic, with emotion and feeling. Great book! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Buy it and stick with it until the end.

I am currently at a major bookstore and the paperback book is the same price as what amazon is offering it on kindle. I have a membership to this bookstore so actually the book would be cheaper. Its really disappointing that I am not getting a discount or a cheaper book by being \\"green\\" and not buying a paper product of a book that is 50 years old. It is actually quite obnoxious."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"An individual who sees the movie first, and expects to read one of the funniest novels ever, will be sorely disappointed. The movie, is told in some respects, from the viewpoint of R.P. McMurphy(played in the movie, brilliantly by the way, by Jack Nicholson), while the book, is told from the viewpoint of Chief Bromden(played in the movie by Will Sampson). And from Chief Bromden's perspective(that of a virtual mental ward &quot;lifer), some of the things, such as Bancini constantly moaning, &quot;I'm tired, I'm tired&quot;, which McMurphy justs finds hilarious, Bromden finds rather tragic. The viewer of the movie doesn't fully understand that nurse Racthed is &quot;evil&quot;, to some extent, I'm certain viewer's of the movie sympathized for her, but the reader of the book has absolutely no sypathy for Nurse Ratched. The reason the reader of the book has no sypmathy for Nurse Ratched is they know her whole story, she eliminates any one with independent ideas, and falsifies the results of other people's findings(for instance, if the doctor, who viewers of the movie thought would help Jack, were to diagnose MacMurphy as capable of returning to the normal world, Nurse Racthed could simply insinuate he was an alcoholic, and his diagnoses would be thrown in the trash!). Nurse Racthed is sort of the literary world's Joseph Stalin. Purposely omitting other remarkable differences from the movie, I shall end my review. All I can say is, read the book, and of course, watch the movie, it certainly won't change your life for the worse(although I can't say for sure if it will change your life for the better)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about an insane asylum in the mid part of this century. It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief Bromden looks out the window for the first time. The reader is always on the edge of his seat, waiting for something else to happen. Everyone I recommend the book to gets something a little different out of it, which is why this is such a tough review to write. You really have to read the book, because there is no real way I can explain it to you. I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who loves a good story."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am currently teaching out of this book with my 10th graders.

You must read this, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The first half of this book is quite slow. It does have its funny and sincere moments though. If the first half of the book was as well written as the last half, it would deem five stars. The protagonist in this tale is a good natured lug who tries to inject the spirit of life into a ward of patients of mental illness. He unveils the hollowness and darkness they live day in, and day out, while striving to weaken the clinical hold over them by the head nurse. It is a touching and heartwarming story. It illuminates the contemptible views we had, and to a large extent still have of \\"mental illness.\\""},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I debated reading this book, assuming that it was a pulpy best seller whose subject matter was already exhausted by a very good movie. But the book has true literary merit and is infinitely better than the movie. The story is told from the viewpoint of the Chief, whose struggles with his own demons and delusions adds a whole new layer of complexity to the story. McMurphy's character is at once more iconic and more subtle than that portrayed by the movie. He struggles with the burdens of being the hero, a bit like \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", to draw on another great movie. But the Christ symbols are also more present in the book. To be sure, it's a strange Christ who strangles Nurse Ratchet. Much as you want her to be strangled, I don't think that particular twist works any better in the book than in the movie. Still, Ratchet's role as the symbol of everything that's wrong with our overly controlled and bloodless social order and McMurphy's humanity are wonderfully conveyed in this book. It's a significant book and is better than a lot of highly ranked novels of the latter half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an incredibly powerful book, especially when you consider that it was at least loosely based on Kesey's own experiences in a mental hospital while participating in government drug experiments. As someone who had watched the movie before reading the book, I was at first surprised that it was from the Chief's perspective; what would that do to the story? Well, it made it very, very intense. Bromden, or \\"Chief\\", is incredibly observant, and even his hallucinations tell the story in a very real way - he sees everything as mechanical and calculating, and believes that not only the hospital but the in fact entire world Outside is a giant \\"Combine,\\" which is set against people. His account of McMurphy's battle against Big Nurse is very insightful, from beginning to end; and of course the end is incredibly powerful and disturbing, and shows a great deal of strength of character in Bromden that has begun to emerge in the course of the book during his friendship with McMurphy. Really an amazing read, and worth it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Ken Kesey does a great job of making you feel connected to his characters. He does such a good job you almost think they are real. Another thing Ken Kesey did a good of was constantly changing the theme which kept you interested. It also had a very emotional and unexpected ending which makes this book great. I would recommend it to any one with a high shcool or higher reading level."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read this book many years ago, and again recently. I have worked at 3 different mental institutions, over the last 35 years. There were many areas that Mr.Kesey took liberty with, but over all, people that have never been in these instutitions, would be suprised at how accurate most of it is. Fortunately, in the later years, the operation, that RP McMurphy underwent, has been discontinued. All of the staff of these places, are honest, and hard working people, but there are still those nurses, that have a point to prove. Even today!

I hadn't even begun reading \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" Yet, and Already I was enthralled by the captivating story of a Mental Institution and The Colorful Characters Living in it.Chief Bromden, The narrator of the story, is a half-breed Indian who is also a patient at the ward. A patient for many years, he has worn the guise of a deaf-mute, and while this is not actually the case, he has fooled everyone into believing it. He Spends all his days mopping and observing his environment. His Fear Of The \\"Combine\\"-What He Believes are the Machinery That Fills The Walls and floors of the hospital- only serve to make the story more interesting.The Central Figure of the Combine Is Nurse Ratched. Described as being large and intimidating, the Nurse runs the whole floor from a little glass booth.Perhaps the most interesting character of all, Randle McMurphy is an Obnoxious, Tattooed, red-headed Instigator That Causes Problems from the moment he arrives at the institution. He Feigns insanity to duck being sentenced to a work farm. He undermines the rules, gambles for money, and walks through the hallways dressed only in towels. Tensions build between him and Ratched when his spirit encourages the other patients to call for change.All In all, While definitely odd, I believe this was a piece of literature worth reading; I may very well look into reading other pieces by Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book might not seem interesting by the look of it, but once you read it. it grabs you.

The writing is wonderful and the insight into this facet of \\"The Human Condition\\" is unmatched. I feel that this book should be required reading for all medical students and should be part of a required medical ethics class at all medical schools.This work has profound implications far beyond the those related to the medical community. This book raises questions regarding due process, habeas corpus, and American civil rights in general. Proof that this book is truely a classic has already arrived. These problems have returned upon our nation and what is old is now new again. Consider the shocking, current, real-life case of the crusading Harvard Medical School graduate Dr. Stefan Kruszewski, a prominent Harrisburg Pennsylvania psychiatrist, in these articles:the Philadelphia Daily News, Wed, Jul. 07, 2004\\"Lawsuit: State fired shrink for exposing abuse\\"By NICOLE WEISENSEEEGANthe British Medical Journal, July 10, 2004\\"Whistleblower charges medical oversight bureau with corruption\\"Jeanne LenzerThese articles are related to the \\"mental health initiative\\" that was announced by GW Bush and was based heavily on the Texas TMAP guidelines, which were developed and implemented in Texas while Bush was governor. The initiative was announced by Bush's \\"New Freedom Commission on Mental Health\\" and apparently involves wholesale testing of Americans, even school children, for mental illness and the administration of drugs to those found \\"wanting in sanity\\".It appears that corrupt drug companies are currently trying to turn all of America into \\"the Oregon mental hospital\\" written about in this book. With the enormous Vioxx scandal in the news right now, is this really hard to believe? It shouldn't be.In many states now one phone call can result in an innocent person being stripped of their rights, detained, interrogated, and possibly drugged to dangerous levels. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" should concern anyone who believes that \\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\" are more than just words.If you appreciate the book \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", I also recomend the followingBooks:\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf\\"The Pearl\\" by John SteinbeckTV:\\"I Am Furious Yellow\\", Simpsons episodeMovies:\\"Anger Management\\", staring Adam Sandler\\"Chicago\\", staring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger\\"A Perfect Murder\\" staring Michael Douglas"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey does not waste words.

This novel is about a man named Randall McMurphy or Mac as some of the patients called him is sent to a psychiatric ward instead of prison for a crime that he was tried for and the outcome was spending time in the hospital. McMurphy figured out that if he acted crazy, he would not have to go to jail and spend time working and he could lounge around and do nothing in a hospital. Here at the institute, he sees that there are quite a few people whom he will have fun by giving them a hard time. McMurphy's main advisary was a woman by the name of Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was a large lady and Randall knew that it would be a task to annoy her but that he was willing to accept. Just within a couple of minutes of entering the hospital, McMurphy notices this one large gentleman whom appears to be Native American. His name is chief and he is supposed to be \\"deaf and dumb\\" yet in reality does not want to converse with anyone. Chief's first impressions of McMurphy are not good, however further on the fantastic voyage, they will have become best of friends. McMurphy eventually changes or at least has a large impact on many of the patients in the hospital and then everyone notices what his purpose that he felt like serving there really was.I would recommend this novel to those readers who enjoy a story about a supposed nut-case whom fools everyone and while noticing that the way people are treated in the hospital is unfair and unjust, then he would attempt to change it. Also if readers are looking for someone to show caring, sympathy, and special bonds being friendships to emerge from this experience, then I would really recommend this novel to anyone. You can really see how the detailed description of different characters view on events, or items that either go on or are in the hospital appear to be. Different patients, different illnesses, different perspectives, and different emotions turn Ken Kesey's novel into a masterpiece. Kesey was able to create two characters that would have the biggest impact on the audience, as well as the novel itself. Those two were McMurphy and Chief; the friendship that once was dislike and then slowly evolved into something passionate and heart warming would melt those whose hearts buckle for two people who care about someone with everything they have. Chief helped McMurphy to escape when he wanted and although he had a chance, he would not allow chief to be taken and abused, so he decided to stay back and endure the agonizing struggle to survive under Nurse Ratched's power."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"its good.

I was inspired by a friend of mine to reread it, and after many many viewings of the film based on the same tale, starring Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers, amongst others, I still do not come away disappointed from this brave and outrageous story of mental ill health in the early 1960s. Ken Kesey is one of very few writers with the talent and perspicuity necessary to balance extreme horror, pathos and humour so precariously that his material is never disrespectful and immensely readable. You laugh and cry with the victims, and your heart soars and cascades with the vagaries of their lives. Unputdownable."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had a hard time getting through this book.

(I love the story - but it is the quality of the \\"Hardcover Book\\" that is very disappointing)."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"My husband and I have made it our project to work our way down the AFI's list of the 100 greatest American movies. The 1975 Milos Forman adaptation of this novel appears on the list (#20 on the original list, #33 on the later revised version), and I have a rule about not seeing movies based on books unless I've read the book first, so of course I found myself picking up this novel. I usually enjoy reading books regarded as classics, but I wasn't particularly looking forward to this one. Having spent quite a bit of time in psychiatric facilities between 2000 and 2003, including over a year in a semi-long-term facility when I was around 20, I tend to steer clear of fictional treatments of mental illness, for a multitude of reasons. The idea of a *comic* novel set in a mental institution didn't sit well with me at all.Then I actually read it.There's been enough said already about the plot. You probably already know the core storyline of this novel is the battle of wills between the malicious \\"Big Nurse\\" Ratched and the malingering convict Randle McMurphy. Ratched is a wickedly effective villain, in whom genuine malice is seamlessly commingled with the impersonal force of compulsory conformity. (It can surely be no coincidence that her name so resembles \\"ratchet,\\" a mechanical device that allows movement in only one direction.) McMurphy, the lusty swaggering gambler, is perhaps the least saintly Christ figure in all of literature. Less attention, unfortunately, has been paid to the novel's narrator, \\"Chief\\" Bromden, whose delusions hold more truth than most people's view of reality: the one-man Greek chorus who comes into his own as protagonist and, in so doing, holds out hope for all of us who aspire to something more than just getting by in an insane world.\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is, of course, a counter-cultural novel in which the mental ward is symbolic of a conformist society. Although Ken Kesey was inspired to write this novel by the time he spent working on a psych ward, his primary goal wasn't to call attention to the mental health system per se. Still, I found it almost frightening just how perfectly he captures it - and just how little some things changed in the four decades between this novel's publication and my own hospital experiences. There is, of course, plenty of exaggeration in these pages, of both the dramatic and the comedic varieties; as the Chief himself admits, the reader may well \\"think the guy telling this is ranting and raving . . . you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! . . . But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\" No, they don't actually have patients lobotomized for having the audacity to ask what exactly is in those pills that they're taking - but that doesn't mean they encourage that sort of curiosity either.I've seen staff mock and ridicule patients, and even provoke them when they were in crisis. I've had them use their knowledge of my trypanophobia to force me to behave as they wished, even when I wasn't doing anything that would legally justify their so much as laying a hand on me. I've been to the \\"Community Meetings\\" where no one in charge actually gave a damn what the \\"community\\" had to say. When I noticed how often I was given the wrong meds, and brought this to the attention of the higher-ups on behalf of the other patients who might be less diligent in checking the contents of their pill cups before swallowing, some of the nurses labeled me a troublemaker. I remember how many of my fellow patients bought uncritically into the therapeutic model they were offered: \\"If we can't work together as a community in here, we can't do it out there,\\" one of them proclaimed once, to the approval of staff, while I shook my head in puzzlement, wondering what getting along in a closed group of heterogeneous strangers, among whom the only common element was severe psychological illness, had to do with getting along in the outside world. Kesey touches upon all of these things, with such compassion - never stated, but plainly obvious, and never descending into pity - that I was able to empathize completely with the characters, rather than feeling isolated by the memories of my own trauma.As for the comic aspects of the novel, I found myself enjoying Kesey's dry, dry, brutally ironic wit. Never does he go for cheap shots at the expense of the mentally ill; the characters do sometimes behave in humorously absurd ways, but Kesey refuses to mock. Unlike the men on Nurse Ratched's ward, I found myself laughing often during my time in the hospital - but it was a bitter laughter, the kind that comes when you just can't cry anymore. In fact, one of the most triumphant moments of the novel has the men learning to laugh again. McMurphy, according to the Chief, \\"knows you have to laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy. He knows there's a painful side . . . but he won't let the pain blot out the humor no more'n he'll let the humor blot out the pain.\\"Kesey's writing is beautiful and challenging. The characters are rich and complex; I was surprised how much I came to care about even some of the minor figures. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a rare accomplishment: a genuinely tragic comedy, or a genuinely comic tragedy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A book about a mental institution that poses questions about sanity, freedom, human dignity, and the right of individualism. Written from the perspective of one of its inmates, Bromden, whose marginalisation in this microcosm of an oppressive system is accentuated by the his giant stature, his Native Indian roots, and assumed deaf-and-dumbness.Through Bromden's surreal narrative, an otherworldly phantasmagoria is created, where the tyranny of Head Nurse Ratched (\\"wretched\\"?) gives her the power to control time and douse the premises with (literal?) mind-numbing fog, and walls (and patients) are wired, and controlled like clockwork by her control panel. Then in swaggers McMurphy, the quintessential American rebel, who disrupts the system, challenges the authority of Ratched, and basically rouses the inmates from their passive acceptance of their subdued states, to reclaim their lost humanity.Kesey, by delivering the story through Bromden, destablises the authority of the narrative, but as Bromden claims early on, \\"it's the truth even if it didn't happen\\". The reader, in negotiating with the text, establishes an uneasy relationship with that narrative, which is the success of the conceit of this book. What is real, and does it matter?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It's a page turner. I'm not a continuos reader but this book I could not put it down. Check it out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The seemingly oxymoronic title of my review, \\"A good bad book,\\" is intentional. I can sum up this book quickly by saying that it is very well written, that Kesey was a literary genius, and that it is deservedly called a classic. So what's the bad news? Let's just say it's not a book I recommend for a first date! If you want a book that drips cynicism and psychological violence, this is the one. The subject matter is about a man who is in revolt against the very corrupt powers that be in a mental hospital. The problem for me is that he is as much a criminal as they are, but his criminality is glossed over against their greater violence, a common theme in literature. Randle McMurphy, to me, is not a sympathetic figure, but he is made to look that way because his \\"freedom\\" comes through attempts to defy an extremely oppressive power structure. Indeed it is mentioned that he once led an escape from a Chinese prison camp...but his behavior is still very much thieving and unexemplary. Among many other things, his stautory rape of a yong teenage girl is decidedly glossed over; but for me that one act robs his character of much of its sympathy.If you want a book that purports to be an expose' of mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century, without a single redeeming quality, (personally I cannot and will not believe that all of them were such hell-holes) then this book is for you. I'm reading it because, again, it is very well written, and since I am in a production of it on the stage as my very first drama, I want to do my job thoroughly, and that's why I am reading it. Great reading, but for God's sake don't read it when you're depressed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Love the book. Great writing, great reading.I was very transported by his writing into the insane asylum where the Big Chief and eventally McMurphy, live. I could hate the Big Nurse as if she was an enemy of my very own. I couldn't help but feel a slight bit of validation when McMurphy ended up first slamming his fist through her wall of glass at the nurse's station and then choking her in the hallway. Then I realized that I wasn't a crazy person and couldn't agree with his choking her almost to death.It is written so well that you can clearly understand the Big Nurse's hate, cool calculation, manipulation and utter control that she has over her patients. She is a demented sergeant operating under the guise of truly wanting to help her patients.McMurphy is as sane as they come, as sane as any of us except he has vices and in this setting, it is unacceptable. It must be fixed. He seems extremely likable and reminds me of a few people that I know. I root for him throughout the book.Poor McMurphy is brought to a sad semi end by the Big Nurse but thankfully and sinfully, the Big Chief puts him forever out of existence and then is off to start his own new life."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel officially ends the 4-book reading that I had set forth to get my teeth into this summer. I must say, that it truly stands out from anything I had read before it, be it this summer or anytime for that matter. Ken Kesey weaves a tale that is smart, witty, sometimes insane and ultimately tragic. Though the setting is mainly in a mental asylum somewhere in Oregon, this story has a universal appeal to it that can be felt by anyone, anwhere in this world.R.P. McMurphy is a sane man that, due to a brush with the law, opts for being committed in a mental asylum rather than be incarcerated with hard labor. Upon his entry in the secluded world of the asylum, he strips all the barriers formed and starts laying his own rules, in his own way. This leads to problems with the head honcho of the place. A big, gruesome, and menacingly evil Nurse Ratched, dubbed Big Nurse for her huge frame and even huger bosom. The rollercoaster, that patient McMurphy takes the inmates through, finally leads them to realize the ultimate goal. That man, no matter the situation, can always hold his destiny in his hands. This knowledge, achieved in the end, does not come without a price.Set in the late 60s, early 70s, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a gem of modern literary works that came out at the time. It brought out a wonderfully-made movie, starring Jack Nicholson as McMurphy. The role defined him as an actor to be reckoned with. Though the mavie is seen through the eyes of McMurphy, the novel's perspective looks at things through the eyes of a big half white, half Native American inmate, that acts deaf and dumb in front of the asylum's staff. The narrative, because it is through the eyes of a mental patient, can at times be truly insane. That's where the fun really lies. Kesey works his magic in making us feel the insanity and despair of the patients. He can be funny, in a laugh out loud kind of fashion. He can also be tragic, when you realize what the inmates go through each passing day. The novel is a definitive treatment of the age old abode of individual versus establishment.This is a very human story, with a lot of suffering and exploration of man's insecurities. It has become a classic that some schools have even recommended as part of their curriculum. Through all the ups and downs of the story, I was, forever inspired and ultimately liberated in mind to finally realize that you can take away a man's life, but never his freedom. The book receives my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Counterculture icon and author Ken Kesey (1935-2001) wrote his first novel, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" in 1960. The book was a response to the author's experiences testing mind-altering drugs for the federal government and his later tenure as a nurse's aide in the same facility. In the introduction to the novel, Robert Faggen places this seminal novel in its proper context, arguing that this book incorporates several themes of the 1950's: the Cold War, the plight of the Native Americans, the reliance on psychiatry as a cure all for social problems, and the vestigial remnants of McCarthyism. Even if you could care less about how Kesey's book fits into American cultural history, you could hardly fail to miss the overarching theme of his novel: the tensions between the individual and the state, between those trapped in an industrial society and those who wish to live in freedom. There is a film version of this book starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher that adequately captures Kesey's stark visions.The author's tale takes place in a mental asylum at an unknown time. Perhaps this is because time has little importance to the inmates in the facility. The people in this particular ward of the hospital fall into categories of \`acute' or \`chronic,' depending on whether they have hope of recovery or are irrevocably ill. The days are full of drudgery, an endless round of medications interspersed with playing cards against the background of canned polka music. Everyday the acute patients meet for group therapy that really doubles as a McCarythyesque tattling session. The name of the game is acquiescence to the myriad rules and regulations of the institution. Those inmates who violate the rules earn a trip to the disturbed ward or a quick trip to the electroshock chamber. Repeated disobedience could lead to a lobotomy. Predictably, fear is the perpetual state in which most of the patients live. But with the appearance of a nonconformist named Randle McMurphy, fear starts to give way to a burgeoning hope that life will become better in this hospital.The narrator of this story is Chief Bromden, a mixed blood Indian who is a patient in the ward. This man spends his days mopping and sweeping the floors while hearing and seeing everything that goes on around him. The Chief fears that something called the \`Combine' controls the world. For him, the \`Combine' is the machinery that fills the walls and floors of the hospital, constantly spying on and controlling the men in the ward. He believes that those who work in the asylum are actually full of cogs and gears, are part of this giant, controlling machine. Moreover, the staff and the patients believe that Bromden is a deaf mute. He isn't, but Kesey's choice of this Indian as the narrator of unfolding events is a stroke of brilliance. Since no one thinks the Chief can hear or speak, he becomes privy to every activity in the institution. The staff speaks freely around him because they feel they have nothing to worry about. His cleaning duties allow him full access to every area of the floor, including the room where the staff meets to discuss other inmates. You cannot help but like Bromden, and you quickly question whether his observations are truly the ramblings of a madman.The central figure in Bromden's \`Combine' theory is Nurse Ratched, sometimes referred to as \`Big Nurse.' This seemingly grandmotherly woman personifies the Chief's fear of control and cold aloofness. Ratched runs the floor from her little glass booth, her hands on the levers of the machinery that controls the lights, the music, the group therapy sessions, and even most of the doctors. Her voice alone controls the destiny of the inmates. Ratched enforces the rules and regulations, and she decides who receives punishment or release. Big Nurse encourages stool pigeons and belittles the patients with implied threats and stony glares, often masked under an ersatz exterior of patience and cheerfulness. With the arrival of McMurphy, Ratched prepares for a battle of wills that by extension is a war between the individual and the state.Randle McMurphy is a boisterous, tattooed, redheaded troublemaker ducking a sentence on a work farm by acting crazy. Right from the start, McMurphy undermines the rules and regulations of the hospital. He gambles for money, wonders the hall wearing nothing but towels, sings, and challenges Ratched's authority by going to the floor doctor to receive rule waivers. But far, far worse is McMurphy's effect on the other inmates in the institution. His breezy spirit and tenaciousness encourages others to demand changes in the daily routine. Randle is a subversive of the worst type, and Ratched will do anything in her power to slap down this upstart to her fascistic rule. The end of the story seems to mark a significant defeat for the concept of individualism, but if one reads closely it is apparent Kesey keeps the dream of freedom alive however ephemeral it may be.Although I disagree strongly with Kesey's career as a counterculture mainstay, I loved this book. Everything about it is brilliant, from the characterization to the tight writing style. The Penguin edition even includes pencil sketches of people Kesey drew during his work as a nurse's aide. These haunting sketches add a special dimension to the text. Ultimately, the novel works because of its messages of freedom versus entrapment and the dangers of both conformity and nonconformity to the human soul. I recommend you run, not walk, to get this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this classic a few months ago after I chose it off a list of books for an english paper. Little did I know that I had made a great choice. I have always enjoyed books that centered on individuality and rebellion's against the rest of the society. This book is no different. It follows the story of Randall McMurphy, who throughout the novel tries in every which way to disobey those with power in order to find a way out of the mental hospital for himself and to help the other members of the ward in escaping as well. He becomes a teacher for the ward, a helper for them. Many characterize him as a Christ like figure, as Kesey does provide enough evidence that he may have been notioning such an idea from the beginning through language, character descriptions, and events that parallel events from the Bible. This novel has become one of my favorites and opened up my heart to other classics such as The Great Gatsby and Catch-22. If it were not for &quot;One Flew Over,&quot; I'd probably still be content with more recent novels. Thank you, Mr. Kesey, for such a fantastic book. It reads rather quickly and leaves you with a satisfied feeling at the end. &quot;One Flew Over&quot; has one of the best endings I've read in a very long time, possibly ever. I did not believe it would end as it did, but it makes complete sense when you sit back and think of the novel as a whole. Well done, Kesey, your effort is well appreciated and strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"...and i thought the movie was great when I first saw it. I was amazed by the performances of Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, so I told myself I have got to read the book.Luckily, my english litterature teacher in college gave us an assignement on that book. I have read it through and through, over and over. I have read it twice in about two days. I couldn't stop reading. The slang that Ken Kesey uses when Chief narrates the story is just great and really brings us back in that period.But what i really loved in the book, is that you get to know why chief is like that. In the movie, you only get a little bit of the story, and that's a shame. I really enjoyed the book and the movie. But if you only saw the movie, you're only getting half the picture, so I say, if you liked what you saw, then buy that book and read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a great book and I'm sure you can read the other reviews for insight into why it is so great, but the Kindle edition isn't very good. It's like they ran the book through a cheap OCR and just threw it at Amazon. There are lots of scanning errors. 'He' often comes thorough as 'I Ie' and the letter 'c' and 'e' appear to be interchangeable in multiple places. Avoid the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The longing to be free is an inherent human characteristic. So is distrust of authority. Author Ken Kesey weaves both of these essential human components into his masterpiece, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.The setting of this novel is an insane asylum, darkly and fearfully portrayed by Chief Bromden, the book's narrator. For it is within the wall's of this harsh, bleak institution that Authority--coined the \\"Combine\\" by the Chief--controls, directs, and manipulates every aspect of the lives of the patients. Nurse Ratched, who controls the Chief's ward, is the ultimate authority figure--a menacing, cold, callous, larger-than-life authoritarian who will stop at nothing to make sure the \\"Combine\\" stays firmly in power. Kesey, through the Chief's narrative, creates a gloomy, hopeless world, a world where the facility's patients have nothing to look forward to except the inexorable clutches of insanity.Into this world appears Randle Patrick McMurphy. This character isn't insane, he's simply trying to beat a work farm rap. More importantly, McMurphy is a strong, self-willed individual; instantly, the \\"Combine\\" senses a threat to its control. The story subsequently becomes a battle of wills: McMurphy's relentless defiance against Nurse Ratched and the Establishment. Granted, McMurphy achieves a series of victories, but in the end, Authority prevails. Or does it?Kesey's allegorical tribute to the indomitable human spirit is brilliant, fascinating, and timeless. His negative social critique of authority unchecked makes ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST one of the literary masterpieces of the 20th Century, a novel most enthusiastically recommended.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's novel \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a whirlwind of eccentricity and brilliance. In a plot that is completely character-driven, Kesey skillfully manipulates stock characters to reflect on larger ideas regarding the individual and his place in society (both on the ward, and at large). The evolution of character and self - highlighted by the \\"reality\\" of life on their ward - is fascinating; Kesey attempts to prove that insanity is a product of contemporary culture, and that reality is not as fixed as those in power would have the masses believe. I am currently teaching this novel in an introductory-level English class, and it has proved to be through-provoking and inspiring - even to students who otherwise have no interest in reading novels. This is a novel everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This novel is a dark look into the life of an insane asylum, told through the eyes of the committed Chief Bromden, who has faked being deaf and dumb for his entire ten-year stay at the ward. Randle Patrick McMurphy is a newcomer to the asylum, and his self-assured competitive outlook on life upsets the rules and regulations of the ward. He is the first to challenge the ultimate authority, the Big Nurse, and he helps the other men gain the bravery and willpower to stand up for themselves. McMurphy helps Chief Bromden find himself and ultimately break out of his shell. This book presents some ideas and images that are difficult to follow, but this only makes the book more realistic, because it is expected that it would be hard to comprehend the workings of a troubled mind. As the characters evolve and adapt to their changing surroundings, Kesey sheds light on human morals, and the sometimes corrupt short-term solutions to problems that people come up with to make their lives easier. Through the power struggles between the Big Nurse and her patients, Kesey also demonstrates that there is a fine line between sanity and insanity. Many of the narrator's mysterious observations are metaphors for how people act in reality, and it is fascinating to journey through his warped mind and see the world as he sees it. I highly suggest this book to anybody who likes to read books that call for a fair amount of thought and deciphering, but are rewarding in the end."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey's great accomplishment here is that he's brought a grand sense of authority to this book. He worked for a spell at a similar mental hospital in Oregon, even going so far as to subject himself to shock treatments. These experiences allowed him to add authentic detail to his world, such as the classification of the patients as Chronics, Acutes, Walkers, Wheelers, and, most ominously, Disturbed. The lucid descriptions he provides of each phylum are heartbreaking. Life in his ward world is made up of mindless repetition and routine, where patients are watched over by hapless staff, and institutionalized racism is never given a second thought. All of these aspects of the hospital work together to provide a nifty little microcosm of a radicalized 1960's America.Much of the novel is internalized. Chief Bromden, our humble narrator, begins life as a deaf and dumb Chronic. Only he's got a secret (I'll never tell). The story, as told from the Chief's point of view, is disjointed and fragmented. This is not an ineffective technique, however. In fact, it helps bring the reader into the mind of the insane, because as the Chief suffers through his hallucinations, we get to suffer along with him. Kesey, to his credit, never goes overboard with the Chief's dreamlike states. He works hard to keep the Chief's meanderings intelligible, always getting back to the story just in time before he lost the reader completely in that mania. He lets the Chief reign himself in if only to provide lucid commentary on the events at the hospital. This duality, this schizophrenia, makes the Chief one of the great unreliable narrators of the postmodern age. He's not consciously covering his tracks to make himself look better. He really believes the things he says, even if the reader can't fully. &quot;[What follows is] the truth,&quot; he says early on. &quot;Even if it didn't happen.&quot;The real strength of &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is that it not only gives us a strong internal narrative, but the external one is pretty strong as well. Otherwise it would have made for a pretty convoluted movie. Most novels do one well but not the other.The reason that the external portions are strong is that they're anchored on the fate of a truly memorable literary character: Randall Patrick McMurphy. McMurphy, a former work farm employee just new to the hospital, is a more complex character than I thought he'd be. I was expecting from him only unbridled, ego-less action. Instead, he was also quite focused, rational, and well thought out (listen to him cut through Harding's bull, with his neat &quot;'peckin' party&quot; analogy). This brings up one of the novel's central questions: whether or not McMurphy really should be in the asylum, or if he's just faking to get off the work farm (in fact, this question can be asked of all the novel's characters, except, of course, for the Chief. We've been inside his head and can surely testify that not only does he have a few loose screws, but also his screwdriver is broken). This question makes the ending all the more tragic. I'll not give the ending away, but be aware that knowing what ultimately happens to McMurphy didn't lessen the experience for me, and it probably won't for you. Kesey manages to hold the suspense until the reader gets there. When he finally lets go, the shock of it hits you like a fist through a window.The novel's central and scariest truth is that the system (i.e., what the Chief calls &quot;the Combine&quot;) can't be beat. That's very much a 1960's attitude, but still relevant in contemporary culture, especially for those of us still trying to make our way in the world. It is personified here by Nurse Ratched, who, no matter how persistent you are as an opponent, will always hold all the cards. And the sad irony is that this fact, once known, makes McMurphy's final punishment seem more like a blessing than a curse."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey himself will be forever associated with the happenings of the 1960s, but &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; (1962), like other great novels, transcends its countercultural origins. Nearly forty years on, with over 8 million copies sold, it has become an essential part of postwar American literature.The setting: a mental hospital in Portland, Oregon, in the 1950s. The terrified, ill-treated inmates cower under the evil Nurse Ratched, who is all-seeing, all-controlling. Enter the hero, Randall Patrick McMurphy, a brawling, gambling womaniser who, as his initials suggest, is there to induce a revolution. The slowly escalating conflict is played out in a simple four-part structure, building towards an inevitable and moving climax. &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is narrated in the first person by Chief Bromden, a half-Indian thought by all to be deaf-mute, and his extended flashback of events allows Kesey to mix reality and hallucinations to brilliant effect. By presenting the mental hospital, explicitly, as a microcosm of broader society, Kesey urges us to consider our own lives in the light of the events he describes.Its simple structure belies the fact that &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a feast of allegory: of good versus evil, man versus machine, sexual freedom versus repression; of McMurphy himself as humorously subversive Christ figure, as bringer of fertility, and many more - and watch out for the white whale shorts and stuttering Billy, &quot;Faulknerian brain burning&quot;, and even some hidden rhymes at the end of part 3!But spare us the half-baked Freudian interpretations which Kesey himself so roundly mocks. And pay no heed to the charges of sexism and racism levelled at Kesey's novel: his playful plotting and comic-strip characters make such criticism futile. Kesey balances it beautifully: amidst the ribald humour, there is just enough realism to keep us engrossed; and this reviewer little doubts that the systematic cruelty and dehumanisation practised by Ratched and her aides is commonplace in our prisons, mental hospitals and wherever else we lock away the &quot;undesirables&quot;.Indeed, it isn't surprising to find that Kesey worked in a mental hospital before writing &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, and his acquaintances there filtered into the novel; some a little too obviously, perhaps, viz. the (originally female) &quot;Public Relations&quot; who sued Kesey in order to get her character changed. Kesey also tried out electric shock treatment firsthand, and was part of a government program testing psychoactive drugs, his experiences with LSD forming the basis of Bromden's electrifying hallucinations. Now, although Kesey himself may be pretty wacky, he has no personal experience of schizophrenia, and his portrayal of mental illness and its causes has been justly criticised as simplistic. But &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is not, primarily, meant as a contribution to psychiatric therapy, and criticism of it on these grounds is somewhat wide of the mark. We should be glad that Kesey successfully attempted a greater task: to write an anti-authoritarian novel of immense power, forcing us to question the &quot;Combine&quot; seeking to control us all.Kesey's next book &quot;Sometimes A Great Notion&quot; (1964) is more subtle: a long, complex, involving tale set in an Oregon logging town. Fans of &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; should perhaps first try &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; by Tom Wolfe, in which Kesey himself challenges 1960s America with some crazy escapades of his own, thumbing his nose at authority in the same spirit, one senses, as his hero Mr McMurphy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is an important book, with unforgettable characters, an interesting setting and an engaging plot, but first a couple of side notes. It seems in-coincidental that the main character's surname, McMurphy, is similar to that of Larry McMurtry, one of Kesey's Standford classmates in the Wallace Stegner writing program in which they were enrolled while Kesey was writing the book--perhaps a nod of fond respect or gratitude. Also consider that Kesey was likely to have been under the influence of LSD-25 while writing the book. It was before LSD had been declared illegal, and he'd volunteered to take it under a school-sponsored program funded by the CIA. The drug could account for some of the book's more hallucinatory scenes.Kesey's been tagged by critics as misogynistic, unfairly in my view. It is no more misogyny when villainous female characters are depicted than it is misandric when badly flawed males are featured. This book is richly endowed with both. When characters exist in society, it's a writer's duty to serve them up with craft and gusto as Kesey does, lifting the veil on Nurse Ratched's cruelty and passive aggression. Female cruelty is also evident in Harding's wife, who flirts openly with other men in the ward to torture him. Nor does Kesey spare the topic of prostitution in the characters of Candy and Sandy, who go about their work with charm and enthusiasm.Lesser villains are the black orderlies, Washington and Warren, who extract a vicious toll of hatred against the virtually all-white inmates.The main character, McMurphy, is well drawn and believable, driven to inevitable combat with Nurse Ratched as the plot moves relentlessly forward.My only real complaints are the choppiness of Kesey's writing style and the hallucinatory mental wanderings of the narrator, Chief Bromden. I also found Bromden's first-person subjective point of view to be distracting in places, too. It is through the Chief that unrealistic insights into the mind of Nurse Ratched are conveyed. Omnicient qualities are more effective when conveyed in third-person.Sheep attract wolves and frogs, snakes. It seems that collections of the vulnerable, such as orphans or mental patients, serve as magnets for abusers. CUCKOO does a masterful job of exposing this social tendency. One hopes that, if nothing else, the book and its related film resulted in some degree of reform among America's mental institutions."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"First, this review is not a literary critique of the book. It is a review of the digital download.I'm a little over halfway through reading the book. I'm not sure how the work was actually digitized, but the final product is full of editorial errors. It looks similar to some of the documents that I've run through OCR in the past. I would have expected that before the final product was sold online for $10.99 a copy, someone would have taken the trouble to proofread it. I gave it a 3-star, \\"OK\\" rating because the volume is still readable even with the numerous errors. However, it takes away from my overall satisfaction with the product when I have to stumble over these errors during my reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Even though One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a metal institute, it is more an allegory about goodness overcoming oppression and tyranny than it is a story about mental illness.The book contains an interesting assortment of characters:The most noticeable character is Randle McMurphy: a fun loving, gambling, free spirit who went to the asylum to avoid finishing out a sentence at a hard labor camp. He arrived and injected life into a place that had been devoid of it for long. The patients had become complacent by the routine, strict rules, and the ever-present threat of shock treatment or lobotomies if they stepped out of line. The drugs they were constantly administered clouded their consciousness and numbed them emotionally. Bromden called it the fog, and McMurphy was constantly trying to lift them out of the fog.The narrator of the story is Chief Bromden: a seemingly mute half-Indian whose has a case of extreme anxiety. His dad, once a mighty chief, was reduced to a miserable alcoholic once the government took his tribes' land and homes. Gradually, McMurphy teaches him to have courage and believe in himself. Bromdon has an extravagant imagination and describes many of the events that occur with very colorful and creative metaphors. This adds to the richness and enjoyment of the book.The villain in this book, Nurse Ratched (Big nurse), is very controlling and manipulative. A warm and caring faade is always displayed to the patients, but in reality she only wants absolute control of everybody and everything in the asylum. She has carefully selected her staff for that purpose. She constantly has a caring smile on her face, but do not be fooled. Everything she cunningly does or says is to secure control.Throughout the novel, big nurse and McMurphy constantly butt heads. The patients, led by McMurphy, gradually become more defiant, which results in a shocking climax at the end. This novel was an absolute joy to read. I could relate to the fears and insecurities many of the patients struggled with. Most of the acute patients were not crazy just sort of stuck, unable to overcome certain difficulties and were comforted by the security the asylum provided them. A life lesson to take away from this novel is that even though society, government, political pundits etc. say they are doing things for your own benefit, they may actually doing them for more selfish and insidious reasons. Another important message to take away from this novel is that no matter what pain and problems life has thrown your way, have courage to fight on. Oh and don't forget to have fun along the way."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think you could make a solid case that this is the best novel written during the 1960s. Differing greatly from the movie, the book is seen through the eyes of the Amerindian character, Chief Broom. McMurphy comes off in a similar, but also different way than the McMurphy in the movie. The biggest difference to me was that in the book McMurphy was the best therapist in the whole hospital, helping various patients get over and deal with their issues. He even makes the head shrink on the ward feel like a real living man again during the fishing trip where the Doctor catches a huge fish. The Chief while showing obvious signs of real mental illness, some of what is used to showcase that, the \\"Combine\\" and the \\"Fog\\" are also obviously symbolic of some very real things. But I don't want to get into a bunch of mental masterbations about what various things and characters in Cuckoos Nest are representative of. I'll leave that to the eggheads of the world. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a great book and I'll leave it at that.But what about Kesey himself? Ken Kesey had LSD experiments done on him at Stanford by the guy that ended up in charge of the CIAs Mkultra mind control program. This really makes me wonder about Kesey. Its more or less accepted history that the first LSD to get out on the street level was what Kesey stole from the medicine chest at his job as a night shift janitor at a mental hospital and distributed it among his elitist friends. So they give out keys to the medicine chest to the nighttime janitor and he knows just what those fancy new fangled drugs that make the crazies act even crazier are called eh? Ha ha! Yeah man give me a break. I believe Kesey was given LSD to dole out by certain people for specific reasons.Kesey went from writing what was probably the best novel written during the 1960's to, while becoming a counterculture hero, never writing another thing worth reading again. Did doing too much LSD scramble his brains and ruin his creativity or was his creativity nullified by Mkultra programming? Its hard to say for sure but I have to wonder if Kesey was not under some sort of mind control or was being used by the CIA in one way or another. There are a lot of unanswered questions in my mind about Kesey."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kasey *****One of the most important pieces of literature ever, and not just for American literature.

It is the classic tail of good versus evil as told through the eyes of an Indian Cheif as he watches his once comfortable solitude be interupted by a one McMurphy who is just claiming insanity to escape a court ordered work farm. The head nurse, Nurse Racthed is maybe the most hanious villion in all of American literature.

Easily one of the five best novels ever written."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"While One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has a slow beginning (perhaps an attempt by Kesey to explain to his reader the maddening monotony of a mental ward,) it quickly picks up an intriguing plot centered around the observant Chief Bromden and the boisterous R.P McMurphy. When McMurphy bursts into the lives of his fellow patients, his presence forces the others to reclaim the manhood they have given up upon entering the ward. Though his influence is short when compared with the amount of time the men have spent apart from society, his rebellious ideas change their outlook on their lives and situation in a drastic way. Thick with irony and the traditional themes of literature, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is by no means a common or ordinary read. By employing the escalating presence of power struggles, Kesey reminds his audience of the importance of inner strength and always making an attempt, even when a goal appears impossible and makes his work one to remember."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When I first finished reading this book I was left with a deep sense of gratitude that I had stumbled upon this novel and picked it up. I was startled by how good it ended up being, I had thought it would be just any book: good but ordinary. Reading it was like reading a combination of Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger and 1984 by George Orwell: two of my favourite books.The novel is the following of Chief Bromden in a psychiatric ward. Like Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye he only listens, he doesn't exist to others and hardly exists to himself. But he lives in the world of Big Brother, also known as Big Nurse. Put in the light of realistic situations, the same distopian images and themes of 1984 emerge clearly and are vividly frightening.Unlike 1984 a muddy glimpse of hope is given through the canniving and crafty McMurphy. McMurphy is a gambler, a fighter and a ladies man. We are confused to his motives, not sure if they're selfish or selfless, not sure if he's sane or insane. Big Nurse has some of the same questions brought up about her character, is she just a deluded helper or really an evil conspirator. The book walks the line of reality and unreality through the mind of what seems to be a schizophrenic. McMurphy and the Big Nurse become locked in a battle of wits, emotion and force; as the battle goes on, the stakes rise rapidly. This war is paralleled by Chief Bromden's inner battle as he looks at his psychological, emotional and spiritual problems.The novel's realism strikes a chord. All the characters are deeper and more complicated than ever; just as you figure you know, them a little more is revealed. It's like maneuvering in a world of ice bergs (to use one of the most over-used metaphors ever). One of the biggest payoffs is that you discover that you yourself are an iceberg.But not only are the characters lying in a gray zone but the plot is ambiguous. What's happening is always multi-layered. The writing as well is diverse and fresh, at once comedic and then sad. The voice the writer uses is a breath of air for all of us.This was only my original response, my awe at the story's power was expanded upon seeing the movie. A lot of the movie was not at all how I expected it and points I found important were left out. At first I was disappointed but as I watched I began to see what it had offered to these people. I realized how the book continued, after days of reading the last sentence, to show me new perspectives.The movie also helped me just appreciate the book more in general. What the film did well just enriched those parts of the book and what the film missed just expanded my love for those parts.In total the book is one of the richest reading experiences I've had lately and also helped open my eyes to a new part of the world. It is an incredibly worthwhile read and I would say it has something to offer to everybody at every stage of his or her life. If you have not read this book, read it. If you have read this book, read it again. If you're presently in the process of reading it, finish it, wait awhile then read it again."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am dissappointed with the myopic reviews here. This is one of the most clever and meaningful books of its time. If you know anything at all about the mistreatment of mental patients during the sixties, you will understand Kesey's point. He creates a social challenge for all of us to overcome our problems (whatever they might be) and move forward. He tells a story through the eyes of a psychotic schizophrenic and we have to decipher what's real and what's not. McMurphy is clearly a hero who gives up his life for the weak. Thankfully there are people like him who exist. Read it again and open your mind a little. You'll learn something."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"\\"They're out there.\\" The opening line of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey depicts the mindset of the characters: paranoia and confusion. The story is told through the eyes of a mental hospital patient, usually called Chief. Although Chief tells of the happenings in the hospital, he is not the protagonist. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest focuses on a new patient named McMurphy and the effects he leaves on the other patients.The story told from the viewpoint of a patient is very effective because this allows the reader to experience an unbiased depiction of the hospital. Although Chief's seemingly crazed thoughts are sprinkled among true events, Chief offers a childlike view of the hospital. Therefore, the reader can form an opinion of McMurphy without the bias of a narrator. I enjoyed the way Chief describes the hospital before McMurphy; the infirmary appears mellow and mundane. McMurphy's first contribution to the patients is as simple as laughter. Chief describes his laugh as \\"free and loud and it comes out of his wide grinning mouth and spreads in rings bigger and bigger till it's lapping against the walls all over the ward.\\" Even the imagery of the novel becomes more colorful and lively. From this sudden change in tone, the reader can tell the importance of the new patient, McMurphy.McMurphy is also essential of the development of the theme: the harmful effects of an abuse of power on the rehabilitation of patients. McMurphy is the first patient to point out Nurse Ratched's faults; namely, her ill use of authority which actually depletes the sanity of the patients. Kesey's use of such a vile, unlikable antagonist is effective because it helps the reader sympathize with the patients.Also causing sympathy for the patients is their mistreatment. Kesey is effective in describing the unnecessary shock treatments for somewhat sane patients who, because of the treatments, become insane. Kesey's obvious distaste for the manner in which mental hospitals were run is obvious. Much like Chief's description of government authorities as having \\"seams where they're put together,\\" Kesey also believes that those who perform the \\"dirty work\\" for the government are merely machinery. Thus, the author invokes the reader's sympathy for the patients, particularly for Chief, with each word.In addition, Kesey's use of motif makes the novel more enjoyable. For example, McMurphy is constantly paralleled along Jesus. Because of McMurphy's many sacrifices he makes for his new friends and the way he takes the patients to fish on open sea, much like Jesus did with his apostles, McMurphy becomes a Christ-like figure. This comparison causes the reader to subconsciously be drawn toward McMurphy as a type of savior for the patients.Ken Kesey's use of theme, point of view, and motif make One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest an enjoyable read. Many would enjoy this novel because of its theme and its universal appeal: all people are scared to be unjustly punished or mistreated, like the patients of the novel often feel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This was a coming of age book for me in my teens, and no one who cares about mental illness and the ways in which society suppresses free expression and individualism should miss the experience of reading this amazing tale. Be sure to catch the movie starring Jack Nicholson as well."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book in which it describes the battle between The big Nurse and McUrphy. this beautiful story unfolds on the grounds of an assylum where the Big Nurse rules supreme. As you go along in this story a new titan in this epic battle steps forward, McMurphy. And in the last 100 pages this book shows how a insane mind can muster the brain power of multiple brainiacs. I thouroughly enjoyed this book because of it's writing, tone, and enjoyment factor. The first 60 or 70 pages move slow but after that it is smooth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Although a fair novel on its own terms, OFOTCN does a disservice to those who actually endure severe psychiatric illness. &quot;Freeing&quot; many patients would only exacerbate their problems; Kesey's ideas are commendable, his expression of them lacks sympathy."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Dear &quot;Amazon&quot; Folks:Here is a book review by Claire Min-Venditti, age 6, dictated to herdad after he read the book to her over a period of 3 weeks:The book was called &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot; It had a guy init named McMurphy, and he was a pretty good trickster and gambler. Hetells lies a lot to people, but the book did not have a happy ending.There were a lot of people in it, but it was a good story. I like it. Itwas written by Ken Kesey, and it's about a mental hospital and a nursethat runs it, and she's mean to the patients.And McMurphy just came in because he's a new patient to come to thehospital. He was trying to get out of the hospital, because he didn'twant to get treated that way anymore, so at recess time he climbed overthe fence because there was this guy, and they called him &quot;Chief,&quot; andhe was big and strong and tall, and he was pretending that he was deafand dumb. So McMurphy got on his shoulders and climbed up the fencebecause he was very tall.And there was a bus there, which he snuck into and drew the otherpatients away and drove them away in the bus. And it picked up one ofhis girlfriends, and he went fishing without permission.When he got to the fishing place, he told the captain that he was goingto go fishing. And he paid to go fishing, and the captain said, &quot;If youwant to go fishing, you have to tell me if anyone will let you gofishing.&quot; So he told the captain to call an old abandoned hotel inCanada, but when the captain was about to tell him that he was alreadyon his way on the boat, fishing. So when he came back, the police werethere, but he didn't get arrested for taking the boat, but he stillpaid.That night, his two girlfriends came over and bought some wine and theyhad a wonderful party and messed up all the things and played tag downthe hall in wheelchairs and sprinkled cough medicine all over people'sheads. And they had a lot of fun, and they told the girls they couldstay there overnight, and the nurse didn't like that.The next morning, the nurse came and saw all that mess, and she was verymad. And she saw a patient named Billy sleeping with one of the girls,because he fell in love with her. And she said that she was going totell his mother, and he didn't want that to happen, so he went into aroom by himself and killed himself with a broken glass.And then one of the younger nurses saw him and came screaming out ofthat room and told the bigger nurse when it happened. And so everyonewas trying to look and see inside of the room, but the big nurse shovedthem out. But later, after that, when they were sleeping, they cut outpart of McMurphy's brain so he was turned into a vegetable, and hecouldn't talk and he couldn't walk.And the Chief, the big strong guy, came over to his bed with his pillowand smothered him. He was so strong and big that he picked up thecontrol panel in the tub room and threw it out the window, and it brokethe glass, and he was free because he didn't like that place at allbecause the big nurse treated him and all the other people so bad.I think only a little bit of people would like this book, because itdoesn't have a happy ending, and the big nurse doesn't treat anybodygood in the book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"*spoilers below*I certainly did not like Big Nurse (BN) or her goons or what they did. However, I don't think that justifies 2 things our red haired hero did. In the end he could have escaped, instead he exposes BNs breast and strangles her. It turns the whole book into some kind of sexual struggle with the answer being given that men to be men need free sex, whores, and to physically dominate women. In addition, Chief Broom resorts to euthanasia before he gains his freedom under some flawed concept that quality of life determines whether it is worth living.The 30 something lad who egged on by some sense of nobility and a great quantity of locker room bravado indulges in a night of revelry feels real guilt when BN threatens to expose his actions to his mother. If he had really thought it was OK, he would have been able to stand up to her instead of committing suicide. He is not simply weak.Our hero is a tragic anti-hero. Tragic because he dies. Anti because instead of good morals he gambles, smokes, sleeps around, cusses, and fights when he doesn't have to. The message seems Nietzschean. The only real people are those who make their own rules, supermen. The individual vs all authority. Unfortunately authority is made up of people seeking their own also. No one is worth emulating.It is well written and presents the story from the point of view of an inmate. It also deals with deep themes. But the answers are flawed and lacking."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a very original novel that takes place in a mental hospital. McMurphy is clearly the big hero that cracks you up. He brings life to the ward and gives hope to the patients. The downside to this novel is it is VERY slow moving at the beginning though it does pick up as it goes. It's comical in parts but sometimes there doesn't seem to be much of a plot. Also,on this specific copy, with the house on the cover, the font is sooooo small! It's like 7 pt. or something. It makes the book seem slower. It is a very different and cuckoo read, and if you like action-packed books it's not for you. On the contrary, many people enjoy this book, you really get to know the characters."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This story is made up of skirmishes between McMurphy and Big Nurse. With a series of practical jokes he changes the life of his inmates. He make the patients feel smarter then the staff thought they were. However McMurphy would pay for his pranks with a lobotomy. I don't think that it was that good of a book, definatley not a modern masterpiece."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was good. This book was the only book that I read that I didn't think it was boring. I think that the best part of the book was when McMurphy made the Big Nurse flip out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I should review this book twice, one time for each of its two main themes.I salute the book that gives us the freewheeling tale of an individual who leads a revolt against stifling social oppression. In a closed world where the authorities demand obedience and punish anyone who doesn't toe the line, one wild n' crazy guy stands up to buck the system. In doing so, he brings hope and courage to his fellow downtrodden sufferers. Hooray for our hero!I revile the book that gives us, as man's greatest enemy, the archetypal Castrating Bitch. You'd think that the head psychiatrist would make a more realistic symbol of oppressive, all-powerful authority. (Even today, nurses have little power to act independently, and in the era of this novel they were pretty much expected to say \\"Yes, Doctor\\" and fetch the coffee.) But author Ken Kesey was willing to ignore this bit of obvious. I guess he really, really wanted to write a woman in the role of man's oppressor.Of course, not every woman is a Nurse Ratchet. There are good women, too - women who are good for men. Billy found one, after all. The cure to all his ills came in the form of a silent, obedient female who spread her legs at his command. How sweeeet. Nothing feels as good as a girl who knows her place and does what she's told.So, guys, let's review today's lesson. Powerful women are out to cut off your equipment. Submissive women make a man feel like a MAN! Ahhh. You're feeling better already, aren't you?"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"book was in very bad shape cant read it, will fall apart in handling. the story is good I learned it by watching the movie of the same title"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I know you're not supposed to say stuff like this, but the movie was way better than the book. In fact, so good is the movie that the book has little to add. And that's saying something, because the book itself is considered a classic.The only thing that was slightly different was the unexpected choice to have the taciturn Chief narrate the entire thing.But that didn't add much. I read this thing cover to cover and didn't get anything out of it that I hadn't already got out of the movie.Just wanted the world to know."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I ordered this book expecting it to be the Great Penguins Edition, much to my surprise of it being an older edition. I ended having to buy a second book from another seller. Ended up spending more than i saved. So dissapointed."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey was, is, and will always be a second string writer. He quite overwhelmingly lost any claim to authenticity or originality with the publication of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" It reads like the jottings and musings of an orderly with an eighth-grade education. Nurse Ratched's paper thin representation of the \\"Man\\" is so entirely hackneyed as to make the reader wish he or she were born absent the gift of sight and not have to read another single book.This is a non-redemptive novel, and deservingly so, given the author's/protagonist's trip through the hollow's of the mind where superficiality reigns supreme.Chris Roberts"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I think the book was alright i mean i dont think i would of ever picked the book out my slef.

I can also a very close relationship these days between the symbolism in this book and how it can be applied to politics. The nurse can be viewed as the big business, Tobacco or the NRA.

Big mistake."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Initially, the book was very hard to understand. That was probably one of the main reasons why I was never interested in the book. McMurphy is by far one of the best characters in the book. He reminds me of myself at home. At home I try to take over the TV, gamble, and rebel against everything my parents say. When I say McMurphy rebels, he's all against nurse Ratchad. He does everything in his power not to do what he's supposed to do just like walking around in his underwear.If this book was alot more clear in the beginning it would be a very noble book and I think a lot more people could enjoy it."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I am currently reading this book for my H English 10 class, and i find it to be extremely dull. Yes, I understand, it takes everyone a step deeper into the lives of the mentally challenged people of our time. However, it is a difficult book to follow. There is a constant changing of characters, which lead me into great confusion of the importance each one displayed within the text. I was very disappointed when I began reading this book. I always heard great things about it, but i guess, it's just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Two stars for the occasional vividness of Keysey's writing--and no more for the tiresome use to which it's been put. Stanley Kauffmann, mentioning this book in his review of the film version, referred to it was one of those books he \\"needn't read--simply outlive.\\" And perhaps the time will come that this story of a psychopath looking for a cushy ride in a mental hospital and locking horns with the tough nurse in charge is seen as the whinings of a perpetual adolescent and not some epic struggle between freedom and conformity. All Randall MacMurphy wants to be free to do is steal and cheat and toy with women sexually. Subtract the hero-worshipping tone, and we have a denizen of a true-crime magazine story, the sort of lowlife the cops pick up after a string of violent rape-murders or robberies. In the end, you don't have to like Nurse Ratched to wonder if she might have done the world a favor . . ."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book. I had to force myself to finish it and at the same time avoid ripping out my hair due to boredom. The only character I liked was McMurphy. It was interesting to see the way he was able to impact each character in the book with his antics and ideas. Admittedly at some parts of the book I was uncomfortable reading about what went on in the asylum, and I think this was kind of the point, so the book was successful there. To me, the most important aspect of the book was, as Medgar Evers once said, \\"You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea.\\" One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest demonstrates the power an idea can have over people, and how even if you cannot see the idea in action, once it has been introduced it will survive."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I could not concentrate whenever I started to read this book. It is hard to differenciate between what is really happenening and Chief Bromden's hallucinations. The book has yet to capture my interest. There are too many different characters to keep track of.

Ken Kesey is a deep writer. He goes really deep into the thoughts of the characters. At the beginning I was having a hard time understanding what was going on, but as the story progressed I started to understand. At the beginning of the story I thought that all of the guys were very crazy. As the story went on and the author gave more detailed facts about some of the characters, I started to believe that they weren't really as crazy as I thought that they were. As I started thinking deeper, I thought maybe it wasn't me that was changing my thoughts about them, maybe it was them really changing. I now believe that McMurphey really did change the others, all for the better. When he first arrived and started taking their money and making trouble, I thought that he was just going to make the other patients crazier, but I was very wrong. He got the Chief to start talking, and he got most of the other patients to smile and even stick up for themselves. Overall, the story was excellent. Even though I thought that it started out slow, it ended with a bizarre twist. Just like Steinbeck's &quot; Of Mice and Men&quot;, a friend killed his friend for what he thought would be the best for both of them. We all thought that McMurphey was going to escape, but it ended up that he was killed the night of his great escape and Chief Bromden went ahead and left in his place. The author Ken Kesey obviously put a lot of time and a great deal of thought into this book. It was great and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good, dramatic, book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was pretty good. It was not the best book I have ever read, but it is by far not the worst. I got confused while reading it and found myself rereading almost all of the book.

I would not recomond this book to anyone who does not have a basic high school reading level, and even then by careful and be sure to double check whet you read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A compelling story of a man's search for himself. The book entails many problems that as a lazy world we shove aside saying we'll deal with them later.

I loved every element of the book, if anything was left out the book would be uncomplete. The ending, although tragic, was satisfying and appropriate. In my opinion McMurphy won, he left his impact on the &quot;nest&quot; that can never be undone. The book was written in the perfect perspective, Big Cheif's, without his view of things the book could never be as abstract as it was. Overall an excellent book"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I really liked the way that this book was written, although the whole &quot;plot&quot; of the story made me realize that our world is really corrupted. Our society is against anything different. I liked seeing the world through Big Chief's eyes and knowing what he thought of his own society in which he lives. For me, the whole book was about Big Chief's building himself up enough to make a breakthrough, and then finding the courage to break out of the combine and begin his life once again.

This book goes into great detail about what life was like in the 60's, what life was like in an asylum, and what life was like with McMurphy. This book does not have one underdeveloped character, or one loose end. This book has a lot of symbolism such as: Christ, the fish, the poem \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", and many more. There are struggles brought up between the men; the fight with themselves, Nurse Ratched, the machinery, and the outside world. The detail and precision in this book would make the reader believe that he in face resided at a Insane Asylum and had electro-shock therapy. It makes you believe that he was a rebel like McMurphy, but on the other hand there is the Chief. Kesey has great skills at writing, and using characters to really make this book a page-turner. But, the best part of Kesey's is that it takes the reader to new levels of fear and hope for McMurphy and the gang."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a well-written book about a man named McMurphy. McMurphy is placed in an aslyum because the courts declared him a physcopath. McMurphy isn't insane. He's just looking for a free ride so that he doesn't have to go back to work on the pea farm he was at before he was arrested.Over all, I would recommend One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to anyone who is looking for a book that touches the mind and tears at the heart. Kesey demonstrates great knowledge of how the human mind works and to what extent a man will go to keep his sanity in an insane world.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest is a definate read. It continues to draw readers into its realm of sanity within insanity. Of human perseverence under a dictator's rule. Of man's indomitable will to survive."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The Viking Critical Library edition of Ken Kesey's &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is worth every cent of its price, not that it's a high one anyway. The page count is double that of the novel, and what you get in this excellent edition, is a preface, a short biography, and a plethora of literary criticism, a very exhaustive collection, ranging from forgettable, strained and biased work to brilliant criticism. It's not just a novel, it's a compendium you get for a price of one. I strongly recommend this particular edition of the novel, and would encourage you to keep an eye for other volumes published by the Viking Critical Library.Kesey was not appreciated after his first novel, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;. His later novels and stories received abysmal reviews at the time of publication, his life was widely perceived as wasted. In fact, with &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid&quot; Tom Wolfe summarized Kesey as a one-note, one-novel author. Since when quantity is equivalent with quality? The same statement can be made of Joseph Heller and Harper Lee. The latter didn't even try to write more than one novel he published! I claim that that particular novel of Ken Kesey earned him the place in the timeless literary pantheon, that it immortalized the author, and whether or not his fiction of the latter day is redeemable, is a secondary issue, almost irrelevant, I'd say.&quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is indeed a universal novel. Many circles, political movements, ranging anywhere from anarchist and socialist to conservative and libertarian - tried to assimilate Kesey into their ideology, into their vision, whatever that was. A good piece of literature is universal, timeless, with redeeming features that are always true (or untrue, for that matter), whenever they are read, and if they contribute to the reader's development regardless of their generation. &quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; was one such book - it dealt with universal truths, with the basic premise of life - that we should be free, no matter what, that if once depraved of dignity, we can't regain it back, and then it's not worth continuing afterwards, that it's a once-only gift from heavens. We can also self-depreciate, too - as an aside note.A very strong moral message the novel conveys is the opposition of the individual and the society. In a way, Kesey's book is similar to John Kennedy Toole's &quot;The Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, where a similar point is raised. &quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is an apotheosis of personal freedom, and a warning against the tendencies evident in modern societies. A free individual is disengaged from the society, although coexisting with it on a daily basis. Exactly this point provides a wide arena for interpretation, and if you enjoy analysis of this type, you will definitely appreciate Penguin's critical edition - for there's much material that will satisfy your curiosity, if need be.Abstracting from that usual tendency to stress the individual-system opposition presented in the novel, I think that one of the main threads of interest, for me at least, is the keen observation Kesey makes about the human nature. If given the chance, the animal creeps out from us, and goes wild. No matter how civilized we are, it's always there, lurking. Also, we have oceans of cruelty in us &#65533; maybe not all of us - but a vast majority definitely do. Where we differ - is the degree. Life is not black and white, but grey, all shades of grey. If given the sufficient opportunity, we shall turn against our brethren. I believe in this, and Kesey seems to have at least hinted at that. I won't make a prolonged philosophical digression, although that's the proper playground here, but I do think that we are essentially bad, evil, primitive, with a good side to us, which is like a self-conscious and often automatic chain that holds us in place. Religions superimposed the idea of temptation over that basic premise, and where religions differ is the actual interpretation of symbols. What I find of more value as a lukewarm believer, is the caveman sub-layer of our human nature. Evil and good are not balanced. The former is kept like a genie in a bottle, the more we are civillized, the more so. it is not equilibrium. And from time to time, the evil creeps out, or, rather, bursts out, and then there's trouble. Some people feel right at home with their real nature, and thus are more adept at obtaining the equilibrium. Often devoid of empathy, they execute their wishes if given the chance, and they do so more efficiently than the rest of us - precisely because they are more balanced. I keep coming back to Kesey's Nurse Ratched. If I were to characterize her in one word only, use only one adjective, I'd choose &quot;unemphatic&quot;, if there's such a word.&quot;One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a novel that gives food for thought. It will last you for days, months, or even a lifetime, along with a few other giant works of the XX century. Irrespective of his career of the later day, Kesey is immortal precisely because he conceived that universal novel which gives rise to so many interpretations, is such a fertile work of one man's imagination. And that in addition to the actual excellent storyline! Kesey was a giant for me. May he be blessed with peace forever."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Randall McMurphy arrives at a mental institution after serving a stretch on a State Farm. At the State Farm he faked insanity to get out of the work. Little did he know what awaited him at the institution.Almost from the first minute of his arrival he squares off against the Nurse in an epic battle between good and evil. The asylum represents a very acurate microcosom of the outside world, complete with the &quot;system&quot; pushing them to be who they aren't.Written by acknowledged acid freak Ken Kessey, this book is sure to please all of you anti-establishment hippies out there. But its written so well, it may even entertain a repulbican as well."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"In my opinion, this book is the great American novel. I'll forgo the usual blather about what it all means and why it's so great, but I should point out that it really is just as important and profound now as it was in the early sixties."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"As is often the case, the book is better than the movie. However, that is saying a lot in this instance as the movie was also quite good.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a captivating novel about a sane man's time in a psychiatric ward. There are many interesting characters and plot points that keep the novel continuously moving. I would definitely reccommend this book."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This is a truly great book and one that you have to be read, whether or not you have seen the (also brilliant) movie. Kesey tells a gripping story in a wonderfully sympathetic, humorous manner. And like so many great works of fiction it is written in a fairly simple manner, without using too many stylistic devices. If you are not gripped by the story of the patients and their suffering under the sadistic nurse, you are probably just not meant to be a reader!The book does have one big advantage over the movie, though. It has the character of the giant Indian, the Chief, as a narrator, and he is much more important to the book than to the movie. His personal battle against debilitating fear would have been enough of a plot to sustain a novel."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"If you haven't read this book, you're missing something...The setting is a mental asylum with its staff and the inmates. Through the book, we enter and share the life there - the humor under the tyranny of the head nurse and the &quot;system&quot;... it is touching and disturbing at the same time because you might end up finding the inmates more 'sane' than the people whose care they're under. I watched the movie based on the book. The movie is very good too but the book is better by far."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"There is no story quite like Ken Kesey's One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest. It is an incredible tale of a man who single-handedly brings life back to the inmates of an Oregon mental hospital. It is a tale of hope, desire, and of living life to the fullest. Hope is represented by the freewheeling Randle McMurphy who makes it his mission to save his fellow inmates from the terrible rule of Nurse Ratched. The battle of wits between the nurse and McMurphy becomes the essence of this story. It symbolizes something much bigger than the petty poer struggle it appears to be; this is the power-hungry versus the oppressed. Author Ken Kesey has managed to maintain a humorous tone in the gloomiest of settings with a cast of some of the most animated characters I have ever come across. From the POV of a hospital inmate, the story puts the reader right inside the walls of this loony psych ward. Read it and find your way out."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"A reader from San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 11/2/00A very astonishing and mouth opening fiction literature.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a very exciting fictional work which gives the reader a taste of what it was really like for patients in mental institutions back in the 1960's. Such experiments as electric shock and actual puntures in the head made to analyze the patients reaction, really shocked me to hear. The story is told by a Native-American mental patient, Chief Bromden. His experience, however, is very astonishing to hear, and intriguing to acknowledge that mental experiments such as those were actually thought to improve their mental health instead of making it any worse. Overall the book is phenomenal and I stongly give it a 5."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"The hero made a mistake...he wanted out of the sun, out of the hard days spent working county land for no personal gain. He fakes insanity...too well. Winding up in the asylum, he finds that though he's only faking, he's still crazier than many of his fellows. But he enjoys it, and pulls them together. One of the top 100 books I have read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It is questionable whether there is a point in reading or writing another word after reading this incredible masterpiece. There has probably been no book in the history of the world like it and it would be an incredible shame not to read this book. If you have any intrest in Orwellian, dark types of books then this is your meat. I repeat that this is a masterpiece of the very first quality, one of the greatest books, and probably the greatest ever written."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"When one thinks of summer reading, many start picking up the latest magazine off a shelf. I, on the other hand, decided to pick out a book to enjoy. I am now very thankful for the book I chose. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a riveting tale that sets it apart from other books of it's time. The narrator's point of view gives this book much more defining charactersitics than many other pieces of writing. I urge anyone who hasn't read this book to give it a try and be captivated by it's astounding writing."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's novel is without question one of the great works of American literature. While it offers much food for thought on the nature of mental health therapy and the authoritarianism which imbues many mental health institutions, it is far, far more than that! The hospital where McMurphy raises havoc is a metaphor for our own society. The dreams of the &quot;Chief&quot; are like windows to the outside world, revealing that it is all too similar to the mental hospital which confines the characters. The real joy of reading this novel is not so much in finding criticism with the &quot;nest' of mental health institutions; but instead seeing how all of us are trapped in a restrictive and maddening &quot;nest&quot; of our own making. Truly a novel to be read over and over, at various stages in one's life!"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Okay, so it usually takes me about 100 pages to actually get into a book. But, because of the pure genius and imagination of Kesey, I was sucked into the novel during the first paragraph. I stayed up that night from 9 o'clock to somewhere around 5 that next morning, not just reading, but relating to every connotation and metaphor that Ken laid in. I have never been more consumed by a single book in my life. Nor have I ever read a single book more than once. If you are looking for a book about individualism vs. society, don't pass this gem by."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Ken Kesey did a fantastic job with this novel. The constant struggle between the patients and Big Nurse makes for a great plot in such a confined area as a mental institute. McMurphy is a charismatic Irishman who is sent there for rowdy behavior, but during his stay he makes a giant impact on the patients as well as the facility."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"It scares you to think of the 'treatment' deemed 'auxillary' not even 40 years ago. It scared me just to read about the effects, before I actually became empathic and connected to the marvelous characters... each one unique, lively and different. The writing style of this book is incredible- it paints a picture so vivid you can almost step into it, can almost smell the antiseptic of this damnable institution and feel the hated burn of a hypodermic. A book I would recommend everyone (who is able) should read."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey wrote a deep involving story about life in a mental institution in the 60's. These were days when lobotomies and electro shock treatments were free game. The character of Randall McMurphy brings a new atmosphere to the ward when he arrives and helps the other patients live life to the fullest again. The final pages make for a heartfelt ending that will make you say a pray for all the mental patients who have had to endure years of mistreatment in institutions to &quot;cure&quot; them."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's plot is extremely creative and original. The book is very elaborate and filled with many deeper meanings (Thanks, Cliffs Notes!). But despite its intricacy, it is exciting, especially near the end. The book should be in every personal library. The plot is so incredible, that even the movie was rated in the top 100 in my local paper last week (no. 22)! END"},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Very, very few people in literature, science, religion, or government have even attempted to define &quot;They.&quot; For this reason alone, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"What defines sanity? In Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest this very question is posed. We are immediately introduced to Chief Bromden, a patient at the hospital. He describes the Staff, the Chronics and the Acutes. The Staff is led by Nurse Ratched, a wretched woman with rules for everything, accompanied by all the floors orderlies. The Chronics are all the patients on the floor that remain merely vegetables due to lobotomies and electro-shock therapy. The Acutes are all the patients that are still functional; they play a crucial role in Kesey's novel. Chief Bromden is an acute but thought to be a mute, that is until Randall Patrick McMurphy arrives. McMurphy has been released from a work farm to have his sanity evaluated. McMurphy is loud, outspoken, and vulgar a vast difference from the other patients. McMurphy has brought upon himself the task of destroying Nurse Ratched. McMurphy, who is known for big ballin' and bar brawling' disposition, thinks this to be an easy task and a way to keep himself entertained. What McMurphy discovers are limits and the harsh reality he faces. Kesey uses both McMurphy and Chief to illustrate societies destruction of natural impulses.Kesey worked as an orderly in a Virginia State Mental Hospital while in college. He was also acting as a lab rat for the government at the hospital aiding in the testing of hallucinogens such as LSD. With unlimited supplies of such drugs he spent a lot of his time working in the hospital under the influence. While working one day he hallucinated an Indian sweeping the floors of the hospital and thus we have Chief Bromden. Considering how much time Kesey spent around patients and under the influence as some of the same drugs as them he seemed to have a lot in common with them making it easier to write from that perspective. Some of his most insane moments he admits to have written while greatly influenced by these psychedelic drugs. Kesey's experience in the field allowed his characters to be believable. The question of which of the patients were sane and which were truly gone was omnipresent.McMurphy is a liberating character for the other patients. He teaches them that they have to learn that they alone can control who they are. Society has put a label on them and broken them down to the point they too believe they are crazy and incurable. McMurphy leads them on an outing one day in which they escape on a boat to go fishing with beer and a girl. This newfound freedom for them is one of the best medicines they could have gotten. They realize that they would like to be back in the world and be able to do the normal sorts of things they would like to do.I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it is a great tool to learn not to judge people. It shows such a profound form of personal growth and loss that I wish I could at some point be able to experience something equally eye opening. I give this book five stars and consider it a classic."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I read a considerable amount of reviews about this book before deciding to get my hands on it, the whole psychiatric story thing did not really sound like a tale I would enjoy. But surprise - and a pleasant one - this book captures the mundane world view on the mentally handicapped in a beautiful and very thought provoking way. I had never given it much thought that society label's psychiatric patients and society decides when, how and what to cure.The happy gambler and convicted conman, R.P. McMurphy, tricks himself into a psychiatric hospital, because he has found out that these places offers a much more pleasant stay than a jail work camp. He is meet by worn down shells of men, lacking happiness, embarrassed by there sexual desires and without any drive. He quickly discovers that the head nurse and here staff is as much responsible for these weak men's condition as are there psychiatric disease. The rest of the story is a tour de force of McMurphy's one man battle for freeing these men. A battle which he ultimately succeeds in but end up paying the price himself.A grotesque, provoking and ultimately tragic story filled with gripping characters and written in a highly witty language. In short a masterpiece and one I will shurely read again."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Another book that so many people read in high school that I somehow never had to read; I was hesitant, yet excited to read it all at the same time. I am glad I did.The story is told by Chief, the Big Indian. Through his eyes we see the ins and outs of life in the mental ward. The author uses the Chief's own inadequacy to set the tone for the other patients in the hospital; each goes through life with the pace of a crawl. The processes and procedures are in place to help them acclimate themselves to life outside the ward in hopes that some day they may rejoin society. Or that is what the staff tells them anyway.We are introduced to a few figures with relative authority over the goings-on within the hospital walls, though their power is usurped by one woman. The head nurse. Over years she has manipulated the people around her, scaring off doctors and ward staff that she did not feel she would be able to control. As we join the story, her pieces are in place. She has a doctor overseeing the ward that is too timid to deny her control and three hospital attendants that are as immoral as she.She has her way with the patients' minds. In group therapy sessions she asks the men to point out the shortcomings of others thus reinforcing their insecurities. These same insecurities are the reasons that for many of the men are in the mental hospital in the first place.She keeps them weak and afraid, exerting her control until one new patient comes along and begins to question authority. R.P. McMurphy has bucked the system in every environment he has entered. As a result he had seen every form of punishment except one: the mental hospital. He was, maybe for lack of a better excuse, labeled a psychopath and duly committed. Now he has a new set of rules to break.McMurphy may be euphemized as out-going, though others may prefer to call him obnoxious, pushy and loud. He is, in all respects, both the complete opposite of every other patient on the ward and the exact thing the nurse has worked so hard to avoid. With relative ease she has broken the spirits of every man before McMurphy and they both get creative as their rivalry grows.She has control over the men's daily routine and has guided their thoughts as well for so long. McMurphy obtains control over their sense of freedom, but will that be enough?The mental hospital was a great microcosm for society at large. The patients are everyday people. The nurse, more abstractly, is societal expectations and normal, \\"acceptable\\" behavior. The Chief could be you or me. He, more than the other patients, has acted in a way that is in line with what others have assumed about him and not how he wants to act. He conforms to what people tell him he is. McMurphy represents the small portion of the population that thinks outside the box. He is the free thinker who teaches us that it is ok, and should even be encouraged, for us to question authority.Too often we do things because that is...just what you are supposed to do. We get out of bed, get dressed, go to work, go home, have dinner, kiss our spouse and go do bed. We are \\"grown ups\\" now and that is what grown ups DO. But why? Why not shake things up? We have the ability to carry ourselves with the integrity of adults though we live freely from others' expectations of us.McMurphy champions the mentality (to keep with the setting of the book) that we need to maintain some sense of autonomy. You can control where I live and you can control what I do during the day, but I will not let you control how I think and feel. And most importantly the lesson he focuses on is that no matter how tough the going gets, never forget out to laugh. This is an incredibly powerful tool we can use to avoid being swept under the control of societal pressure and expectation. With our laughter we show others that we are still in control, but you have to mean it.This may be completely off base with what Kesey had hoped to portray in his book, and it may mean something else entirely to you. But that is, after all, the beauty of it. I am not head nurse. I am not here to tell you how to think and feel about this book. But I do recommend you read it and find out for yourself. As I got into the book it was good, but not great. By the end I was pleasantly surprised by how much I really enjoyed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story about those who are at the lowest level of society, mental patients. Kesey vividly describes the suffering of these patients and their struggles to deal with themselves, the Nurse and society. A particularly poignant scene is the monologue of Pete Bancini, a worn out man who was never accepted into society. Bancini says:\\"I can't help it. I was born a miscarriage. I had so many insults I died. I was born dead. I can't help it. I'm tired. I'm give out trying. You got chances. I had so many insults I was born dead. You got it easy. I was born dead an' life was hard. I'm tired. I'm tired out talking and standing up. I been dead fifty-five years. \\"Kesey has done what few authors (perhaps Salinger as one of them) have, truly described those who seem to struggle to find their identities in a society that ennervates them. A phenemonal book, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest opens one's eyes to the societal inequalities of those deemed unfit to lead normal lives. Instititutional oppression is the overlying theme of this novel.Despite this, many choose to ban the novel because of its misogyenistic and rascist elements. The tool for the evil society (the Combine) is a woman, her agents are the \\"black boys.\\" Yet I think that these elements should not influence one's decision to read this book. If at all possible, by ignoring these elements of the novel, one is left with a masterpiece.I recommend this book to everyone, although mature themes make it more appropriate for an audience that is sixteen and older."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I'd could write for days about all the reasons that this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, about how it flips your perception of others, makes you re-evaluate your life, abolishes all previous assumptions about \\"insanity\\". All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. It will change your life, and it's incredibly entertaining... as a bonus."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"I would go on and on and on about this one if I didn't have so much work to do, but listen, it wouldn't benefit me or you, you should just read this book.I love the movie, my favorite movie ever, I saw the movie first, I'm a huge fan of Jack Nicholson in the role of Randall McMurphy....The book is better.The book is different.Read the book.P.S. the book actually takes place in 1953, not the sixties, or seventies like everyone is saying. A lot of things were different in '53 than they were in the late sixties."},{"Title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest proved itself as one of the most originally written and stylistically executed novels I have ever experienced. Everything perfectly fitted together to make an interesting tale of the occurrences between the walls of a mental institution. The story is told from the point of view of from of an Indian, nicknamed Chief, who has the entire ward convinced he is deaf. By making this situation, the author Ken Kesey used it to narrate the actions of the ward entirely through Chief's observation, which allows him to report and analyze all the characters in the novel. The entire ward is turned into disarray when a new patient, Randle McMurphy, arrived and challenged all rules and authoritative figures, something no one had dared to even think about attempting. Throughout many arguments and actions of rebellion, his innovative style began to rub off on the other patients and all learn how to break out of their monotonous actions. They indirectly learned how to overcome most of their illnesses. Most of Chief's observations were noted underlying themes of the whole book, mostly reflecting views of the real symptoms and affects of mental illnesses. Overall, this book was refreshingly original with themes that if followed can create an interesting and thought provoking life."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],J={key:0},F={key:1};function x(s,e,n,c,r,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",F,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",J,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(A,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-ed05c94d"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/38.md","filePath":"people/38.md"}'),q={name:"people/38.md"},E=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
