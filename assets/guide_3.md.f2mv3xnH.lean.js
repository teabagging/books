I read through all the exercises in this book with another player. The upper line is meant to be played by the student, with the lower line played by the teacher or a more advanced player. The book consists of graded units of increasing difficulty.The exercises use actual Medieval and Renaissance music, as well as English country dances and folk music, with a few original pieces written by Mr. Fischer.So often, exercises used in method books are repetitive and boring, making them a chore to work through. The music chosen in this book is quite appealing, with a lot of variety. I think this method book would work well for players of all ages, since the music is fun to play, and is carefully chosen to demonstrate a particular point, such as modes, rhythms, syncopation, combination tones, etc.Mr. Fischer is to be commended for producing a refreshing method book, with an easily readable format and a well-chosen variety of music that demonstrates valuable lessons for the student."},{"Title":"The Recorder From Zero, Vol. 2","review":"I have both books - my daughter is the student.

Of course everyone is unique, and providing that this is a solution to all families that are dealing with autism is not true. However, I believe that is an okay simplistic description of a complex diagnosis."},{"Title":"The Flight of a Dove","review":"When Betsy, then 3 is first enrolled in school, she is autistic and nonverbal. Betsy's mother said that Betsy developed and spoke within normal limits until she was a year old.Betsy's behavior fits the classic profile of Infantile Autism. She \\"self-stims\\" by rocking, squinting and engaging in other singular motor activities; she does not speak nor interact with anybody. School personnel tell the girl's mother that they can make no promises and will do what they can to help Betsy adopt more socially appropriate behaviors and self help skills.Brownie, a male beagle mix and a dove are the ones who catch Betsy's attention. She is first captivated by the dove and by watching this free bird, she begins exploring her surroundings and interacting in small increments. She initially ignored Brownie, but he was determined to get her to play with him. In time, she befriends the lovable hound.The only thing I didn't like in this book was when the author described autism as \\"a cold gray autistic world.\\" Not necessarily. That neurotypical misperception cost this book one star. For a person with autism, the world is not necessarily bleak. Autism is a neurobiological condition that impedes communication and social skills to varying degrees, based upon the individual.By the book's end, Betsy finds her way of soaring. To the author's credit, Betsy is not miraculously cured."},{"Title":"The Flight of a Dove","review":"Consisting of twenty-seven pages in a tall picture book with pastel illustrations, The Flight of a Dove is too complex for children to really comprehend. Autism is not this simplistic and will give families unrealistic expectations.The Flight of a Dove follows a little girl known as Betsy to Green Meadows School where the head teacher is Mrs. Bouvier. There are various snipets on the pages showing Betsy isolated in her own world, usually sitting in a corner. Her mother Jeanne explains how Betsy does not eat solid food, makes hissing and clicking sounds while sitting still for hours.Sometimes the illustrations show Betsy's eyes closed, her hands stiff by her side or clenched fists. Sometimes she is even barefooted. Her condition is mentioned as being extreme. Eventually over time Betsy would eat crackers while at Green Meadows School and play with blocks. Betsy made the same patterns with cards and when the teacher would turn away she would change the patterns.The Flight of a Dove seemed to jump around a bit without any explanation of why Betsy preferred to do things a certain way, and how this is typical of children on the Autism Spectrum. Children with autism play the same way with their toys, lining items up or sorting in a particular sequence. One illustration has the teacher's one-year old daughter babbling beside Betsy as the baby tried to get closer. Finally someone removed the baby, but why was a teacher's baby at the school in the first place? This seemed a bit bizarre to me with no rhyme or reason.The Flight of a Dove introduces the resident animals - a cat, two rabbits and a parrot. The animals were popular with the other children, but clearly Betsy was uncomfortable around these animals. Seasons changed with Betsy now being at the school for one year.Up to this point nowhere in the book does the reader see this knowledge they supposedly have, there is no discussion of Doctors, visits with therapists or really understanding and patience. Instead they are pushing a baby into the girl's space and bringing animals around her when she is visible upset by the changes taking place.Another day Betsy seems to be the only one in a classroom with a teacher and kissing the Dove. Then Betsy started allowing the other animals to close to her and she became involved with the other children in games that meant dancing and holding hands with other children and the teacher.I am really not sure who the targeted audience is for and feel the book takes us back to the dark ages in keeping quiet about autism. The author has no experience with autism and makes it seem very easy to overcome and magical at that.I personaly would not want classmates of either of my children to peruse through this book and think this is what my children are like. Readers with knowledge of autism will know that Betsy depicts traits of autism, yet it is not mentioned within the pages of the book.The illustations showcase the isolation at first in the darker colors and stillness at the school. Yet once the dove enters the classroom the vibrant colors take over. Even the clothing on Betsy seems to be more appropriate as she enjoys the classroom more.This is a book I would not purchase as the parent of two children on the Autism Spectrum. The cover of the book rubs me the wrong way, as well as how the girl says Mommy at the end. This book could really depress parents when they find that this is not the norm with children on the Autism Spectrum and create false hope.Clearly not a book for families who just received a diagnosis of autism. Use caution when sharing with children who might have siblings and/or relatives on the Spectrum and wonder why their family member does not respond magically like Betsy did."},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"This is a comprehensive treatise written with passion, and reminds me of \\"The Whole Earth Catalog\\" of the '60's, Mother Earth News, and various underground comics. Done in the best tradition of the good ole days. If you find info that is not in this book, you can write it on a sticky note and attach it to an inside cover."},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"As other reviewers have noted, The book is rather encyclopedic about the subject of bamboo. It includes sections on history, usage techniques, horticulture and other aspects. The tone of the writing is that of a passionate advocate. It can be a bit sad to reflect that the hopes for a panacea to end poverty and deprivation through implementing bamboo have not been realized. But one aspect of idealism is optimism. And that remains a worthwhile and endearing aspect of this book. As i have recently obtained the book, i can't vouch for the currency of the sources and references. I can say the vast store of practical information in the book will be valuable as i learn more and attempt to utilize bamboo in greater ways."},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"If you threw half the chapters in this book away, you would have a better book...It is very comprehensive on bamboo,I am glad I purchased it but too many paragraphs on &quot;saving the world&quot; (ecology comments)"},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"This is a very good reference book for studying the botony of bamboo and also for building (ideas only) and other uses for bamboo in the past and present in other countries where bamboo is in abundance.

And DO GROW BAMBOO!"},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"When I first read &quot;The Book of Bamboo&quot; many years ago, I thought it was brilliantly researched but simply too eccentric in organization and style to be representative of mainstream thought on the subject. Despite the wealth of information it contains, I hesitated to recommend it to people for fear its intensity would put people off rather than draw them in. However, after several years of growing bamboo in coastal northern California, I recently picked it up again and instantly recognized it for the classic it is. Fewer than 1 percent of 1 percent of all non-fiction books published are ever republished after they go out of print, especially by a prestigious national firm with major editorial capabilities.

Mark Wall"},{"Title":"The Book of Bamboo: A Comprehensive Guide to This Remarkable Plant, Its Uses, and Its History","review":"Written by the one of the few people in the world qualified to produce a monograph on bamboo, it is as comprehensive as it gets. David Farrelly has spent more than a decade planting, harvesting, and building with bamboo in Mexico, Nicaragua, and the United States. If you are only interested in the growing of bamboo as an ornamental, then this book may not be exactly what you expect, but it still serves up more information on bamboo growing, propagation and care, and bamboo species and description then any other currently available books on bamboo. Don't expect grossy pictures either, but line drawings and old black and white photographs somehow seems to fit well in this book. Grossy pictures would have been out of place here. What really makes this book a must read is the other non-botanical, non-horticultural information on bamboo that the book includes - it's history, it's multiple of uses, it's interaction with mankind through the ages.If you are into bamboo beyond it's aesthietics, this is a &quot;must read&quot;.

The Blues in this collection constitute the earliest published blues songs and instrumentals, and will offer many clues into the difficulties both writers and publishers had of settling into the common 12 bar form. Plenty of W.C. Handy as well, who while he did not exactly write the melodies in most of his pieces, he certainly knew how to assemble and promote them. One notable omission is Baby Seal's Blues, which for many years was considered the first publication of blues with 'Blues' in the title, or the mention of Oh You Beautiful Doll, in which the verse is also an early blues. Aside from that, just playing through this collection is an instant education that will leave you well versed in the form - and many of the pieces are available for a listen on my web site (better enhanced with book in hand)."},{"Title":"Beale Street and Other Classic Blues","review":"This is an excellent set of classical Blues sheet music. The tunes by W.C Handy are especially welcome, e.g. The St Louis Blues. The printing is clear, although some of the sheet music is somewhat small, but still very readable. All in all, a very good collection for the price."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"Entangled in the past and driven by conflicted loyalties, the protagonists are introduced via the curiosity of Andrew Jackson Blackwood, a real estate entrepreneur with a shady past. Using Blackwood as a device, this &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; plot unfolds with Linda Stamp (Cathy) and Bruder (Heathcliff) as the star-crossed lovers. Their drama is played out in the early years of the 20th Century, when California falls prey to the avid schemes of developers.Part of Pasadena takes place just a few miles south of where I live, so I chose this book partly for the familiarity of place. Often Ebershoff's descriptive passages are as perfect as the rows of orange trees that once filled the acres of Southern California. But at other times, his extravagant phrases grow tedious, describing myriad flora and fauna native to the state. If I hadn't known the lush hillsides and pure blue skies, now smog-filled and over-built, it is possible to glean a bit of the former beauty of California. As well, the profligate wealth of the era and the careless use of natural resources plundered by entitlement are stark reminders of the disrespect for nature's generosity.In the beginning, the story is enchanting in its praise of simple farm life and the rewards of hard work in a setting of natural splendor. But by the time the novel moves to Pasadena, the dialog is thick with duplicity, complications, misunderstandings and secrets. In the city of Pasadena, affluence exists side by side with poverty, an uneasy coexistence, with the workers who sustain the privileged lifestyle crammed into inadequate housing, the rambling estates surrounded by acres of groves. That said, Ebershoff does a fine job of portraying wealthy Pasadenans as vapid, elitist and full of energy to better the lives of those less fortunate, ad nauseum. That the upper classes of the 1900's consider the immigrant workers less capable is obvious and belabored.The great flaw in Pasadena is the promise of its title. Pasadena, the novel, connotes a more comprehensive attention to the city and its origins, yet the book, but for a few asides, is located on one private estate of producing groves, and limited to this very specific world. All of this is historically accurate, but not really of the scope the title suggests. The story is quite compelling on its own, with the psychological twists and turns of the characters, rendering Mr. Blackwood unnecessary. Some incisive editing of about 100 pages might have made this novel more memorable. But there is still the problem of the lover's complete inability to communicate with each other, and the tiresome denouement of their choices."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"&quot;Pasadena&quot; is a splendid novel which affirms David Ebershoff's talent for writing great fiction. It is a far different novel than his critically acclaimed - and popular - literary debut &quot;The Danish Girl&quot;; one still worth the time of a devout reader of contemporary fiction. Ebershoff's latest novel is a sprawling epic which covers almost the first half of the 20th Century, focusing on the shattered lives of Linda Stamp, her father Dieter, and the two men she falls in love with; the mysterious orphan Bruder and the equally enigmatic Captain Willis Poore. Ebershoff tells a compelling yarn about Pasadena's rapid rise from a frontier haven to wealthy Easterners to a surburban city soon to be engulfed by Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of these four protagonists. And yet, as splendid as Ebershoff's writing is, it did not quite captivate me as much as China Mieville's &quot;The Scar&quot; (Although Mieville's novel is fantasy, it too also tells a compelling saga about dysfunctional characters.). Still I am sufficiently impressed with Ebershoff's latest tale to grant it five stars; it is among the most compelling works of contemporary mainstream fiction I've come across."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"This muddled rip-off of Wuthering Heights would be a must-miss were it not for the audiobook narrator Lorna Raver's superb, nuanced reading. She gives us vivid characterization where the author gives none, and excels at mood and atmosphere. A beautiful voice beautifully employed on an unworthy project."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"The time I spent plodding through this book was not time well spent, so I'm not going to waste much more on this review. Although publicized as a serious read, this book reminds me of a Harlequin romance, just longer and with bigger words and without protagonist names such as Lance or Crystal, although Bruder, the spurned lover, comes close. This is the type of book you find on the shelves of a rented beach house, next to the sections devoted to Danielle Steel and Anne Rivers Siddons: the same misunderstandings, contrived plots, and improbable coincidences. If you must read it, save it for the beach or a long plane trip."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"Although this novel is meticulously researched and presents an unscathing (and very honest) depiction of Pasadena old society, the love story dominates rather than any real history of Pasadena. And I feel its necessary somewhere to acknowledge Emily Bronte for said love story. Pasadena is Wuthering Heights, but in Southern California at the beginning of the twentieth century. And that being mentioned nowhere, not even in any of the reviews I have read, it took me by surprise. However, I read it in one day, could not put it down. It just didn't live up to my expectations as historical fiction."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"This wonderfully crafted story keeps you interested from the first page until the last. The characters are fascinating and the history of Pasadena was interesting and almost like an extra character. A great read!"},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I actually did enjoy this book in spite of the 3 stars, but it was far too long, and the story jumped around too much. The author would very briefly tell the reader some major development in the story, and then much later the reader finds out how that development occurred.I liked reading about early days in Pasadena, CA."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I loved A Danish Girl--it's up there with my favorite books ever, and I'd love to write the screenplay. I looked forward to Ebershoff's new novel, but Pasadena is off-the mark. I loved the concept--I loved the first quarter of the novel, with the start of the Wuthering Heights romance, etc. Only, I feel like Ebershoff took so long writing this section that he ignored Bronte's pace . . . the book is LONG, and yet he never gets to the second generation's story . . . and our &quot;Heathcliff&quot; and &quot;Catherine&quot; never have their firey reunion w/ Catherine's mad scene . . . heck, he only barely brushes over Heathcliff's marriage to &quot;Edward's&quot; sister. Ugh. I looked forward to these scenes, only for the book to end on a flat note. Could've been good, I wish he'd try again and think about plot a little more. The generational saga with a little boost would have really set Pasadena off."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"David Ebershoff has entered the arena of current writers able to carry off The Big Story, his comrades in this arena being Richard Russo, Jocye Carol Oates, Annie Proulx, Cormac McCarthy among others. PASADENA: A Novel is epic in length at 500 pages and for those readers who find books of this length daunting, all fear of ennui can be put aside. Ebershoff knows how to spin a tale and develop branches, twigs and fruit on his basic trunk of an idea that maintain the reader's interest in carefully following the unfolding of this saga of California from the turn of the century to mid 20th century. Wisely he incorporates all the ethnic groups, the miscegenation, the influx of the Eastern US wealthy into a land of the pioneer spirit and in doing so he successfully defines what exactly makes his chosen locale of Pasadena unique. The story is about people - men and women who strive for independence and social acceptance simutaneously, who drive their lives through pledges secretly made and just as secretly dismantled, who search for love for all right reasons but settle for less than their ideals, whose lives intertwine with the ever changing permutations of individuality only to come full circle to their own altered origins.The characters Ebershoff creates are wholly three dimensional and do not stray beyond the boundaries of credibilty. Love, longing, lust, lying, and the building and destroying of dreams are on every page. Bruder, an orphan from an unknown family is seen as trash as a child in Pasadena where the Top 100 percenters or accepted Society members determine the lives of too many people, but becomes the stalwart force that carries this tale of war, of greed, of the 'gold in California' spirit, and ultimately the arrival of the foundations of the freeways and housing developments that have transformed current day Pasadena from its origins as a winter haven for the East Coast wealthy who basked in the glory of the lush landscape of orange groves and the Sierra Madre mountains. He is a giant of a man, but then he walks among equal giants in the personas of Linda Stamp, her father Dieter, her ultimate husband Willis Poore, and the myriad supporting cast of characters who weave in and out of this unfolding mystery with unflagging stealth. If the critical eye finds that the author at times pushes the descriptive language of the genus/species flora/fauna of his locales (he seems especially bent on informing us of the beginnings of many extant Pasadena families, businesses, and buildings) to the point of excess, then at the same time that eye must admit that few writers are so well researched in all the details that make us secure in the knowledge that this story could be a true tale.Ebershoff is a full-fledged novelist with the publication of this tome. He is one elegant writer! The promises made in his earlier 'The Danish Girl' and in the tightly detailed 'The Rose City' are not only kept but surpassed. Here is a man who can spread his wings over a vast canvas and bring home a story that leaves indelible imprints of characters that are difficult to leave behind with the closing of the last page. This book is a worthwhile commitment of your reading time. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"The narrative style of this book added to the difficulty of getting through it. While the third-hand technique had me immediately thinking of Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein, the more I read, the more I realized I would have been better off rereading Bronte's book. It is amazing that Pasadena took over 500 hundred pages and yet there were some gaping holes (I will not detail to avoid giving anything away). Not only were our \\"as told by\\" narrators unreliable (each saying that the other was not to be trusted), but the book's narrator was unreliable as well, leaving us confused and possibly misinformed from the very first scene. Before I even reached 300 pages, I was done with the characters. I was pretty sure how it would all end up, and frankly I didn't care about or connect with any of them. And I didn't care to slog through another 200 pages to discover secrets and promises. From that point on, I skimmed lots, read parts that somehow caught my interest, and in the end, was not surprised by how everything turn out.Glad I got this from the library and bought A Casual Vacancy from Amazon."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I will be visiting relatives in Pasadena this spring but I have never been to that part of California.

Another book by Ebershoff that is a must read is \\"19th Wife\\"."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"Let me begin by saying I DID enjoy this book, and I believe the author has a lot in him. This was a big project, indeed. In \\"Pasadena,\\" the reader is taken on a ride through the early 20th century, into 1945, but mainly dealing in the first 25 years. The author tackles not only Pasadena, but Carlsbad, Mexico, and Europe in the first World War. As many reviewers have said, this is a tragic epic of lust; many have stated the author copies the Wuthering Heights storyline. I didn't take that as a necessarily negative formula, as long as a story is well written, the same tale can be conveyed many ways. That said, I did find the first half of the book enjoyable. However, as the story moved its location to the city of Pasadena, it began to lose its footing. A story about a girl in a shipwrecked load of oranges is never followed through, holes begin to surface in the story, and by the end of the book some of the characters have 'died' but no discoveries are made about their 'secrets', which is a theme in this book. Overall, the book was enjoyable but, as someone else has mentioned, it does have a bit of the Harlequin feel by the last third. I will try Danish Girl, since others here have mentioned it as a better read. I think this author definitely has promise."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"This book, despite its length is a fairly quick read with accessible prose. I picked up this book because I live not far from where some of the novel takes place.Overall, I found the book enjoyable. It is a tragedy on a grand scale. The book does suffer in its middle stretch from a fairly plodding pace. I commend the author for his research which reflects in his enlightening historical details."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book but ultimately found it way too depressing. In this book, everything that is wonderful and good and successful eventually gets torn down and the is usually tragic. Loves lost, fortunes destroyed, lives ruined. Naturally life is full of tragedies, but there are times you wish that Pasadena would at least touch on a few positive themes.The heroine of the book (if you can call her that) is Seglinde Stumpf who soon becomes Linda Stamp and eventually Lindy Poore during her short, tragic life. Well before her premature death she gets to see the ugly side of life that includes the drowning death of her mother, the duplicity of her father, poor treatment from the men she loves, the death of her brother and the overall malaise of a once grand city.Overall, the writer is talented and he does bring the feel of old time Pasadena and Carlsbad to life for the reader. The characters are complex yet interesting enough to keep you hooked even if the flow of the events is sometimes hard to follow.I would recommend the book to people from Southern California who have an interest in Southern California's history, but could be of limited interest for others."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I've read Wuthering Heights and in comparison with this book, Wuthering Heights captures the story's tragic loves much better. Pasadena is Wuthering Heights dressed in an orange grove and onion farm. I was disappointed that the story is not only using Bronte's storyline, but it doesn't have the force of Bronte's. Ebershoff explains Linda's and Bruder's reasonings for their mistakes, but Bronte gave a more magical and spooky tale. If you are interested in California history, there are other books, and if you are interested in a tragic love story, check out Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Pasadena","review":"I did not like this book. I lived near Pasadena and currently live near Carlsbad and was very interested in the history of the two cities where the story takes place. The only reason I finished reading the badly written convoluted story was that it did provide some interesting historical background of the two cities. But any substance was lost in the painfully constructed cast of characters and storyline."},{"Title":"Grandmother Spider Brings the Sun: A Cherokee Story","review":"This is a wonderful telling of a truly Cherokee tale.

Instead of the usual stereotypical &quot;ancient legend storyelling&quot; literary style we often see with retelling of traditional tales, this legend is refreshingly written in a colloquial manner. This style, as well as the two-page layout with text on one side, makes this an excellent book to read aloud. The textures and colors and expressive animal illustrations can be shown to their best advantage. My boys love all the animal pictures, the humor, and the exciting fire-spouting Sun Guard monsters!

Although I have read every other De Lint book or story I can find, and they are all simply breathtaking, (check out Memory and Dream!!) Dreams Underfoot has remained my favorite. Sentimentality, no doubt. Dreams Underfoot is a tapestry novel, with characters and events that weave themselves together to give you a fabulous picture of the city of Newford and all its strange and wonderful aspects. De Lint's writing style is brilliant, both lyrical and funny, both sad and strange. If you like Fantasy novels, in particular Urban Fantasy, then do not, under any circumstances, miss this book. De Lint is considered one of the seminal authors of the Urban Fantasy genre, and there is no doubt in my mind that he is a master of his craft."},{"Title":"Dreams Underfoot: The Newford Collection","review":"Skillfully interweaving magic, music, art, compassion, and contemporary issues such as child abuse and homelessness, Charles DeLint is hardly an escapist. However, in this anthology he offers glimpses of a well-realized world much like our own, just different enough to allow faerie to wander city streets barefoot in winter, or for a practical joke involving a gorilla suit to lead to a fleeting encounter with a genuine yeti. My favorite story in the collection is a gorgeous, heartbreaking retelling of 'The Little Mermaid'."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"As I read this novel, it got worse and worse until I thought it could not get any worse, and then it really got worse. A week later, I could still vividly remember the characters and could envision them in a motion picture. I could not put it down once I started reading. There has to be a lot of truism in this novel and very thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"After an incident with US Senator McBride, Norm Shepard left the marines to become a railroad brakeman and fish in the Potomac. While heading to a spot to fish, he notices two other fishermen, but when he walks past them, they shoot him in the back. He manages to escape to the nearby road where Major General McKay gets him to a hospital.McKay is concerned where this shooting occurred so he assigns long time civil servant Ross Chambers and his emergency management team to investigate. Evelyn Pace and Jim Woods interview Norm; they return to their superior Ross with grave concerns that the two wannabe killers were monitoring weather conditions, which could mean an NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) attack on the capital. While Norm is recalled to active duty, the response team begins activation of Project Bluelight, THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT project to keep the government operational during a crippling emergency. The ideal solution is that they must stop rogue terrorists from causing a pandemic incident of mass destruction.Though terrorists employ clever deadly ruses as they value life less than radioactive waste, THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT highlights what is a major fear of many people: weapons of mass destruction (ask the President and his psychological advisors). The story line is a powerful thriller that looks at what a government can do to continue to lead even when calamity reaches biblical proportions. Though the small insets focusing on the terrorists seem more distracting than revealing, readers will feel they won the Triple Crown with Ray Derby's compelling tale of counterterrorism.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"The story was amazing and since it was before 9-11 it is even more amazing....some forethought.A very good attention getter and holder.I loved this book and would also like to see it as a movie."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"I have been reading books a lot lately and this one really made me want to see what could happen in the end.

It's a fantastic plot with great characters. Ray Derby has a knack for writing that I don't see as often as I would like."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS WORTHY OF READING.IT IS MORE FACTS THAN FICTION. I WONDER WHERETHE AUTHOR GOT HIS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.DEFINITE INSIGHT INTO WHAT IS REALLY GOINGON IN AMERICA.."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"I think that I would have liked to be able to give 3 and a half stars for this book. The book is an excellent first attempt by Ray Derby.Many people might have a misconceived notion of what a \\"Shadow Government\\" really is.....no, it's not another President and VP and all altogether different cabinet, just waiting in the wings to take over in the event of a crisis.....it's a smart way to look at a potential situation. A shadow Government for Derby's book is thousands of people (mostly retirees), chosen by the government, which excelled in their given fields, whether it be in nuclear physics or carpentry, etc. that would be saved and be able to lead America back into civilization in case of mass destruction from nuclear, chemical or biological warfare.As you can guess, America is struck by a biological agent that kills millions of Americans. It's a race against the clock to have the Shadow Government and the facilities that will house these people up and running before the terrorists unleash the weapon.The plot is very solid. It is evident that Mr. Derby uses his experience to create a chilling world. The plot itself will keep you on the edge of your seat and while this does not give anything away, you are pleasantly surprised where the story turns in the end. Characterization is a little on the thin side. The pace of the plot made it difficult to really be able to identify with the characters....you really don't have the time to get to know them. I think now, after 9-11, it's easier to identify with the emotions of the country in general. The subplots of romance are weak, but easily ignored. There are a few plot points that weighed the story down, rather than moved it along, but again, you turn the page waiting to see what will happen next.All in all it's a good read. I definitely recommend reading it and I will eagerly watch to see if Mr. Derby publishes another book in the future."},{"Title":"The Shadow Government","review":"This book was GREAT! I read it before September 11th. It was amazing how true to life this book was.

The first chapter establishes her career, her heart and her strong sense of responsibility to the memory of her brother Joel.The story line held me in its grip: from Cat's determination to discover the truth about her brother's fate (she believes he was murdered while he scouted the bush in Nairobi for the right location to put up an exclusive resort hotel), to the eventual entanglement of emotions when forced to deal with Jock Campbell, owner of Campbell Safaris, to get her to that location. It is implied that Campbell knows the truth about Joel's death. Cat suspects that he does and hires Campbell, much to his own resistance to have anything to do with her. She does so on the pretext of completing her dead brother's dream.She is challenged at every turn trying to find out who Campbell really is and what side, if any, is he on. The relationship that develops between the two creates an exciting roller coaster of events, from meeting Campbell's aristocratic family to a barrage of life-threatening situations the closer they get to the hotel site, which turns out to be a bucolic, exquisite environment untouched by commerce. The sexual attraction is palpable. Being the modern woman, Cat thinks she can be satisfied by Campbell's advances and a few sexual gymnastics, but gradually we see there is more between them than immediate gratification.The other characters play into the intrigue and adventure. The mysterious young woman who enrages Cat because of her feelings for Campbell (which she keeps suppressed); Tom M'Bala, Campbell's business partner, a man of high breeding and intelligence; Father Gaston, an interesting character whom Cat befriends; Reitholder, the obvious villain, is strangle-worthy. Then there are the three Maasai warriors for whom I felt admiration and affection. They served as guides and attended the needs of the safari. They were also formidable fighters when challenged by the opposition.The war that breaks out in the bush between the Campbell/Stanton faction and a &quot;mystery&quot; band of poachers(led by Reitholder and instigated by his partner, a Frenchman named Colonel Francis)held me in thrall. I was astonished that such scenes could be written by a woman, but Ms. Brien proves throughout this story that she has a very broad brush running through her talent. The war made my heart jump, the violence and the description of what was happening to each of its participants kept me turning the pages and hoping that the good guys would win out. I won't say what happens, but I will say that finding that chapter is worth the effort if you want to witness superb writing.Nell Brien goes far beyond the obvious and opens the door to understanding the jungle habitat in ways I never knew before. I am convinced she was on safari herself when she got the idea for this book. I look forward to her next and hope she never stops.Brava!"},{"Title":"Lioness","review":"While searching for the right location for a hotel in Kenya, architect Joel Stanton dies in an accident that leaves his partner-sister Cat badly shaken. Not too long after the body bag with her twin's contents inside arrived in Los Angeles, Cat receives an envelop holding Joel's sketches and a strange letter followed the next day with his camera containing no film. Cat feels something is not quite right with her sibling's death and decides to fly to Nairobi to investigate what really happened and to complete the project.In Nairobi, Cat retains Campbell Safari to guide her as she follows the footsteps of her deceased sibling. Cat is attracted to Dan Campbell, but feels he is hiding the truth about her brother from her. Dan also feels the appeal, but has his own demons that will not allow love to properly flow between the two of them.LIONESS is an exciting romantic suspense in which the tension increases with every step taken in Kenya. The story line is crisp and brings the entire African nation and not just Nairobi to life as few books have. The lead couple is charming as they struggle between mistrust and love. However, no question that Nell Brien's novel belongs to Kenya, a place that will fascinate the audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lioness","review":"Lioness was so engrossing I couldn't put it down. What a read! This book has everything I look for in a great book - romance, mystery, a mesmerizing story, with a compelling message about the ongoing massacre of wildlife in Africa. Reading this book was not only enjoyable, but also as with Nell Briens other book &quot;Veiled Journey&quot;, it informs the reader of these on-going social and moral wrongs. After reading Vieled Journey I started reading other books on middle eastern womens plight of a total lack of rights and deep social and personal supression. Now after reading Lioness I am compelled to take a strong stand to support the stopping the killing of these beautiful creatures by poachers.Nell Brien is my favorite new author because of her vividly engrossing writing style, where you lose yourself in the world of her characters and their story. I love the feeling of not wanting to put a book down and frankly I haven't read one like that since Veiled Journey.Great applause and thanks to this author who writes not only extremely entertainly, but also informs on important current issues going on in our world today."},{"Title":"Witch's Wishes","review":"A witch on Halloween night gives a girl her wishes just for the night, then regrets it.

In this book, he summarizes beautifully various results in algebraic geometry that were known at the time of publication. Most importantly, the author believes that in order to properly understand algebraic geometry, one must delve into the works of \`Italian' algebraic geometry, as well as the works of Zariski, Weil, and Grothendieck. The former assists in building intuition, while the latter gives a unified algebraic framework in which to work in and relates the subject to number theory. Every student of algebraic geometry has perhaps been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of results in the subject, and the increasing level of abstraction in the form of the theory of schemes, that is encountered when learning algebraic geometry. This book introduces the \`classical' point of view, with the modern scheme-theoretic approach left to a future work, says the author. Since its publication, many new interesting approaches have been taken toward algebraic geometry, one being that use is being made of the computer and various symbolic programming languages in order to deal with the geometric objects from a computational point of view. Another has been the role of physics, particularly that of \`mirror symmetry' and superstring and M-theory. In fact, one might expand the words of the author in the introduction to this book, and now say that a proper understanding of algebraic geometry should also involve an understanding of quantum field theory, integrable systems, and superstring and membrane theory.Some of the more interesting and well-motivated discussions in the book include:1. The author uses an \`analytic' version of the implicit function theorem to show that the Zariski open set of smooth points on an affine variety has the structure of a complex manifold. The Zariski topology has been viewed as somewhat \\"mysterious\\" by some beginning students, so this characterization clears this up to some degree. 2. The need for the group of divisors and the resulting Picard group. This is done to make up for the fact that for a smooth variety X, the affine coordinate ring R(X) is not a unique factorization domain (UFD). The author describes this situation as being analogous to the one in algebraic number fields where the UFD property must be weakened to that of decomposing principal ideals into products of prime ideals. The Picard group is then the group of divisors modulo the principal divisors, and then R(X) is a UFD if and only if the Picard group is zero. 3. The discussion on Chow's theorem. The author motivates this famous result by asking to what extent the general theory of complex analytic spaces parallels the theory of algebraic varieties. The difficulty, he explains, is that in algebraic geometry one deals with rational functions, which do not have essential singularities like analytic functions do. The author discusses a case where no essential singularities occur, his example dealing with \`analytic' and \`*-analytic' subsets of complex n-space. Loosely speaking, analytic sets are essentially zero sets of analytic functions, whereas *-analytic sets can be represented as the union of complex submanifolds. He shows that a set is *-analytic if and only if it is analytic, and from this result follows Chow's theorem, which states that the only complex analytic subsets of n-dimensional projective space are algebraic varieties. Chow's theorem is a generalization of the result in complex variable theory that says that the only meromorphic functions on the extended complex plane are rational functions. 4. A natural question to ask when studying algebraic varieties is whether they have a \\"size\\", i.e. a volume or area of some sort. For r-dimensional subvarieties of n-dimensional projective space, the author proves that one can define the 2r-dimensional volume of the variety, and this is accomplished via a Riemannian metric on n-dimensional projective space. This metric only depends on r and the degree of the variety, and is in fact the famous Kahler metric. The author goes on to characterize algebraic varieties as minimal submanifolds of n-dimensional projective space, using the tools of DeRham cohomology. The volume result is then generalized to that of compact oriented submanifolds of n-dimensional projective space, with the first result holding when the submanifold is an algebraic subvariety. 5. The treatment of the Hilbert polynomial. The author motivates this in the context of the calculation of the dimension of the vector space of functions with poles at most a given divisor. He proves an explicit formula for the Hilbert polynomial for r-dimensional subvarieties of n-dimensional projective space. He also shows how the constant term of the Hilbert polynomial is related to the \`arithmetic genus' of a projective variety. The arithmetic genus is then shown to be equal to the topological genus for smooth curves, this being the famous Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem in dimension one. His proof of this result is very detailed and actually quite fun to work through and read, as it does not depend on the theory of harmonic forms. 6. For those who are interested in the theory of elliptic curves, the author gives an elementary overview of their properties."},{"Title":"Collector's Guide to My Merry with Values","review":"Wonderful book if you need to find out what little things came in what package.

The information brings you up to a point and then stops just before anything practical is said. Even though HTML is past maturity I still prefer to use it for its flexibility and clarity of purpose. This book stops at HTML 2. However it places the emphases on proper design and the practicality of trying the design before finishing the plan."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"Molly Keane sticks to her chosen niche in this book, the story of an Anglo-Irish family whose members are dedicated to mutual assured destruction, even as they slide into genteel poverty. Nobody in the St Charles household would dream of treating the dogs or horses badly; servants and local tradesmen don't fare so well. But the brunt of their vituperation is saved for one another, with each family member nursing a store of petty grievances, both real and imaginary. Our guide for this particular version of hell is the unlovely, delusional daughter of the house, Aroon. Neglected by her philandering father, despised by her icy mother, used by her charming brother, she pines for love and approval. Her transformation to bitter, vengeful, old maid is inevitable and heartbreaking to watch.Nobody captures the claustrophobic world of the decaying Anglo-Irish aristocracy better than Molly Keane. While parts of \\"Good Behaviour\\" are very funny indeed, it is considerably darker and more complex than the rest of her books, all of which cover similar ground. The writing is exceptional; Keane nails the idiosyncrasies of her characters vividly, with wit and affection.An engaging, if ultimately depressing, account of a not so well-behaved family."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"An aristocratic family living in poverty in a huge, crumbling mansion...A fat woman terribly disappointed in love...How could this story be funny? Only through the wit and skill of a great undiscovered writer like Molly Keane--how truly sad that this book is Hard To Find. She creates Ireland in the 30's for us in tones so rich and vivid that you'll never want it to end."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"I'm belatedly writing this review because I feel it's owed, since I dinged another of Keane's novels, \\"Queen Lear,\\" rather badly years ago. Excerpts from the QL review:\\"I bought [Queen Lear] because I was stunned by the perfection of \\"Good Behavior\\" which I expect to read again and again over the years. . . [In Queen Lear] Molly Keane seems to attempt a repeat of the magnificent knockout punch she delivered in \\"Good Behavior\\" (an ending which perfectly and shockingly fulfills and transforms the beginning, built logically and inevitably on everything in between). . . [In Good Behavior] Molly Keane made me sympathize with and finally, grudgingly admire a truly fascinating heroine, Iris Aroon. She's warped, stunted, horrifyingly self-deluded, and her unquestioning acceptance of the shallow values of her tormentors is rather disgusting. Still, there's the hidden audacity and sly creative stubbornness with which she copes.\\"Almost 6 years after writing the QL review, my re-readings of \\"Good Behavior\\" are beyond count and the pleasure they've given me immeasurable. This book is simply outstanding.I would not compare Keane to Austen though. As in Austen's novels, \\"Good Behavior\\" presents a meticulously structured and seamlessly controlled plot progression, featuring masterful character development and telling social detail. But Keane's story has little positive emotional appeal, which though often understated was never lacking in Austen - even her nasty little novelette, \\"Lady Susan,\\" does not have the nihilistic undertones of \\"Good Behavior.\\"As a rule I abhor nihilism in all of its trifling, self-important manifestations, but it's bearable in Good Behavior because Keane has the good sense and the skill to deliver a double-whammy payoff to reward the reader's generous bestowal of attention and time.First, there's the massive intellectual thrill the moment we \\"get\\" the significance of the first scene as the last concludes, and secondly, there's the deeply rooted satisfaction of witnessing proof that indeed, \\"what goes around, comes around.\\" The universe is just, and our choices significant. HOOOAH. Big time.I deeply admire Austen and generally prefer reading her to reading Keane, but still must say that in \\"Good Behavior\\" Keane delivers her one-two knockout with a power and precision unequalled in any other novel I've read, including Austen's best."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"...In \\"Good Behavior\\", Keane has captured this world, depicting with sharply witty and bitter accuracy the passe rituals, the claims of class superiority, the tyranny of families disguised under the label of love. Yet she maintains the poignancy of the human need for acceptance and love.I am looking forward to reading her other novels. And I've heard that there is a BBC production of \\"Good Behavior\\", so I'll be watching for it as well."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"Aroon St Charles, aged 57, tells us of the first thirty years or so of her life. She was born before the first World War into an Anglo-Irish Protestant landed family living near Limerick. She had a cold, unkind, selfish and unresponsive mother. Her father was inarticulately fond of his daughter, but his life was otherwise wrapped up with horses and dogs, even when, later, he lost one leg in the war. As a child Aroon (a surprisingly unconventional name for such a convention-bound family) loved Mrs Brock, the governess, a lovely character who had come to teach her and her younger brother Hubert. She had previously worked for the Massingham family, friends of the St Charles family, and the children are fascinated by the stories she told of the Massinghams, whose three boys - Richard, Sholto and Raymond - Mrs Brock had tutored previously. She had loved it there, but had had to leave them because her philistine employers thought she was making the boys sensitive to poetry instead of taking a manly interest in horses and other vigorous pursuits. For the first sixty pages she dominates the book, so that we think she will be its central character. She won't be - though memories of turn up occasionally to haunt her former charges. Instead, the tougher character of Rose, the cook, will play an increasingly important part.Aroon and Hubert grow up, best friends: he good-looking, she too tall for most men; but he makes sure she is part of the social life of the country gentry centred around Horse Show balls. The Massingham-St Charles family friendship is carried on into the next generation, when Richard Massingham, as glamorous as Hubert, becomes the latter's most intimate friend. Hubert encourages a threesome; Richard comes to stay during the Cambridge vacation; and shy, awkward, too-big-bosomed Aroon falls in love with him. There will be bliss and pain in these relationships - all exquisitely described.I must not reveal how now one blow falls after another - upon the family and upon Aroon in particular. She does her best to cope; she has a need to help and to be needed, to love and to be loved; but, as before, she often feels hurtfully excluded. She suffers one humiliation after another - and again good behaviour means that she must not show it.Molly Keane's prose is superb; her period details (clothes, households) are excellent; her characterizations a wonderful blend of subtlety and caricature. She shows us the life of families where \\"good behaviour\\" was a carapace behind which its characters stifled or were made to stifle the expression of all feelings, where deep emotions must not be shown at or - in family privacy - after funerals. At the very end Aroon's psychological burdens are unexpectedly lifted; but until then the suffering in this book is almost too painful to read.Excellent though Marian Keyes' introduction is, I would advise readers not to read it until after they have read the book: it contains too many spoilers."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"She so thoroughly captures that magical time in history. The sweetness and the foibles of the Anglo-Irish and their sentimental attachment to the country."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"This is the first novel by Molly Keane that I have ever read, but it will not, assuredly, be my last. Keane writes with a bitter irony about the mores of a crumbling Angle-Irish family in the mid-decades of the 20th Century whose behavior is anything but good. Keane has been compared to Jane Austen but she is more biting and less forgiving of her characters' foibles (at least on the evidence in this book)."},{"Title":"Good Behaviour","review":"The book's story and characters are interesting, but somehow it never seems to live up to its promise.

Mummie and Rose would be in power over me, over Temple Alice,until I was old, or middle-aged at best, beyond even the remembrance of time past. They may starve me too- the idea filled me with panic. Mummie doesn't eat and Rose won't cook for me alone. They will enjoy starving me. It will be called economy. Daughters at home are supposed to do the flowers.

She receives a note from England telling her that her birth father is alive and since there were many secrets surrounding him and his supposed deathshe convinces her family to let her visit england so she can surrepticiously pursue it. And of course she gets into a great deal of trouble. She winds up forced into marriage to the angst ridden earl of valcour who has past tragedies of his own.

This had a very believable story line, with real tragedy that can actually be felt by the reader. There were just enough twists and turns to make it interesting without crossing over to unbelieveable. And Little Nattie alone will win your heart. Very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics","review":"In the gutsiest political manifesto of American history, Woodrow Wilson dared to say that the Founding Fathers had it wrong. What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that &quot;separation of powers&quot; did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics","review":"This book is a classic. As a young academic with a keen interest in national politics, but without any experience, Wilson critiques the American governmental structure on a number of points, examines all of the branches (except judicial), the inner workings and character of each branch, and their inter-workings. Wilson is mostly critical of the system's deficiencies and has few words of praise for Constitutional government. Instead, his ideal model is the British system, with which he is constantly comparing the American. He also touches on the model of French government to provide a broader basis of comparison. The world's other great model Republic, Switzerland, is given passing mention. A broader discussion of the diversity of foreign models, including more discussion of the brilliant Swiss federal system, but also including the German system, would have added much to this book.Wilson's principal complaints with the shortcomings of American government can be summed up with one word: disjoint. He states that there is no structure in the Congress that can be described as \\"leadership\\" in British sense, meaning that even the nominal \\"leaders\\" of the parties cannot claim to speak for the rank-and-file members, who may act on their own initiative, through committees, in the process of drafting legislation (instead of having legislation crafted by a central administration and having members vote or reject it). The result is that there is no cohesive policy, as the various committees draft legislation within their own domains that in the end can be contradictory or mutually abrasive.Wilson also states that there is disjoint between the executive and Congress, largely due to the executive being independent from the legislature. This is almost unique to the American system; in most systems, the functions of administering law are subordinate to those of making law. The independent executive leads to a disconnection between the making of law and the making of policy, which makes forming a cohesive policy quite difficult.Wilson offers more such examples of disjoint in the American government, including the disconnect between those who decide how to tax and those who decide how to spend, but the logic is similar. If one extends the line of Wilson's thinking, the implication is simple: the concept of checks and balances in our Constitution has been a failure. This conclusion harkens back to the spirit of Centinel, who in 1789 condemned checks and balances as snake oil, contending that human intellect is not equal to the task of checking the various interests through an elaborate counterbalancing system. A more effective alternative would be a simple and transparent system (the American system is not transparent but quite obfuscated) in which any attentive observer could determine the chain of events that produces results, and act directly to indicate his approval or dissent of that result. In contrast, Wilson states that in the American system, \\"the voter has no way of knowing how his ballot can any effect on the government or policy, even an infinitesimal one.\\" Wilson's thesis is similar to Centinel's sentiment in his famous letters.Noticeably absent from Wilson's dissertation is any mention of the judiciary (typically presented at the most basic educational level as one of three coequal branches), which in the United States, takes a role in crafting policy through the concepts of judicial review and the setting of precedents that are similar to legislation in effect. One may conclude that this absence is because the judicial branch has only become so prominent in the 20th century, but such a conclusion would be misinformed; the Supreme Court has been crucial to policy in America, since John Marshall. The absence of the judicial branch in this analysis is a minor deficiency, but an intelligent reader should be able to extend Wilson's logic of disjoint to the judicial branch. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to see his thoughts on the matter.In all, this book is quite informative, insightful, and worth reading. On a lighter level, it is interesting to see how some of Wilson's observations on government hold just as true 125 years later, and to see how some that he states as essential have come to change."},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."},{"Title":"Gathering clouds,: A tale of the days of St. Chrysostom;","review":"My low rating is for this version of the text, not the text itself:The $0.99 Kindle version is very difficult to read because it is not actually formatted for the Kindle. A single line of the text is always split into two lines, the second of which ends about half way across my screen. (I'm using the default text size, 3rd choice from the left, and standard keyboard at the bottom orientation) The text fits the Kindle properly if you orient the device with the keyboard at the right (or left) and the text scaled to the second smallest font size -- too small and awkward for comfortable reading for me.I decided to purchase the CCEL version of this text, also available on Amazon at $2.99. It is formatted properly & the text behaves as expected on my Kindle. A quick search shows other versions available here as well, but I wanted to support the CCEL if I had to pay more for this.As for the book itself:I'm about 5 chapters into the book and am finding it rather interesting. The average reader may have a slow-go of it because Farrar's style is solidly late 19th century.

In Dance With Me, main character Jane Porter returns to her hometown of Twin Rivers, Rhode Island, to be with her sister and ill mother. Jane has been away from RI for years, escaping her past, living in New York City's Greenwich Village and founding a successful bakery business. Her motives to return aren't just for her mother and sister, but also to search out a teenager named Chloe, whom she gave up to adoption at the time of the baby's birth. Not a day has gone by that she hasn't thought of her daughter. She meets Chloe under secret circumstances, hiding the fact that she is her birth mother. Jane unexpectedly finds love with Chloe's uncle... but when she reveals that she is Chloe's birth mother, the news is not welcomed but vehemently rejected. After assisting her sister in settling mother in a much needed constant-care nursing home, Jane reluctantly returns to New York to reopen her bakery to escape the pain of Chloe's and the uncle's rejection. Does forgiveness come out of love lost, to be regained? Rice's book has a realistic premise, but soft on character development and depth of the plot lost in the repetitiveness of 'will she love me?', 'will she accept me?' \\"will he understand?' If you are a reader who enjoys a no nonsense, light romantic read, then Dance With Me is for you. (Recommended Reading: The Pearl Diver by Jeff Talarigo)"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I always look forward to a Luanne Rice book. Inside the covers, they each hold something special, magical- a tale of love, family and redemption. And they always keep me coming back for more!Dance with me is about two sisters, Sylvie and Jane and their ailing mother. Even though they are both about 30 years old, in so many ways they've never grown up. But now is the time to face the past and start anew. For Sylvie it's dealing with a mother who has Alzheimers, who she's built her whole life around- but now it's time to start a life of her own. For Jane, it's about forgiving her mother for encouraging her to give up a baby she had when she was 20 and finding a way to make up for lost time. And then we get to know the family of the little girl Jane put up for adoption, Chloe, and her family- who have their own secrets and problems.Again, Luanne Rice takes topics we've read about a million times before and some how still manages to hold our interest. And she never gives us a cheesy ending, anything forced or fake. It's as real as real life can get. I'd recommend this book for anyone who enjoys romance or family stories. The story keeps you interested and the characters endear themselves to you. Also- read any of her other books, they're all wonderful!"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Jane Porter returns to her Rhode Island hometown to help her sister care for their ailing mother. Jane rarely makes the trip due to the painful memories that have scarred her even into adulthood. When she was a sophomore in college, her mother forced her to give up her child for adoption, and it was handled privately, with the baby girl going to a local family.Dylan Chadwick has also returned home. After his wife and daughter were killed in a crossfire while he was a US Marshall, he has returned to the family apple orchard, determined to bring it back to life. He has forged a loving and protective relationship with his niece, who it turns out, is the child that Jane gave birth to 15 years earlier.Coming home affords Jane with the opportunity to meet the child she could never forget. Soon, she is spending time with Dylan, who has suddenly come out of his shell, and has fallen for her. She too is smitten with Dylan, but worries that her motivations for being with him will be misconstrued once he finds out about her relationship to Chloe.Dance with Me is an absorbing story about two lost souls who manage to find each other, only to find themselves at odds. The icy relationship between the sisters and the mother is believable and engrossing."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"This story was exceptionally LuAnne Rice and yet, somehow a lovely departure. Jane Porter has been seeking that which complete her, the child she gave up as a young college student. Her journey sets many free and in the end Jane rediscovers the love of family and of a most exceptional and wounded man. Dylan Chadwick is perhaps on a similar journey, to find peace after losing his own daughter, in Jane he discovers that peace and a forever love.The story was almost lyrical in voice. I was pulled into both Jane and Dylan's journey and unable to stop reading.To compare Ms. Rice's books would be unfair, but Dance With Me does prove that her story telling improves with each new offering."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"While it was great that the adoptive mother wants what is best for her daughter, I found the acceptance of the birth mother - particularly after her deception - to be unbelievable.Also, Ms Rice kept pointing out the differences between Chloe and her adoptive family and how much she was like Jane. Yet, when Chloe is clinging to her mother, we don't really see why. The portrayal of the adoptive parents was too one dimensional."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"The subject of this book hit close to home for me. I loved the characters, the story, and Rice's sensitivity in the telling of the 2 stories that kept me reading nonstop for 10 hours. I felt the pain, joy, tears, and laughter of these great characters. The depth, the twists and turns (that life gives you), and the genuine emotion of each character and his or her role in the drama of the life Luann Rice breathes in to and around is sound, down to Earth , and genuine. The story lines are not corrupted. The mother who gave up her child leads an unhappy, lonely life while she sees that this lovely free-spirit has had a happy life, despite teenager angst. The devestated father comes home and finds solace and possible happiness. The reader will appreciate how the teenager and her birth mother connects with him. Connections break and never be reconnected perfectly, but grafting two broken pieces create a wonderful new thing! I believe this is one Rice's best books."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Jane is drawn back to her Rhode Island roots by her mother's failing health and the yearning for the daughter she gave up as an infant. The baby (named Chloe) is now a teen. Chloe feels misunderstood by her adoptive parents and stymied in her efforts to seek out her birth mother. Not realizing why Jane is interested in her, they develop a friendship.A relationship springs up between Jane and Chloe's uncle, Dylan, who had suffered the tragic loss of his wife and daughter. He devotes himself to restoring the family orchards.As secrets are revealed, the relationships shift and re-form between Jane, her mother, her sister, the long lost daughter, the adoptive parents and Dylan.The author has a sure hand at creating the small town Rhode Island setting and the complex relationships and feelings."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"By Kristina DenenkampThe book I Chose to read was Dance with Me, by Luanne Rice. This book, would be considered a tragic love story. It tells about Love, Life, and the hope that things will eventually get better.This story takes place in a Little Town of Providence Rhode Island, with references to New York City. Jane had moved away from the country, as far away as she could get. She had so many horrible memories in this place. As soon as her mother was taken care of, she would go back to the city. She would return to hiding from the past. Jane attended Brown University; she wanted to become an English teacher. However her studies were interrupted when she met a boy. Jane becomes Pregnant and the boy will not marry her. Her mother Margaret decides that she is too young, to have a child and sends her to St. Joseph's. The baby, now named Chloe, is given up for adoption. Jane's heart was broken, but she knew it was what was best for the baby.Now back at home, she knows she cannot see the child whom is now 15 years of age, but she feels she must. She goes to the old apple orchard that is where her home is located. It is there that she meets Dylan Chadwick. Dylan is Chloe's uncle, and Jane finds it the perfect opportunity to meet her daughter. But will the recognize her?I think that this book was interesting; at the beginning I was bored with it, because it drags on. However, it gets better as you keep reading. I think that this book is a good read for people on a more mature level. I do not think that 10 years olds and under could comprehend the moral of the story. I think the author did a amazing job with the sensory details. She did a good job making you feel the characters emotions. I think that through the story, however, she should have mentioned more about Chloe's family. Some of the only information you have about them is that they strongly dislike the apple orchard, and Uncle Dylan.I believe a good message given in this book would be to think before you act. If Jane had she would not be in the situations that she is in now. I think a lot of teenage girls should read this book because it gives strong messages about teenage issues. It tells you about the negatives of your actions, about what really happens.I think that this book is a pretty good read. Its not on my top 5, however, I do think that it has good messages, and is very entertaining."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"If you're looking for a light read with interesting characters, this is it. If you're looking for in depth analysis of the internal conflicts between adopted daughters and their birth parents and adoptive parents, this is not it.Overall, I thought it was sweet. Sure, there's holes in the plot, but it's not an academic report. This is my first Luanne Rice book and I'm sure I'll read more in the future."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I had never read Luanne Rice before, but was intrigued by the synopsis on the back of the book enough to give it a try. While at times I found the writing a little distracting, the overall story and feel of the book was well crafted. I very much enjoyed reading it, and will probably read more of her work as a result."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I don't usually run out and buy a hardcover book immediately, but Luanne Rice books make me go and do just that. This book was well written and very touching. The whole premise of the story is Jane comes home to help her sister take care of her mother, but we find out she has come home for a very different reason and that is to find her daughter. As with any Luanne Rice book, Rice never puts all her cards on the table at once. She very slowly reveals her intentions for the charactors development chapter by chapter. The magical web she weaves makes us long to read more to understand and to develop the character in our mind. I spent a night reading this, I just couldn't put it down. Luanne Rice is in fine form. Anyone who enjoys books with a coastal flair will always enjoy Rice's books."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"You could probably cut this book in half and it would be a better read. Rice spoonfeeds us the plot, she overdescribes, and she throws in sappy red herrings. If she had built up Jane's betrayal without telling us everything about it, then revealed it to us at the same time Dylan found out, it would have been more compelling (though we may have suspected where she was going). The resolution was much too flat - I didn't see how the characters got to a place of forgiveness for a betrayal that to me would have been unforgivable. I really wish I could have edited the manuscript for her.My biggest objection to the book is the way adoption is portrayed. The bio-mom is constantly referred to as \\"real\\" while relationships with the adoptive parents (who some would argue ARE the real parents) are trivialized.I give it two stars because I kept reading, even though I wasn't enjoying it."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Other reviewers have accurately described Luanne Rice's Dance With Me. What hit me when I read it was the way the author presented the book in the eyes of young, middle-aged, and older people. For example, Margaret Porter, the retired school principal, and mother of Jane and Sylvie, was in the early stages of dementia of some type. Being in her head was some times confusing to the reader, and well it should be.Then, we get into the head of a 15-year old. But not just any 15-year old. Chloe is adopted and knows it. She longs for her real mother, but loves her adopted parents dearly. At one point we, the readers, must feel the pain she goes through when she first learns she might be pregnant. This is especially hard if you are a parent of a teen yourself.In the middle are Sylvie, Jane, and Dylan (Chloe's uncle). Sylvie, who has put her life on hold to care for her mother until her sister Jane helps her find a way to find happiness for herself. Jane, mother of Chloe, is steadfast throughout. She must have suffered throughout the years before the story begins, but now she is okay with it. It is not until the end of the book that we learn enough about Chloe's father to understand Jane.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story guided by excellent characters. It is a book you won't want to end."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I always encourage my students to read anything but textbooks during their quarter breaks. This is one of the books I chose for myself! It was a great \\"sit by the pool\\" read and I actually read it in one day. It wasn't 'rocket science' and it kept my interest throughout. Maybe a little predictable at times, but immediately after finishing it, I picked up another Rice book (Beach Girls) and enjoyed another relaxing read. If you're looking for intense drama, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a 'feel good\\" read, this is what you want!!"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"In Twin Rivers, Rhode Island, former high school Principal Margaret Porter slides in and out of senility. Her youngest daughter Sylvie takes a leave of absence from her job as the local high school librarian to care for her mom. Margaret's oldest daughter Jane, a successful New York baker, comes home to help, but brings with her a very sweet cake that her mom the diabetic should not eat.Though her mother seems to have forgotten the secret they shared, Jane feels guilt over the hush-hush that drove her out of town. Jane meets and befriends young Chloe, the child she gave up at birth under pressure from her own mother. The Chadwick brood adopted Chloe and love her as if she was biologically one of their own. Soon Jane and Dylan Chadwick, a former US Marshal whose wife and child died in a shootout, fall in love. However, she has the Chloe secret and he still feels guilt over what happened to his previous family making anything permanent seem impossible.Fans of contemporary romantic family dramas with deep relationships will appreciate the latest Luanne Rice entry. The story line is solid due to a realistic cast struggling with interrelating with one another. The two siblings and the Chadwick crew seem so genuine while Margaret's condition comes across so real and adds depth as to what is best for an aging parent and for their caretaker. Though the reconciliation ending seems to easily done even if Chloe \\"named\\" herself, fans will enjoy this delightfulHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"This is the first book I've read by Rice, and I thought it was really good. Some books enable you to get lost in them and you can feel your facial expressions changing as each page turns. And you feel like you have to keep reading. This is one of those books. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I can't remember when I have read a more annoying book as this one. Jane is one of the most annoying characters I've come across for awhile. I couldn't even feel sympathy for her. She is 20 when she finds she's pregnant; she didn't have to give her baby up-that was her choice. She's not 15 or 16 but old enough to make choices. Then even so people do move on and in 15 years she could have married and had other children instead of the obsession she had with Chloe. The whole book is over the top dramatic with nothing realistic. Now I'm sure most women who have to give a baby up never truly forgets and probably hopes one day she can see that child but for Jane to walk into Chloe's life when she is at the most vulnerable age is unconscionable. I didn't see Chloe as so sensitive as determined to have her own way with the whole environmental issues and etc. I believe in environmental issues but Chloe is over the top ridiculous. She's too young to even understand some of the implications. She is destructive to people who do not agree with her. I was disgusted with the language the author had Chloe and her friend use even to using the F__ word. Wasn't it interesting that the adoptive parents raised her and now walks in Jane the birth mother who is ever so cool and clear through the book Chloe takes pot shots at her adopted parents as if she has the maturity to judge them. Jane had no right to intrude in Chloe's life and I was very upset when she told Chloe who she was without having talked to the adopted parents first. That was horrible! I was adopted and I knew from the time I was a little girl and I didn't spend my growing up years pining for a mother who gave me away. IT happens! I was perhaps curious but not obsessed. I found my birth family (quite accidently-I wasn't looking) after my adopted parents had passed away. It was not all the drama portrayed in this book. My adopted parents gave me my values and education and though it was nice to find my birth family and answer some questions, it will always be the parents who raised me that will be the best part of my life.I did feel sorry for Dylan and all he had been through and perhaps Jane could have been good for him if she hadn't lied and deceived everyone. She was supposed to be there helping with her mother and instead she was always sneaking off to see her daughter and leaving her sister to handle everything. I was just disgusted with her through the entire book and of course this being a work of fiction, the author made it all come out okay. In real life it could have been and probably would have been a disaster!I have liked some of Luanne Rice's books like The Secret Hour, Summer of Roses, and Dream Country and some have been a bit annoying but this one was so annoying from start to finish that it will take me awhile to try another of her books!"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I found this book very disappointing. Everything was so predictable, I didn't even have to read to the end. Jane was an extremely selfish, self-centered, 35 year old woman. She came home on the pretext of taking care of her mother, yet, that's not why she really came home. She came home to butt into the life of a daughter she gave up at birth and to get into that daughter's uncle's pants. Jane has a younger sister, who has stayed with their mother all these years, pretty much giving up a social life, and her career. Jane supposedly came home to help her, but all she did was leave the sister with more work, and even took her car whenever she wanted without asking. What a selfish character. Anyway, as stated above, the whole story was very contrived and very predictable. What a disappointment. I've read four or five other books by Luanne Rice which I enjoyed very much, but not this one."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I am really enjoying this Luanne Rice book, Dance with Me.

This book was good the second time around too."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"The main thrust of this story deals with a mother being forced to give up her child for adoption. \\"Identity is key\\" Jane says. \\"Even for birds.\\"Romance takes a secondary place to the themes of hurt and pain in this story. Jane and Sylvie were deeply hurt when their father walked out on his family.Also in the background is the role of nursing homes where even a school principal or a banker or a stock broker can find themselves. But it is still possible to go to a barn dance and have some fun!The name of this book was very well suited as in the last lines of the story the protagnist holds out her arms to her lover as music begins down below. \\"Dance with me\\" her eyes seem to say. A touching conclusion."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"College life was a joy for Jane Porter...as long as she had her loving boyfriend by her side. But when she discovered she was pregnant their junior year, Jeffrey Hayden was anything but loving. Jane wanted the baby; Jeffrey wanted his life the way it was. Without the prospect of marriage, Jane's mother Margaret forced her to give her daughter up for adoption.Fifteen years later, Jane is a successful baker, running one of the most well-known spots in New York City. But Margaret's illness forces her to come home to Rhode Island, where her younger sister Sylvie has all but given up her own life to care for their mother.Once she's back in Twin Rivers, Jane becomes obsessed with the idea of getting to know her daughter Chloe. Now a high school student, Chloe was adopted by a local couple. Raised as an only child, Chloe had the companionship of her same-age cousin Isabel -- until Isabel and her mother were killed four years ago. While the Chadwicks have some trouble coping with Chloe's antics now that she's in her teens, her Uncle Dylan finds the girl a godsend, soothing him in the years since the loss of his own family.With summer approaching, Dylan sets Chloe and her friend Mona up in his roadside apple orchard stand...providing a golden opportunity for Jane that she can't believe. She bakes pies and tarts for the girls to sell, all the while beginning a relationship with her daughter. Chloe, of course, has no idea who Jane really is. All she knows is that her uncle's smitten with her...But, as with all things, the truth finally has to come out; and when it does, what will Chloe and Dylan think of Jane's lies?"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I enjoyed Dance with Me. I did, however feel that the end was a little rushed. The story is touching - I felt for all the characters - Chloe for feeling abandoned, Dylan for his grieving, Jane for her lose, Sylvie for her sacrifice, Margaret for health. Luanne Rice writes another beautiful story about the power of love. Read it!!!"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Two families, the Porter's and the Chadwick's, of Twin Rivers, RI, are linked forever by a heartbreaking event some fifteen years prior that has remained largely hidden but has had its effects. Both of the families have suffered through varying crises, but that incident from years before takes on new and dramatic significance in this most sentimental of books.When Jane Porter finally decided to take a sabbatical from her bakery in NYC and return to her childhood home to deal with her traumatic loss from years before, little did she realize that her path of discovery would be so intertwined with Dylan Chadwick, who has been in mourning for many years after having lost his wife and daughter in a shootout on the streets of NYC. But it is Dylan's niece Chloe, a sensitive fifteen year old, who loves nature, is a bit of an animal rights activist, and has a magnetism that defies her years, who becomes the healing force for both Jane and Dylan.Rice's books are not without their troubles. They are full of weepy, anguished moments. Not only do her characters over emote, but also the author can't let the dialog stand on its own. She is constantly compelled to add her own emotion-based spin on what has just occurred. The reader can easily feel that his or her heart is being gratuitously tugged at. An unexpected incident involving the pure Chloe with a bad boy is a guaranteed tearjerker.Yet, despite all of the emotion - grief and anxiety being most common - her good-natured characters seem to find happiness at the end. Flawed characters, facing predictable failure, are not part of her repertoire. Former US marshall Dylan aggressively confronting some teen-age trespassers with a loaded shotgun is not a sign, in the author's depiction, of perhaps some deeper problems.Rice is obviously appealing to a certain audience. For them, her predilection for making precocious children - wise beyond their years - the centerpiece of her stories is a surefire device. Her books are basically a pleasant, though maudlin read. Reading a couple of those a year might not be such a bad idea."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"I don't know what it is about Luanne Rice, but she writes in a way that grabs at the back of your mind and won't let go until the last page is finished and you know the outcome. I liked this story because of the way each character linked with the next. The intimate way their parts are described and their lives explained has you feeling for them each step of the way. You have to keep reading to see how the layers of each person is peeled away until finally they realize the commonality they have.Romantic love is present in this story but it is also a story about parental love. Young love, old love, mistaken love, abused love and new love. Luanne Rice is a big believer in love and that is what keeps me returning to her stories and looking forward to each new book."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Beautiful story, reminded me of &quot;Home Fires,&quot; also by Luanne Rice. The setting for the story was wonderful and the characters were easy to get to know and love. This book could become a great movie!"},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Dance With Me is a family saga romance that ties up multiple couples by the end. It's a story of two sisters. One is fair-haired, spinsterly and dutiful, while the other one is dark-haired, moody, and took off to live in the big city. Good daughter Sylvie has left her school librarian job to care for her failing Mom. Wilder Jane returns to the small town from the big city to lend a hand. This would be enough to make a good story, but Rice also throws in a family in conflict over selling the family farm to developers, an adopted teenage daughter searching for her real mom, and the tragedy of a murdered child. All these conflicts miraculously resolve by the novel's end. Even the mother enjoys her nursing home! The book is set in rural Rhode Island, which provides a well-drawn and somewhat unusual background for the story. This is the first Luanne Rice novel I've read, so I can't compare, but it would have been a better book if it had tried to do less, and did more with that was left. Instead, it's so formulaic that you can't share the characters' joy in their happy ending, because you can see it coming from page 1. Dance With Me is weak even for a beach read."},{"Title":"Dance with Me","review":"Dance with Me by Luanne Rice held my attention throughout the whole story.

Just couldn't put this book down. Harrington illustrates exactly how journalism should be. Every journalist, aspiring or professional, should read this book!"},{"Title":"Wet-Wall Tattoos: Ben Long and the Art of Fresco","review":"I dipped into this book because I'm interested in Italy and wanted to learn a little about fresco technique (but I wanted to learn it painlessly, which for me means tucked inside a narrative instead of laid out in a textbook). But I found that I stayed with the whole story, genuinely interested in the personalities and the outcome of the project, a religious fresco executed in Charlotte, North Carolina in the late 1980s.Clearly Ben Long is a difficult albeit talented man, but just as clearly he seems willing to do what he must to keep fresco alive. We read stories of earlier musicians and artists (Mozart and Renaissance painter Lorenzo Lotto come immediately to mind) who produce a work and present it, uncertain the agreed-upon compensation will be forthcoming or that there will be any at all. Much of Long's work has followed the same pattern: slow, steady execution of a religious fresco, in Italy or the United States, followed by a small &quot;purse&quot; from a grateful priest. The North Carolina project followed by the author in this book was, by design, more lucrative and more modern, but the negotiating, the arguments, the temporary withholding of final compensation, the frayed nerves, the eager acolytes working just for the experience--all of it could have happened 400 years ago. And just when you're starting to realize this, the author deftly segues into the relationship between Pope Julius II and Michelangelo during the frescoing of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.It's refreshing to see such a quiet subject get such careful, journalistic treatment. There are no fireworks here, just a well-told story of interest to those with a fascination with the making of art, with Italy, with fresco in particular, and with the intersection of history and modern times."},{"Title":"Wet-Wall Tattoos: Ben Long and the Art of Fresco","review":"I first encountered Ben Long in 1989 in Raleigh, North Carolinawhen I was working on a television profile of his friend and fellowfresco painter, Charles Kapsner. Ben sat, somewhat reluctantly, I thought, for an interview, and regaled us with tales of their days in Florence. I later joined his circle of associates attending the dedication of the St. Peter's fresco in Charlotte. The sense of inspiration was palpable in the church that evening, Ben's generous and deep nature infusing this great monument to the sacred; later, at a bistro down the street, he stiffed me for a bottle of Wild Horse Pinot Noir. How could one not be charmed by this study in contrasts?By 1990 I had been drawn into his circle, videotaping work at Ben's Paris studio on his next project: the massive fresco triptych which adorns the Bank of America lobby in Charlotte I briefly met Richard Maschal when this book came out, and I found him describing the same man of brilliant mastery, intense commitment and provocative nonsense that I came to know over the span of three years. As painting proceeded at what was then called NationsBank Corporate Center, captains of industry replaced the church hierarchy, and Ben's subject matter moved into secular themes. But the dichotomy of patron and painter remained the same, as Richard so aptly compared to that of Michelangelo and Pope Julius II. At one point Ben's work was halted while Charlotte Powers that Be decided that they understood Ben's desire to make a strong statement about regional heritage, but could not countenance a certain larger-than-life image contained within the center fresco: that of a KKK member smoking a joint. After an enlightening meeting with local African-American leaders Ben gracefully found a way to alter his composition, but at no expense to his vision.Ben has moved onto other equally challenging commissions, but it is the St. Peter's fresco, and its story as related by Richard Maschal, that places Ben Long as a maestro at the fore of an American renaissance of this ancient technique, the genuine article, just beginning to hit his stride."},{"Title":"Wet-Wall Tattoos: Ben Long and the Art of Fresco","review":"Being the author's daughter, I was surprised to find it listed when I took a search on my last name. I was equally surprised to see such a great review!Aside from my obvious inclinations, this really is a great book. Witty, culturally far-reaching, honest, and wonderfully crafted, it is a fascinating portrait of a man who surely mirrors the tempestuous Michaelangelo. Ben Long is a fabulously challenging man, angry, intelligent, even sexy. Read this book and learn about art, religious tradition, and the creative landscape of America ...and I got to pick out the title!"},{"Title":"Wet-Wall Tattoos: Ben Long and the Art of Fresco","review":"I have long been a fan of Ben Long. It was our privilege to see his frescoes back in the 80's after reading a tiny insert in the AAA travel book on Virginia and the Blue Ridge Parkway. At that time, the churches did not have the notoriety they have now and neither did the artist. I thought him a genius then and I haven't changed my mind.This book, written in an easy style for those unfamiliar with Long's work, details the actual process of wet fresco and Long's work from church to bank building. It is bold, frank, and shows Long's flaws and strengths while never delving into the type of 'tell all' you'd get from someone eager to embark on sensationalism. It is well-written and interesting.I still run across people who have never heard of Ben Long or his work. I am quick to tell them to stop off at the many spots down south if they are traveling in that direction, that feature Ben's art work---and I've yet to hear anything but praise when they return!The book came quickly and was in promised condition."},{"Title":"Spawn Book 2","review":"I grew up reading comic books and have always had a fondnessfor them.

The actual texts are cheaper, and I find that I get a fuller experience of the book when I read it myself.David Sedaris is the exception to that rule.Don't get me wrong; I love reading his work. I've read everything I can by him and enjoyed every mintue. The exception is that as much as I enjoy reading his work, listening to him read it is all that much better.Sedaris' voice is perfect; soft and dry like his humor. And since most of these stories and essays are autobiographical in nature, his reading takes on a kind of life that you can't get by reading it, it becomes more like a friend telling an anecdote at a party, it becomes personal.Anybody can be slapstick. Anyone can put on a goofy voice and make you laugh by being silly. David Sedaris gives you more to laugh about, and is all the better for it. When you find yourself laughing out loud at his soft spoken, earnest phrases, you'll laugh some more just because.

Usually when you start readig most works by an author some pale in comparison to others and by the end of the adventure you realize most authors have 'hits' and 'misses' and you should vet a bit more carefully before buying someone's entire collected works.

One does get the sense from some of the stories that Sedaris was cleaning out his bottom drawer to capitalize on the success of his Santaland Diaries by pasting together a book-length work.But Sedaris' reading, with the help of his sister who does the female or young boy parts, makes the book exceptionally funny. The \\"Rooster\\" story is just terrific. I also loved the \\"Homophobia Newsletter\\" as a wonderful bit of irony about those who embrace victim-hood a bit too easily. That and the \\"Rooster\\" made me laugh the most.The alcoholism theme runs in a number of stories and is dealt with the most in \\"Barrel Fever.\\" I found this story to be quite interesting in its use of irony, including the heresy of poking fun at the 12-steppers whose cure is sometimes almost as bad as the disease.These stories are good and the reading even better."},{"Title":"Barrel Fever and Other Stories","review":"This is the best of the best, as far as I'm concerned. \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" will crack up anyone raised in or currently living in the South - we all have known guys like David's younger brother Paul, a.k.a.

This a work that not only offers a critical analysis of the present but also gives us hope for the future."},{"Title":"How brief a candle: Modern man in the insistent dialectic","review":"How Brief a Candle establishes the truth of the existence of God the Creator and the immortality of the human soul. Using procedures of systems analysis, the author has drawn from a multiplicity of disciplines including philosophy, theology, physics, psychology, sociology and mathematics. The history of man's though concerning himself and his relationship to God is traced through the ages, beginning with Plato and Aristotle, right up to our present age.The book demonstrates that a stable society is not possible without a morality based on some theistic system toward which man &quot;stands in awe&quot; (the Hobbesian question). A basis for a sociology of morals - and hence a moral sociology - is formulated. And finally, the author proposes a methodology by which the present decadent world age will be changed, during the next few decades, to bring about a return of the world to a truly human civilization.The &quot;insistent dialectic&quot; is that interior conflict which has existed in man from the beginning - symbolically in the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. Man is split in his view of himself. He wants to be totally independent of any external restraint - free to &quot;do his own thing.&quot; Yet, he realizes that he is in fact constrained by his own limited resources. He does have a master - if not of divine dimensions, then of human dimensions - his own fragility and mortality. He cannot live exclusively in his own image.The book uses two scenarios to display the insistent dialectic. First is that of Nietzche, who wrote toward the end of the 19th century. An atheistic existentialist, he saw the 20th century as a descent into nihilism - man becoming totally anarchistic, having no values in common. Nietzsche saw emerging in the 21st century a &quot;master race&quot; which would tyrannize the rest of mankind into following along like cattle.The other scenario is that of the late great British historian Arnold Toynbee, who consigned the twentieth century to technology but saw the 21st characterized by a return to theistic belief and a period of great spiritual growth. The two scenarios are antithetical and well reflect the insistent dialectic in its modern setting. This modern viewpoint has been of relatively short duration, a brief candle in the history of man.The author believes that while the present situation of the world favors the Nietzsche scenario, there are signs of dissatisfaction with man's view of himself as a &quot;Trousered Ape&quot; or a &quot;Walking Bag of Seawater&quot; - as an intelligen monstrosity in an otherwise fairly satisfactory biolog world. Man is forlorn in his own image - hopelessly flawed in attaining his goals and flawed in his hopelessness of any other.The author sees the denouement of the two scenarios in the realm of major religiously inspired social movements which will arise during the last decade of this century and during the early stages of the upcoming age. God remains the &quot;Master of History.&quot; One way or another, man will serve God - in joy or in anguish. The choice is ours."},{"Title":"Jeane Dixon: my life and prophecies;: Her own story as told to Rene Noorbergen","review":"Jeane Dixon was born with the \\"star of david\\" and a half moon in her palms.

She helped hundred's of kids over the years and established the Children to Children Foundation Inc. She donated ALL of her proceeds that she received from her gift to charity and the foundation. The Roman Catholic church does believe in astrology for all her critics who stated that the church does NOT believe in astrology and that it is evil. As long as one doesn't REPLACE the church with astrology, that is acceptable, quotes Jean. It is when one accepts astrology OVER religion that problems arise. Jeane made a comfortable living in her husband's successful real estate company in Washington D.C.There are hundred's of cases where she would have a vision after hearing a particular word or conversation that she would be having with friends. She worked 12 hours a day and never took a vacation. She was totally devoted to God and let him guide her in all that she did.She stated that all the \\"Revelations\\" that she had were directly from God (sometimes it took years for her to get the complete picture - it took her 20 years to get all the information she needed to write her astrology book, Yesterday, today & forever where she correlates the 12 disciples of Jesus with the 12 signs of the zodiac) and couldn't be changed as they were the will of God..such as the JFK assination which she predicted over 10 years earlier.The \\"visions\\" she saw, in her crystal ball and others places, COULD be altered by man such as MLK Jr. & RFK Jr.'s assinations. Sometimes she stated that her interpretations could be off so that could affect her predications as well.She had about a 90% percent connection with the channel that psychic's have compared to the average person who has about a 7% connection.She had a true gift from God and never tried to use her gift for profit as she felt that was not God's will. Such a great lady and a great story. Well worth reading ten times over."},{"Title":"Jeane Dixon: my life and prophecies;: Her own story as told to Rene Noorbergen","review":"I was looking for books about Jeane Dixon because my Dad had mentioned reading her books in the 1960's. Because of all the political turmoil in the last years, i was curious. I couldnt find anything on her in the public library, so here I am. I truely believe she was gifted by God. She was very genuine and such a devout Catholic and religious person. She took no money for her readings and prophecies, except for her charity to underpriveledged children. I researched a lot of the prophecies she made and the revelations (which cant be changed) and found the accuracy astounding. Anyway, read for yourself, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Jeane Dixon: my life and prophecies;: Her own story as told to Rene Noorbergen","review":"I've been consistently impressed by the top clairvoyants in that they stand for a self-responsibility the 1-800 astrologers would never cater to. While her mantra is \\"we're here to do God's will\\", her practical message is quite the opposite; that your destiny lies in your hands and can never be subjugated to another.I'm glad her prophecies for our time have not come to pass; and hopefully they won't. Nostrodamus had similar expectations for a world war in 1999; perhaps Mankind has changed course to save us all; with any luck, it is not just a postponement.Regardless, this is a great book for the intelligent and will whip into shape those who just want to drift through life and let the stars decide."},{"Title":"The rise of universities (Cornell paperbacks)","review":"Charles Homer Haskins wrote a short but instructive account of the Catholic universities and the Age of Scholastic Learning. As Haskins indicated in this book, there was a plurality of Scholasticism. In fact, he called the phenomenon \\"Scholasticisms\\" Haskins indicated that Medieval Catholic universities were quite informal compared to contemporary structured university systems. Haskins also informed the read that what some call The High Middle Ages was a time of the development of parliamentary political and legal systems, Gothic architecture, the beginning of Big Capitalism. etc.Haskins began this study with a brief description of Catholic university organization. The Medieval University was located where the students and masters (teachers)could rent buildings and arrange accomodations in a city or town. In other words, unlike the modern university campus, there was no campus, no established buidings or grounds, and no specially built facilities. Such European campuses and buildings only began in the late 14th. and 15th. centuries (the late 1300s and 1400s).Haskins informed his readers that what were called universities were actually guilds of masters and students. Both the masters and students had to be well organized to avoid predatory lending, rents, food prices, etc. Merchants and those who profited from university life were economically forced to lower prices, interest rates, rents, etc. The fact was that students and masters could relocate easily. The local businessmen, landlords, bankers, etc. had to figure that a lower profit was better than no profit.There were unique characteristics of Medieval universities. The masters taught basic and advanced classes. The universities were international in that all teaching, learning, and scholarship were done in Latin, and students would be admonished or even fined for not using Latin. Students and masters were not confined to one university. Often students would attend lectures at different universities prior to taking examinations at the University of Paris for example. The use of Latin was so prevalent that the area around the University of Paris was and is called the Latin Quarter.Haskins gave a brief but useful description of the curriculum of Medieval universities. The undergraduate courses were called the Trivium-Rhetoric, Grammar (Latin Grammar, writing, and the classics), and logic. The latter was ususally based on Aristotle's treatises on logic. The Quadrivium consisted of studies of Astronomy, Music (the pensive Gregorian Chant), Plane Geometry, and Arithmetic which may have included algerbra. As some readers may know, these seven areas of study were known as The Seven Liberal Arts. When students successfully finished the complete Liberal Arts curriculum, they could teach the Seven Liberal Arts upon approval of the university chancellor and/or local bishop.Haskins then gave a brief description of more advanced studies which included Law (Canon Law and Secular Law), Medicine, and Theology. The latter was called Queen of the Sciences and could include 16 years of study. As Haskins mentioned, the University of Paris officials took so much pride in their School of Theology that they forbade the study of secular law. The most honored Regeant Master of Theology of the Catholic Church was St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)who attended and then taught at the University of Paris where some historians state he did his best work.Haskins presented the conditions under which masters taught. If a master could not get five students to attend his class, he was fined. Masters had to be thorough and could not end lectures early. The masters at the University of Bologna in Italy had to get student permission for leaves of absence. The masters were fined for lack of punctually and thoroughness of their teaching. Haskins stated that the masters at the University of Paris got organized into a guild or corporation first and could more easily negotiate with organized students.Haskins also presented \\"the other side of the coin\\" in describing student life. Many students were poor and could not afford books. Books were expensive because they had to be hand copied and well bound. Poorer students had to go to the bookseller and rent sections of the texts. One student started studies in theology, and when his father discovered the cost of a Bible, suggested to his son to study something else. Students did not have ready access to libraries. Learning was based on memory and thinking. Books were so scare and costly, that they were loaned. Haskins made the point that later libraries were the depository of masters' lectures which gradually began to increase in size.Haskins gave a good description of student behavior and discipline. Some Medieval students were indeed unruly. Students were required to attend Mass. If students missed class for no bona fide reason, they could be fined and in some cases flogged. Haskins suggets that some students visited the pubs and socialized so much that they figured a whipping was well worth it. Haskins also presented a good account of student poetry and a class of students who could be roughly called the Ordo Vagorum. These were wandering students who never finished the curriculum and had too much fun as \\"professional students.\\" Haskins has brief excerpts of their poetry which should interest readers.Haskins had some interesting comments about academic freedom. What moderns call academic freedom was prevalent in the Medieval universities. A part of academic life consisted of dispuations, and these debates were lively and intelligent. Masters could enter the realm of discovery and new knowledge. However, the masters could not undermine the intellectual authority of past learning. The fear was extreme skeptism which would undermine any a priori foundations. Yet, persecutions and repression were extremely rare according to Haskins. Haskins also stated he could not find one example of a master or student being persecuted for believing in free trade, socialism, non-violence, etc. Such views have resulted in political overtones and repression during the 20th. and now 21st. century. Haskins is also clear that teaching and learning were taken very seriously during the Middle Ages. Politically correct nonsense and sloppy thinking would have been scorned. Learning and reasoned debate were honored which has disappeared from much of contomporay university life. The demand on students to read and think was intense.Haskins confined much of this book to the University of Bologna which may started as early as 1158 if not earlier. According to Haskins, the first Medieval university may have been at Salerno as early 1076. The focus of Haskins' book is the study of the University of Bologna and the University which is enough for the beginning student of Medieval univerities.This is short book, but it is well written. For anyone who wants to know more Haskins provided an excellent bibliography. Haskins' book makes a connenction between Medieval universities and modern universities. Readers should know there is a connection. Unfortately too many \\"experts\\" argue that earlier events and men were from the moon when in fact, they were historical events and individuals who should be studied and appreciated."},{"Title":"The rise of universities (Cornell paperbacks)","review":"Not much has changed since the 13th century. In some ways students were freer in that they had more leeway to choose their professors. On the other hand, especially in Theology and Philosophy departments, the inquisition was a fear near at hand. Haskins seemed to argue that students' freedoms was somewhat equal in the end to now. Getting drunk and wasting time was as much a part of univeristy life (in some circles) then, as now, and the number one issue of students was money -- typically how they can get it from their parents. Most students and their parents expected some vocational, profit making, activity to be the end result of their studies. Some students were serious; some often got drunk, sang, or got in fights, or both; and some wrote poetry and played the guitar. Everyone was expected to speak Latin, despite what their native tongue might be. They learned Latin so they could read works by ancient Roman poets, like Ovid, who also sang praises to being in nature, good times with friends, and playing the guitar. There was also law to study, or various associated studies, which was profitable. Parents didn't encourage their children, very often, to study Theology as there wasn't much money as an end result of it for most. Many interesting details given in his effort.Universities formed, essentially, as a student union to protect their rights against cheating local townspeople and professors. On occasion a whole union of students would leave a town, if they felt cheated, taking their business elsewhere. The Pope, about this time, I think, approved of union formations (which I feel was the death blow to communism in Europe, in the end, and will be in China as well; plus they keep America somewhat safe from being an out and out plutocracy). I don't know if students these days feel themselves part of a union though.Haskins has a very down-to-earth point of view and argues, for whatever purpose, that the modern university owes its direct linage to the universities of the thirteenth century in Europe and he does this with effectiveness and enjoyable, but scholarly, descriptions.Haskins has the distinction of being the father of Medieaval studies in America."},{"Title":"The rise of universities (Cornell paperbacks)","review":"Haskin's text, \\"The Rise of Universities,\\" is fascinating for a number of reasons. First, the story is superbly told in this set of three lectures given in the very early 1920's at Brown University. Second, the insights Haskins inserts at various points of the discourse are worthy of great consideration, and we very easily feel we are listening to someone who is an expert in the subject, one who knows far more than he is telling at the given moment. Third and finally, we realize we are reading a \\"historical\\" book, not just because the subject concerns history, but because Haskin's own role in helping re-introduce the medieval world to a new generation of American scholars was history in the making. His more famous and acclaimed text, \\"The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,\\" was a critical component in doing just that, but here we see Haskins \\"where it all started,\\" in the lecture room at Brown, and we close our eyes and imagine we are sitting in on these discourses exactly as they appeared nearly one hundred years ago.The work comprises three lectures on the medieval university, the first focusing on the earliest universities in terms of their structure, organization, and even linkage to today's universities, the second on the medieval university professor, and the third on the medieval university student. The material is presented in an extremely accessible manner, and one need not be a medievalist or medieval historian to follow the content. Much of the content is simply fascinating to anyone who wonders where today's universities can trace their lineal heritage. We read about the attempt to \\"date\\" the start of the world's oldest universities (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, and others), the differences between \\"northern\\" and \\"southern\\" universities, the specialties of each of the institutions, and the motivations for creating both student and teacher guilds. We also read about issues that faced the medieval professor, including the management of the classroom and its' students, the awarding of degrees, and even a little about medieval instructional techniques. We learn, too, about student life during these years, including the ever-constant quest to find money to finance schooling, the in-town brawls, and the requirements for exiting the university with an official degree. A special \\"extra\\" is the inclusion of some of the poetry written by medieval students and preserved through the years.This is not an in-depth look at the subject, nor was it ever intended to be. (For such a book, try outHistory of the University in Europe: Universities from 1945 to Presentby Hilde de Ridder-Symoens, which, at four volumes, is not only highly detailed, but also current and exceptionally well written.) What it is, though, is an excellent introduction to the topic that still contains many good insights on the topic and is well developed and clearly presented. As such, this book likely has two main audiences: those who wish for an introduction on the topic, and also those who are medievalists and wish to become more acquainted with Charles Haskins himself, a key personage in the field. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The rise of universities (Cornell paperbacks)","review":"this was required text for a sociology course. dont waste your money. my prof. didn't refer to it once. he must have had the same opinion as me."},{"Title":"The rise of universities (Cornell paperbacks)","review":"Although rather brief in terms of length, it is based upon Haskins's three lectures, this book provides an excellent basic source for information relating to the founding and rise of the university in Western Europe.

I would like to comment on the Billectric poem mentioned by the last reviewer.

You'll notice all the stereotypical accouterments: wine, cigarettes, and hanging out in the woods. When Robert Frost comes along, this poser doesn't recognize that Frost is the real thing, by 'taking the road less chosen.' He makes fun of the famous poet, thus demonstrating his ignorance.

There are *several* chapters on this! I'm very impressed so far with their teaching abilities and I appreciate the fact that they give full examples. First the authors cover how to use ASP.NET 2.0's shrinkwrapped solution. Then they give detailed information on how to implement your own custom providers for Memebership and Roles.

ASP.NET 2 is not a complete change from ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 1.0, but rather a few changes and a lot of enhancements. As someone who's been using ASP.NET for a couple of years, I'm finding this book extremely helpful, not only as an introduction to ASP.NET 2.0, but also as a review of ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 1.0. I'm not sure what I would think of the book if I didn't already have some experience, but it seems like a complete review of ASP.NET to me. The authors have done an outstanding job. Every time a question is generated in my mind, the author answers it in the next paragraph. This book is thorough. I'm even updating some of my 1.1 code while I'm reading it.

While we have done a decent bit of classic ASP over the years, prior to 2006 we have not jumped aggressively on the .NET bandwagon. The advent of ASP.NET 2.0 and the growing din of client requests has changed that and we are now focusing on .NET development.Prior to reading this book, I read through the Wrox Visual C# 2005 book to gain a solid footing in C# and .NET in general. I must say that although this book's title begins with \\"Pro\\" I found it to be very accessible to a relative newbie. Familiarity with the aforementioned C#, web development and object-oriented principles in general seemed to be adequate as a primer for the lessons in this book.The authors' ability to convey their obviously strong knowledge of the subject was outstanding - the language was not aimed too high nor was it unnecessarily full of jargon. I found the coverage of database access, rich data controls, session state and caching to be particularly valuable. Another area of great value to ASP.NET 1.1 developers is up-front coverage in each chapter to let them know what has changed in 2.0 from the 1.1 coding model. The breadth of coverage of this book is impressive - I cannot think of a significant topic that was not covered in some way. The authors seemed to focus at length on the most commonly used features of the language - they definitely covered the areas that I know we will be using.One quibble that I have with the book were the occasional typos that made it past the tech checkers/editors. For example, the authors would introduce a new class name or method in a code block and then refer to that same class/method later in the chapter or in later example code with a slightly different name. While I have become accustomed to this in many tech books, I didn't expect to see as many code errors as I saw in a book of this quality.Overall, I rate this book very highly and encourage any web developer that is interested in being productive with ASP.NET 2005 to get this book."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I haven't read any other ASP.NET 2.0 books but don't feel I need to after this one.

Some examples include rollover image user controls, protecting pdf documents in your web directory, tracing soap messages and a nice summary of lifecycles for pages, controls and data binding. It's not exhaustive, but at 1200 pages, it certainly covers more than 90% of what you'd ever need to know.

Now the books are becoming very useful because you can tell the authors are seasoned in Asp.net and have a lot more knowledge on the subject. This book has, so far, answered every question I have had about Asp.net 2.0 and even ones I didn't know I had!

Every single chapter of this book teaches something, even with ASP.Net programming experience."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"This book is choc-full of useful material on ASP.net. A monsterin his category, it contains way more about asp.net than you probably want to know...can be a good reference for the experienced ASP.net developer who is moving to the 2.0 version, or has already read smaller books and played a bit with the technology.What I find aggravating in this title is the bloated and pompous writing style. This being just another clunky web-technology, who are the authors trying to impress? Also, some of the code examples are incorrect or incomplete, clearly due to the fact that this book has been rushed to publication. More material about design would have made this book better and more balanced. Maybe two volumes would have been less intimidating, but definitely more expensive.Don't try this at home if you have never programmed ASP, you will be crushed."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"Be careful, don't get this book for beginer to intermediat topics. I found this book is missing a lot of in depth information on things like webforms etc.if they didn't want to cover it properly then don't include it in the book. it's decieving. if a book says chapter on webforms then it should actualy have a chapter on webforms and not just a few simple useless and incomplete examples.I constantly have to search the web to find what it's missing to do basic stuff. The examples are not very thorough.this book has 34 chapters. does that not seem like an awful lot of stuff to you? how could you really cover topics in detail with 34 chapter?sorry but i don't like this kind of book. i prefer a book that leaves you feeling confident. this one make me feel helpless.I will probably return it!"},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"This is really a good book. The topics covered are intended for the serious developer and the code and examples are excellent. I found the chapters on the data controls and data binding most helpful, there is also a chapter on XML that is really good.You also get a .PDF addition of the book. If you have two monitors on your system you can bring up the sample code in one and cut and paste into your project.The book was a little expensive but well worth it. I would purchase it again."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"This is indeed an excellent book. Very succinct.

When you write a book that is this long, it's usually bloated with material, and there is so much text that it's nearly impossible to get through. With 34 (yes THIRTY-FOUR) chapters, this book is just way way overkill. I don't want to give the wrong impression though, as this book has good content and is an excellent resource for ASP.NET 2.0 developers. If you don't mind crazy large books, then this text might be perfect for you. As it is, I have no qualms recommending this book, I just think if a couple hundred pages were trimmed off, this could have achieved the same goals and been a tighter end result.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I got this book last week and I am so satisfied I felt like writing a review for the first time.I would suggest this book to anyone looking for an intermediate to advanced comprehensive book on the subject.

Very useful considering its 1200+ pages."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I normally shy away from 1000 page books. They tend to contain a great deal of content that are boring, and sometimes redundant.But this book covers ASP.NET, and I don't see how you can cover all aspects of ASP.NET in less that 1000 pages.What I really like about this book is the \\"short and sweet\\" way a subject is covered. I feel like the author spent a lot of effort in determining \\"what exactly do I need to say\\" to explain the subject rather than \\"how much can I say\\".For this reason I feel this book will also make an excellent reference. For example, if you need to refresh your memory on how to implement http modules, the relevant chapter will bring you up to speed quickly. You might want to include other references for additional examples, but this book would be a great first reference.This is definitely not a \\"beginners\\" book, and therefore named \\"pro\\". The book does not cover every possible ASP.NET fact, but I feel the author knows his subject, and knows what is important to know or most relevant."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"This book does an awesome job of hitting everything that is new in ASP.NET 2.0. There is a lot to cover but some how Mathew is able to go into depth on almost every subject.If you are moving from 1.1 to 2.0 this is definitely the book you want to use to get there. He covers everything new in ASP.NET 2.0."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I'll quickly summarize the main parts of this book and provide a recommendation as to whom this book is intended.The book itself is broken out into 6 parts; Core Concepts, Data Access, Building ASP.NET Websites, Security, Advanced User Interface, and Web Services.&lt;ol>&lt;li>Core Concepts covered the basics; Visual Studio, web forms, state management and server controls. A lot of ASP.NET 1.1 rehashing took place here, describing new features with everything else. If you're familiar with ASP.NET 1.x I'd quickly skim through this section.&lt;li>Data Access is a fairly big section covering the new databound controls (gridview, etc) and the new declarative data binding options (object data source, etc).&lt;li>Building ASP.NET Websites is where I expected most of the books content to come from. This section covers the usual new features of ASP.NET 2.0, master pages, themes, skins, and sitemap stuff.&lt;li>Security was a rather large section. It dealt with forms authentication, windows authentication, some of the providers and even custom provider stuff.&lt;li>Advanced User Interface covered custom server controls, design time support for those controls, and web parts.&lt;li>Web Services got into the basics of creating web services and talked about some WSE&lt;/ol>Bottom line: If you're a developer with experience in C# but NOT in ASP.NET and are looking to make the move to web application development in ASP.NET 2.0 then this is a good book for you.If, however, you're an experienced ASP.NET 1.x developer then I'd say skip this book and look for a much more concise reference that discusses the differences and new features of ASP.NET 2.0. I've seen other reviewers glad for the review of 1.1 material in the book but personally I'd rather have a book 1/3 or 1/4 the size of this with just the facts, as it were.It seems the distinction between the Beginning and Pro versions of this book are with respect to how well you know the title language, at least that's what I took away from reading the book jacket.1200 pages is a lot to get through, but I did, so the language and flow of the book were decent and it seemed to be well edited as I don't remember many explosions over poor grammar or spelling.&lt;/div>"},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I first purchased this book, as I normally do, to read on a not so well documented part of ASP 2.0 but I quickly became very interested to read the rest of the chapters and it was not long that I went through the whole book which is a rare occurrence for computer books. The book is written to both satisfy the person who is looking for a particular topic or for one who is interested in complete technology overview. Chapters are grouped into well related sub sections which make reading a lot easier and more logical. The only shortcoming of the book was its lack of complete working examples. Although the book has many examples, they are not complete and some don't work. I highly suggest downloading the examples from the publisher's website to get a better understanding of these examples. Overall a great book on ASP 2.0 and a must for any library."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I was out of touch with .NET programming as was doing classic ASP project.

I found the Cryptography and Deployment section which explained the differences between IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0 very helpful.However, I not only like reading the concepts, but writing the code to see it work. It was difficult to take that approach with this book. The connection between the concepts and the presentation of the code examples were often scattered. I found this frustrating."},{"Title":"Pro Asp.net 2.0 in C# 2005","review":"I am very familiar with ASP.Net 1.1 and was looking for a book that would take me into 2.0. This book has done an excellent job. Most of the changes from 1.1 to 2.0 are clearly outlined throughout the book. I actually learned some features that existed in 1.1 from reading this book.The text is very easy to follow and the examples show exactly what needs to be shown, but no more than needed to get the concept.The new features in ASP.Net 2.0 are very well documented. They do a great job of highlighting the way it was done in 1.1 vs 2.0.Great book. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to dive into ASP.Net for the first time or upgrading from 1.1 to 2.0. Well done."},{"Title":"My Visit To Venus","review":"T. Lobsang Rampa is a legendary spiritual leader whose gifts to humanity have continued to offer his readers a true and trustworthy vision of the wondrous worlds that lie just within reach of our own. More than 20 years after his death, Rampa's writings still manage to touch the heart with their uncannily realistic stories about the Astral Plane, the marvels of outer space, and the beauty of the Tibet he loved so much.\\"My Visit To Venus\\" is an excellent example of Rampa's unique genius. It begins with a section of commentary by well-known researcher and author John Keel. Keel gives the reader a short course in Rampa's life story, including the engrossing tale of how Rampa became what may have been the first modern case of the Walk-In phenomenon. How a struggling British writer was transformed into a venerated New Age teacher and spiritual adventurer is beautifully told by Keel in his customary wonderful prose. A general history of the abduction phenomenon through the millennia is also included, which helps put Rampa's experiences in the context of mankind's age-old hand-in-hand stroll with the unknown.Next comes an introduction by Gray Barker, one of the early pioneers of UFO research. Barker discusses his decision to publish some of Rampa's earlieset work and gives a detailed account of the controversy that accompanied the publication of \\"The Third Eye,\\" Rampa's first book. Both Tibetans and the British media were up in arms about it, calling it a fraudulent piece of work and claiming that Rampa had never been to Tibet at all. Rampa answered his critics by saying that while he had never been there in his present body, the spirit of a Tibetan lama had entered his body under unusual circumstances. Barker's introduction also includes testimony from Rampa's wife as to the reality of the extreme personality changes in Rampa after the lama had moved in.From that fascinating beginning, the book moves on to Rampa's own telling of the tale, which this time around features a journey to Venus, as the title implies.Rampa is on a journey, accompanied by a few fellow lamas, to meet with the beings that are telepathically leading them on. After a freezing trek through a Tibetan mountain range, they come to a warm and blissful garden called The Hidden Land. There they encounter a deserted flying saucer sitting on the ground, which they enter and explore.Soon they meet an alien Rampa calls The Tall One, who briefs them on their coming tour through outer space, the real purpose of their journey. Instead of describing the experience as warm and fuzzy, sweetness and light, Rampa talks frankly about the terror he feels as he is surrounded on all sides by such \\"high strangeness.\\" That is another aspect of the abduction experience he shares with the more recent spate of modern abductees--one's initial reaction to the alien presence is nearly always one of fear.But after those first moments of fright, Rampa and his friends traverse the heavens on a flying saucer and witness all the beauty of an alien paradise on Venus. In all fairness to Rampa, it isn't really necessary that the location is literally the planet Venus. It could be anywhere in any universe and the message would still be the same--heaven is waiting for those who are ready to go there.You can read \\"My Visit To Venus\\" in one sitting, but its positive effects may last you a lifetime."},{"Title":"My Visit To Venus","review":"I have read that this book even thou was written by Lobsang Rampa was not published by his consent.I understand it was part of the book cave or wisdom of the ancients.Typical lobsang work,unbeleavable but plausable.As a race we know little.I believe there is more to life,and this book could possibly be a peak into reality however how unreal it all seems.There isnt much content, but the manuscript and pictures more than make up for this.Food for thought.A good read."},{"Title":"My Visit To Venus","review":"Very nice book- Definately belongs to TLR.

The characters and situations are so real, so engaging. I like that they are people who fight their own shortcomings, that they're flawed and imperfect and that their lives are full and messy and complicated. Things turn on small events like the flu or bad weather, just like in real life. I really enjoyed this and am now going to read Ms. Gutcheon's other books."},{"Title":"Domestic pleasures","review":"Beth Gutcheon has written a contemproary masterpiece about life and love in the 90's.

Of course, it wasn't until after I finished the book that I realized that the star rating was based on only 8 reviews.I found this book to be a fine read. Something you bring to the beach. Usually I bring to the beach eithera. a good who-done-it / lawyer type book (think Grisham, Patterson, or Scottline) orb. something I would deem a chick book. A novel with interesting characters and a decently amusing plot where the main character is usually a woman I can relate to and a potential romance will most definitely be covered somewhere in the story.This book falls under category b., the characters are easy to like and are interesting enough that you want to know what happens to them next, and there is a romance, but the overall plot I found to be somewhat boring making me wonder, &quot;why I am still reading this&quot;.

You will like it enough, but there are just a lot of better choices out there for the beach."},{"Title":"Domestic pleasures","review":"Wow. That's all I have to say. DOMESTIC PLEASURES is one of the best books I've read this year. I'm ashamed to say it's my first by Gutcheon, but it won't be the last. I've just now ordered all the rest of her books and am looking forward to many hours of reading pleasure, although how she can top PLEASURES, I don't know. As an author myself, I know how difficult it is to handle as many story lines, characters, and relationships as Gutcheon gave us in this book. Not to mention writing from the point of view of such different ages. And Gutcheon has done both so beautifully. From page one, I was hooked by the characters and their lives. Martha and Charlie, Sophie and Connie, Phoebe and Jack, baby Fred and Gillis, Patsy and Molly and Ruth and William and Dave. I don't think I'll ever forget them. I was so caught up in their lives, I didn't want the book to end. Gutcheon is a marvelous writer. Not only did she make me cry a few times, she made me laugh over and over again. Her dialogue is so good, I wanted to smack her! &lt;g&gt; Okay, that's because I am jealous. I'd love to be able to write dialogue that clever and witty and real. Bravo, Ms. Gutcheon.

Their relationship, as it grows -- and grows apart -- is deftly and believably handled, as is the relationship between her dad and his mom.

I'm not the only one either, the hardcover edition I read has glowing reviews from Pat Conroy, Rosamunde Pilcher, and Rita Mae Brown on the back cover. This is quality writing. The characterization, dialogue, the various complex story lines are all very well done.

Raymond Gaver's plane goes down in the Santa Cruz mountains and his attorney, Charles Leveque, must deliver the news of Raymond's passing to various friends, business associates and most importantly to Raymond's ex-wife and son, Martha Gaver and Jack.However, Martha is no fan of Charles since he was also Raymond's divorce attorney and Martha was treated very badly during the divorce proceedings by her ex and the attorney, Charles. In this new world, with Raymond gone, Charles is the administrator for the trust set up for Martha and Raymond's son, Jack. Martha must go to Charles for anything that she needs for Jack; an unpleasant task for her.Martha and Charles develop a relationship after several meetings and their relationship sets off a series of stories of secondary characters that are a part of both of their lives. The author interweaves the other stories brilliantly into the relationship that surrounds Martha and Charlie. I found this book reminiscent of Maeve Binchy novels.The challenges of relationships and the hope that can come in the aftermath of loss are wonderfully portrayed inDomestic Pleasures : A Novel."},{"Title":"Domestic pleasures","review":"When Raymond Gaver's plane crashes enroute from LA to NY, Charlie Leveque, his attorney, is the one to tell Raymond's ex-wife Martha. Martha, who remembers hating Charlie for his role in turning her world upside down in the divorce from Raymond.And now she discovers that he is the executor of the estate and the one to whom she must address financial requests for her son Jack.Sorting through the detritus of a life abruptly ended brings these characters in close proximity with one another, and then, almost by accident, Charlie and Martha become friends. She begins to understand that he is not to blame for how Raymond tore her life apart, and, in fact, he has gone through his own divorce and is left trying to figure out how to raise his teenage daughter Phoebe. They realize they have more in common than they thought.As their relationship begins to change and they become close, they discover that, as it turns out, their children are tight friends, who may be more than friends. Instead of making life easier, this complicates things.The journey of these characters in forging their new lives, separately, and later together, is beautifully wrought, set against the backdrop of Manhattan life with all of its complexities.Gutcheon has a unique talent for showing us what life looks like in Manhattan in the 1990s, and especially how to navigate life after divorce in these times. She is brilliant at dialogue, showing us the delightfully awkward movements of adults discovering new love, just as she also takes us right into the world of teenagers, with all their funky behaviors and appearances. We begin to see each of the characters; we hear what they hear and chuckle at their flaws, foibles, and missteps. Here is an excerpt that spotlights some of the issues for Martha and Charlie:\\"Martha looked doubtful. She was so tired she could hardly remember why it was she couldn't just fall into his arms and go to sleep. Why couldn't they just tell the children to behave themselves? Think of the pleasure of cooking breakfast together for all three children, of going to bed together two nights in a row, of going to the supermarket together and deciding together what to cook, of taking a walk together without having to arrange baby-sitters or take three subways to get to each other to do it. Think of sitting together in lamplight after dinner, reading and looking forward to going upstairs to bed together, instead of looking forward to going out in the rain, getting in a cab, and going sixty blocks to sleep alone.\\"We meet other characters along the way, like Sophie, Charlie's ex-girlfriend, and her sister Connie, whose marriage is falling apart. These characters intersect with the others, almost randomly, but their appearances somehow shape and redefine the lives of our major players.But what obstacles will appear to seemingly derail their lives? How do the complexities of sharing their domestic lives somehow prevent or complicate those ordinary moments? And how, finally, will each of them sort it all out so that the domestic pleasures can be accessible to them?I lovedDomestic Pleasures : A Noveland thoroughly enjoyed savoring the lives of such colorful and real characters that made me root for them, and long for their victories, even as they struggled. There were humorous and sad moments, just as there are in real life, in this memorable tale that I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys touching, piercing stories of love lost, found, and embraced once again.

Virtually every page of book titles and listings has at least one glaring error. In the area of juvenile series books it is both incomplete, full of errors, etc. Examples are easy to find- Border Boys Series incorrectly dates the publishers, Bobbsey Twins description woefully incomplete, Battleship Boys lists only a few of the titles in the series and does not mention the first publisher which was Altemus, Airship Boys Series fails to note all of the books and both of the publishers. These mistakes are just on the pages I glanced at for series books. I suspect the same errors of commision and omission exist for many other books. Get yourself Mattson's guide for series books and do your own research for anything else. This book does have a nice glossy cover. Totally form over substance."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"Rhomatum/Mauritum seems like its going to be a fascinating world. The history of the two cities, the difference in philosophies of the Rings, the mysterious other races-- it's a good set-up. The exploration of the world happens through the eyes of the three brothers of the Rhomatum ruling family, driven by their conflicts with each other and with their Aunt (the villain of the piece).The book was a slow start, at least in part because the author seemed determined to get all the elements of the world in at once. While the interaction between the brothers is well-written and fresh, some of the plot points are rather hackneyed and the motivations of the other characters don't seem nearly as considered or complex.Despite the flaws, the book has a lot of potential, so really call it a 3+. I plan on reading the next."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)If you survive boredom, this book will cause you much anger.The plot is good, an intricated dynastic struggle set in a strange Renaissance-like world where guns and a sort of magical electricity coexist with a rather primitive economy based on agriculture and commerce. As a matter of fact the setting is one of the main assets of this book, especially for readers who like long complex stories. Many realistic details are given about an economy which counterposes educated and extremely selfish and short sighted merchants, living in the big cities and matter of fact, loyal farmers.All the main characters, not only the three brothers, are well rounded and interesting, even if I feel like complaining about their being -just a trifle too- much bigger than life: the Rhomandi brothers quarrel like teenagers and their aunt is an old unbearable harpy they should have learnt to avoid since childhood: no sensible person, having enough wealth as they have, would be willing to endure her.If the development of characters is a little flawed, a problem shared by many fantasy authors who seem incapable to develop an entertaining story without exaggerating and one rather easy to overlook, Ms Fancher achieves her worst with her writing.Many pages are well written, fast, thrilling or hilarious: the author clearly knows her job. Unfortunately she decided her volumes had to find a second use as bricks: of the 560 pages, at least 200 could have been cut with no prejudice for the quality of her work.Have you ever tried to pour tap water into your favourite drink, let's say a costly french wine? Ms Fancher did exactly this. Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"I have read all three books and they have been among the best I have read. But whether or not you will find it just as good depends on what you're looking for. For those of you looking for a quick, light, and amusing read, these books might not be what you're looking for. The plots in this story are extremely intricate, and the characters even more so. This isn't to say that the plots develop slowly. Although they are intricate, they aren't inappropriately long or drawn out. Fancher paces the changes in the story perfectly - she waits long enough to allow anticipation to build up, but doesn't wait too long. Even so, someone who is looking for a quick and dirty read may very well loose patience with these books. And these books are definitely not recommended for those who like simplistic, black and white characters and plots.But for those of you looking for a dense and profound read - one that will draw you in and absorb you completely - then the Dance of the Rings series is highly recommended for you. The depth of the characters in the story is astounding, and their personalities are so unique and different from one another that it is hard to believe that they were created by the same author. This is no fairly tale story with clear boundaries between good and evil either - Fancher seems to revel in presenting complexities and ambiguities, and these weave into the story in interesting and unexpected ways. The world Fancher presents is well illustrated, but she won't bore you with the overly-detailed political intrigues of an unfamiliar fictional world like some fantasy authors do. She puts just as much time into developing the personal lives of the characters, which many readers - like myself - find more interesting.Overly simplistic stories bore me, so I was delighted to finally find a story which had plenty of substance for me to munch on. The only thing which confused me at first is that one of the characters is ambiguous in gender (which is where the gay theme comes in), but I caught on as I kept reading. But overall, Fancher blew me away. When I finished the last book the only thing I could think was *Wow*"},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"Jane Fancher's RING OF LIGHNING is a promising start to a potentially thrilling trilogy.

But developmentally, the land could be seen as a somewhere-else version of Regency England. Carriages are lightened by ley-powered balloons but drawn by animal power; medical advances are limited and not out of line with the kind of one-on-one warfare practiced; and politics wear a courtly smile on the sleeve but often have a poisoned dagger of the tongue lurking.Family relationships are vital here, and Fancher gives them a good, sometimes unsettling, very occasionally rather convoluted play. Three brothers stand as potential heirs to their grand great-aunt, who controls the tower and fascinating Rings that harness ley power -- science mixed with psychic skills. The old a combination of the harridan, raddled old Countess in Pushkin's QUEEN OF SPADES and an aged but unrepentant Lucrezia Borgia. That her poisons are of the mind, usually, doesn't mean they're any less compelling. She loves power and means to hold it as long as there is breath in her body and perhaps even after. And she can strike with all a snake's power and swiftness, as when she throws one of the brothers to hell and gone with her ill-used powers, out of the city and into terra incognita.The brothers themselves are an interesting trio - Deymio, Khyel and Nikki. Their mother and father are both dead, and we soon learn that their thoroughly confused psyches and between-bro relationships are very much due to dear old but not so dear Dad ... and that mother was as much a victim as they. Working out their destinies is uphill work, despite all the good will they may have. But then, aren't family troubles always the worst and hardest to negotiate?Within this setting of power, intrigue and policy, of communications between citystates and political bravos, there are unsettling hints of other powers at work -- and they may not be at all human ...A good read, a well-written book and a fine character study, RING OF LIGHTNING is for the thinking fantasy fan."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"Fancher's book suffers from its excess mental intrigue. While ordinarily a book uses people's thoughts to help readers become more engaged with its characters, this book tries to move its story along by throwing heaps of semi-relevant thoughts at its readers. Unsurprisingly, this leads to a very slow book with plenty of extraneous writing. Perhaps its most irritating facet lies in the continual mental posing of its three main characters, whose interests consist of mostly petty hatreds and fears that continually get rehashed just when it seems the dynamics of their relationship have moved on to a new stage.Other parts of this book are also pretty awful. When the oldest brother finally has his confrontation with his crazy aunt the verbal exchange between the two comes off as an argument between a couple of 8 year-old kids in the schoolyard.While I had no expectations of this book, somehow it still managed to really disappoint me. Very little about this book is worthy of praise as, added to the failures I have already mentioned, it fails to resolve any of the conflicts which drive the story and has absolutely no sense of closure at all. I give it two stars because it develops an interesting world and has a few moments that are actually engaging, enough that I finished reading the book despite its many, many failings."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"The Ring of Lightning was built on a potentially good premise- a dysfunctional family using Rings of Power to remain in command. Unfortunately this potential is largely squandered in the book's fluffy and unexciting subplots and lack of a coherent vision.The portrayal of character relationships among the Rhomandi is the best part of the book. The rest of the plot doesn't have much to it, including an unexciting subplot about a 'leythium' creature (leythium is an electricity-like energy that is the basis of the Ring's power). The deux ex machine ending also disappointed.All in all, there are much better fantasy books to read (eg LOTR, EarthSea series, His Dark Materials by Pullman). You could possibly buy this book, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"This is the first book in Fancher's second trilogy, Dance of the Rings. These books are fantasy, and are just the kind of book I like. They are well-written, which is of fundamental importantce. They are character-driven, focusing on the relationships among three brothers - all well-conceived, distinct individuals with strengths and weaknesses. They are tightly plotted, and well paced. Throw in a society powered by ley lines and people trying to discover electricity in competition with the ruling class, and you have enough conflict and dramatic tension for any purpose. These books are out of print and thus available only from used book sellers, sometimes at very high prices. Fancher is, however, in the process of making them available as ebooks at very reasonable prices through Closed Circle Publications, an internet site she runs with C.J. Cherryh and Lynn Abby to reintroduce their back list into the market."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"The first paragraph of this book is a forewarning that history is a recording of two steps away from the facts through a narrow perspective. And wow does this book throw bunch of perspectives into your face. Okay, maybe just three, and then four by the end, but I have never read a book where you really get into the eyes and mind of the focal characters. Most 3rd person narrations skims the ego and id of the various characters but in Ring of Lightning you are privy to their thoughts, angsts, anger, helplessness, desperations, uncertainties, suspicions, and deepest regrets. The story is of three brothers who are political heirs to a powerful city and its satellites. The two eldest, Deymorin and Mikhyel, are estranged while both loving the youngest brother, Nikaenor, to the point of suffocation.The story starts out told from the perspectives of Deymorin who view Mikhyel as prudish, priggish, and puppet of their great aunt, the powerful \\"ringmaster\\" whom the city depends upon to control the \\"leys\\", a source of energy aka oil/electricity. Mikhyel has essentially raised Nikaenor since their parent?s death. Both Deymorin and Mikhyel can't see Nikaenor beyond as a child and treats him so despite his protest. Nikaenor loves both Deymorin and Mikhyel and tries to be peacemaker between them, desperate for a \\"family.\\" When their great aunt decides that none of the brothers would make adequate \\"ringmasters\\" she takes a different course of action and thus setting into motion of point of no return for the brothers; either they work together or be permanently splintered from one another. We are then allowed into Mikhyel's perspectives which are devastating and sad. Ring of Lightning is essentially a character study of all three brothers and their relationship to one another. It is rather intense.Right now I'm having a difficult time finding the sequel Ring of Intrigue. I can't wait to read the continuing saga of the brothers and the feisty Kiyrstin, her impromtu assassination attempt is one of the funniest I've read. Still, I have a sinking feeling that the author is far from done when it comes to Mikhyel's emotional pain."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"This book's focus centres on the three Rhomandi brothers Deymorin, Mikhyel, and Nikaenour and how they eventually - by way of a burgeoning psychic awareness of one another and their animosity towards their great aunt Anheliaa's plans for extending and maintaining the city of Rhomatum's influence upon neighbouring satellites of the Ley-web - discover that their suspicions of one another have been ill-founded ( due to a long term communication breakdown ), and that all three working together are a living Ley-node.The bedrock of this narrative is the usage of intense viewpoint to convey the psychological and motivational aspects of the brothers' concerns. Much is made of the Nikaenour character in respect to his own view of Deymorin and Mikhyel, and as a hub by way of which Deymorin and Mikhyel consider each other and Nikaenour, in conjunction with Anheliaa's influence on all of them. But in the end though, Deymorin's misconceptions about Mikhyel are probably the most poignant, as they have been the seed of the brothers' mistrust of one another to greater and lesser extents.As a backdrop to all this is the city of Rhomatum, which was founded by the brothers' ancestor Darius some three hundred years previously. A city born from Darius' vision: \`Today I looked into the rings and saw a new and better world'. And so it was that Darius built a tower upon a leythium-node wherein he set in motion a set of giant rings composed of leythium and silver from which the power of Rhomatum was established: a power that is the source of conflict between the resident ring-master Anheliaa and everyone else.A lot of the interconnections in this book are quite understated by conventional standards, making the wheels-within-wheels elements of the story a little hard to keep track of as the story evolves and unwinds. I found it really had to be read at least twice to get a better impression by way of hindsighted forewarning. Which for a book of this length is saying something, since from my point of view, it takes an interesting and engaging one for me to read once."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"Not everything is what it seems in Jane Fancher's Ring of Lightning. The first point of views you experience is that of the oldest and the youngest Rhomandi brothers. Their thoughts give you two colored perceptions of their city and their middle brother, Mikhyel. However, as the story unfolds and you see their world through the eyes of other characters, your perceptions change. You find yourself sympathizing with Mikhyel. I found him becoming my favorite character in the book, followed closely by Dancer, the mysterious protege of Mother. And who is Mother? A creature who has taken an interest in the Rhomandi brothers. This is fantasy as it's meant to be written. No elves, no magic spells or wizards, no dragons. Just a character driven piece with attention to the small things that make you feel this place exists, these people exist.If you like CJ Cherryh, or Siege by Lynn Abbey, you'll like Jane's Ring series. Pick up the first book and you'll be hooked. Oh, and tell Mother I sent you!"},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"The set-up in Ring of Lightning is quite interesting. Three brothers separated by politics and family conflict, cities powered by magical energies, looming international and internal conflict over the source and use of those magical energies, eldritch beings taking an interest in human doings, historical mysteries, an eighteenth-century style setting . . . This book was a decent read, as there was a certain amount of action and intrigue to draw you in and the characters were interesting enough to make you care about whether they would sort out their problems.However, the story can be turgid at points, as events are continually reexamined from every character's point of view with the all concomitant wondering about motives, possible courses of action, etc.There's also the issue of the next two books in the series. If you like Ring of Lightning, you may be severely disappointed by its sequels, as I was. They never fulfil the promise of Ring of Lightning in terms of plot, and descend into psycho-sexual/romantic personal dramas.So, the first book is worth a look, but maybe you should read reviews of the sequels first to see if you really want to tackle this series as a whole."},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"Three very different brothers, whose fate is very much intertwined, in a world powered by ley lines and politics reminiscent of C.J.Cherryh and Marion Zimmer Bradley crossed with Lois McMaster Bujold. I came to care very much about each of Fancher's characters, human and nonhuman alike. Plenty of action and adventure as well, making this book such a page-turner that I just couldn't put it down!. --Margaret Adamson Fincannon"},{"Title":"Ring of Lightning (Dance of the Rings)","review":"This is a very good first book in this series. I thought the politics and intrigue was great. The family ties and confilics was really great. This book was a great read.. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"Kaufmann's WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE is a neglected classic of twentieth-century moral realism. His analyses are succinct, searing, insightful, and superb. Anyone who takes seriously the philosophical tradition of critical thinking should read this challenging masterpiece."},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"Kaufmann's personal books are not just about philosophy. Rather, they might be better described as self-help book, with advice coming from an accomplished philosophy professor well-versed in literature and religion. While his The Faith of a Heretic had a religious context, Without Guilt and Justice has an ethical one. He begins by describing what he calls decidophobia: the unwillingness of individuals to take responsibility for their lives. Kaufmann also describes the strategies people use to avoid this responsibility. But Kaufmann does not offer any simple-minded alternative: It is the whole thrust of his analysis to show how difficult it is to make fateful decisions in a responsible manner. But the problem with decidophobia is that it leads to an inauthentic life: the decidophobe is far from living in a land of ignorant bliss. In his more philosophical chapters, Kaufmann discredits the notions of retributive and distributive justice. Kaufmann summarizes, The concern with desert looks to the past, but it is more fruitful to consider the future. The rejection of justice allows the individual to disown guilt, an unproductive feeling that mires the individual in the past. Kaufmann then explores what his analysis means for the individual. For someone expecting a purely abstract philosophical discussion of ethics, this is where Kaufmann takes an unexpected turn. Ultimately, for Kaufmann, ethics is not just about living harmoniously with society by applying the golden rule (an overrated precept in Kauffman's opinion)-but rather it should be about what an individual should do with her life in an active way (what some might call self-actualization). For the autonomous individual, the choice is essentially two-fold: the detachment of Nirvana or a creative life. Kaufmann's sympathies lie with creativity (combined with service to humanity), and Kaufmann's most vital points concern the importance of creativity. This is an excellent book, although his The Faith of a Heretic is even better."},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"This remarkable book covers a lot of ground. From a new term coined Decidaphobia (and its' various behavioural strategies), to a broad rejection of justice as the backbone of our moral foundation, leading to the dismissing, of all things, GUILT! Why, you ask, should we eliminate guilt? From Kaufmann himself: &quot;Guilt feelings are a contagious desease that harms those who harbor them and endangers those who live close to them. The liberation from guilt spells the dawn the autonomy.&quot; And it is at this point in the book that Kaufmann really takes off about alternatives to decidaphobia, justice, and guilt. I'd rather not give away his complete book in a review however!Frankly, this stuff should be a first year phylosophy requirement. Really has a good chance to connect with younger readers in the beginning of the book with his discussions of decidophobia (ie, are you wasting your moral life).Please email me if you've read this review and can give me some feedback!"},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"This book is soooo clear. I felt upon reading it that I had found the words I have so long sought. This is a remarkable application of the consequenses of Nietzche's philosophy. Kaufmann has obviously done a fair share of his oun thinking over the years. In fact, it reminds me of Nietzche: &quot;We should spend less time in relentless activity and more time in relentless thinking.&quot; Kaufmann is simply relentless!"},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"This is not a book for the lightweight or fainthearted. It is steeped in philosophy and historical precedent. One is left, if not in full ageement with the author, at least swayed considerably. Books such as these are refreshing and delightful.I hope it is reprinted again and again.The copy I received was in excellent condition.Father Thomas Doyle"},{"Title":"WITHOUT GUILT AND JUSTICE","review":"Kaufmann, Nietzsche's foremost expositor, and best English translator, brings his own considerable philosophical skills to play in this volume.It is true that some of his specific references, such as the \\"alienation\\" of mid-20th century psychology, or his riffs on Solzhenitysn, may be dated.But his core arguments certainly are not.Kaufmann spends a fair amount of time turning a withering moral eye to retributive justice, and another withering logical and existential eye to the idea of proportional justice, and various related ideas.Hence his title \\"Without Guilt and Justice.\\" Kaufmann argues convincingly that neither idea can be logically generated within an overarching system of morals. One can almost see John Rawls being ground to grist between the millstones of Kaufmann's cogitating.But, this is small confort to humanists who would argue that an enlightened system of morality exists without religion. Instead, Kaufmann is saying that ALL systems of morals, no matter their metaphysical base or antimetaphysical base, are existential in nature. As for particular moral terms like \\"guilt\\" and \\"justice,\\" without specifically referencing Wittgenstein, Kaufmann's argument appears to be that they are part of the language games we play."},{"Title":"KATIE MORAG S ISLAND STORIES(CO-E","review":"This book contains 4 stories of Katie Morag, a littel girl who lives in one of the Scottish outer islands.

I started reading it even before I left the store and was quickly claimed by it's messages.

I increased the font size as far as it would go, but it was still nearly impossible to read. Well, I thought, it looks like those particular pages were transfered to the kindle format as graphics, not text, but I really liked this book so I bought it anyway. I decided those summary pages weren't critically important. Once I had the whole book, though, I saw that the first paragraph of each chapter had the same problem. So did many of the paragraphs at the end of the book where the sample horoscopes are described. And last of all, all the tables and the end of the book are also unreadable.

Her observations of character, at least her descriptions of traits associated with ascendants, are sometimes astute. However, the reader should be warned that Goodman's book does not allow you to accurately calculate your ascendant. To do so, you must know the exact time and precise degree location of your birthplace--Goodman's chart is not accurate enough because it merely estimates degree. For example, according to Goodman's chart, I am Libra Ascendant; however, computer calculations indicate that I am Virgo Ascendant.

Her descriptions are very excellent and I found myself leaving this book with the Host(ess) and buying another copy.Now as a student of Astrology I found this book equally useful. She has compiled so much good information into one text. I have shown it to my Teacher who was equally impressed. For many a person this book will truly be 'The Only Astrology book you'll ever need'!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"Its amazing and well worth over what I paid for it. It is truly detailed and very informative. I think that it is indeed the only Astrology book I will ever need!!! Wonderful book and only waited 2 days before receiving it!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This is good for a new beginner , and everyone who wants to read it as leisure ,but if you are advanced astrology you may skipped this. I feel entertained while I read it."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I love this book. It is easy to follow unlike many other books I have bought. It has so much information and it is so informative. I didn't even pay attention when I bought it that it came with a CD for your entire astrology chart! I would recommend this book to anyone who like to read about astoroloy and the entire zodiac. Buy it you will love it!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This is the second copy of this book that I've owned. I love it. Its the only astrology book that is pretty true towards describing each sign, and the personality traits affixed to each that I have come across thus far. The charts in the back of this book are easy to read and are spot on. I have done so many charts for people using this book! You can read up on your findings after you have deciphered what planets were in which sign at birth. Its a great tool, and an even greater read. This was my first astrology book, and although I've read and now own others, this is still my go to when it comes to astrology."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book was in really good condition for being used. It came with a CD to compile your natal chart. It was easy to do, very simple. The book has a few areas that I believe could have gone into more detail and explanation. It isn't really the ONLY astrology book you'll ever need because of that fact. It is great for people who are just starting out with their natal chart. It is easy to read, but it does take some time to read and understand your chart. I took time away from it, went back to it, and found some new exciting information. It never gets old. It can always re-peak your interest. I would recommend it to others who would like to have a collection of astrology books. Alone, it is fun and informative but I myself would like to own a couple more books because it lacks detail in the areas of aspects, conjunctions, sextiles, squares, trines and the like."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I absolutely love this book. Any time I don't understand something in astrology I usually grab my book. I'm still a newbie to astrology but I enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"As a professional astrologer, I can definitely say that this is not the \\"only\\" astrology book you'll ever need; however, it is a great start and gives a broad overview of the basic tenets. This book is not for the professional, but after reading it, the beginner will be educated on the basics in a very organized way."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I have taken classes in Astrology and am fairly knowledgeable. However, I feel very empowered having this book because it is so much more detailed. It described me to a \\"T\\" and I look forward to gaining insights on others by using it."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I just received this book a few weeks ago and am really enjoying using it along with a few other astrology books that I bought in order to dive head first into learning astrology. It is a great help in getting a very rich picture of the different ways to interpret the locations of the planets in a natal chart.This book focuses on interpretation, and walks you through the pieces of a natal chart and helps you in interpreting each piece in a variety of ways. First Sun Sign, then Moon sign then the planets and so on. The book includes a CD which will cast a chart for any specific date, and the CD does not offer interpretations. This is actually a good thing, because as a student of astrology I have had caught myself relying on the interpretations printed out with certain natal chart programs. This program allows you to rely on your own abilities to look up meanings and interpret the chart yourself.For those low tech types there are charts in the book that show where the planetoids are located on certain dates and times and they have about a 200 year range. This will allow you to cast a chart by hand if the need arises.P.S. When you read the reviews for this book please take note of their dates as this book has changed a lot from when it was reviewed years ago. Some of the information in those older reviews simply isn't true anymore."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"The book was in very good conditions thanks ! It did take a very long time to get to me but it was worth the wait"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"In print for nearly two decades, The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need truly stands up to its title. However, should you plan to make a career as an astrologer you will, of course, need further study. Beginning with the Sun signs and moving on through the remaining planets, as well as more obscure influences such as the Ascendant, Moon signs, Decanates and Cusps of each sign, the book is well thought out and the information presented in a logical and orderly manner In addition the author explains the steps necessary to erect a chart in simple terms.Without including any un-necessary information Woolfolk includes everything that you need to get a decent idea of what each element in your chart means and provides an accurate method of putting all this information together in an easy to understand format. In addition, she describes a method of comparing one's chart to that of another, called Synastry, in order to determine their level of compatibility with one another.Had the author stopped at this point, the book would still be an invaluable tool in and of its self; however Woolfolk has also included a plethora of miscellaneous information not found in other books on astrology including a detailed analysis of the amorous nature of each sign by gender, as well as advice on seducing an individual based on his or her Sun Sign. There's an entire chapter devoted to maintaining good health, with advice regarding a proper diet and a few words about each sign's erogenous zones.For those who enjoy a little science to balance their magic, the book contains detailed astronomical information regarding each of the planets, as well as their mythological history and correspondences. In addition, the author has included the legend behind each of the signs of the zodiac, as well as a brief history of astrology and a comprehensive dictionary of terms. The charts in the back of the book which indicate in which sign each of the planets are in the zodiac through to the year 2025 also doubles as an almanac, an invaluable tool for Wiccans and Pagans who observe astrological hours in the timing of the spells and rituals.Over all, The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need is a very good introduction to the topic of Astrology and contains all the basics needed to familiarize yourself with the principles of Astrology and get you started on erecting your own chart and understanding exactly what it means. That being said, should you decide to advance in your studies the book does not address the principles behind The Nodes of the Moon, The Part of Fortune, The Asteroids, or Retrogrades. However, it is an excellent reference for the casual reader and the serious student alike."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book is SO on! With any new relationship I check to see what the book predicts and for better or worse it is always right. Maybe I should pay more attention to what the book says and it would save me some time and heart ache ;) The title says it all really."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I already knew the basics of Astrology, but this book and program has helped me a lot. Even my husband, who is very knowledgeable about Astrology, found it quite informative and easy to use"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book is okay, although honestly I don't find myself reaching for it very often."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"Boy, was I wrong! It's easy to get started on the way to understanding astrology, but it doesn't stop at the basics. You can use this book to take your understanding to whatever level you want. The CD-ROM is a simple moon chart plotting program. Easy to use. I am glad this is the one (and only) astrology book that I have purchased."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"With this book you can look up practically anyone's chart quickly and easily. Joanna Woolfolk is extremely adapt in making the complex patterns of astrology understandable to all. It does not overwhelm but gently draws you into the depth that is astrology."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"...for the beginner or expert to expand his or her horizons in astrology. A great reference, this book by Woolfolk should be at every astrologer's fingertips for easy flip-to-the page guides. Whether one forgets the meaning of each House or what a Midheaven is, the price is perfect for the book as a reference guide. I was personally introduced to the book by my mentor and teacher. My copy was purchased for under $5 and I will treasure it forever."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book brings the, &quot; All important symbolism &quot;, of occultism and meanings of each to the beginner, with clear and meaningfull understanding of each. Before reading this book, some time ago, I knew nothing of astrology, and it gave me quite a foundation."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"The book is certainly gorgeous to look at. But the title is a bit misleading. I do not think that a book that barely mentions such features as the nodes of the moon, the part of fortune or the asteroids should call itself- &quot;The Only Astrology Book You Will Ever Need&quot;. It discusses the basics quite nicely in the usual cookbook formula. But like most beginning and intermediate students of astrology will tell you, this info becomes stale and repetitive. I suggest the works of Martin Schulman- his series is great. He understands that all the aspects that are relevent to the study and implementation of astrology cannot be summed up in a few hundred pages. Also Llewellyn has a series that is worth a peek. It has views and research from noted astrologers that are much more detailed and in depth. &quot;The Only Astrology Book You Will Ever Need&quot; will leave the reader with more questions than answers, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"For the most part, I find this book to be quite useful.A particular point is the assumption that all living humans are heterosexual. However, I did find a love synastry method that works with homosexual lovers (Mars/Ascendant).I guess I should say &quot;don't assume heterosexuality&quot;"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book could just very well be the only astrological book you'll ever need! ZodiacZone.Net is a new, but refreshing, website specializing in unique zodiac gifts &amp; collectibles.

(Mine is in the hardbound edition) I have since gone back to it over the years to recommend it to lots of people and friends wanting to start out learning. I still recommend it for the beginner as well as the intermediate and advanced! Ms. Woolfolk has done a great job in presenting information to many people in a simple way. It did NOT stop me from buying more books, it actually whetted my appetite!

I highly recommend it. I'm very happy with all the information, charts and tables that it contains."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This was my introduction to astrology and it did a very good job for me. It is quite complete and easy to read. It might be more suited to people who are willing to put some work in to find out all of the different elements that affect the person being read. I was able to guess times (rising signs) of some people I know using this book - I thought that was amazing at the time. Anybody who thinks that they are a religious or spiritual person should atleast take the time to have a look at astrology, and this is the perfect book for newbies (yet comprehensive)."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I really enjoyed Woolfolk's book. The organization is appealing and applicable to everyone who becomes involved with it. Actually, I have not been this excited about a new book I've bought for a long time. If you have any curiosity about astrology you will not be disappointed by this book.The CD-Rom included has a program that will create a birth chart for you. It's not very complex, at least given what could be generated for a birth chart, but it will satisfy most beginners. Woolfolk's interpretations for my different signs are absolutely outstanding - although a few are puzzling, I have been intrigued to think more about my personality and examine if a few of her interpretations are really accurate. For the most part, the book is a fun read and very accessible. She consolidated an enormous amount of her own knowledge and general knowledge in the astrology field into the book.So, are you a cancer? Scorpio? Libra? Which of the twelve are you? Which celebrities share your sign? Do any famous people share both your sun sign and moon sign? I understand much more about astrology due to Woolfolk's book and find myself looking for more - of course, somewhere in the book. A rank beginner can pick up the book, generate a birth chart, and form a reasonably sophisticated interpretation of the birth chart by using the book. The significance of the different bodies, and concepts such as different groupings and location of the bodies on the chart and ascendants, are covered well. The book will not instantly make you an expert but it will definitely fuel your desires more if that is your objective.A minor complaint: Did Woolfolk have to choose Bill Clinton for the sample reading? What a boring choice! Other than that (and Hillary's picture in the book) it's a great book and I'll definitely see past that because it's such an outstanding book.Woolfolk definitely sees the big picture. She also makes it very accessible and fun for the reader. Outstandingly well done. Thank you, Joanna!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book is an astrologer's BIBLE. I have many astrology resources on my shelf, but this book is the first I reach for time and time again.

First, the Kindle addition does not give you the CD so those chapters which reference it are useless. Second, the authors obsessive reference to Oprah Winfrey made the examples annoying since there are a lot of more interesting people who could have been used. I have other books on the subject, but this one was recommended by an \\"astrologer\\" so I purchased it. The phrase \\"nothing new under the sun\\" would apply to this book. And with the kindle addition, your stuck with it. Amazon SHOULD NOT sell this via kindel without the CD and if they do it should be for no more than a $1.00."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I bought this book about a year ago. When I bought it I didn't know much about astrology, but I was interested in it so I figured this would be a good place to start.

I lay in bed at night reading all about them. Then I always know how to start up a conversation with them. You can't go wrong when you have a secret guide to a males mind and personality. Besides, if you know their likes and dislikes ahead of time, when would you have time to argue? It's great. I've gone by the book ever since I bought it. Great info, it's almost scary how right on everything about it is about your personality judging by your stars. I love it!

I also reccomend Parker's Astrology &amp; Astrology for beginners by William Hewitt."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This is a very good book as far as helping one understand astrology. However, I have found throughout my experiences and studying other books including Llewellyn's Moon Sign and Sun Sign books, not to mention the classic Llewellyn's A to Z Horoscope and Delineator, and the powerful psychologically impacting books of Dane Rudhyar and those of Jan Spiller, James Braha, and David Frawley, that astrology is one of nature's forces that does effect a person's life. However, that effect is either weak or fraught with complications and contradictions if used only by itself. It is my opinion that one must also understand and work with the Kabbalah and the Tree of Life in order to tap the powerful forces of the universe that actually lay behind both Astrology and Kabbalah. By doing this, one can then use these forces to shape and direct one's life.At the end of the summer of 2005, I began working with a book called \\"Kabbalistic Cycles and the Mastery of Life\\" by Dr. Joseph Lisiewski. One calculates a Kabbalistic chart based on one's sunrise and sunset and uses the chart to direct their lives. Calculations can either be performed by hand or by using the Kabbalistic Calculator at the author's website which is 8thmatrixpress.This book has helped my life tremendously from relationships, financial matters, as well as spiritual matters. It an intensely PRACTICAL book and is much, much easier to use than aspect interpretation or trying to get a solid read on aspect-planetary house placements. But I mean by this that it applies the theory behind Astrology and Kabbalah in a new way to help a person in the most important affairs of their life. It is well worth the time to study it!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I think this book is much better than other books on astrology because it presents the information so a lyperson could understand it.

However, it is written to be simple, and as such it treats the reader as uncomprehending - a treatment that leads to the ommision of many things that would be better told to the reader, so that they could fully understand the subject.

It was the only one I need, of course that doesn't mean you magically won't buy any more books, but in general it showed what I wanted to know.

And to those who recommend Parkers over this, I have to disagree. The Parker set is good, I agree, but I still hold my opinion that this book is it!

I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in astrology weather they be in the begginer or intermediate stages of study."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"The title really is false advertising: You can't even do the kind of astrology that's described in the book with just this book, as you need an ephemeris--a chart that tells you what degree your planets are in--to figure out the aspects between planets, and this is a central part of astrology. You can find an ephemeris--as well as more helpful readings of what planets in signs and houses mean--from Parker's Astrology, a far superior all-in-one astrology book. Much of Woolfolk's book has a cut-and-paste feel. There's a chintziness about the writing that is in keeping with the choice of such a cheesy, mercenary title. I'd like to single out the section on synastry, or chart comparison, which is bad to the point of being harmful. I give this book two stars rather than one because it can give a beginner a general idea of what real astrology is about, and may lead them on to more serious books. So it has some value to the extent that its title is wrong."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"An excellent book anyone who has given less than four stars is being harsh !!! The only short comings that this book has are 1.) The aspects for planets are limited (It views aspects as bad, good, and ok but not in those exact words. The only information that she can give you on aspects is the conjunction between planets , which is no more than 2/3 lines, other than that there is no help.) 2.) Recent 'planetiods' such as lilith, chiron, ascendant and midheaven do not have aspect information. For instance if you wanted to know what sun conjunct ascendant meant in your chart, or any of the above I've mentioned, there is no help. 3.) Cusp information is not included at all. For instance say that your 4th house cusp fell on pisces. There is no information that would tell you what this means. To make a long story short, the book is excellent for everything except aspects and house cusp information."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"If you were born in the southern hemisphere, forget about buying this book. The charts are only for the northern Hemisphere"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"The author writes with clarity in a warm and direct style. I do not agree that it is the *only* book you'll ever need on astrology, but it is a good place to start.I am most disappointed that the second edition contains a glaring error: The author lists George W. Bush as a \\"Famous Gemini.\\" She is wrong! George W. Bush was born on July 6, 1946 at 7:27 AM in New Haven, CT. He is a CANCER Sun, Leo Rising (Ascendant) and Libra Moon.I can hope that this is a publishing error/typo, but it makes me nervous--If she is wrong about the Sun Sign of the President, (and it's not a typo), what else is wrong with the book? How accurate is other information? After reading the second edition, I don't trust her expertise as much as I once did.The Age of Aquarius is not usually covered in a basic astrology book and her section on entering the Aquarian Age is well-done. (Both editions have it.) The author provides something for all of us to think about because this Age carries both a promise for a better world and a dire warning: The inventions that can save us can also kill us. (Nuclear power, an Aquarian invention, as an energy substitute for depleting natural resources vs. global nuclear war) We have the technology to go either way. Which way will we go?I have both editions of the book and I am disappointed in the second edition because it has \\"Completely Revised and Updated\\" in big letters on the front cover. I couldn't tell much difference between the two editions as I placed them side by side and compared them.Still, astrologers are not known for their clear writing styles and Ms. Woolfolk explains astrology better than most. She has something to offer the beginner in the often murky world of astrological writing and terminology. I wish she hadn't written that George W. is a Gemini, but her writing style and clarity are worth a look."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I couldn't agree more with most of the other reviewers. This truly is THE only book on astrology you will ever need, whether you are new to the whole, exciting world of astrology, or if you are already a pro. I would not say I'm a hard core astology person, however I've always had an interest in it and found that the majority of things in this book were right on the money! It's almost as if the person who wrote this book knew exactly who I was and everything there is to know about my personality and the personality of other people I know. It is well written, easy to follow, and organized well into different sections. I even let a friend who is a die hard astrology follower, borrow this book and she was very impressed by it.

It covers more than basic astrology books and help those make a simple (but not very exact) chart to find out what their signs PROBABLY are. But as for it being the only astrology book you'll ever need, it definitly is NOT. Maybe if you just want to know the basics, but if you're looking for in depth readings this is probably just a good place to start. Over all I recommend it to people with very little knowledge on charts, aspects, and their signs, but if you already know all about charts and aspects then don't waste your money because you won't learn anything new here."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This is an excellent book for beginners. It brings together all the elements I needed in a beginning book and explained quite a few things most astrology books assume you already know. There are certainly more in depth books on the indivitual subjects covered but I none I know of that cover *all* the subjects in this book.You may find yourself *wanting* more detailed books after reading this one, but you won't *need* them. The basics, common sense and imagination will take you a long way with this book as your guide."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I am a professional Astrologer who has studied astrology for 16 years now. This was my first Astrology book at 15 and it was a very dim general introduction.To advise you before buying: It is very dumbed down for the novice to understand. There are better books to get a better understanding about astrology. The art of chart interpretation is complex and cannot be that simplified. If you want to accurately learn astrology then I suggest authors like Stephen Arroyo,Steven Forrest,Kevin Burke, ,Noel Tyl. I teach basic astrology and I would never recommend this book to my students. In an effort to be fair I will say if you do not want to cast charts and know some slight details on houses ,signs etc then this is a decent introduction but by no means is this a great book for the beginning astrology student. I will say although it was (((my first book)))) It never took me to that next level I was seeking. If I would have relied on it as my only book I would not be a good astrologer today."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I believe that this book will give any astrologer (or would-be astrologer) a lot of useful information, but would be most useful to the novice. It is insightful, intelligent, and at times, quite funny. Ms. Woolfolk never talks down to the reader or uses jargon. It is easy and fun to read. If you are interested in astrology and want to learn much more beyond just the sun sign astrology that you see in the newspapers/net, this is the book you should buy."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book is strictly for beginning beginners. This is the first book I got on astrology and I kid you not when I say that I \\"outgrew\\" it in a few days. The introductory information on the signs, planets, houses, etc. is moderately useful, but can really be found in any book on astrology. If you are interested in constructing charts with even the slightest degree of accuracy, DO NOT use this book. The only thing you can find out is which sign each planet was in at your time of birth - there is no hope of calculating the degree. The method given for constructing charts is highly inaccurate, and if done in this manner it is very likely at least some, if not all, of your planets WILL fall in the wrong houses entirely. In addition, although information is given on aspects, you cannot even come close to calculating them using only this book.To really drive home the point here, let me say I have only been studying astrology for 2 weeks at this point and I already have found all these problems with the book. I cannot even fathom how many more could be found by someone with even a moderate education in the field of astrology.All these complaints aside, it is a rather inexpensive book, and if you overlook all the instructions on chart construction and instead visit a site like http://alabe.com/freechart/ for a more accurate chart, this book can be used to study all the basics of your personal chart. Don't expect too much, though.Were it not for the pompous title and the author's failure to indicate that her method is inaccurate, I'd have given it three stars."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"i got this book many years ago in a book club deal. i paid way less than it for the price to download it here. even the price i paid for it then i came to discover was way too much. at the time i got it i thought it was a good book full of informative information-but now i know better. the poor substitute for an ephemeris aside from being grossly incomplete along with other information that it has is INACCURATE. no means of calculating angles are explained and the short cut for figuring out one's ascendent is useless. very little of the information that it gave me in chart form ever applied to me as a person. and i have since discovered why as i have a planetarium program on my computer that will give you the EXACT LOCATION OF ALL THE STARS AND PLANETS IN THE SKY AT THE EXACT TIME AND PLACE OF ONES BIRTH. this book nor any other like it does that. this book makes no mention whatsoever of the planets that roam into signs other than the 12 accepted zodiac belt ones as the program clearly shows them to do when you trace them night by night over time (and yes i did just that when i discovered the discrepancy.) ask any astronomer who routinly studies the sky if you don't believe me about that its true they can show you in the sky just like my nifty little program tracks them backward and forward in time. case in point my sun is in sagittarus-my moon is really smack dab in the middle of orion's club-and my neptune in ophiuchus. its pointless to get any type of book like this or even go to an astrologer for that matter if they don't give you a true chart based on where everything actually was in the sky at the time of your birth. they are lying to you and laughing all the way to the bank as they take your money. and if they believe in such a flawed system they aren't worth their salt so to speak cause someone can't be influenced by something that wasn't in a place someone says it was in when they were born as in my case the sun in capricorn can't have any affect on me if it was really in sagittarus when i was born nor neptune in scorpio when it was in ophuicus or the moon in taurus when it was really in the club of orion. after discovering how inaccurate it was i sold this book to a second hand bookstore that paid me much more for it than what i spent on it so only in that respect do i consider it the best investment i ever made. if you are into this stuff find someone who takes into account the precession of the equinoxes and all the signs the planets wander into and that they do not cover equal 30 degree sections of the sky either. people shouldn't eat up the gross in accuracies of this and many other books like it as if they were true and accurate when they clearly aren't once you do some research into the matter. in closing this or any other so called traditional astrology book (and any sidereal that don't include all the other signs that planets wander into aside from the 12-13) isn't worth the paper its printed on, or the complex dance of computers and satellites that it takes to download it."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I found this book very helpful. I was curious to learn more about astrology and it answered all of my questions. It also made me think of ways to use astrology that I hadn't even thought of.

Overall, a very fun look at the subject!"},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"Book goes beyond the sun signs. It tells you about the moon in different signs, and the planets as well. Includes an ephemeris to look up the moon and planets and where they were when you were born. We did our horoscopes and we're creeped out by how accurate they were, especially the moon signs. I also did one for someone whom I know with a massive ego to the point of being annoying, and almost every planet/sign referred to the person having an ego problem. I don't know if it's the only one you'll ever need but if you're interested in astrology I would recommened you buy this first as it's so easy to use."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"I always believe that anyone who is undertaking a subject intensely may need more than one resource...however, I can certainly say that this should be one of the main ones to use for beginners.Astrology, to me was always a complicated subject and creating a chart for a beginner like myself has always been hell. Learning the some of the different ways that charts are created and the meanings of houses, decanates, etc can confuse a person who is studying alone. I can honestly say that I learned a great deal. Of course, there is more...PLENTY more. But, for the newbie, this can be a great start.The author informs you of what page to refer to in order to find your ascending sign, and basically to what degree, how to find your moon sign, and other things that one wonders about often. I have not used the CD yet, but, the foreward will also explain that the CD will refer you back to the page number that gives further explanation of what a certain area in your chart means, which is very important.While I understand that the more experienced persons who rendered their critique say that there is much more involved, please know that your beginnings on any subject should not overwhelm you, but should be used as a building block for the next stage, which there are other books that can assist with that. It is well worth the purchase, and I will be using this as a reference very often. I also have to note that this was purchased on my birthday...I believe it was meant for me to see a book that finally simplified astrology for my needs."},{"Title":"The only astrology book you'll ever need","review":"This book is really great.

The section about planets is quite informative. There's also a chapter that explains in details the history and legend behind every sign. I find that entertaining.However, I did not like the chapter on how to interpret your birth chart. It was not specific enough. For example, my North node is in Taurus and in the 11th House. There was a page which describes my node in the 11th House, even though it was extremely short. Too short, in fact. But there was nothing about my north node being in Taurus. What's the point of me finding out on the CDrom that my North node is in Taurus if it's not being explained in the book? All other chapters are very, very detailed, except for the chapter that explains how to intrepret your birth chart. It's as if the author spends too much on other chapters that by the time she got to this chapter, she got tired and decided to half-ass it.I'd say this is good for beginners, but not for high-esteemed astrologers.

That is, until I popped the CD from this book in my laptop, created my chart, and began to read. Wow! I learned things about myself that I had never noticed before, or paid much attention to. This book makes things very simple, easy to understand, and quick, especially if you use the CD that comes with it. Creating your chart using the CD takes about 2 minutes, and then everything is broken up and it gives you the page number to look things up in the book and learn about what it means.

I)","review":"If Christopher Bell&#65533;s &#65533;Portugal and the Quest for the Indies&#65533; is written as popular history, in an adventurous style, and if C.R. Boxer&#65533;s masterpiece, &#65533;The Portuguese Seaborne Empire&#65533; excels in synthesis and displays a breathtaking grasp of world history, then Diffie and Winius have produced a 435 page &#65533;history by the numbers&#65533;---a methodical, step-by-step story of how Portugal began to explore the Atlantic coasts of Africa, how it outmaneuvered its rivals, settled Madeira and the Azores, and developed a system of trade and control that lasted over a century before succumbing to more powerful, better organized rivals and to the consequences of a small nation&#65533;s being overextended. Puncturing the various balloons of myth and legend, the authors&#65533; down-to-earth, but highly detailed approach to the history of Portuguese exploration and penetration of the trading world of the Indian Ocean and the Far East is an extremely useful and interesting volume, probably required reading for students in the field. FOUNDATIONS OF THE PORTUGUESE EMPIRE sticks to the period 1415-1580, at which later date, Portugal entered into a sixty year period of absorption by Spain. (Note: the title as listed on Amazon is incorrect.)The strong point about this book is the documentation, so useful for further research or inquiry. Footnotes have been placed at the bottom of the page, not in the text, thereby allowing smooth reading for people like me, who are unlikely to need to know the exact sources. There are some good maps and a section of illustrations. Not only are the voyages and battles in the East covered, but the authors also keep track of what was going on back in Portugal; the royal follies, the intrigues and battles with Spain, the rivalries among the Italian city states, the fruitless attempt to conquer Morocco, and the energetic trade with the Flemish ports to the north. We learn how the Portuguese got their information and see how, though mercantile reasons seemed to be by far the strongest motivation for their exploits, they often made huge sacrifices for reasons of faith too. From Ethiopia to Japan, from Persia to the Moluccas, soldiers, traders, and priests spent their lives in the quest for riches and in (mostly vain) efforts to save souls. The authors point out that the Portuguese domination of trade in the Indian Ocean during the period under discussion was no accident. Rather, it was the result of a geopolitical plan to strangle Muslim trade, and control trade routes through strategically placed forts (Sofala, Mombasa, Ormuz, Goa, Malacca, etc.) and a strong fleet. Rivalries among Portuguese commanders in the East, as well as the Portuguese king&#65533;s distrust of his far-flung lieutenants, led to many a disaster, but time and time again, Portuguese naval power and unbelievable bellicosity overcame huge odds. The last chapter of the book, entitled &#65533;The Balance Sheet&#65533;, tries to decide whether the whole thing paid off---if in fact, aside from individual fortunes made, Portugal benefitted from its explorations and conquests.The weakest point in FOUNDATIONS OF THE PORTUGUESE EMPIRE is that the authors seem far more comfortable and authoritative when dealing with Europe, with the Portuguese side of the story. When, on a few occasions, they attempt to describe Asian societies, their explanations are weak. Some errors creep in. They hardly mention any African societies at all&#65533;the Africans are acted upon, never actors. For an extremely thorough story of Portuguese methods of expansion and economic domination, however, I would recommend Diffie and Winius&#65533; work to every interested reader."},{"Title":"Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580 (Europe and the World in the Age of Expansion, vol. I)","review":"This is the best book to start learning about Portuguese history. It proceeds chronologically, showing the expanding distances of Portuguese exploration over time and describing the experiences of contact and settlement with other civilizations they discovered during their journies. The book also contains topical or thematic chapters that deal with particular aspects of this period of history without regard to chronology (for instance, discussion of the development and adoption of the tools of exploration like the compass, astrolab, and the caravel).Through this format, the reader is able to follow the thread of history as the Protuguese progress in their exploration and consider the larger issues surrounding their efforts without being constrined by the chronology.I found the book easier to follow for the beginner that \\"World on the Move\\" by Russell. Russell's book is entirely thematic, which leaves the novice reader wondering exactly what happened."},{"Title":"Uintah Railway: The Gilsonite Route","review":"This book is a good read for anyone who likes narrow gauge trains. It is a good primer for gilsonite mining especially for fans of the Unitah Railway. The writing quality is high and most of the pictures, although limited in number, are clear enough to help in modeling. All in all, an enjoyable railroad read."},{"Title":"C is for City","review":"C is for city. Which is to say, New York City. At least that's the impression you'll receive after reading Nikki Grimes's eclectic alphabet book. Picture books have learned something that Sesame Street knew years ago. Mainly, that kids dig cityscapes filled with letters and numbers. As a result, \\"C Is For City\\" is a metropolitan dive into the beauty and excitement of the New York City streets. It's a kickin' little number that teaches kids their alphabetic basics while giving them a taste of the high life. Even suburbanites will enjoy it.The best way to give you a sense of this concoction is to describe to you the first two pages. In them you've a fancy lady and her dog driving along a city scene that is both grimy and opulent. The words on the page read, \\"A is for arcade or ads for apartments/ on short streets with alleys alive with stray pets/ A is for Afghans named after their owners/ who drive them to art shows in silver Corvettes\\". In the pictures kids can find a variety of different things that all begin with the letter \\"a\\". Then they can flip to the last page in this book and see if they truly found all the \\"a\\" related objects. Each page or two page spread in the book is like this. Sometimes they sport a huge amount of objects. Other times, there are only a few. Through it all, Grimes's catchy well-paced alphabetic poems give clues to the various letters in each and every illustration. By the end of the book you find you've just taken a whirlwind tour through offices, operas, parks, parades, shops, streets, and every imaginable New York cityscape. It's surprisingly exhausting.It shouldn't surprise much of anybody that Nikki Grimes has written such catchy four line poems. Best known, perhaps, for her young adult novel, \\"Bronx Masquerade\\", Grimes is adept at poetic license and creation. Fortunately for her she's been paired with the multi-talented Pat Cummings. Cummings has packed each page with original situations and multi-racial characters. Everyone from snooty ladies walking their poodles to Hasidim in their black garb traverse the pages of this book. Kids reading this story should make sure to try to find the little black cat that pops up in each and every spread. He's a sneaky one. The book was originally written in 1995, but even though the pictures show almost every well-known New York landmark (everything from the Washington Square Arch to the Empire State Building), the Twin Towers are nowhere in sight. Quite by accident, parents everywhere have been saved the necessity of explaining the Towers' significance to their four-year-olds. Remarkable.Now I'll admit why I didn't give this puppy five stars. It's basically an unfair reason, but one that I'm unable to break away from. Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with Graeme Base's, \\"Animalia\\" will note the similarities between that picture book, and this one. And of the two, \\"Animalia\\" is the better written and illustrated. So if you want to get your hands on the best alphabetic-find-all-the-objects-slash-animals-beginning-with-a-particular-letter book, this is not the one to purchase. But if you want TWO of the same kind, kindly locate and whisk away Grimes's, \\"C Is For City\\". It's definitely an exciting way to present the normally hum-drum alphabet. Consider pairing it with Nina Crews's, \\"The Neighborhood Mother Goose\\" for a particularly urban storytime."},{"Title":"C is for City","review":"Now, before I even get started, I want to thank the author of this book for showing a picture of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Our copy of ABC NYC listed only \\"vendors\\" for V, and I was very disappointed because, well, the Verrazano is a pretty bridge and I've been looking at it as my touchstone since I was a kid. So seeing it in a picture book, the very same bridge my nieces can see from their mother's window or walking along the water - it's special to me.That doesn't affect my rating, it's just incidental.This book isn't an alphabet book that happens to have a citified theme, it's an ode to NYC that happens to be written in abecedarian format. And as odes to the city go, this one is pretty great. The author caught a lot of different events and scenes, and the scenes included an appropriate amount of diversity, something you don't always see in picture books. It really was like looking at my own home :)Only thing? It's not so much like looking at my home NOW. The pictures are a bit dated, they look more like NYC when I was a kid. And so this book *was* published when I was a kid, so that makes sense, but it did make me feel slightly awkward reading it... kinda like when you look at your high school yearbook and cringe at what you thought of as good fashion choices, you know?"},{"Title":"The Seven Deadly Sins","review":"Sins are definitely out of fashion. The last time I came across the Seven Deadly Sins of Envy, Pride, Covetousness, Gluttony, Sloth, Lust and Anger, it was in a glossy Singaporean magazine for the trendy crowd. Under each of the headings it featured big cars, expensive condos, the current \\"IN\\"-nightspots, the newest restaurants, fashionable jewelry, designer clothes and so on. The word \\"sin\\" may have made monks and Victorians tremble; but we just shiver in anticipation of the latest thrill. Alain de Botton captures this change in attitude perfectly in his 5-page afterword: \\"[Today] our concerns are of a different order. We worry about whether we are cheerful or depressed, fulfilled or low in self-esteem. We worry about happiness, not sin and virtue.\\"\\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\" have originally been published in 1962 by The Sunday Times, and authors from England have written all seven contributions. The book does not rank the sins in any order (rankings are a very American obsession, and it seems the English have not been infected yet in the early sixties). However, it is very fitting for our democratic society to begin with ENVY, Angus Wilson's contribution, and to end the book with ANGER, W. H. Auden's contribution. Envy is the quintessential democratic \\"sin.\\" Alain de Botton reflects that \\"envy comes from comparison and [...] the habit for everyone to compare themselves to everyone else is a particularly modern, democratic one.\\" People envy only those who they feel themselves to be like: \\"There are few successes more unendurable than those of our closest friends [and] it follows that the more people we take to be our equals, the more we will be at risk of dissatisfaction.\\" Which explains why a society of equals does not automatically lead to more happiness for its individual members. Anger is also a very democratic \\"sin\\" because anger tends to arise from a sense of entitlement: \\"We aren't overwhelmed by anger whenever we are denied an object we desire, only when we believe ourselves entitled to obtain it\\" (Alain de Botton). A sense of entitlement comes with democracy: we are not just in pursuit of happiness, we assume we are entitled to it.Wedged between the highlights of Wilson's and Auden's articles are contributions by Edith Sitwell on PRIDE (a tongue-in-cheek confession to the \\"virtue\\" of pride), Cyril Connolly on COVETOUSNESS (a very funny short story about obsessive greed), Patrick Leigh-Fermor on GLUTTONY (an indigestible, rambling piece of writing - skip this part of the menu!), Evelyn Waugh on SLOTH (\\"Sloth is the condition in which a man is fully aware of the proper means of his salvation and refuses to take them,\\" the state of rejecting the \\"spiritual good\\" which - in modern parlance - leads to depression, the contemporary cousin of sloth), and finally Christopher Sykes on LUST (a fine example of British common sense).If we worry about happiness, not sin and virtue, why should we read about \\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\" at all? Why worry about the \\"good\\" when we can go out and have \\"fun\\" instead? The answer is: the \\"good\\" is about the value we attribute to our lives looking forward and looking back, the \\"fun\\" is just living it. In general, we are bad at \\"just living\\" or \\"living in the moment.\\" but experts in reflecting on the past and planning for the future. It is a smart decision to build on our expertise and put some meaning into our lives to make looking back and forward more enjoyable. After all, the good life and the happy life are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Alain de Botton points it out just so well: \\"If we listen to pre-Christian philosophers, there is never a conflict between happiness and goodness. For Socrates, the sinful man is at the same time the miserable man, the good one the happy one. It's only with the arrival of Christianity that a conflict starts to appear and that, unwittingly, it starts to seem as though being good is dull and not likely to lead one to happiness, while sinfulness is bad, but actually rather fun.\\""},{"Title":"Invention and Method: Two Rhetorical Treatises from the Hermogenic Corpus (Writings from the Greco-Roman World)","review":"Greco-Roman rhetoric was taught to students as consisting of five parts that provide a series of steps in composing a speech. The first of these parts is known in Greek as Huresis or invention, literally finding, and listed a series of topics, with examples, that could suggest things to be said in the exposition of the subject and in support of the argument. Invention differs somewhat in each part of the speech. This treatise discusses three parts of a typical judicial or deliberative speech: the introduction, and proof. There is no explicit discussion of epilogues. The fourth book of On Invention is largely devoted to matters of style and composition. It is throughout an unusual work, differing considerably from other discussions of rhetoric both in its teaching and in its terminology.The second treatise translated here as On Method of Forceful Speaking continues the originality of On Invention and is included because it addresses topics neglected in the first treatise. The work is by a different author and has its own distinctive terminology. There are some similarities to the Pseudo-Dionysius' art of rhetoric. The author shows no awareness of Aristotle's discussion of style or of other classic rhetoricians. There is some attempted systematization."},{"Title":"Two Suns, Two Moons","review":"This book of poetry is charming, readable and a testament to women everywhere, their struggles, their joys."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"As is typical in the 87th Precinct novels this has more than one plot strand and the various elemnets are pulled together as the book reaches its climactic pagesEvents are set in train by the murder of a beautiful young woman named Susan Browner ,dead of multiple stab wounds in her apartment in Isola.A cache of erotic letters -very explicitly described by the author-is found in the apartment and it is clear she is a \\" kept woman \\" .Soon after a man named Arthur Schumacher is shot to death on the street ,and his dog is also shot in the incident .Schumacher was the late Susan Brower's lover .The investigation takes Detective Steva Carella into the family circle of the late Arthur Schumacher -his formar wives,his daughters and step children .The death of Schumacer is not the end of the affair -a former wife ids shot and killed and it is obvious there was considerable dissent in the family .Alongside this case is the hunt for the killers of Carella's father-murdered during a robbery at his bakery .This case is outside the jurisdiction of the 87th and we are given a step by step exposition of the hunt for the two black youths responsible .There is also a section on Eileen Burke,another regular character who is training as a hostage negotiator .We witnes shere skills in this regard when she is called to the scene of a hostage situation in which an elderly Puerto Rican man is holding his grabnddaughter hostage .The Schumacher case resolved ,the climax sees the other two plot stands coming together as Eileen is called to mediate when the two killers hold a teenage junkie hostage in exchange for a plane to Jamaica .This is a novel about loss .Carella and his mother mourn the death of his father ;his sister is concerned that her marriage may be in disarray and Carella sepends some time reflecting on the way his youth now seems a distant memory .It works well enough as a thriller but there is a little too much padding for my sake ,to put it well in the upper echelon of this series but even so most crime novel fans will enjoy another professional outing from an accomplished writer"},{"Title":"Widows","review":"WIDOWS is a criminal novel which begins with the crime scene of a beautiful 22 year old blond girl found murdered in her expensive penthouse.She had been cut by a knife in several different parts of her body.A series of exotic letters had been found in her apartment with no names of the writer mantioned on it. The detectives manage to guess who had written those letters and Arthur Schumacher is found shot onthe road near his apartment building, witnessed by the doorman. It is found out that Arthur and Susan had been having an affair for about 10 months.In succession Arthur's second wife and ex-wife also get murdered by the same person with the same gun.Now it is for the detective-sergents to find out who is behind all these assainations. The other special part of the book is the fact that the author goes into the lives of the detective-sergents also. His focus is not only on the murder but also on the lives of the people involved. A very interesting book to read. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Widows","review":"The writing here is typical of McBain; a brilliant job."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"Ed McBain's long-running series of mystery novels spanned fifty years and over fifty books. Based in the fictional city of Isola (with its eerie similarities to New York), McBain's conscientious cops spent thousands of pages chasing down every sort of villainous behaviour. From 1956 to 2005, readers were introduced to serial killers, money laundering, granny dumping and more.In Widows, something awful again happens to the perpetually-beleaguered Detective Steve Carella. This time, his father is killed. While that investigation (one of the rare cases that the reader follows outside of the 87th) is underway, Carella's squad tackles another murder, as a hormonally-supercharged man has been killed, leaving behind a trail of blond lovers, wives, ex-wives and daughters. Finally, Eileen Burke is joining the city's Hostage Negotation team, in one of the more interesting subplots.Widows is one of the more tonally-interesting books in the series.Horrible things happen to Carella, and the reader is still being exposed to the horrible things that have happened to Eileen. But the murder cases are both best described as darkly comedic. Tense, hysterical laughter; moments of tragic-yet-entertaining self awareness; bizarre characters; and even the occasional puppy.Although nothing 'nice' happens in Widows, McBain manages to infuse the entire book with enough dark comedy to keep the reader from contemplating suicide (as opposed to, say, Calypso or Lightning from the early 1980s)."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"Ed McBain readers will enjoy this novel.

Well, Carella could catch a break once in a blue moon."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"Others have written their reviews on the plot, and to that end I suppose it was okay. But in WIDOWS, McBain tries his hand at psychology and demonstrates clearly that he's ill equipped to do so. I'm an avid Ed McBain fan, and I've read the majority of his 87th Precinct series. His work is excellent in the genre of hardcase noir writing. I've spent a lot of hours immersed in his novels and consider him among the 'greats' in police procedural stories. But I think he missed the mark here, causing me to recoil out of the story too many times. Fortunately, this is the only book of his that has done that so far, and I remain solidly a fan! In spite of my negative opinions of this particular book, I would suggest still that people buy it and assess it themselves. McBain books are definitely worthy of collecting by those who enjoy police procedural mysteries."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"Ed McBain's books are ALWAYS interesting, different and engaging...highly recommended for anyone who likes police procedurals with well developed characters...good read!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"This book may appeal to those wishing a New Age or Wiccan approach to nature and spirits, but has very little to do with true shamanism.

I'm sure this must be a reflection of the author's personal path, but to represent it as shamanism is wrong.I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to even a beginning paganism student. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anybody wanting to learn about shamanism.I would not have bought this book unless it were required reading for one of my classes.

People don't like it because they say she thinks she is teaching Native ways, but she isn't. She just could have organized her information better, and settled on which religious approach she was going to write from. I was interested in studying Shamanic practice for quite a while, but have finally become disgusted with what seems to be the general attitude the Native American shamanic community has towards Wicca and Pagans. Irregardless of if you do or do not have Native American ancestry, if you practice Wicca, you're a wanna be not worth the air you breathe. Please."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material. She provides lists of correspondences. Fine, could be useful.What it does not do is provide any real information. We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style \\"vision quests\\" or \\"seekings,\\" encounters the author alleges to have experienced. These \\"experiences\\" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book. Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's \\"Native American family.\\" (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully. The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing. (An example: the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff. A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal. So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff? With runes, no less.)Even more suspiciously, many of her \\"Native American teachings\\" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored \\"rays\\" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians. I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture. (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.) And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public. Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'? If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'. They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read. Waste of space on my bookshelf. Waste of trees to print it. Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in. I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"Well this book has some good idea only reason i do not give a magick 5 is it is alittle gear toward native american abit which i have np with but i would like to see it more open.

I felt that the authoress did an excellent eclectic instructional writing on modern shamanism as experienced and exercised by a real modern American priestess.You have to look at the book in that context.This shaman book is written on an eighth grade through tenth grade reading level.So,it's not for everybody's reading status and pace.It may be too basic for other pagan practitioners and heathen healers.I cannot dismiss it for being nonsense however.And found the book to be thought-provoking and helpful for me,on some points.And i'm sure for open-minded neo-pagans alike as well,who want to build upon one's understanding of modern Western shamanism."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"Wasn't it nice of the Native Americans to &quot;adopt&quot; Ms. Wolfe? I'm sure they regret it.As long as I live, I will never forget the passage about how she reduced herself to tears trying to convince &quot;her Native American family&quot; that, since &quot;nine million&quot; of &quot;her people&quot; were killed during the &quot;Burning Times,&quot; European pagans have suffered just as much as Native Americans. &quot;I could not make them understand,&quot; she concluded, perhaps pausing to shed a tear for the ignorant savages.Nowhere in the text did I see word one about some of the profits from this tome going back to the people who shared so generously with Ms. Wolfe and taught her so much. She seems to be a cultural pirate as well as a &quot;religion-hopper&quot; who's a Witch one minute, a Shaman the next, and authoress of her own full-blown Wiccan tradition the third.Pass this one by!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"This book is bad,why because native americans have an oral tradition of their beliefs they do not write about it in books."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"I have been recommending this book for years.

If you are a solitary practitioner or kitchen witch who is just beginning on your spiritual journey then I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"Amber Wolfe's beautiful introduction into the world of shamanism is a wonderful book that I have recommended to my cherished friends interested in native american spirituality and deepening their own spiritual journey. This is a spiritual lesson planner, and is not meant to be an anthropological study into any culture. To further understand and appreciate this work I recommend reading Soul Retrieval by Sandra Ingerman, the works of Michael Harner, the Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda or books by Lynne V. Andrews."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"Amber Wolfe really helped me out of the mire of traditional magick and taught me to listen to the shaman within.

With its unlimited amout of correspondences on herbs, stones, rays, animals, alphabets, divination, tools, as well as Esbats and Sabbats, if I had to choose only one book out of my entire collection to use exclusively, I'd pick this one. Please buy this book.

It is easy to read and understand and could be very useful as an instructional tool or for personal expansion. Recommended!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"I think many of the negative reviewers of this book are too harsh and I want to address their comments. Amber Wolfe admits that she has pulled from many different traditions to assist anyone wanting to pursue a \\"Nature Path.\\" I understand the purists, of any tradition, won't like this book and it will actually make some angry, but there is another side to be considered which I will go into. But first ...I recommend this book because the basics are solid and Amber has explained a few things in a straight forward manner that I have no seen elsewhere. She cleared up some disconnects so that the information could come together for me in a more enlightened way. Her anticdotes are interesting because they give some insight into the author and her perspective, plus I identified with some of them in a way that reinforced my own experiences. Now for the negative reviewers and purists ...I follow a Nature Path, but I have not had the opportunity to receive much useful or well-intended instruction from anyone - I have a blending of Celtic and Native American Blood, but no tribal family nor Scottish Clan to call upon. My Native Blood calls to me and that actually means absolutely nothing without the opportunity to participate in the oral tradition. I am a \\"blending\\" of cultures and traditions by my very nature, existance, and upbringing in America. I have no choice but to learn whatever I can from whatever sources are available to me and to follow a nature path from my own wit, wisdom, faith, and trust. This is what Amber is supporting.A nature path is about what we all have in common ... can't we leave the dogma fighting to the organized religions of the world? I had a nice Christian woman ring my doorbell this very morning wanting to save my soul ... how nice for her. I believe the native culture is safe ... yes, it has been scavaged, but it has survived and will survive. Amber is writing a book to help those of us stuck in the melding pot. I have no idea what she does with her money, who she supports or not, but I know this book can't make up for the atrocities that have happened to the Native American tribes, nor is it meant to. To the negative reviewers that don't like her Native American references I will pose these questions ... \\"I am Celtic blood (caucasion) and I am Native Blood ... which side of me am I supposed to hate? Which side of me am I supposed to ignore?\\" At this point, no one can make up for the attempted genocide of the Native Americans, but we can respect and support the revival of the cultures.Truth is truth regardless of what tradition it comes from. Joseph Campbell said something to the effect that ... the mind of all humans are similar and it is no wonder that disparate tribal groups came to the same understanding of the creator ... that the myths are all so similar.But, I am here to tell you ... that unless you were born to be a Shaman you will not become one regardless of what you do. Plastic Shamans abound and it's sad. This does not mean, however, that we can't find and use some of the techniques for personal growth and healing. This book is about a nature path for those of us who do not believe in the personification of Spirit, the need to access Spirit through someone else, or that anyone needs to be saved to be accepted and loved by Spirit. As humans we have a need to express ourselves, to be creative, and to connect to Spirit and to one another, and Amber has provided a well organized set of tools to assist us in that purpose. She should be applauded for doing such a good job of organizing and relating such complex material.(BTW, some of my comments here are directed at the reviewer who commented \\"Thoroughly Repulsive\\" and \\"Garbage\\")"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"i notice that one of the reviewers here did not like this book because it was like paganism,well shamanism IS a form of paganism. this book is excellent it covers very many different areas of shamanism,however i feel it is more for the wiccan and witch that wants to learn about shamanism than the Native American"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"&quot;In the Shadow&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read.

Although it is an interesting book, it is by no means useful to one truly looking to start their path to Shamanism. Amber Wolfe gives some basic ideas of Shamanism and interweaves them throughout the book, but this is, in essence, not a book about the ways of the Shaman- it is a book about the ways of a witch who integrates some Shamanism into her own eclectic style. Too much of this book is celtic and wiccan influenced to truly be a useful guide to Shamanism. Much of it comprises of rather light, useless excersises, mixed in with interesting yet essentially unimportant anecdotes. I am writing this to help whoever truly wants to walk the path of the Shaman-there are many other books that will you serve you much better- don't waste time and money on this one."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature & Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)","review":"Amber Wolfe, by far, did an incredible job on this book! I am a 3rd Degree High Priestess in Witchcraft, and have also practiced Shamanism with various Native American Tribes on their reservations for over 15 years... Amber's rituals were smart and clear, very easy for a beginner to understand. I recommend all of my students and coveners to read this book. Shamanism is the first form of witchcraft in the history of the world, and Amber has brought it to a more modern day stage, without loosing the true meanings and importance of the ancient ways.

A man communicates to make a point and solve a problem.\\" - From the deckJohn Gray, author of the popular Mars and Venus relationship books, has created a 50-card deck based on his book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. His insights are intended to help individuals better understand and communicate with the man or woman in your life--resulting in richer, meaningful, and loving relationships.Each of the Mars Venus Cards depict an observation or recommendation by Gray, with one side aimed at women (the Venus side) and the other geared towards men (the Mars side). Here are a few of the remarks found on the cards:Mars: Women use \\"always\\" and \\"never\\" when they are feeling insecure. Venus: Men take generalizations literally and get defensive.Mars: Women do not appreciate being told how to change their feelings.Venus: Men do not like being told what to do.Mars: Call her from work and tell her you love her.Venus: Leave him a love note that only he will see.Mars: Her symptoms of stress are overreaction, feeling overwhelmed, and exhaustion.Venus: His symptoms of stress are withdrawal, grumbling, and shutting down.Mars: The more a woman feels the right to be upset, the less upset she will be.Venus: When men talk about their problems, they are looking for solutions.Mars: A man scores points with a woman if he does his best to contribute.Venus: A woman scores points with a man if she lets him off the hook when he makes a mistake.Some of the cards in the Mars/Venus deck are not universally applicable to all men or women, in my opinion, and some seem a bit archaic. However, both my husband and I looked over these cards and feel the messages are mostly accurate. Fans of John Gray's Mars/Venus approach to relationships will likely enjoy this deck, as well as those comfortable with traditional gender roles.Many of the Mars/Venus cards really nails the central issues of potential relationship sore spots, in my opinion, especially the ones about modes of communication.(To see 6 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])"},{"Title":"La Maestria del Amor: Una Guia Practica para el Arte de las Relaciones","review":"Get this book and the Four Agreements.

Although the skeletal plot is rather insubstantial, the charm of this book lies elsewhere - in its aural genious and visual delights. On a first read, it is difficult for the uninitiated adult to catch its meter. Once mastered, however, the tale delivers a syncopated be-bopping chant. The mixed media illustrations, of gouache, collage, and computer effects, capture the spirit of itts urban backdrop. The contract of soft curves and sharp angles on the faces and figures of its characters effectively mirrors the emotional truth within. The repetitive and simple text, scattered like jewels across the pages one line at a time and printed in a large font, makes it ideal for the toddler and preschool audience. This book would make a delighful addition to any quality children's picture book collection."},{"Title":"A dictionary of the Portuguese and English languages, in two parts;: Portuguese and English, and English and Portuguese","review":"\\"... occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc\\" doesn't even begin to cover it, and I'd say that qualifies as false advertisement.

(Bear In The Big Blue House)","review":"I got this book for my 23-month-old daughter, who is a huge Bear fan, and she loves it! She brings it to me like six or seven times a day to read it to her! I have to admit that at first I was a little worried about how long the pages would last with her (we sometimes refer to her as \\"El Destructo\\" - you should see what she does to board books!), but so far, this book is one of the rare few that she has left intact. Maybe she's trying to tell me that she's a big girl now; no more board books, please. I think it's because she loves the pictures of Bear, Tutter, Ojo, Treelo, Pip, and Pop, and she loves the episode \\"Dancing the Day Away\\", which is similar to the story in this book, and she actually enjoys carefully turning the pages herself and \\"telling\\" me what is going on in the pictures. Another added bonus is the cool \\"dancing\\" picture of Bear on the cover. As with all of the Bear in the Big Blue House books we have, this one has really kept my daughter's attention, too. Maybe in part because we always dance the \\"Cha-Cha-Cha\\" at the end (who can resist?)."},{"Title":"Seasons of the Witch Day Planner 2005","review":"This was a great deal.

With full awareness that some of the plotting left something to be desired, and that parts of it weren't the most original, I really enjoyed it - writing and characters that held the attention and did interesting things.And When Gods Die followed suit. I hoped, actually, that the plotting might be a bit stronger, but that isn't really the case, sad to say: it's a bit all over the place. When the Prince Regent is discovered clutching a very beautiful, very young, very strangely clad, very dead woman in his arms in the Yellow Closet of the Pavilion at Brighton one festive evening, Sebastian St. Cyr, Lord Devlin (alternatively called Sebastian and Devlin, though not iirc St. Cyr), is called in to investigate. I liked the manner of this calling in: you investigated that other thing recently, now the Lord Chamberlain would like you to find out who killed this woman. Sebastian's response that he only investigated the other matter because his neck was at risk is waved aside - and the insistence that he detect again is reinforced by the revelation that the dead woman was found wearing - in addition to a green dress which came nowhere near fitting her - a necklace that belonged to Sebastian's mother. Once again it's a personal matter, and he has no choice.I still like the characters, but this time out I find myself often becoming frustrated by them. No major spoilers here, I promise, but: it drove me distracted that it took days for anyone to consider the dress that so clearly did not belong to the dead woman. The description of it - as a well-made, expensive garment obviously made specifically for some one woman - immediately told me that Sebastian needed to determine who made it and for what specific woman, and trace how it got to the Pavilion on a dead woman's body. This did happen, but not for chapters. Keeping in mind that Sebastian is not a professional detective, and that he is no Sherlock Holmes, still I found his modus operandi frustrating. He turns up a piece of information involving X, and hares off to talk to X, who gives him a tidbit concerning Y, and off Sebastian goes to confront Y, who drops Z's name - and so on. It's purely reactive. Which I suppose is pretty realistic, but just seems ... inept.One other thing that bothered me inordinately was that necklace. It's important, for reasons I won't spoil. But over and over (and over) Sebastian is discovered by the narrator standing staring down at the necklace in his hand. He has very good reasons to be a bit obsessive about it - but for his lover to twice wake up and see him standing naked with his back to her gazing at the necklace is completely unnecessary d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.I still think the series is worth pursuing. I just hope that as it continues Sebastian shows improvement at his new job."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"I've read a lot of mysteries and I have very high standards for plotting and characters. I believe that a mystery should be a great book as well as a great puzzle. Generally, I either really like the book and read it straight through, or I don't like it at all and quit after my self imposed limit of 50 pages. This book managed to fall into the middle. At first I thought it was good and somewhat interesting, but it just ran out of steam and I reached the point that I really didn't care who killed who, if they did it again, or who retained the British crown. I finished the book because I just kept believing that I must have missed something and at the end of the book, I would be surprised and delighted. I'm afraid I was disappointed. It was just boring. I'm not well versed in the history of that era, but several events did not sound right to me and the author admitted to inventing a royal personage. Some leeway is OK in historical fiction, but extra members of the European royals is a bit to far afield for me. There was an attempt to create some friction with the protagonist's love life, but it seemed clear that its status would not be changing anytime soon, so that failed to be interesting either. C.S. Harris is certainly much better than Agatha Christy or the writers of the \\"Murder She Wrote\\" series, so if you like those, you may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"This was a very satisfying read.

It's fast-paced, rich in historical detail, colorful characters who are tormented enough to make them interesting without being painful to read about, and contains a variation on the 'locked room' mystery that is truly puzzling.What I love about the three St. Cyr books I've read is that in addition to the mystery being investigated, the recurring characters are slowly revealing their own secrets. Kat Boleyn in particular, has a really awful secret that could end her romance with Sebastian if known, and I'm eager to see what's going to happen when the truth comes out.Of the first three of Ms. Harris' St. Cyr books, I liked this one the best!"},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"While the second installment in the Sebastian St. Cyr mysteries, \\"When Gods Die\\" proved not to be as thrilling and as riveting a read as the first installment in the series, \\"What Angels Fear,\\" it certainly wasn't a drag either, and was actually quite an engaging and riveting read. Indeed, this series is shaping up to be an automatic must buy for me and if you enjoy historical mysteries set during the Regency period, you'll definitely want to check this series out.In June of 1811, scandal rocks Brighton when the young and beautiful Marchioness of Anglessey is discovered dead with a jeweled dagger in her back in the Prince of Wales' arms. In a futile effort to contain the damage to the royal prince's reputation, the authorities hurriedly announced that the young machioness had in fact committed suicide at the royal residence. However, instead of quieting the rumour-mongerers, this announcement only fuels the speculation that the prince was involved in some sordid way in the lady's death. Hoping to avert a disaster, the powerful Lord Jarvis commissions Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin to discover who really murdered Lady Anglessey and why. And while Sebastian may not care a toss about the indolent Prince of Wales' reputation, he does care about restoring Lady Anglessey's reputation and seeing to it that her murderer is brought to book. The last thing Sebastian expected though was that this murder inquiry would have links to something from his own past...While \\"When Gods Die\\" may have failed to please the most fastidious of readers, it certainly did please me. At this point, all I ask is that I be entertained and enthralled and that the things that jar (language, historical inaccuracies, characters too stupid for words, etc) not hijack the book. And C. S. Harris certainly did entertain me. Her fast paced, cleverly constructed and vividly depicted scenes kept me happily engaged from start to finish; and if certain subplots (like the one involving his mother that was a bit out there in my book) did detract slightly from the overall cohesiveness of the book, I did not think myself too badly dine. All in all \\"When Gods Die\\" was a worthy follow-up to \\"What Angels Fear\\" and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next installment in the Sebastian St. Cyr mysteries."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"I was well pleased with Harris' latest mystery.

Good descriptions of the era make it more interesting."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"This is the second book in the Sebastian St. Cyr mystery series. I picked up the first in the series, \\"What Angels Fear,\\" because I adore a good British period mystery. I love Lauren Willig, Deanna Raybourn, Tasha Alexander, but CS Harris' books are different. The narrator and detective of her series is a man, and while this probably seems like a stupid thing to point out, it does significantly change the tone of the books. Historical mystery novels with female narrators tend to be heavy on romance, dress descriptions, and monologues about \\"why won't the men around me take me seriously?\\" Don't get me wrong - I love those books - but CS Harris' series is different. Her protagonist spends less time in ballrooms and more time chasing suspects through the seedier parts of London, having fistfights with Bow Street Runners, and throwing would-be assassins into the Thames.In the opening of \\"When Gods Die,\\" George, the Prince Regent of England, is discovered holding the dead body of the beautiful young Marchioness of Anglessey. Sebastian St. Cyr is asked to investigate the murder, but he has no interest in helping the government protect George's reputation. Sebastian does agree to help, however, when he sees the Marchioness' dead body - she's wearing a necklace that Sebastian last saw around his mother's neck before she died in a boating accident seventeen years ago.I actually enjoyed this novel more than the first in the series, possibly because Harris could spend less time introducing characters and more time fleshing out plot details. I was glad to see the return of some familiar faces from the first book, and I liked the backstory Harris gave us on Tom, the reformed pickpocket that Sebastian hired as his tiger. This book was darker and grittier than my usual period choices, but I thought it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"It intrigued me making me stay up late to finish it.

Keeps you guessing right to the end."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"This is the second in the Regency era mystery novels featuring Sebastian St. Cyr. The story picks up shorty after the events of WHAT ANGELS FEAR. Sebastian is once again pulled into a sordid affair, the much younger wife of a wealthy aristocrat is discovered naked and dead, and in the arms of Prince George. St Cyr was quite aware that this latest escape would not help the Prince's already unsavory reputation, but he would not have agreed to aid in the investigation had not the unfortunate young woman been wearing a necklace that St Cyr had last seen around his own mother's neck the last time he saw her. For years he had assumed that the necklace had been lost, along with his mother in a sailing mishap. How had the necklace, in pristine condition no less, come to be in the young woman's possession? As he began to make inquiries Sebastian discovered that there was much more going on than appeared at first, both in the Brighton palace now and off the Cornish coast when he was a child.There is a very strong overall story line to this series so by all means begin with WHAT ANGELS FEAR if you are interested in a light romantic mystery set in the Regency period. The mystery aspect is reasonably clever, and fairly laid out although the bigger mystery plot line, that of the St Cyr family secrets is left dangling. The romance portion of the story is likewise left unresolved. As for the historical accuracy of the story....well lets just say that if you are a stickler for accurate, historical details you should be looking for a non fiction account of the period and not at a romantic mystery novel with a historical setting."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"Viscount Devlin is once again tapped to use his unique sleuthing abilities to discover who has murdered the Marchioness of Anglessey.

Or is it the lady's husband, jealous because she took a younger lover? Or maybe it's the lover, whom she cast aside?Lots of suspects abound in this intriguing mystery set in 1800's London.

The author also pens clunker lines like \\"...and then she guided him into her.\\" Good grief. In the bio, you'll see that the author also writes romances, so that's explains things. Otherwise, it was a decent mystery and a quick read. But if you want SERIOUS(ly fun) historical mysteries, read CJ Sansom or Charles Todd. This book not in that league."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"The second Sebastian St. Cyr mystery covers one of the more interesting aspects of the regency era, which is of course the regency itself. I have always wondered why at this point in history the English people didn't overthrow their monarchy in favor of a democratic government. Think about it- an insane king, a prince obsessed with re-decorating his house and with limited mental skills and a country that already had a history of overthrowing their rulers. But then there was the French revolution and every noble man and women in the land were terrified that the bloodshed would come to England. So the stupidity of the regency continued.But the regency is being threatened. Just days before he is to come into power Priny is found with a dead woman in his arms. But al is not as it seems. The woman clearly didn't die where she was found and the dagger in her back was not the cause of her death. And around her neck is a necklace- a rare, one of a kind historical necklace that was last seen on Sebastian's mother on the day her ship went down, sending her to her death....Now back with his beloved Kat Boleyn, Sebastian starts out trying to discover the truth about his mother and ends upon being drawn into a complex plot to not discredit the monarchy, but to replace it entirely...I enjoyed \\"When God's Die\\" more than the first book in this series but still never really got into it. It's the kind of book you just kinds of skim along in. So while it wasn't bad, it wasn't that good.Hopefully the third will be better.Four stars."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"First Sentence: \\"He knew she'd come to him.\\"Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton when he, and other party goers, enter a room to find Prince George with a dead woman in his arms. The woman is Guinevere Anglessey, the very young wife of a wealthy, elderly Marquis. She has a dagger in her back, but there's no blood, and a necklace once belonging to St. Cyr's presumed-dead mother around her throat. St. Cyr is determined to find Guin's killer and from wince came the necklace even though it costs him his fine wardrobe and possibly his life.Harris has done it again. She has created a captivating story filled with historical details and events, and excellent sense of place, although she's made the Thames much too clean and there some conversations and attitudes highly unlikely to have been realistic for the time and that make it obvious the author is a woman. But, in the light of great characters, strong relationships, an exciting plot with good action and a subtle balance of humor and emotion, I can forgive the faults. Overall, I loved the book and have added Harris to my must-read list."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"Regarding the use of this book on Kindle - it USED to be speech enabled, allowing a Kindle user to play the book in your car so you could hear it while you drove (or any other place, if you wanted to give your eyes a rest). Now, all of a sudden, it's no longer speech enabled (text-to-speech). What gives? Did the publishers suddenly change their minds? Is the support for text-to-speech disappearing from our Kindles? I bought Kindle BECAUSE it had the text-to-speech ability, and now that seems to be getting more and more useless for the books I want to buy. Horrible."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"I had high hopes for this book, because I enjoy Regency fiction, but this book disappointed me. Although it has an intriguing plotline - a murder set at the Brighton Pavilion in an attempt to discredit the Prince Regent - its characters are one-dimensional and never drew me into the story. Worse, but not uncommon these days, was the sloppy editing. Sharp readers will find things like \\"then\\" instead of \\"than\\" or \\"straights\\" rather than \\"straits\\", for instance. And then there is the heavy-handed politically correct thoughts supposedly held by the hero as well as other characters.The uncritical reader will just assume, sadly, that it was possible that a nobleman born in the 18th century could actually worry about women's rights, poverty, the inconsistencies of the American Revolution's aims compared to the current situation in America at that time. But there is little documentary evidence to prove that, and it shows instead that C S Harris merely enjoys putting her own opinions about the US's history into the mouths of her characters. This includes a dialogue between a freed American slave running a tavern and St. Cyr, declaiming over a US that offers freedoms through its revolution but still enslaves blacks. Even more astonishing, she has her character then discuss the fate of the American Indian - a fate that, in the early 1800's, would hardly have been set in stone, given that the US had barely completed the Louisiana Purchase and westward expansion was barely underway. But that doesn't stop Harris from putting 21st century political expression on page after page.That, plus the sloppy editing and cardboard characters, made the book virtually unreadable to me. If you want a real old-fashioned Regency romance, unsullied by current day politically correct speeches, choose one of the old favorites like Georgette Heyer, or find a newer author who's content to let her characters speak as they would have in the early 19th century."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"In Brighton in June 1811, the Prince Regent hosts a fete at the Royal Pantheon when he finds the woman he planned to make his mistress dead with a dagger in her back. The Prince falls apart so it is up to LordJarvis to learn what happened. He asks Viscount Sebastian St. Cyr to find out who killed Marchioness Guinevere Anglessey. St. Cry declines until he sees the necklace the victim is wearing.The last time St. Cyr saw the necklace his mother wore it on the day she died at sea. The dagger belongs to Prinny, but Guinevere actually died from arsenic poisoning. Many English believe the Hanover dynasty is tainted with madness and assume the crazy Regent killed his latest whore; some go so far as to believe the country would better off with a Stuart restoration. Civil war seems imminent as St. Cyr considers how Guinevere fit in a highly charged political picture as she didn't dabble in affairs of state only in affairs with heads of state and had no connection to the Stuarts except the necklace.C. S. Harris cleverly uses words to paint vivid colorful pictures of a decadent era symbolized by its hedonist prince and a country divided like a checkerboard in many chaotic ways. The hero is intent on solving the mystery of the necklace perhaps more than the homicide though he knows uncovering the killer might give him clues as to how Guinevere got his mother's death jewelry. The cast brings out the ambience of the era inside a realistic entertaining whodunit.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"I started to sit down and write a long diatribe about all of the historical errors in this book-- errors of history, not just anachronisms. Then I decided that I would just bore anyone who read that wall of words. So this is the short version.If you don't mind the fact that the author writes a Note at the end to mention that she made up Ann of Savoy and fails to mention that she also made up a lot of other stuff including the fear of a curse against England because George III went mad, then you might be all right with this book.She does get the Jacobite heir at the time wrong-- it was Charles Emanuel, King of Sardinia (Savoy was a Duchy which became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia in the 17th century), not his brother Victor Emanuel. Charles had abdicated Sardinia but kept the personal title of King some years before the last legitimate Stuart died and the right passed to him by both descent and the will of Henry, Cardinal called Duke of York.To be fair, the PC attitudes that other people complain about are not out of period. This was a time when people where examining what liberty and rights of man (and even women) meant.However, the idea that the hero could recognize an accent as from the south in the USA based on his father having spent time in Georgia \\"in his youth\\" is entirely too much for me to swallow.So no, this isn't a very good HISTORICAL mystery. Nor is it terribly good mystery.If the reader is interested in a contemporary mystery that also works in the death of the Duke of Cumberland's valet, I would suggestKingdom of Liesby Lee Wood. I recommend the Audible download.And in case anyone cares (or is still reading), there was an alliance between Goditha Price and James, Duke of York, as mentioned in the Author's Note, but without children-- the Stuarts weren't shy about claiming their children by mistresses so there's is no conspiracy there. Goditha died young, unmarried and childless before James took the throne as James II. The records that remain of her (Pepys,MEMOIRS OF THE COMTE DE GRAMONT.and the Earl of Rochester) are not kind.I think that making up half royal children for Americans to claim descent from is almost a cottage industry."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"An excellent book.

And a good thing, too. If I had read this one first, I probably wouldn't have hung around for the two or three that follow.The story was surprisingly repetitive and tiresome. Dear Ms Harris, we know Devlin and Kat are lovers. It is completely unnecesary-and down right ANNOYING-that their almost every encounter ends in sex or pleas for an acceptance of a marriage proposal. They are star-crossed and can never be together. The reader is bored by it, but gets it. And yes, yes-we KNOW that Devlin had strange yellow-almost feral eyyes. I lost count of the times the writer discribed the protagonist's peepers. We KNOOOOOWWW that Devlin is smarter, better, faster than the rest because Harris tells us this over and over and over again.The mystery itself was convoluted and strangely simplistic. Its a good thing that Devlin cared so much about the murder, because this reader sure didn't. There were just too many characters and goings on that contributed to the lack of cohesiveness that chacterized this book. It seemed that the writer added the cast of characters to make a boring set-up more interesting. It didn't work.The writer spent so much time waxing poetic about Devlin and building up the cast of characters that she neglected the actual mystery-which was not that hard to figure out.Jarvis,his daugher Hero and Tom the tiger were the most intriguing characters in the book but were terribly under utilized.Over all, this book was just o.k. Not as good as the rest, but not bad enough to make me abandon the series. I hope for better next time."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"In June 1811 Prince George of Wales was named Regent of Great Britain. While celebrating in Brighton shortly before his ascension, a young woman is found dead in his apartments. The Prince can't remember how she got there, much less how she came to have a daggar in her back. Did the Prince kill her? Why?To help clear His Highness' name, Detective Jarvis hires Viscount Devlin, Sebastian St Cyr, who was cleared of murder charges a few months prior (in the series' debut novel, \\"What Angels Fear\\"). Devlin doesn't care much about the case itself; however, the dead woman was found wearing a necklace that was around his mother's neck when she drowned sixteen years earlier. How did she get it? Is his mother alive? And what does the Prince have to do with all of this?As usual, the mystery is full of many turns and interesting points. I must admit that I enjoyed this one more than its prequel. This may have to do with the fact that I was already familiar with the characters and their individual stories. The main players who survived the first novel are back; Sebastian's on-again-off-again girlfriend Kat, his young street urchin Tom, and even his nasty sister Amanda.There are a few readers who have felt betrayed by the books for their lack of historical accuracy. Because I have a very limited knowledge of Regency England, this didn't affect my enjoyment of the book. I found \\"When Gods Die\\" to be intriguing, exciting, and enjoyable."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"Set in 1811 London, full of political intrigue, Sebastian (aka Viscount Devlin) is asked by the close adviser of the Prince Regent to investigate the murder of a woman found in the Regent's company dead--while he fell asleep and doesn't recall anything that happens. Not wishing to become involved in the Regent's female problems nor in anything political in the current climate, he's set to decline when Jarvis dangles a necklace in front of him--an ancient necklace that was last seen around Sebastian's mother's neck on the day she disappeared when he was eleven years old. Of course this draws him into the mystery, and the story unfolds--both the story of the murder and of how the necklace came to be on Guinevere Anglissey's pretty dead neck.Sebastian, Tom (the street urchin he rescued who is now in his employ as his 'tiger' or horseman) and Kat Boleyn, his lover and actress in Drury Lane, investigate various aspects of the crime and things get more dangerous for them all the closer they get. I admit that I hooked one of the author's red herrings and ran with it and was rather surprised at the solution to the crime and the necklace mystery too. Cracking good action-packed suspense, the first book in awhile that I've been literally unable to put down. I liked this better than the first book, and the gratuitious sex didn't bother me as it was between well established characters."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"I just finished reading ALL of C.F.

While I still don't quite adore Sebastian as I do Julian Kestrel in the fairly similar Kate Ross series, he makes an interesting detective. The power politics and the dreadful Regent, the future George IV, \\"Prinny\\", don't bog the book down as one might fear. The writing and dialog are excellent, with descriptions that are vivid without going on and on. Even my partner, who despises books about 'nobs' obsessed with their attire and social whirl, enjoyed this book and quizzed me about how the Hanover dynasty ever became England's rulers.So while I think you do need to read the first novel to know who people are and what is going on, this one is far better and more fun."},{"Title":"When Gods Die: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery (Sebastian St. Cyr Mysteries)","review":"Is there a genre called 'light historical fiction'?

I do admit that while I did not find it unbelievable that a black man would own a tavern in that era, I did find the conversations that took place between Sebastian St. Cyr and the tavern owner highly unbelievable. And yet, overall, the plot was totally absorbing and the story itself a satisfying mystery tale. Not the strongest of the St. Cyr mysteries, but certainly not a weak effort.

I review the pros and cons.PROS:- the book exists: there is something to read on ENY.- it provides a lot of facts and good stories about ENY.- some chapters are indeed really good (the chapters about the history of ENY, the chapter on recent politics).- Thabit tells in details about the scams in real estate.CONS:- it is ultra-liberal. I mean, I am myself liberal, but the author is a serious extremist. The book is so biased that it's not even funny in the end.- the chapters about the history of Thabit's work in ENY are useless and tedious.CONCLUSION:You'd rather buy the excellent \\"Brownsville, Brooklyn\\" by Wendell Pritchett. Brownsville is just west to East New York, about the same in terms of social processes, and Pritchett is a true scholar, whose work is amazing."},{"Title":"How East New York Became a Ghetto","review":"The author reveals his bias, apologistic views, ultra-political correctness, and lack of understanding of Economics 101 from the very get-go. And goes downhill from there. Yes I'm sure there has been corruption and mis-management by the \\"authorities\\" and community groups (past and present) alike, but that is tangential to the demise of ENY. I was there. If you have rent control, landlords cannot and will not invest or maintain. When housing stock deteriorates, only those who cannot afford better will remain or move in, thus giving rise to a heavy concentration of the poor and uneducated. In turn, this leads to frustration, crime, further flight of the true working class (the old East New York), and inevitable decline. Is it reversible? I hope so. But the author's schemes are nothing more than code for welfare. And that does not work. The author's views on education, law enforcement, et al, follow a similar path - PC at the expense of reality"},{"Title":"How East New York Became a Ghetto","review":"Admittedly this topic is probably a difficult (but important) subject to transform into a book. As an example of oppression, racism and naked greed this story is little different from the fates afflicted upon other poor black neighborhoods. The author has a grasp of the details, but presents the same material again, and again. On occasion some paragraphs seem copied almost verbatim from chapter to chapter. If you must have the information in this book, then I guess you need to buy it, but do not expect to be able to tolerate reading more than a couple of chapters (and you probably don't need to anyway!) A 40 page pamphlet would have been a more appropriate format. Perhaps the author should be encouraged to produce a shorter 2nd version with the addition of some current statistics."},{"Title":"How East New York Became a Ghetto","review":"In this very readable book Walter Thabit describes the decline and rebirth of East New York. It is both readable and methodical in desribing how real estate, politics (from the federal level to the community school board)and prejudice (economic and racial) destroyed a viable community. Special interests groups from community based organizations to the teachers unions to uniformed city workers worked against the best interests of the community.The good news is that East New York is on the rise. The efforts of long time community residents and faith based organizations have made this a community for those on their way to achieving the American dream of if not home ownership, a decent place to live. How East New York Became a Ghetto is instructive in how community residents must organize themselves and align the best interests of their communities to prevent this kind of debacle from happening in their own backyard."},{"Title":"How East New York Became a Ghetto","review":"I am only halfway through this book and it does indeed have a liberal lean to the writings in it but other than that the stories on ENY are entertaining.

Maybe not the best general or the easiest one to deal with, he stands head and shoulders above many of his peers. This is an excellent military biography of General Price during the Civil War and while over uses is a \\"warts and all\\" story. The author pulls no punches in saying where Price was wrong and where he was ill served by superiors and peers. Very even handed, it is clear that price had many admirable qualities coupled with some quirks but he did care and he did try his best.A second plus of this book is the excellent introduction to the war in the West. Price was at almost all the important battles and each is covered. The overview of his 1864 Missouri Campaign and almost unique, most histories do not mention it. Price usually disappears after Corinth but here we follow him to the Trans-Mississippi and defeat.Castel's appraisal of Price is very fair and worth the price of the book. Couple with the battle histories this is an excellent buy. The maps are sufficient for the book and tend to be at the campaign level. However, I did not find that to be a problem when reading about any of the battles. The writing is crisp, to the point and moves. Overall, this excellent book will increase your knowledge of the war in the West and needs to be in your Civil War library."},{"Title":"Kitty Hawk to Nasa: A Guide to U.S. Air and Space Museums and Exhibits (American travel themes)","review":"This book is a very good reference if you wish to visit airplane museums in the United States.

About one fifth of the games deal directly with grammatical accuracy by exposing students to correct or incorrect sentences, with a caveat from the author urging us to accept that students who are highly focused will not imprint the wrong sentences that the theories of Skinner or Krashen may suggest. I can't say for sure whether incorrect grammar will be unconsciously learned or not, but it is clear that not everyone will be interested in these kind of activities anyway. I was therefore pleased that the rest of the book covered material that would appeal to many different types of learner, not just the analytically inclined. Grammar Games has a distinctly British, slightly seventies, and somewhat eccentric feel to it. We can learn by being physically active, or by being silent and reflective. There are board games and gambling games. You can vote for the best, play snap, take part in an auction, or do back-writing. You can even brainstorm why two people would want to exchange socks on a train - not everyone's cup of tea, perhaps. I enjoyed reading Grammar Games because most of the activities looked interesting and highly original, and that there were many that I would like to try out with my students, someday. For the EFL teacher searching for new ideas on how to teach grammar while having fun, whether you are experienced or novice, I recommend that you take a look at Mario Rinvolucri's Grammar Games."},{"Title":"Grammar Games: Cognitive, Affective and Drama Activities for EFL Students","review":"This book was recommended to me by a professsor who had used it with her Middle School ESL kids. After having it a week, I have to say it is fabulous. I had been looking for ways to teach grammar to my junior high kids, without tedious explanations of grammatical rules, worksheets or diagramming. The day after I received it, I was able to start the kids on a game where they could internalize grammatical rules, and demonstrate what they already understood about the deep structure of English. The only preparation required was writing a sentence on the board, and they were involved for twenty minutes. The only reservation I have in recommending this book is that it is British, and intended for adult learners. I have had to adapt some of the language to make it easier for my kids to understand."},{"Title":"Grammar Games: Cognitive, Affective and Drama Activities for EFL Students","review":"Provides various activities that teach many aspects of English as well as grammar points using communicative methodology. These activities are creative and helpful. What is so useful is that these activities can be modified/altered to suit your class level. Some of the expressions and topics are a little strange and not really suitable to use in class for young learners who are at beginning level. But of course you can alter them. I have been able to make up many of my own lesson ideas from this book, written by ESL teaching veterans. &quot;Grammar Games&quot; is very helpful. I also recommend &quot;More Grammar Games&quot; which is a part-two, or addition to this book."},{"Title":"Grammar Games: Cognitive, Affective and Drama Activities for EFL Students","review":"I teach junior high English as a Second Language to mostly Spanish-speakers in Colorado. I use this book all the time. It has many suggestions for puzzles and auctions, collaborative and competitive games. Some of them require preparation; like pulling sentences from homework to play a game judging correctness, or making and laminating cards, but many can be played straight out of the book. If you have taken a language teaching methods course, and were baffled by the idea of \\"The Silent Way\\" you will begin to see how it could work, because some of these games come from that philosophy. The title of this review comes from student complaints about some of the activities, where they are writing poems or paragraphs. There is no competition and no winner getting candy. However, even if no one is getting candy, they wind up being very focused on the grammar. As Rinvolucri says, \\"the dice and cards are the locomotives that pull the grammar train along.\\" One caveat- the writer is British, and has taught mostly adults, so some of the games have to be tweaked. The grammar is mostly the same, the names of some of the games can be changed, and some content can be changed. For example, one prompt asks students to write down complaints about landladies. I don't think any of my kids has complaints about landladies. Fabulous book- I would buy it again, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Grammar Games: Cognitive, Affective and Drama Activities for EFL Students","review":"The subtitle of the book did use the word EFL, and perhaps I should have realized that these games are not suitable for adult ESL students. The level of most the so-called games is too low for most ESL classrooms. And the author has a very odd idea of a game. In V.2, students do a multiple choice quiz, choosing the best translation of a sentence in their native language. Activity II.5 is entitled \\"Correcting homework\\" and that's what it is--having the students correct each others' homework. Some are more game-like, I suppose: IV.4 has students writing irregular plurals on the backs of other students with their fingers; such words as \\"genii\\" and \\"menservants\\" are suggested. And V.4, \\"We are furniture,\\" has students pretending to be furniture while repeating sentences they have memorized.

First of all, there is virtually nothing for lower levels. So you're out of luck if you're teaching a beginning or even a lower intermediate class. The second problem for me is that it's \\"veddy British.\\" I would have to translate into American before I used it. The third, and biggest, problem is that the games require a lot of preparation. Many of them require a lot of hand-made flash cards. Do you really want to spend two hours preparing a fifteen-minute activity? The only way this would be profitable is if one is teaching the same lesson to multiple groups. When I removed all the things that were culturally inappropriate, I had only one game I could use for my lower intermediate level Arab teenagers. It was a good one that I found valuable, but it was not worth paying this much money for only one game. Two stars."},{"Title":"The story of an African farm","review":"\\"Story of an African Farm\\" is a difficult work to describe. It must be read several times, and carefully pondered before all of its secrets are unlocked.Ostensibly, the book revolves around the lives of three children (and, later, adults) who live in the Karroo plains of South Africa. The main focus, however, is on two of the characters - Waldo, the earnest and deeply curious son of the German farmkeeper, and Lyndall, the beautiful, outspoken and rebellious orphan who suffers all her life for her ideals.The book itself is semi-autobiographical. Waldo represents Schreiner's journey from fanatical, childlike faith to bitter skepticism, who reaches a watershed of sorts when he hisses to Lyndall 'There is no God - none!'. Lyndall, on the other hand, embodies Schreiner's frustation with her station as a woman - barred from the upper echelons of society, and her inability to find a mate who is both her intellectual match and willing to accept her as an equal. \\"I want to love\\", she whispers to the grave of Waldo's father, \\"I want something great and pure to lift me to itself.\\"There are many other themes that flesh out the subtext of this extraordinary book - the tragedy of solitude, that ultimately, all humans are alone in the cosmos. \\"Dear eyes\\", the dying Lyndall whispers to her mirror, \\"they will never part us.\\"Readers who expect a narrative will be dissapointed. What narrative there is serves only to undersore the book's many themes. Often, the flow of the story is out of sequence, or devoid of context, and deliberately so. Roughly, the book is divided into three sections - the first introduces us to the characters as children, and reveals their innermost thoughts. The second, and shortest section is entitled \\"Times and Seasons\\". It is somewhat of a summary of what has gone before, dealing mostly with Waldo's journey from Christian fanaticism to dispairing atheism, and foreshadows some of what is to come. The third, and longest section, covers the lives of the characters as adults, and is by far the most powerful, and moving piece of the book.The reader who is looking for mindless action is advised to pick up the latest Tom Clancy novel, or whatever passes for literature these days. Those who are willing to put aside all preconceived notions, and have their cherished beliefs challenged are invited to read this book. The search for truth is endless. But this book is a perfect place to begin."},{"Title":"The story of an African farm","review":"When The Story of an African Farm was published in 1883, the title gave no indication to readers what the complex scope of the novel was really about.Written by South African governess, Olive Schreiner, the book's crux ran along the controversal: the oppression of women, feminism, the existance of God, anti-imperialism, the bizarre transformation of one the novel's characters (not Lyndall) into a transvestite. It goes on and on. The novel was written when the belief of agnosticism was in the early stages of being in 'vogue.' Also interesting, Darwin's Origin of the Species had been published for some time, and the theory had rooted itself in many areas of society.This was not the traditional Victorian novel that was written in the old English 'bonne bouche' manner on par with Jane Eyre or Emma. The prose of the novel has a broken up fluidity to it; it is not grandiloquent; it is in fact, quite brutal, edgy. As Elaine Showalter writes in the excellent introduction to the Bantam Classic edition, &quot;Readers expecting the structured plot of a typical three-volume Victorian novel were startled by the oddity of African Farm, with its poetic, allegorical, and distinct passages, and its defiance of narrative and sexual conventions.&quot; With that clearly explained, it is not a surprise that it shocked old, priggish Englanders with their stiff upper lips and staunch, conservative manners, nor is it shocking that the Church of England called the novel &quot;blasphemous.&quot;African Farm details the lives of three key characters: Waldo, Em and Lyndall. The latter character is the one who seems to bring up the key issues that made the novel controversal. Lyndall is always described as 'little,' 'delicate,' 'like a doll,' 'a flower.' However, she is the one who refuses to marry (with one minor exception to the rule) until a social equilibrium is established between men and women. She desires equality between the sexes, and is willing to suffer for it. And she does, more than what is expected. Odd as it may seem, but considering the period in which the novel was written, the character of Lyndall really had to be physically 'feminized' in order to make up for her strongly held convictions of being a 'total' woman and not 'half' a woman.If any person reads the novel, the character of Lyndall needs (from my view) special attention, for she questions the values of men, women who accepted the standard, religion and the social hierarchy in which she was born. Her questions seem like cartels, challenges. Why can't she have a job? Why can't she be educated or independent without the stigma 'weirdo' unflinchingly attached to her? Why must she be dubbed 'strange?' The reader must always ask why when reading this book. The three characters, Lyndall especially, endure a lot of hardship, a hardship that mirrored the very author's life, i.e. her cold and distant upbringing, the religious retraints placed on her life as well as the life-clenching grasp that old norms had on women of that period. African Farm was Olive Schreiner's liberty, her freedom from the societal choke hold.In conclusion, the novel is not one of grace and patrician dogma. It is not a book of nice ladies and gentlemen sitting under the African sun near exotic, wild flowers sipping tea and participating in intellectual banter. No, it is an underscored work of literature where ideas of human aspiration and ecumenical desires are explored under a blazing sun and burnt, sandy plain."},{"Title":"The story of an African farm","review":"Although I had to read this book for a college class, I would read it again in a second, I feel that I can only gain more and more from this book through rereadings. Its plot is at times disjointed to the style of the author and the message she is attempting to convey, so for those who are looking for a strongly Dickensian or \\"feel good\\" read, this is most likely not the book for you right now. But for me, from an analytical and heartfelt standpoint, the subtlety of the book and its beauty and its truth made me tear up a little bit. I'm currently writing a paper on Waldo and his artistic and personal growth throughout the novel, so maybe I'm a little biased, but although Lyndall is an incredibly interesting and advanced character, I think Waldo is often glossed over as merely suffering from a religious crisis of faith, and, being a man, not deserving of attention in this novel of the \\"New Woman\\". But Waldo ultimately reaches a place of amazing peace and understanding, and the lives of Waldo and Lyndall intertwined together is truly beautiful."},{"Title":"The story of an African farm","review":"I had to read this book for my British Lit class in college.

We often joke about &quot;methodizing&quot; and Methodist ways -- so natually, I thought this would be a funny treat for my Mom. I was disappointed -- the book is full of one-liners, most of which present the Methodist church as a liberal, female-friendly, ecumenical organization. Granted, the church has (thank goodness) become must more open-minded over the years, but not to the extent this booklet implies. I could relate only to one or two of the jokes, and even they were lame. I didn't find any of them laugh-out-loud funny. No doubt, the Methodist Church is large and congregations and practices vary from church to church. I'm sure that there are a handful of Methodists out there who might find this funny. However, even though I have attended several Methodist churches over the years, I didn't particularly relate to this, nor did I find it funny. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this little cheaply-produced booklet (which looks like a freebie you could pick up the on the shelves in the narthex, right next to the Upper Rooms -- and it's not even blessed with a nice paper cover or any four-color illustrations) unless having something titled says &quot;You Might Be a Methodist If . . . &quot; is, in &amp; of itself, amusing to you."},{"Title":"You Might Be a United Methodist If...","review":"I found this book to be amusing, but a number of the jokes about Methodists could easily be applied to many of the mainline Christian denominations.

Depending on the church, you might find yourself in a hysterically conservative, wildly liberal, or casually moderate congregation. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to find one-liners of the &quot;You Might Be...&quot; variety that will resonate with United Methodists across the board.For myself, as a member of the United Methodist Church I found this small, short book harmless but only mildly amusing at best.

He went to school only a few days, but educated by nature, he told stories which never failed to reach people for Christ. He was a man of common sense, a very blazing common sense which touched the common man and amazed the learned. Countless people will be in heaven because of the faithful service of this gypsy. You will also read how a faithful father raised a faithful son. I think it will make anyone thinks they know about gypsies to think again! I loved this book."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"This book was a startling and controversial spiritual landmark in 1888 when it first appeared. It covers cosmic, planetary, and human evolution, as well as science, religion, and mythology. It is based on the esoteric Stanzas of Dzyan, with reference data from over 1,200 sources. It was virtually the Bible for the early Theosophical Society, and has continued to be so even today in the 21st century. The work comprises three volumes: Cosmogenesis, Anthropogenesis and a further volume with index and bibliography adding immense value as a study tool. Cosmogenesis is the origin of the universe, while Anthropogenesis is the origin of humanity. In many countries around the world there are study groups dedicated to understanding this book. It is a compendium of nearly all religious and esoteric knowledge available at the time, but gathered psychically by the author. If you know about the life of the author (Blavatsky) the psychic guidance method seems the most plausible means of her obtaining the remarkable content for the Secret Doctrine.The impact of this book is so great that it should be an essential for anyone into the spiritual growth areas of today. Aside from theosophy, the work in this book is the starting point for all New Age philosophies. It grew out of a social climate of spiritualist seances and psychic phenomena, generalising all that was known then and integrating it in spectacular fashion. Many of the intelligencia of the day were influenced by this work, and wrote books on many aspects of this. It also led a prolonged Western excursion into the Eastern mysteries and religions.The book adds depth and insights to so many religions and philosophies, and yet follows the edict, \\"there is no religion higher than truth\\". For example, it adds to Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Cabbala, Rosicrucianism, etc you name it! It also has a lot to say about the science of the late 19th century. Examples of modern New Age philosophies dependent either directly or indirectly on the Secret Doctrine are:- the Alice A Bailey schools including the University of the Seven Rays, Summit Lighthouse, the I AM movement, Steiner's Anthroposophy, Wicca, many yoga schools, healing energy techniques like Reiki, Shiatsu, etc. There is still much ambivalence even today about the Secret Doctrine and its writings and its esoteric traditions associated with the Himalayan Masters of Wisdom. The best way to resolve these issues is to read the book for yourself. It is a difficult book, even impossible for some students who may be surprised at how strange its language seems at times to those new to such things. But it was written not as a \\"suck it and see\\" book, but as a \\"live with me forever\\" book. I'm very pleased to recommend it to you."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any \\"newly rediscovered\\" esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too \\"quaint\\" and \\"old-fashion\\" for the \\"New Age.\\"There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply \\"browse.\\" I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as the \\"seven races\\" and \\"seven globes\\", just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of \\"seven heavens.\\" Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"It's hard to imagine that this very detailed book was written by an uneducated woman, obviously she had a lot of help. This work is a hundred years old and written during a time when sensational journalism was well practiced. However, this work is one of the most significant writings ever and contains munerous predictions later &quot;discovered&quot; by science. Eventually maybe science will &quot;discover&quot; all of it. The work is controversial, even today. Anyone who can comprehend this book in one reading is not of this earth. I started reading it almost thirty years ago and still reread it often, particularly for reference. It's great that this work is now on-line with a good search engine at blavatsky.net."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"Not suggested for anyone with a short attention span. This is a massive accomplishment bringing the A to Z of occultism under one literary umbrella. An astonishing find."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"Blavatsky was an incredible mystic and probably the best known Theosophist. The Secret Doctrine is such an incredible work. Although some parts may seem to be cryptic, Blavatsky gives so much information and insight into the occult world. It's not an easy read, but I find myself rereading chapters only to find a hidden nugget that I overlooked before. This is a compendium of vast esoteric knowledge and I am so grateful this scarce third volume has been made available."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"I really don't know why so many reviewers find this book 'difficult.' I suspect they probably find the King James Bible 'difficult' for similar reasons, the most obvious of which is that standards of education and more especially, literacy, have declined considerably since H.P. Blavatsky wrote her master-work. Another possible reason is that the 'secrets' Blavatsky revealed, just like the allegories of the New Testament, cannot be understood by the unaided intellect. If they could, we would all be filled with Wisdom and have no need to continually reincarnate on this sorely-troubled earth to learn the Eternal Verities.It seems to me that to expect to grasp the great truths which have puzzled the greatest minds since time immemorial in a few short weeks or months, or by skimming the surface of books like the Secret Doctrine, is akin to attempting to scale Mount Everest when one has difficulty climbing the stairs to bed!If one has absolutely no knowledge of the Ancient Mysteries, or worse, believes that real scholarship and science began with the Ancient Greeks and that the Ancients knew nothing that we do not know infinitely better, this book will make about as much sense as Shakespeare would to a troop of monkeys. Equally, if one has been spoon-fed upon the sound-bite 'mysticism' and 'new age' claptrap that passes for 'occultism' nowadays, it is not very surprising that the Secret Doctrine should seem a 'difficult', if not an entirely CLOSED book to the majority of its readers.The fact is that it was NEVER intended for the majority, or even for the majority of 'occultists' and 'mystics'. The latter being those who wish to have their own fancies and fantasies confirmed, rather than learn the truths Blavatsky reveals in this book. Unfortunately, as I suggested above, the intellect alone cannot apprehend these truths without the aid of intuition; a fact insisted upon by every true Teacher from Buddha to Jesus, and before.Now whether you choose to call intuition 'spiritual vision', 'inspiration' 'the eye of the soul', or anything else under the Sun, the fact remains that every great philosopher and spiritual teacher has said that unless we can learn to transcend our purely physical, earthly 'thinking', we shall never have any apprehension of the truth of anything, much less the nature of Man, or God, or the Universe. In the degree that we DO use these higher senses we will find the 'difficulties' of this book are largely of our own making and melt away like snow under the warming rays of the Sun of Wisdom.Far be it from this writer to tell anyone what they should or should not read. But it will be clear to anyone with the slightest SINCERE interest in Truth and Wisdom that the Secret Doctrine was written for the few and not the many. If you are among the former you will not need me to tell you that this remarkable book bears the stamp of Holy Truth on every one of it's inspired pages. If you are NOT, you will dismiss it as bunkum and consign it to the rubbish heap of mystical literature which fills the bookshelves of stores around the world to overflowing.As Blavatsky herself says in her preface: \\"The aim of this work...is...to rescue from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all religions; and to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity from which they all spring; finally, to show that the occult side of Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern civilisation.\\"As other reviewers, more capable and diligent than the writer, have covered the subjects Blavatsky discusses in some depth, I will not recapitulate their good efforts, except to say that after a lifetime of study and the acquisition of many hundreds of the best works on philosophy, science, mysticism and occultism, I know of no other book in existence that answers so clearly and completely the question of who Man is, whence he comes, whither he is going and what the purpose of Life is. Needless to add, the answer is not '42'; much as I both enjoy and admire the fiction of Douglas Adams!For those who CAN see the Light that shines from the golden leaves of the Secret Doctrine this book will be a revelation that will open the door to a hitherto undreamed of world of truth, beauty and wonder; constituting an edifice of unbelievable grandeur and sublimity. Such will join the ranks of appreciative readers like Albert Einstein, who always kept a copy of the Secret Doctrine by his bedside. For those who find the book too 'difficult', or worse, will insist upon associating it with conspiracy theories of all kinds, there are plenty of 'colourful' books which may be more to their taste for the weird and fantastic!!!In passing, I would just like to point out that there are several editions of the Secret Doctrine in print as well as abridgements of it. I'm sure I don't need to add that where different editions of an author's work exist it is generally best to obtain the one that THEY themselves wrote and approved. In this case that is the edition published by the Theosophical University Press of Pasadena, USA. This is a photographic facsimile of the first two-volume edition of 1888 bound into one volume and verbatim with it. A three-volume edition (considerably 'edited' by Annie Besant and other leading 'lights' of the Theosophical Society, was published after Blavatsky's death. This is to be avoided, as are the many abridgements and 'improvements' which have appeared in recent years.Let me end this rather inadequate review with a quotation from the book itself:\\"I have here made only a nosegay of culled flowers, and have brought nothing of my own but the string that ties them\\" (Secret Doctrine, I, xivi). In thus quoting the French essayist, Michel de Montaigne, Blavatsky not only displays the humility which is ever the hallmark of the true Sage (in stark contrast to her many detractors and calumniators, both past and present!), but also demonstrates that the 'flowers' in question are not new. On the contrary, they are the scattered efflorescence of the ANCIENT Wisdom which she gathered together for the very first time in ages for the benefit of the few who are able to appreciate it. May YOU who reads this be such an one and discover the treasures hidden within the pages of this most remarkable of books."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"These volumes are a great testament in spiritual literature.

In this work, she goes stanza by stanza using the \\"occult\\" (spiritual) teachings of the book of Dzyan. Of course, what makes these volumes come to life is her commentaries.

As Katinka Hesselink states in her article, &quot;Race, Sub-race and Sociological interpretation&quot; : &quot;H.P. Blavatsky uses the word race in a variety of connotations. Sometimes it means the present day humanity, sometimes a 'sub-race' of mankind. When she means present day humanity she does not say humanity, because she was of the opinion that humanity goes through a variety of stages (called rounds), which take tremendous amounts of time...The people of America and Western Europe are clearly the wealthiest and the most intellectually active at this time in history. Blavatsky therefore distinguishes them from other people by calling 'us' a sub-race of the fifth rootrace. This seems to me more a sociological distinction than a physical one..&quot;The problem with the &quot;root race&quot; theory begins when HPB seems to imply that &quot;root race&quot; also has a biological component as well as a sociological one. This seems to have led HPB to declare that certain &quot;races&quot; (and here she seems to mean biological) of people are inferior to others and, therefore, opens a pandora's box of bigotry and discrimination as well as many twisted interpretations of her theory. Hitler is a terrifying example of how this theory has been misused. It well known that he kept a copy of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; by his bedside and relied on it to develop his dangerously inaccurate version of HPB's theory.One of the basic tenets of theosophy, however, is to &quot;to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour.&quot; The truth of this tenet is that EVERY human being has a soul that is progressing towards enlightenment via many lifetimes of learning. There can not, therefore, be anyone &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; to anyone else. There are only people at different stages of the same path to wisdom. The idea of &quot;inferior biological races&quot; should be vehemently opposed by a truly &quot;enlightened&quot; person.Another problematic issue is the origin of the ideas contained in &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. The brilliant and world renowned Kabbalah scholar, Gershom Scholem in &quot;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism&quot; states: &quot;There can be little doubt in my opinion that the famous stanzas of the mysterious &quot;Book Dyzan' on which ..The Secret Doctrine is based owe something, both in title and content, to the pompous pages of the Zoharic writing called 'Sifra Di-Tseniutha'...The solemn and magniloquent style of these pages may well have impressed her suceptible mind...The 'Book Dzyan' is..nothing but an occultist hypostasy of the Zohairic title...&quot;I write these paragraphs not to discourage you from reading &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; but to encouarge you to read it with a discriminating mind and eye. HPB and many of the later theosophists mix many truths with even more inaccuracies. (In the case of Alice Bailey, these inaccuracies include her vile anti-semitism and biological racism.) Keep in mind the basic tenet that I quoted above: &quot;A Universal Brotherhood of Humanity&quot;."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"Well worth the positive reviews - which restricted themselves to what H.P.Blavatsky actually had to say in the S.D. Too much review space seems to have been dedicated to 'defending' - or 'refuting,' ideas not explictly found in Blavatsky's book.At the worst, this includes reviews making the S.D. a prelude to the work of Samael Aun Weor. The 'larger picture' alluded to by H.P. B. was not a hint that some future writing/s would fill in the gaps, but that it was incumbent upon individuals to discover the 'larger picture' - for themselves.As for the hysteria over the allegedly 'rascist' elements in H.P.B's work, it was a relief to find one reviewer reminding us that Theosophy advocates the pursuit of truth \\"without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour. \\" Nuff said?"},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"Aside from being Sirhan Sirhan's inspiration for killing the younger Kennedy, this is a rather remarcable book. It was the first book that Mr. Sirhan requested when he was usured off to jail. This was because of Mrs. Blavatsky's teaching in the book that he was 'Becoming a God' and nothing could prevent him from achiving 'His Will'. Of course, this is not a new teaching. It is just tragic that he took her at her literal word.The New Age movment is a direct deseandant of Mrs. Blavatsky's writings. First with her 'Isis Unveiled' (pub. 1877), a &quot;1,300-page compilation of mysticism, tall stories and archaeology, which hints at a lost knowledge that had been familiar to the initiates of antiquity&quot;...&quot;The result was both vitriolic and garbled, but 'Isis Unveiled' was to provide endless scope for interpretation.&quot; (Encyclopedia of the Unexplained - Ed. Richard Cavendish, Consultant: Professor J.B. Rhine [of Parapsychology fame], writen by historian James Webb - pg 250).The book was 'shown' to her in the air before her eyes as the Akashic Records. The Akashic Records are 'distinct vibrations' for every creature in the Chosmos that can be read by anyone whos eyes are 'atuned' to the mystical. A kind of 'cosmic record-keeper' to be used in determaning whether or not you come back as a bug or what-not in your next life. They were made famous by Levi Dowling (1844-1911), an old Cival War army chaplain, who wrote 'The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ'. It was published after his death by Eva S. Dowling, Ph.D. - the Scribe to the Messenger - in 1911. The 'Christ' (lit. anointed) was mearly a title, like President or Prime Minister, and is used by many peaple (Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed the Prophet, and so-on) - not just one single person.In writing 'The Secret Doctrine' Mrs. Blavatsky used the same method to interpet the ancient 'Stanzas of Dzyan' [not the so-called Chinese text interpreted in H.P. Lovecraft's works]. Published in 1888 it was mearly an extention of 'Isis Unveiled' an! d a serious attempt at reconciling the differences between East and West occultic thought. 'Man is God in the making' was her basic premiss. It is slightly easyer to make sence of than 'Isis Unveiled' and is the literal bible for the Theosophical Society. After Mrs. Blavatsky's death in 1891 the Theosophical Society (started by Blavatsky in 1875) splintered into four seperate groups - helped by Annie Besant's telling the world that the New Messiah was comming in 1906. Jiddu Krishnamurti was hailed as this New Messiah, a hindu boy manipulated by Besant. On 28 Dec 1925 he was hailed as the New Messiah come to heal the world. But in 1929 Krishnamurti renounced all claims to being a Messiah, and subsiquently suffered amnesia to any events that happened before then. Because of this farce Dr. Steiner (1861-1925) had broken away and started the Anthroposophical Society - Alice Bailey did the same and started the Acaine School - and Guy and Edna Ballard broke away to start the now infamous 'I Am' school in the 1930's. It was Mrs. Ballard that had made the prophecy in the late 1980's that the soviet's were about to launch a nuclear attack and all her disciples hade to barracade themselves in a fallout shelter in the Teton Mt's. Needless to say, she is hard to get in touch with now.Athough 'The Secret Doctrine' is a product of Mrs. Blavatsky's mysticism, it is still a book that has a far reach even today. This alone makes it an invalueable addition to any library. The Age of Aquarius (beleived by Mrs. Blavatsky to be upon us) is now here. What we make of it is another story entirly.Sincerly, Shawn W.

After cheaking it out, that seems the case. It was an offshoot of the Ballards, namely Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who made the heartwarming prediction of the soviet nuclear attack. It was not Mrs. Ballard. She passed away in 1971. I had the two confused at the time of the writing, and I stand corrected. Because it has been said that I would never treat the Bible with such disrespect the following artical is taken (in part) from the Christian Research Institute Journal - The Christ of the New Age Movement by Ron Rhodes - Summer, 1989 - pg 9.&quot;The Christ of the 'I Am' Movements&quot;Guy and Edna Ballard were Theosophists up until Guy was contacted by Saint Germain, an 'Ascended Master' who allegedly appeared to him in a physical body. Saint Germain informed him that he lived on Mount Teton with ninety-eight other Ascended Masters.&quot;Saint Germain appointed Guy, Edna, and their son Donald as the only 'accredited' spokepeople for the Ascended Masters. Saint Germain also taught Guy about the 'Great Creative Word' (I Am). The 'I Am Presence' is said to be in each person and represents a point of contact with divine reality. One can attune to the 'I Am Presence' by chanting 'I Am' decrees. Such chanting reportebly brings about dramatic results in the life of the one chanting.&quot;The Ballards' Christology is distinct in that Saint Germain is considered more important (in the dawning Aquarian Age) than Jesus, and is the primary object of worship among 'I Am' devotees. Jesus - himself an 'Ascended Master' - allegedly said that Saint Germain is &quot;the Greatest Blessing that has ever come to mankind.&quot; [1] The reason for this devotion to Saint Germain is that he has brought the Violet Consuming Flame: &quot;The conscious use of the Violet Consuming Flame is the only means by which any human being can free himself or herself from his or her own human discord and imperfection.&quot; [2] The 'I Am Presence' is invoked ! by chanting decrees, and this in turn activates the Violet Flame. The Violet Flame then burns away undesirable conditions in ones life. Of course, this nullifies any need for Jesus' work on the cross.&quot;&quot;Elizabeth Clare Prophet and her 'I Am' Roots&quot;While the Ballard's 'I Am' movement has considerably declined since its heyday in the 1930s, another 'I Am' movement has achieved high visibility and much popularity in New Age circles. This is the Church Universal and Triumphant, founded in 1958 by Mark Prophet and now headed by his widow, Elizabeth Clare Prophet.&quot;Foundationally, certain aspects of the Prophets' theology can be traced directly to Theosophy. These beleifs include (1) Masters who guide man's spiritual evolution; (2) revelations to man from these Masters; (3) the Christ's use of Jesus' body; (4) human evolution through progressive stages; and (5) the belief that Blavatsky's revelations marked the begining of the Aquarian Age.&quot;Beyond these similarities, the Prophets derived most of their theology from the Ballards. This is seen not only in their emphasis on the 'I Am Presence', but also on the prominent role of Saint Germain.&quot;Elizabeth Clare Prophet says the 'I Am Presence' has become hopelessly distorted within man due to negative energies from within and without. These negative energies impede spiritual progress, but are effectively combatted by the 'Violet Consuming Flame' which is poured out on the world by Saint Germain. This Flame changes negative energy into positive energy. It is therefor an antidote to sin.&quot;This makes Jesus' work on the cross unnecessary. In fact, Mark and Elizabeth Prophet dismiss the idea of Jesus' atonement on the cross as an &quot;erroneous doctrine...which he himself never taught.&quot; [3] Like the Ballards, the Prophets beleive that Jesus attained Christhood as did other Ascended Masters. The 'Christ' of 'I Am' theology represents the divinity within all men: &quot;God dwells in every man and not alone in His son Je! sus the Christ. The only begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth, is the Christ whose Image the Lord has reproduced over and over as the Christ-identity of of every son and daughter who has come forth from the infinite Spirit of the Father-Mother God.&quot; [4] The Prophets conclude that &quot;to become the Christ, then, is the goal of every child of God.&quot; [5]&quot;[1] Mrs. G.W. and Donald Ballard - Purpose of the Ascended Masters 'I Am' Activity - pg 110.[2] Ibid - pg 35.[3] Mark and Elizabeth Prophet - Climb the Highest Mountain - pg's 279-280.[4] Ibid - pg 228.[5] Ibid - pg 160.It hope this has clairified things.Sincerly, Shawn W.

I hope not to make such a mistake again.The writer consistently, and often, unnecessarily uses unfamiliar wording. The use of a dictionary is required. Very little of what is written actually makes any sense; even when the vocabulary is understood. I don't want to dissaude anyone from pursuing their interest, however, perhaps before making a purchase, it would benefit potential buyers to peruse the book itself first to see if they feel this book truly does offer what they are looking for."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"According to the dust jacket this book is \\"universally regarded as the greatest sourcebook in the field of metaphysics\\". Well, I regard it as a piece of junk.Here's what \\"HPB\\" says about the origin of earth. \\"The human being came out of the moon\\" (I, 227-8); the moon has given to the Earth all but her corpse (I, 155) and is \\"constantly vampirised by her child\\" (I, 156), \\"the Earth owes its being to the Moon\\" (II, 64). So, the moon is the mother of the earth. But the moon is also \\"the Queen and the King\\" (I, 386) and also \\"is aptly referred to in Occultism as the 'insane mother'\\" (I, 149). She doesn't say where in occultism the moon is referred to as an insane mother, no does she say why this is apt.HPB also discusses the history of the human race. She gives the figure of 1,664,500,987 years. That's quite a long time. However, she also gives the figure of the \\"human period\\" (II, 69) as being 18,618,728 years. However, this excludes the time before the deluge of Atlantis. Later on (II, 314) she states that the last Atlanteans perished 850,000 years ago, but that it was \\"several million years ago\\" that the main continent of Atlantis perished. Apparently the \\"elect\\" from the lost continent of Lemuria were to be found on Atlantis, before they made their way to Shamballah in the Gobi desert. When Lemuria was destroyed, Atlantis appeared (II, 402). She doesn't say how Atlantis came to just suddenly appear.So, how do places like Atlantis and Lemuria just come and go? Well it's a cleansing process apparently, with the \\"survival of the fittest [in italics] nations secured through timely help\\" (II, 330). She doesn't say what form the timely help comes in. Anyway, \\"unfit nations\\" are swept off the earth. \\"Sub-races are subject to the same cleansing process\\".She also discusses the nature of evil. \\"Evil is a necessity, and one of the supporters of the manifested universe\\" (II, 389). She regards Satan as being \\"much-slandered\\" (I, 413) and states that Satan is \\"allegorized as Good, and Sacrifice, a God of Wisdom\\" (II, 237). Satan is, she says, \\"the grandiose image of one who made of terrestrial a divine man\\" (I, 198).There are plenty of drawings of swastikas in this book. The swastika is \\"the most philosophically scientific of all symbols\\" (II, 98) and \\"the symbol of male and female principle in Nature and much more\\" (II, 29). She doesn't say what the \\"much more\\" is. She also states that \\"every Occultist is a Nastika\\" (I, 279), but doesn't state what she means by \\"Nastika\\".She doesn't think much of Christianity, stating that \\"Christian theology is the servile copyist of the Hebrew bible\\" (I, 382). For application of black magic she states that mandrake roots are \\"especially effective\\" (II, 27).There is much discussion of root races and initiates. She declares that humans are \\"the most ancient of all the now living mammalia\\" and that humanity was \\"already as fully developed as it is now when all the other mammalia now known had not made even their first approach to appearance on this Earth\\" (II, 56). She continues, \\"Such is the opinion of Quatrefages, who thereby gives a terrible blow to Darwinism\\"She seems to be a fan of Buddhism, \\"Gautama Buddha\\" is \\"Wisdom incarnate\\" (I, 162). She also seems to be a fan of Brahmanism, declaring that \\"we know that by 'Eternity' the seventh part of 311,040,000,000,000 years, or an age of Brahma is meant.\\" (I, 206). Well, that's news to me. I thought eternity meant forever. It felt like eternity reading this tortuous book."},{"Title":"The secret doctrine;: The synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy","review":"Speaking as one who is interested in reading comments about the Secret Doctrine, it seems that reviews should be of the book and not the life story of an unrelated person who has nothing to do with the book (swooten@icok.net).

Now I love myself a good non-fiction book and it is read the quicker for actually being written with some wit. This book was about as exciting as picking up a dictionary for me though.

Instead, this book is a series of unimaginative and uneven dialogues between woodenly uninteresting child-characters. Too bad, given that there are few stories written in that setting. The story begins in an abandoned foreman's house along a minor canal system. The lead female character, Etta, is in the house eating the nuts she has found there when the lead male character, Walter, a boy who is living in the house, finds her. Written in Etta's voice, we hear the flat dull thoughts as they go through her mind, or as she expresses them to Walter. She is an orphan with siblings. She needs a place to live. Walter, who has his own problems, tells her she must leave, but changes his mind without reason. A third child character enters, but the dialogue goes on in the same dumbed-down way, sprinkled with the odd modern idiom, as they plow through the story trying to find employment and stability. I found it difficult to sympathize with the plight of the characters, and reading the story became a chore rather than a pleasure. The best part of the book comes at the end: A few historical notes give us some background. This brief afterward reinforced the disappointment I felt in the story; given the lush and interesting setting, it could have been a much better story."},{"Title":"Through the Lock","review":"Spunky Etta, 11, has had enough of the foster homes. She runs away from her last hoping to find a place that she and her brother and sister can be together. That dream of being a family once again keeps Etta's spirit going. She finds an old foreman's cabin that has been squatted by Walter, 12, who is hiding out from his father, the town drunk. Together, with their friend Jake, they make a home for themselves and Etta finds herself belonging to a different kind of family. Hurst drew me in from page one with Etta's humor and non-stop chatter. The dialogue was good, description great, and the plot interesting enough to keep me turning the pages. Although some parts were predictable and I thought there could be a bit more tension with her brother and sister and if they would be coming to live with her or not - it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Experiencing the Power of the Cross: How It Changes Everything","review":"This book comes at a time in my life when many of my ideas about myself, life, relationships with others and with God have been challenged by the profound trauma of divorce. As I struggle to re-establish my identity as a single-again person, Dr. Kinnaman's insights, derived from scripture and from his astute observations of life, have shown me how the Cross is THE path to my true identity, my identity in Christ, as well as to a new life in the reality of God.In this book, Dr. Kinnaman has condensed into the language of today more than three decades of practical experience communicating God's truth. It's easy to read, yet a profound witness not only to the glory of the Cross, but also to the total relevance of the Cross to daily living."},{"Title":"Experiencing the Power of the Cross: How It Changes Everything","review":"Didn't really enjoy reading this book, in fact I quit in the last chapter or so. The subject matter is great, but the method that it was presented didn't appeal to me."},{"Title":"Experiencing the Power of the Cross: How It Changes Everything","review":"Experiencing the Power of the Crossby Gary KinnamanExperiencing the Power of the Cross by Gary Kinnaman provides readers with a fresh new look at the cross. Using exampes from pop culture favorites like The Matrix and The Lords of the Ring, Kinnamon reaches across generations with the message of the cross. The author also uses very relatable examples from his own life. The book is broken down into three parts.(1) Crossing GateIn the first section, the author tackles the \\"new\\" reality Christians encounter as they grow more like Christ. Using the movie The Matrix as a platform, he describes the cross as \\"being an entry point into another world, another dimension, a reality of ulimate freedom.\\" Readers are provided with an introduction to the cross in a chapter called \\"The Cross 101?. This section is wrapped up with a lesson on the importance of Jesus' sacrifice versus the Old Testament sacrifices.(2) Cross PurposeThe author outlines seven practical theological points about the cross. Scripture is included at the end of each chapter for readers to meditate as they observe Lent.(3) Cross WayThe author uses the word scandalous quite a bit in this last section and rightly so! When you think about the Christian lifesyle, every action or behavior is called to go against the norm. This section probes the reader to examine their current lifestyle in relation to the cross. The last chapter in this section (and the book) profoundly summarizes what the cross experience is all about... FORGIVENESS. This chapter alone gives the readers plenty to think about especially if one has had problems with forgiveness.--Tyora Moody"},{"Title":"Experiencing the Power of the Cross: How It Changes Everything","review":"When you see the cross, what comes to mind? It is clearly a symbol of Christianity. For most of us it was brought into a more serious light when we watched the movie \\"The Passion of the Christ, but recognizing its real significance goes even deeper.Gary Kinnaman's book is a practical, contemporary look into unlocking the supernatural power of the cross in our life.How do I give you a short, one page description of this book? I found so much wisdom and teachings that give me so much to think about and to ponder, that I was tempted to write several pages on each chapter in an effort to share some of the insight. But Mr. Kinnaman did it so well; I'll leave it to him.\\"For the person who meets Christ, everything changes and nothing changes. In one sense, everything stays the same. Same house, same furniture. Same relationships, same job. On the other hand, how you understand the ordinary and daily routines of life changes dramatically. Every day becomes God's day, and every moment is a sacrament.\\" Page22I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Experiencing the Power of the Cross\\". The author drew me on from point to point, making each detail, that I have read and studied about many times, seem profoundly new. In the book, he often encourages readers to study certain parts of theBible in preparation for his teaching. Mr. Kennaman writes clearly and in a straight-forward manner making it equally understandable to the seasoned Christian or a new believer. Be prepared to take your time. This book is so easily read that you may be tempted to continue chapter to chapter in one sitting, but I suggest that you stop to prayerfully consider the depth of meaning in each chapter before moving on to the next.The book includes a Scripture reading plan for the Lenten and Easter season. Read it now and then make a point to come back to it at the beginning of Lent.Gary Kinnaman is senior pastor of Word of Grace Church in Mesa, Arizona. He has written several other books including \\"Angels Dark and Light,\\" all of which I plan to read in the near future.

In this work, the author has our hero, Jason DinAlt kidnapped from his adopted planet, the hostile planet of Pyrrus, and taken to an equally uninviting world, and as with the first novel, is forced to survive using his wit, cunning and, to a certain extent, physical strength (which he, by the way, has had to develop on Pyrrus simply to survive). This new planet is one that has been colonized in the distant past by humans, but rather than advance, the isolated humans have sunk into complete barbarianism, practically into the stone age in some cases, and into the early bronze age at best. While they have retained bits and pieces of former known technology, although they now consider it \\"magic,\\" they are for the most part, very, very low tech and very primitive in their life style. This story is of Jason's survival on this planet, without his technology, and with the exception of one not so nice individual (the man who kidnapped him), he is completely alone.As with the first novel, we have SiFi adventure at its best. There is plenty of action, plenty of great situations that our hero must manipulate himself through and some unforgettable characters introduced. Harrison's character development is at its best here and his story telling abilities shine through. The author has a great sense of humor and it shows in his writing. Our hero, Jason DinAlt's quirky outlook on the world and life, is quite pragmatic and it is interesting to see how the author plays our hero's outlook and philosophy against the various situations he encounters.This book was first published in 1964 which is about the time I read it for the first time. I am one of those individuals who will reread a book several times, if I like it. I have been rereading this one about ever two or three years since my first read over 40 years ago, and must admit to be still enjoying the story as much as the first time I read it. Sometimes old works get lost and forgotten. This is certainly one work that is rather timeless and certainly one that should be available to the current readers. To be honest, in my humble opinion, it is far better than some of the fiction in this genre that is being turned out today. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Deathworld 2","review":"A pretty good and fast-paced adventure tale, I suppose you could call it a planetary romance; a spacefaring thief is shipwrecked on a planet inhabited by various barbaric/medieval tribes. In his efforts to get back to interplanetary society, Harrison's smartass hero plays the part of a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, introducing various pieces of technology to the primitive world. The novel is enlivened (some might say encumbered) by Harrison's attacks on religion and advocacy of moral relativism. Deathworld 2 is no masterpiece, but is definitely fun if you take it in the right spirit. I read the September 1964 Bantam paperback with the beautifully sinister brown painting on the cover and the ad for Winston Churchill's The Second World War on the last page."},{"Title":"Deathworld 2","review":"For sure one of the best deathworlds. i really bringsout the best sifi for sifi fans"},{"Title":"Diario de Mi Embarazo: A Day-to-Day Guide to a Healthy and Happy Pregnancy (In Spanish)","review":"Day by day you track the development of your growing baby, this is amazing and also helps your expecting time be not so tired and long.

Concerned about the pagan worldview upon which the Greeks and Romans based their beliefs and practices, homeschoolers are torn between academic excellence and honoring God's command to have nothing to do with paganism. The very basis of American government and language is Roman, and yet Roman culture and history are steeped in pagan idolatry.Aware of the need for a biblical study of ancient history, Robin Sampson published Ancient History: Adam to Messiah, a compilation of seven Heart of Wisdom unit studies covering ancient history from a biblical perspective: Adam to Abraham, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Israel, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and The Messiah. Heart of Wisdom units present history from a biblical worldview based on bible narratives with corresponding global events.Ancient History: Adam to Messiah uses the unique Heart of Wisdom approach to learning. The Heart of Wisdom approach is a thorough 4 step system of instruction that combines the Charlotte Mason approach and the 4Mat learning system developed by Dr. Bernice McCarthy. Each lesson includes a motivating introduction to the subject, fact gathering, hands-on work/creativity, and narration/review. The lessons use these 4 steps to teach to each of the 4 types of learners, ensuring that the units will be useful to children with different learning styles. The activities are an excellent blend of facts and fun, with enough choices to please homeschoolers without overwhelming them. Resources are also well explained, with specific chapters/pages to read for each activity. The author has taken great care to present a variety of activities while keeping planning time to a minimum for the busy homeschooling parent.While the study of ancient times gives students an understanding of history and our current world, the main goal of Heart of Wisdom studies is that the units will illuminate God's Word. As the author puts it, &quot;[t]o fully comprehend our Christian faith, we should have a complete understanding of our Hebrew heritage. As Christians, we study a Hebrew book written by Hebrews; we serve a Hebrew Lord who had Hebrew disciples; we desire to follow the first-century church, was first predominately Hebrew; and through Christ, we are grafted into a Hebrew family! It therefore makes sense to study the Hebrew culture and its effect of world history.&quot; Ancient History is a bible-first curriculum. The study of history is important but is secondary to studying God's word and examining everything else in its light. Each year that the curriculum is used the family will read through the entire bible as an integral part of the curriculum using The Narrated Bible, an easy to read, chronologically organized NIV version.Each of the units is a multi-level study which guides students in grades 4-12 through the creation of several resource books, including a Time Line Book, a Portfolio, a Vocabulary Notebook, a Spelling Notebook, and a Greek and Hebrew Notebook. The units are designed to encourage delight-directed studies and a lifestyle of learning. There are several recommended resources to use with each unit, most of which can be found at libraries and bookstores. The units also make extensive use of supplemental resources found on the Internet. The text of the book is online and once the book is purchased, users have access to continually updated web-based resources to supplement each lesson. Not only is the student learning the unit itself, but is also continually exposed to modern technology as a part of everyday life.Robin Sampson has created an excellent curriculum. The introductory information explaining how to use the book is concise and easy to understand, and the layout of the book is consistent and well-organized. Ancient History: Adam to Messiah is a refreshing unit study curriculum that will delight anyone interested in history unit studies with a biblical worldview."},{"Title":"Ancient History : Adam to Messiah","review":"This is the best curriculum I have ever seen and/or used in the secular or Christian homeschool market- bar none! Nothing compares to it at all!! According to the kids- and me! However, it is tied in popularity- according to our children, not just me-with one other Hebrew based curriculum that had activities more to their liking (not so much writing all the time, every lesson, but more visual things ready made, to aid them), but it does not use internet links, which we LOVE. So we blend both curriculums together when possible. Thus we will continue to use HOW. It is extremely comprehensive in it's coverage of a subject. Nothing is left out. Plus- you don't have to buy any key resource books if you cannot afford it. You can use the internet links and still cover everything in detail! So it is quite economical for families with small budgets. THAT is liberating in itself! We loved all the internet links. There was no way you could NOT learn, or miss something with the abundance of links for each e-book. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for the truth in history/science told in a non-threatening way. Not doctrinal teachings, but the actual truth, no matter where that leads for your children and you. And what could be more Biblical than that?This has been a life-changing experience for our entire family. We spend more time together in God's Word and are growing in our understanding together! Learning Israel's history has been a tremendous benefit to understanding all of history, past, present, and future. Also, learning about our Hebrew roots has brought new life to our relationship with God thru Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Ancient History : Adam to Messiah","review":"This is an excellent book.The studies on the ancients are tremendous,like nothing we have ever done before.I had used other units to try and study this time period,and was not impressed.But,this one fits the bill.It is a christian based unit and I love studying about the related materials and NOT about the false gods of the time periods.Using the Bible as a literature text sure hooked me on this too.It is easy to use and not at all rigid.We are loving it and this is a rare treat and blessing to our family.Not only is this for young people,but-older people as well.We did get the Family Feasts book by Robin as well.This works great with this unit.I highly recommend you to get this unit.You will love it-your child will too.This is a treat!And,you can use it for either 1 year or two years.It is all listed and explained in the book.Get this while you can.Well worth the money.I do not think that you can transfer the internet links on here,If you buy it used,that is.The only way this can be done is if you buy it new.If you bought it used-it would had to not been signed up under the other person.But...there is enough in the unit that you will not miss anything by not having that."},{"Title":"Ancient History : Adam to Messiah","review":"I purchased this book with lots of hope for its usefulness.

It truly was an eye-opener regarding the commonly held notions of this period in British history.Reading this book, I learned --- among many other surprising things --- that &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; was not really so bloody, that &quot;Good Queen Bess&quot; was not really so good, that the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; was not all that glorious, and that maybe England might have been better off had King Henry VIII controlled his passion and greed and left things as he had found them.If nothing else Cobbett's book provides a fascinating alternative viewpoint to what we learned in school. (And he is not afraid to cite his sources in footnotes so readers may check his accuracy.)"},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"William Cobbett's book is extraordinarily well done and terribly important. The author presents the bloody and horrible story of the persecution of Holy Church in England and Ireland from the time of Henry VIII to the reign of George III. This book is even more interesting in light of the fact that it was rendered by a Protestant expositor, who understood the persecution of Holy Church and the devastating impact of that persecution from a political and economic, rather than from a theological, perspective.Cobbett does an exceptional job of linking together the bloody reformation of Henry VIII with the regicide of Charles I, the usurpation of England's last Catholic monarch, James II, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution. Evidently, Cobbett inspired both Belloc and Chesterton. Those who love the histories of Belloc will be well served by reading Cobbett's important contribution. His description of the ecomomic ramifications of the persecution of Catholicism in the British Isles is astounding. And his identification of the tremendous contributions of Catholicism to the glory that was England is equally important and interesting.Read this very important book. And be richly blessed, and well informed by the experience."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"Cobbett wrote this energetic and vitriolic history of the Reformation in the early 1800's. It turned conventional wisdom on its head and influenced many high-powered pro-Catholic intellectuals, including Hilaire Belloc and GK Chesterton. Cobbett's basic premise is that the Reformation destroyed the social fabric of England, which had been sewn together so elegantly under nine centuries of Catholic influence and rule. His detailed account of Henry VIII's profligacy, the rapacious deeds of his political heirs and allies, and the havoc they wrought upon the citizenry, especially the poor citizenry, make a supremely convincing argument. Although Cobbett wields a venomous pen, he researched his subject well and appears to have most of his facts straight. And although he interprets the facts in the worst possible light, there is no getting around the one simple fact that greed, lust and hatred motivated many of England's \\"reformers\\". Cobbett's style is conversational--as if he were writing you a letter, almost--and is remarkably readable for a work of that period. I think any investigation of the Reformation should include this book!"},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"In some arguments with authentic Protestants of the Luther and Calvin vein, I learned for the first time that an authentic protestant does not consider the protestant 'conversion' in England to be a real one. Due to the passage of time and insufficient coverage and study of the Reformation, it was by generalized usage, that the Protestant move of England was lumped in with Calvin and Luther and Protestant thinking on the continent and also in Scotland.This book, after which I do believe Cobbett did jail time, is so much proof that the English Reformation was one bent on pillage, looting and thievery of the highest order. The systematic looting of the manastaries, and the installment of the best and most productive thiefs into the House of Lords, thereby enshrining the families who stole the most from monastaries and hospitals and convents into the government of England up until the present day, is absolute proof of that sham called English Protestantism. The same 'Lords' installed during this time period, where the same Lords and horrendous monarchy that the United States had to break away from. This is the history that this book lays forth, and by and English Protestant no less. Do not let other reviewers fool you, Cobbett was at no phase of his life, keen on kneeling before the Pope.This book is not propaganda, while the book is written in the stlye of an argument, the events, the lootings, and the revolts against the 'Protestants' all over England are given play. Also the horror of industrialism etc., did occur as feared by Cobbett in the forms of all the child labor used in England, as well as the sale of white slaves (see my other reviews) from England Ireland and Scotland.This book allows you to make first, the leap that Protestant thought as developed by Luther and Calvin was partially adopted in England FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF LOOTING THE CAHTOLIC CHURCH, and secondly, you will need no other proof that the English monarchy is so decrepid as to demand every free person mock them all in their graves. Diana and Charles were certainly worthy heirs to that system, as Cobbett, on every page, will tell you."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"Preface, by Francis Cardinal Gasquet. This famous and highly respected work will be an eye-opening education for the person accustomed to the bland, factless, churchless, accepted &quot;history&quot; found in so many books today. It is a tragic depiction of the loss of millions upon millions of souls to the Catholic Faith, but very worth reading for getting the entire story straight - and all by a Protestant writer. This was written between 1824 and 1827 and has been reprinted many times by Catholic publishers because it gives the true and usually untold story of the Protestant Revolt in England during the 16th century. Even though a Protestant, the author shows that England was better when it was Catholic. For example, during Catholic times there was greater prosperity, no penury, no poor laws, almost no crime, no income tax, and a greater national military strength. Whereas, with the &quot;Reformation&quot; came the destruction of the monasteries, the driving of countless thousands of tenant farmers from the lands they had formerly rented (virtually in perpetuity and at cheap rents) from the Catholic monasteries, the creation of a vast number of homeless poor, the subsequent poor laws, income tax, a diminished military capacity, despotism by the monarchs, the Puritan Revolt, dictatorship of Cromwell, an increase of taxation, the rise of the national debt, and finally the American Revolution. Wow! Great stuff!"},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":". . . comes from \\"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\\" -- then you really need to read this book! It will sharply adjust your perspective!This volume, written by an English Protestant, goes to great lengths to detail the events leading up to the English Reformation, straight through to the reign of King George III. He documents the many atrocities committed through the years against Catholics and the Catholic Church -- atrocities that most history books conveniently omit.Of special interest to me and my personal research was the author's documentation on the economic collapse in England which was directly attributable to King Henry VIII's sack of the monasteries (and the author's fears of an Industrial Revolution were amply fulfilled and documented in the novels of Charles Dickens).Highly recommended as a sharp dose of reality!"},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"This history is a very interesting alternative version of what the \\"reformation\\" in England was all about, and I did get a lot out of reading it. However, the copy mistakes were the worst I have ever seen. I found the many misprints very distracting, making the text difficult to read. Also it has omitted paragraphs #346-373, which confuses Cobbitt's train of thought. You can find this book online without the mistakes and read it for free. Unless you want to keep a print copy, that's a much better deal."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"Honesty in the telling of English History in the media, movies (Cate Blanchett had to admit the history portrayed in her Q.E. 1ST movie was bunkum) and school room is a rare animal these days.In this book we are presented with facts that make sense of the need of the British establishment to later hire Whig historians to whitewash the criminal barbarity of the English reformation in the learning institutes of England.The facts of the demonic degree of Protestant barbarity are such that the Anti-Catholic propaganda that was concocted after the fact sound so made-up and ludicrously exaggerated to our ears today.I guess their own crimes where such that even bigger monstrosities were required to cover them up. I note the few people who have negated this book can't but fail to address the historical facts and research contained in this book regarding the true motivational forces behind an event that has brought misery to the 4 corners of the earth.That this book was written by a Protestant makes it all the more remarkable and valuable.If a sister book was to be recommended I would say \\"The Facts about Luther\\" is the ideal companion read.This book also quotes mostly Protestant historians in damning that foolish man who admitted in his own writings that his \\"doctrines\\" came from the devil.Go figure..."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"John Henry Newman wrote inAn Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrinethat \\"to be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant.\\" Newman was referring to the Church Fathers but his observation could also apply to more recent - say, perhaps Reformation era - history, and one could not find a more colorful and entertaining explanation of that period than William Cobbett's \\"A History of the Protestant Reformation in England and Ireland.\\"Cobbett was a Protestant member of that church \\"by law established\\", and a conservative in the true sense of the word.Chesterton wrote of himthat \\"what he saw was not an Eden that cannot exist but rather an Inferno that can\\"; and like all conservatives who take mind to look into the matter, Cobbett developed a profound respect for the Catholic Church and its cultural traditions. \\"When Cobbett found that what he conceived to be a truth had been concealed by a trick,\\" continues Chesterton, \\"his reaction was a towering passion.\\"This \\"towering passion\\" of Cobbett's turned into his History of the Reformation, and reading this work is essential to understanding the virulent anti-\\"popish\\" sentiment that arose and persists in our Protestant dominated culture. More importantly, it explains exactly what was lost in that strong-arm, government-led riot of thieves against the Catholic religion in England that literally crushed, murdered, and intimidated so much of its citizenry. The unintended consequences have thundered down the centuries, as what was formerly known as Christendom sinks deeper and deeper under the waves of lunacy. The men who had given us Magna Carte, habeas corpus and a thousand years of culture where wiped away, and in their place were exchanged standing armies, skyrocketing taxes, central banking, and public debt.Cobbett, arguing with all the subtlety of a bulldog, uses a framework in which there is not one single Reformation playing out, but really a series of five Reformations:1. The first or the \\"godly\\" Reformation of Henry, Edward and Elizabeth.2. The second or the \\"thorough godly\\" Reformation of Cromwell and his Roundheads3. The third or \\"glorious\\" Reformation of William and Mary.4. The fourth Reformation or the American Revolution when America rebelled from being treated by the Crown like - well, like Catholics.5. The fifth Reformation or the French Revolution where France followed the English template to destroy the Church, and ended up nearly destroying the whole of Europe.What is particularly notable in this book is how some of Cobbett's passages could be pulled from today's headlines. In describing the bastardization of England's economy in the 5th year of William and Mary, he writes:\\"Thus arose loans, funds, banks, bankers, banknotes, and a national debt ; things that England had never heard or dreamed of before this war [against \\"popery\\"] for preserving the Protestant religion as by law established ; things without which she had had a long and glorious career of many centuries, and had been the greatest and happiest country in the world.... the ancient philosophers, the Fathers of the Church, both Testaments, the Canons of the Church, and the decisions of Pope and Councils, all agree, all declare that to take money for the use of money is sinful. Indeed, no such thing was ever attempted to be justified until the savage Henry VIII had cast off the supremacy of the Pope.... It is certain that before the 'Reformation' there was no such thing known amongst Christians as receiving money or profit in any shape, merely for the use of money. It would be easy to show that mischiefs enormous are inseparable from such a practice, but we shall see enough of those mischiefs in the end. Suffice it for the present, that this national usury, which was now invented for the first time, arose out of the Reformation.\\"As I write this in 2012, it is worth pausing to look at the abuses of banking, debt and usury, and the misery it has created in the midst of plenty.The book is organized around the following chapters:1. Introduction2. Henry VIII - The Divorce.3. Henry VIII - The Royal Supremacy.4. Henry VIII - Tyranny of Henry VIII5. Henry VIII - The Dissolution of the Monasteries6. Henry VIII - Confiscation of the monasteries7. Edward VI8. Mary9. Mary and Elizabeth10. Elizabeth - The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew11. Elizabeth - Hypocrisy of Elizabeth on the death of Mary Stuart12. The Stuarts13. The Charges against James II and Their Refutation14. Results of the Reformation - Triumph of William III in England and Ireland15. Results of the Reformation - The American Revolution the First Cause of Catholic Relief16. Impoverishment and Degradation of the People by the ReformationI highly recommend \\"A History of the Protestant Reformation in England and Ireland\\" - it reads very quickly, and Cobbett's witty, sardonic style is very entertaining. Bishop Francis Aidan Gasquet's preface and notes are helpful in documenting (and correcting in a few places) Cobbett's sources - which by the way is mostly from Dr. John Lingard's \\"The History Of England, From the First Invasion by the Romans to the Accession of Henry VIII.\\""},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"I assume that it is common in former British colonies like the United States to have a fairly tilted view of things. After all, the Brits and French have been trying to out-snob each other since at least 1066. Nevertheless, until recently, I was unaware of the extent of this tacit anglophilia.Cobbett's book is a key step in reconstructing an alternate history of the rise of British dominance. It is certainly worth note that his predictions of doom & gloom for Britain did not bear out, and the seeds of the industrial revolution that he deplored as a result of Protestant reformation were to eventually lead to a depth of world prosperity that puts his recitations of the daily diet of the yoeman to shame.While keeping in mind that this is a work of propaganda, it should be simultaneously borne in mind that this is really a work of counterpropaganda. I don't really buy the \\"Cobbett was a Protestant\\" argument, as his vitriol is a little thick for a sustaining member of that segment. Nevertheless, the viewpoint he brings is worthy of note in that it is seldom heard with respect to the truisms of English History.I would like to see a historical refutation (note that I refuse to say \\"an historical refutation\\", because I pronounce my \\"h's\\"). Cobbett certainly argues for the veracity of his own data.This book will anger you or amuse you, alternatively. It's a nice study in how grudges get carried on for centuries. It's also a nice example of how time can accomplish great things, transforming Elizabeth into a movie star and Philip II into a historical nonentity.Well worth the read, if slightly high-spirited."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"William Cobbett couldn't write anything bad, but this one must surely appeal mostly to historians. There are the letters (300 or so of them if I've counted correctly) and also a large appendix listing all the properties seized from the Catholic Church during the English reformation. This by itself represents a huge amount of research effort and I think I'm going to find out what actual experts - not me - think of its background and genesis.Read and enjoy Cottage Economy, Rural Rides and so on.Cobbett is a master of invective, of hypocrisy, and of Englishness.Long may he be read."},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"Cobbett's work is so laced with invective and discrimination, that he does injustice to his own contention (as described by Francis Cardinal Gasquet) that \\"Viewed in its social aspect, the English Reformation was in reality the rising of the rich against the poor\\" (pp. vi). A vastly superior (though quite difficult) work with this same premise is Eamon Duffy's \\"The Stripping Of The Altars.\\""},{"Title":"A history of the Protestant reformation in England and Ireland","review":"This is a poorly written political tract from a very long time ago. The author's goal is to show that England and Ireland were a utopia before the reformation. The idea is that England even up to the 1800s was a shadow of its \\"glory days\\" before Henry VIII. Its a strange set of ideas, but not the strangest in the book.The author at one point in the book shows his basic ignorance of history by claiming that there had been no church and no christians before the reformation who were not Roman Catholics. Its of course uncertain if he is unaware of the Eastern Church or does not consider them christians. But either way he has it wrong.The book goes off the deep end in its analysis of the American Revolution. Quote: \\"The American Revolution, which, as we have seen, grew directly out of those measures which had been adopted in England to crush the Catholics and to extinguish their religion for ever\\"The French Revolution is seen as simply a logical continuation of the reformation. He views the French revolutionaries as being not much different than Henry VIII.Its history and its arguments are so inaccurate and/or strange that there is very little value in anything the book has to say. It has worth as a historical curiousity, but not as a serious book."},{"Title":"Praying for Power: Buddhism and the Formation of Gentry Society in Late-Ming China (Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph)","review":"This is not a book for those new to Chinese studies. While Brook's Confusions of Pleasure and Quelling the People are both written to be easily understandable, this book grew out of his Harvard dissertation and, though fascinating, is not readily accessible to everyone. Those familiar with Ming or ancient world history will know of the monetization of the world economy in the 1500's due to massive amounts of precious metals coming from the Spanish New World.Much of this money flowed into China, 'freeing' wealth from land ownership and allowing merchants to become truly powerful in China for the first time. The gentry, the level of Chinese society that controlled land and society through the law, symbolic support of cultural keystones and government service, were suddenly in competition with merchants' sons for these bureaucratic posts that defined a large portion of their self-image. Brook's book looks at the mid- to late-Ming defense of status undertaken by the gentry through support of the Sangha, or Buddhist church.Their monopoly on education, government service and wealth undermined, the gentry connected themselves to 'the people' through the support of the Sangha and to each other through cultivation of artistic tastes. While Craig Clunas is the expert on the latter phenomenon, Brook explains the former in this book. Exploring the gentry culture, dispelling ideas of conflicts between Confucianism and Buddhism and summarizing huge socioeconomic shifts in China, Brook has written an important book. Any reader who has read through the long sentences and generalizations in this review can make it through Brook's work, which is no more unclear and is far more interesting than my review. All those versed in basic history and interested in social shifts should read this work, but those trying to begin a study of China or of the Ming should not begin with this complicated work."},{"Title":"Ruth Bell Graham's Collected Poems","review":"I first discovered Ruth Bell Graham's poetry in her book titled Sitting By My Laughing Fire, now out of print, in the early 80s.

The author tends to focus most of her attention on the Hamm's Bear, a well-known product mascot to be sure, but hardly the reason why many beer drinkers were so drawn to the label in the 1960s. While the Hamm's Bear was cute for women and kids, the author completely ignores the impact of the famous and mesmerizing Hamm's beer signs from the '50s and '60s. For any Hamm's fan, this is a glaring and unforgiveable omission given the enduring popularity of these signs.Hamm's was unique in allowing its advertisers to sell more than just another type of beer. The name \\"Hamm's\\" evoked a place, a state of mind, \\"The Land of Sky Blue Waters.\\" This message was manifested through a brilliant combination of slogans, music, and (especially) through electric signs. No other ad campaign ever matched the evocative association between product and region, between a glass of beer and an idealized representation of nature. That is why neon beer signs and other more mundane breweriana items are a dime-a-dozen, while Hamm's signs are passed down as family heirlooms. It is strange how modern advertisers overlook such an example. Even more strange is why it was overlooked in this book.The book is thin on content and would have benefitted greatly from color graphics and photos, but it is still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Paws of Refreshment -- The Story of Hamm's Beer Advertising","review":"it was in great shape and brought back lots of memories.

I've actually had thermodynamics, both series, and the problems in this book begin at the highest difficulty. Worse, the book does a particularly poor job relaying any information you would need to successfully do the problems.You will need a strong statistical background (I wish two series of Calc based Statistics was enough, but it clearly isn't) and a strong background into deciphering cryptic problems that are significantly more difficult than any examples in the chapters.

The clarity of presentation in this book is matched only by Landau's texts. You'll be amazed when doing the problems by just how much interesting physics you can do with just the fundamental relation of thermodynamics and the canonical formalism. Don't be turned off by the length of this book (&gt;600 pages); the reason for this is not overly wordy descriptions (i.e, Griffiths), but simply huge amount of material presented (Griffiths would take over 1000 pages to chat about the same amount of material).Perhaps the best praise I can give this book is that not only did it teach me stat mech, it really sparked my interest in the field of condensed matter physics, enough to contemplate my choosing this as a research topic in grad school."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"Reif reads like thermodynamics is a brand new result and he has written the first giant paper on it. Not only does this book cover every area under the Sun, from the law of mass action to kinetic theory, but he develops each topic in a formal way, with logical consistency and that curious, gray-haired insight.I continually look to Reif when more \\"advanced\\" books fumble explanations. With the firm conceptual grounding I get there, I can then intuit what other authors are trying to convey. How many astute readers of other thermodynamics textbooks have any idea when Boltzmann's canonical distribution can be used? Or who know the difference between this and Boltzmann's equation?If you are an instructor, the illuminating end-of-chapter problems will be a boon. If you are a student, they will also be, yet less appreciated likely. No matter who you are, if you want to really know thermo and stat mech and are willing to _think_, then buy this book before some competing, flashy, colorized textbook drives it out of print."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"Never mind that this book was published in the mid '60s (before I was even born); if you must choose one book to learn from, choose this one. It is so concise, so well thought out that I have yet to encounter a more instructive text on the subject. It contains a fabulous overview of statistical and thermal physics, and -even though the book contains quite a lot of material- I regret that the author (quote) &quot;resisted the tempation to include applications of Onsager's reciprocity relations&quot; and other irreversible phenomena. I used to teach physics and chemistry, and I must say that books of this quality just don't seem to be written these days. Given the inherent subtlety of its subject matter and the problems many students have grasping it I therefore strongly recommend using this book to study from."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"This book is all business. There are two disclaimers I must make before continuing, though: 1) You ABSOLUTELY MUST be fairly well versed in thermal physics and basic statistics before you can read this book without hitches and 2) In the intro, it is stated that this book is useful for advanced undergraduate course in thermodynamics, which is false. I cannot conceive of a class of undergraduates that possesses the macro-level knowledge of thermal physics necessary to handle this text, as it is one with an undeniable statical mechanical slant.The aforementioned caveats aside, it is difficult for me to imagine a better text for a first-year graduate level course in thermodynamics. The book flows well. I found myself flying through the chapters. The problems seem difficult, but I think that has to do with the style of the questions, because, by the time you are half way through the book, the problems seem to get easier.My single complaint about the book was that there is too much math in some areas where more words are needed. In particular, I think there needed to be more explanation given when discussing the differential equations associated with C-sub v and C-sub p. It got to the point where my professor was confused. This is possibly the only error in the book, as far as I am aware, but, then again, it might not have been an error. This book is, otherwise, a conceptually outstanding book.What I found interesting about this book, since the thermal physics was represented from an entirely statistical perspective, is that I realized that the thermodynamics of the 19th century through the turn of the 20th century are philosophically reducible to the modern conception of thermodynamics from a wholly statistical point of view. I thought that this was very interesting from a philosophy of physics standpoint.Great book!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"1. Since I didn't see this book in print on Amazon I searched on Google and found a place called Waveland Press that seems to have legitimate copies for sale: just search on ISBN 1-57766-612-7 and it should pop up.2. My personal comments on the bookI am a physical chemist who managed to get through college and graduate school without taking a serious course in thermodynamics. For some reason I never warmed up to that subject and I avoided it like the plague. When I was at Berkeley they offered an option for first year grad students to \\"test out\\" of the mandatory thermodynamics course. By cramming from Callen I managed to pass that test and avoid learning my least favorite subject. While at Berkeley I took a 1-semester course on Statistical Mechanics taught from Pathria, and I didn't get much out of that either. I did, however, buy a copy of Reif's 1965 book while in grad school and used it as an occasional reference over the years, but without deep understanding. I promised one day to study it like a college student, and after 25 years I finally got around to it. I worked through the entire book, stopping at the end of each chapter to attempt most of the problems. I was very impressed with Reif's exposition and the quality of most of the problems. (The answers to selected problems at back of book are very cryptic and contain a few typos - I think ;) - but they were still extremely valuable to keep me on track.)I was amused by Reif's comment in the Preface that \\"an author never finishes a book, he merely abandons it.\\" While reading, I kept an eye out for what Reif might have been referring to when he wrote that comment. For sure, Ch. 14 did not work for me. I suspect that Reif would have done a major overhaul on Ch. 14 if he had done a second edition. Ch. 8 is also a little weak and seems rushed. I suspect this is another chapter Reif wanted to rewrite before he abandoned his project. Most of the other chapters are excellent. The intro to Ch. 10 (pp. 404-6 in my copy) is a beautiful example of clear exposition -- it made things I sort of knew already come into better focus. For a book that never saw a second edition, it is remarkably free of typos and errata. The author obviously put enormous care and effort into this textbook. It has stood the test of time well._____________________________________________________________________If you are having problems warming up to thermodynamics, I also recommend the following three slender and inexpensive Dover books which I read before Reif as part of my penance:1. H. C. van Ness, \\"Understanding Thermodynamics.\\" [In Ch. 3 of this book van Ness captures precisely how I felt about thermo in college: \\"The problem in teaching thermodynamics is that the most difficult, the most confusing, and the least interesting material is presented first, and the early applications are usually at best trivial and at worst misleading.\\"]2. E. Fermi, \\"Thermodynamics.\\" Only 155 pages, a few problems at the end of each chapter (much easier than Reif), very clearly presented, very few typos.3. M. Planck, \\"Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics.\\" I was surprised by how fun this book was to read, especially Lectures 2 and 6. (Lecture 2 forms a nice complement to Reif's Chapter 8, and Lecture 6 explains Planck's thought process leading up to the blackbody radiation formula and all the results that flow from it like magic. Lecture 6 also documents Planck's resistance to the photon concept as late as 1909: \\"J.J. Thompson inclines to the most radical view, as do J. Larmor, A. Einstein, and with him I. Stark, who even believe that the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a pure vacuum does not occur precisely in accordance with the Maxwellian field equations, but in definite energy quanta hv. I am of the opinion, on the other hand, that at present it is not necessary to proceed in so revolutionary a manner...\\")"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"One thing that distinguishes this book from the rest on stat mech is its emphasis on the physical content behind the equations. The author takes great pain to develop and elucidate, at every turn, a coherent physical picture for the edifice of statistical mechanics, in much the same style as the classic book by Tolman. However, if you are learning stat mech/thermo for the first time, you probably will be too busy familiarizing yourself with the equations to be able to appreciate the value of his explanations and motivations, which may just seem pointless rants. So, simply, if you are a newbie, try one of the more mediocre textbooks on stat mech, to learn the subject at a superficial level. Once you've mastered the more superficial stuff, you will come around to love this book, assuming that you are a reflective person."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"I simply could not let the idiotic one-star \\"reviews\\" pass without comment. When I first taught a course using this book way back in 1974, I found it remarkably well written, well organized, and full of insight. My students--junior and senior physics majors-- enjoyed it and learned a lot from it, as their test papers demonstrated. (I did find it helpful to supplement Reif with R. Kubo's \\"Statistical Mechanics\\" (still available on Amazon, and in a reasonably priced paperback edition) which consists mainly of problems and solutions.) In fact, I was able to rely on their study of the text to such an extent that we covered (honestly covered, not skimmed) more than half the book in a 13-week term. The end-of-chapter problem sets are excellent; the problems are interesting and instructive. I haven't been as pleased with an upper-level physics text since then (and I've run the gamut from Marion to Griffiths).That said, I must point out a) that this is probably not a good vehicle for self-study, and b) it is much too difficult for recent crops of students, who lack the necessary attention span, patience, and willingness to engage in careful analysis. (The fact that they used introductory physics texts full of superfluous color photos and highlighted \\"word bites\\" means that they are not ready for Reif's elegant, no-nonsense exposition.) But none of the less-demanding statistical physics texts I've used in the intervening years comes close to Reif's flair for expository writing and ability to emphasize essential points."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"This is hands-down the best thermal physics book I know if you want to understand thermal physics at a deep level. This is probably an undesirable book if you only want to apply laws written by others; this is meant to give a firm, complete, general understanding of thermal physics in all applications.I concede that it *may* be too hard for a first course. It *may* be too abstract for a first-timer. I am unsure, as I read this after reading two other standard textbooks. I would argue that thermal physics suffers from the worst textbooks in general; this is one of the bright spots amidst some rather bad thermal books.It does not give cheap cop-outs of how to define things; it does not evade what the definitions of terms are. This is unusual for thermal physics, in my opinion. The arguments are completely pedagogical in nature, as well as rigorous. This is a rare event to accomplish.As a consequence of this book, I can meaningfully describe what temperature is and isn't, especially given that most people can only define temperature based on ideal gases (if you think temperature is a measure of average molecular velocity, as I had been taught for so long, you have been misled...this only applies to ideal gases). Few people are able to understand, let alone explain well, what macroscopic thermal functions are and are not in terms of the microscopic.I return to this book continually."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"I had used this book for two statistical mechanics courses that I had taken: one a graduate level physics course that I had taken as an undergraduate, and one a graduate level metallurgical thermodynamics course that I took as a graduate student. Reif served me well for both of these courses in so far as having provided me with a well-paced development of a statistical approach to thermodynamics. From the point of view of metallurgical thermodynamics, however, this book is not really suitable, as there is no development of solution theory. For metallurgical solution theory the student should read Gaskell:Introduction to Metallurgical Thermodynamics (McGraw-Hill series in materials science and engineering). This omission of solution theory is not really a failing of the book, however, which was clearly not intended for a course in metallurgical thermodynamics--it has more to do with the point of view of the professor who taught metallurgical thermodynamics in my department. Reif does have three good chapters on transport theory, however, including the development of the Boltzmann equation. I have found these chapters on transport theory to have been useful in my research work."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of statistical and thermal physics (McGraw-Hill series in fundamentals of physics)","review":"I'm a junior in college using this textbook for my introductory thermodynamics class, and I think it's a pretty good book.

However, that threat pales when compared to the malevolent beings who plot to bring Kelgrael back under their control with only the Band of Four between them and a repeat of their earlier success of putting the King to sleep.Ed Greenwood escorts his fans back to the Land of the Band of Four with an exciting fantasy tale. The story line stands alone while adding to the mythos established by the previous novel (see THE KINGLESS LAND). The tale works because of the deep characterizations of the Band of Four and their interrelationships, often amusing and competitive yet supportive when needed. The personalities shine through the entertaining plot so fantasy fans will enjoy THE VACANT THRONE; a realm filled with the unbelievable that it feels like Mr. Greenwood cast a believable spell on his audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"Althought the writing is decent, the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. Chat, Flirt, Hack, Die, Chat, Flirt, Hack, Die. Sorry, I hope I didn't spoil anything for anyone. If your looking for a bunch of sensational fights, you'll enjoy the book. If you want a little more depth, try one of his other books."},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through the last one and the this one as well just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series."},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"Well, Greenwood continues to disappoint with THE VACANT THRONE, the second book in his mostly-ignored series staring \\"The Band of Four\\". Even knowing what I was getting into this time (a shallow, silly, and ridiculous distraction), I still found myself let down by this book. Other reviewers have commented on the annoyingness of the characters, the inaneness of the plot, and the over-abundance of (evil) characters, but there is much more than these general complaints to gripe about with this book. Through most of the book, I can't really tell whether Greenwood is trying to be funny by being WAY overly dramatic, or whether he's trying to be dramatic really, which is what I suspect. Completely unexplained groups such as the Faceless Ones or the Melted Ones periodically show up to change the direction of the story for unknown reasons, evil characters that had been previously completely destroyed keep re-appearing, bards and flute-players are a constant annoyance, and the arbitrary use of Thee's and Thou's drives one up the wall. Who does this guy think he is??While I actually did find myself starting to enjoy this book at about the half-way point, as the minimal plot started coming together and I felt the flow of the story begin to be established, that feeling quickly disappeared as I reached the long climax and realized just how irritating and pointless the story had become. When the heroes' plan to attract all of their enemies (plus some) to a extremely dangerous place with no escape route finally begins to work, in comes the totally predictable Dues Ex Machina and the realm is saved again. Wow. Bad.Greenwood did tone down the sluttiness of his only good character here, but honestly, if she's already established as being whorey, why not just run with it? Not Recommended if you've ever read anything decent before in your life."},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"This is a great novel. very suspenceful and adventurous. One of the best band of four novels that he has written. This one is defonetly better then the Kingless Land. It is solid combination of horror,suspence,and fantisy. A very good novel if you love fantisy."},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"I thought the Vacant Throne was a outstanding book. The way it picked up from the Kingless Land was most impressive. It even brought back old foes that made it even harder to put down. It became more darker in it's plot and showed a closer view of the barons in the land that made really interesting. The way the he had Embra and Hawkril coming closer together really got me excited. After all i would have to say this was a great sequel."},{"Title":"The Vacant Throne","review":"Even in lowbrow fantasy, there are some ground rules: you need to like the good guys, dislike the bad guys, and enjoy reading about the heroes using their strength, cleverness and/or innate goodness to triumph in the end. It also helps if there's a finite number of evil schemes going on--say, five. And if you're going to have over forty characters, you need to make sure they're very distinctive so that readers don't get confused and overwhelmed. In this book, on the other hand, the good guys are annoying, the bad guys are annoying, and the heroes go through each fight looking like Bill Gates in the boxing ring with Mike Tyson. It's hard to believe they could rescue a barn from an upset cow, let alone restore a kingdom...and apart from the fact that they're snarky with each other, why should we care about them at all? Maybe if we had more time to get to know them we'd care more, but the 'Dramatis Personae' (at the end of the book, and full of information and backstory that would've made this book less confusing if it'd been placed better) lists 96 characters. In a 319-page book, that works out to a new character every 3.32 pages. Why, why, why??? Oh, and the word 'whelm'? Get used to seeing it a LOT. It's as if the author gets a check from the Whelm Boosters of America every time he slips it in. This author's done better work--maybe it was because of a different editor, or maybe it was because he actually cared about the characters. This book feels to me like someone sitting down with the old notes of a D&amp;D campaign he never actually took part in, and trying to make a book out of it."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"\\"Fever\\", one of Robin Cook's earliest novels, is also one of his better ones. Some were better (\\"Mutation\\"), but it's much better than some of his recent works (\\"Abduction\\" and \\"Vector\\"). Like many of his novels, the premise varies little from novel to novel.This tale centers around a twelve year old girl who has developed a form of leukemia. Her father, a doctor/scientist who has studied and searched for a cure for cancer for the past nine years following the death of his wife to leukemia, is suddenly having to deal with his nightmares again. He has since remarried, but soon conflicts arise between the father and his wife, oldest son, and the doctors who prescribe chemotherapy treatment for his daughter.The father soon discovers the cause of his daughter's leukemia. That source was also the cause of another child's fatal disease. The father subsequently tries to bring the culprits to justice and continue his work while also trying to find his own cure for his daughter. The believability factor is strained a bit here.Cook does a masterful job of relaying the tension between the father and his family, but his description and reactions of the girl do seem to fit better with a younger child and not one twelve years of age. Like many of his novels, there is corporate greed entwined with government agencies. Even though it's a bit farfetched, Cook makes it work with his skillful writing. Overall, any fan of Cook or medical thrillers in general should enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"Action packed race against time to find a cure for the 'fever'. A great story of one man trying to beat the system he works for in order to save a loved one. Your frustration grows as the main character meets and must overcome obstacles before it is too late"},{"Title":"Fever","review":"It was very emotional, interesting and wonderfully planned. In short - a great medical thriller! (But too many medical words used.)"},{"Title":"Fever","review":"Robin Cook is one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed this book as much as all of his others. He's created a doctor/researcher who almost breaks down after an incredible number of problems are thrown at him. He's impulsive, but reacts as any of us might under the same pressures. I read the whole thing in one day, unable to put it down. As a mother, I found what happened to his daughter so shocking that I was both horrified by the book, yet unable to put it down. If you have a horror of sick children, you might want to choose another one of his books. But even if this bothers you, I will just say that the ending does justify reading the book."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"A cancer researcher who's daughter is diagnosed with leukemia is suddenly told by the institute that employs him that he should drop his own research to work on project that he doesn't believe in. Benzene found in the river being dumped by a recycling company. All these things add up to another terrific Robin Cook novel.This was a wonderful book. In typical Robin Cook fashion, it doesn't take very many pages before you are hooked. I guess the real thing about this one it the fact that it is all too real. Big business doing anything they can to protect themselves, a research institute that is willing to do almost anything to keep the money flowing in and a child with leukemia, all very real in this time.One of the things I liked best about this book, was the way in which Mr. Cook describes people, places and things without going overboard. He keeps it straight to the point without all the miniscule detail that you see from some authors. In addition, Mr. Cook kept the medical terms to a bare minimum (unusual for him), and the ones he used, he managed to follow-up with a layman's explanation.I guarantee this book will scare the heck out of you. No it's not a scary horror novel, but it will get you to thinking about what is going on in this day and age. Could there really be a cure for cancer that big business is keeping under raps to keep the money flowing in? This book really got me to thinking about things like, millions of dollars flowing into different charities for years and nothing to show for it.Other books I have read by Mr. Cook include Blindsight, Brain, Chromosome Six, Contagion, Godplayer, Harmful Intent, Outbreak and Vector all of which are good and only one that I didn't really like (Brain).If you like medical thrillers, and Dr. Cook, don't pass this one up. You won't be disappointed. If you have never read one of Mr. Cook's books, don't hesitate to start with this one."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"The beginning of this book markets as more as a medical research book than a thriller, but it quickly takes off. The plot is very simple but thrilling. A man's daughter has developed a form of leukemia and he must find the source before it kills her and other children around him. This was Cook's 4th novel and it was one of his most exciting. Its one of my top 5 favorites but none of his books can compare to COMA. Overall, a great read."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"I am a 17 year old senior in high school. We had to pick a book for an anatomy project. I picked this book because it is kind of non fictional.

It also will show you that a family must stand together no matter what and that you must trust your wife or husband. And the end is not out of the reality, at first you will think that that end is not possible, but when you read the explanation of why it can be you will believe it."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"Robin Cook is a prolific medical thriller writer. I've read most of his books. Fever is not one of his best efforts.The plot of Fever is somewhat analogous to \\"Erin Brokovitch\\". A dangerous chemical is leaching into the river from a reclamation plant. The toxin is giving kids cancer. This novel focuses on the medical drama, rather than the legal. The main character, a research physician named Charles, discovers his daughter is dying of leukemia.The diagnosis drives the doctor nuts. He becomes certifiable. He was always self-absorbed; now he's self-absorbed AND crazy. Rather than support his hospitalized daughter, or his terrified wife, he abandons them both to attempt to go macho, and shut down the evil rubber plant all by himself. Other than one funny EPA runaround scene, the book is painful to read for the first half. It is hard to care about a workaholic, stubborn and selfish man, doctor or not. To make sure you pity Charles, Cook has him drive around in a old Pinto. I don't care what kind of car the guy drives. He's still a jerk. Charles rationalizes his idiocy by claiming he's an \\"activist\\" (that means he gets into fist fights and stomps around and alienates people). Cook seems to be attempting to write a character-driven drama describing the implosion of a family due to a child's sickness. It doesn't work, mainly because the implosion has already happened. This family was never happy. Sadly, the females in Fever are typical early Cook--milquetoasts, afraid to stand up for anyone or anything. So the crazy doctor has free reign.If you can bear Charles long enough to get through the first half of the book, there IS a payoff! Once the nutty doctor decides to use his brains instead of his muscles, Fever is great fun. The story becomes a good, suspenseful adventure.But if I weren't so stubborn, I'd never have finished the book and gotten to the end. Hence the two stars."},{"Title":"Fever","review":"I like Robin Cooks novels. Being I have a medical background his novels are always good reading. I'd recommend this one of his.

This book is suspenseful but perhaps a little too detailed for me. Some may like to know exactly how someone is dressed down to a hand-tied bow tie, but not me. There's a lot of medical detail which bored me a little. Although the protagonist was obnoxious, that was okay since it was the author's choice to make the guy like that. It did take awhile for things to really get interesting for me, but I like lot's of action. There were more personality studies in this book that I'm used to. The characters were all believable as was the story line. There wasn't any way-out fantasy stuff that defied credulity.

Entitled _Speak for England, Arthur_, this play within a play is intended to honor the Headmaster, who has announced his retirement and imminent departure after a forty-year career. The play features the faculty, including the new Headmaster, who created and directed it, the Matron, the nurse, and a few of the students, and is intended to remind these (typical) teenagers of the school's traditions. A boys' choir provides musical commentary on the action. Extended vignettes of important events in British history, many of them from war times, provide Bennett with ample opportunity for satire, as the action moves through Edwardian England, the Bloomsbury group, and the two world wars and their aftermath.Nothing is sacred, as Bennett looks backward from his vantage point in 1968, when this play was first produced, to take aim at specific politicians, the Conservatives, the attempts to appease Hitler, the upper classes, traditional religion, hush-hush attitudes toward sexuality, the prejudices and social inequities tolerated in the country, and, ultimately, the values of the past which have changed as times have changed. The new Headmaster, whose values are as liberal as the former Headmaster's are conservative, uses the school play to reflect his own (and Bennett's) point of view, and as scenes change and the faculty converses, the viewer/reader/listener--and the old Headmaster--quickly see how much values have changed. The Headmaster feels that the values by which he has lived are being mocked, while the students and new Headmaster feel that the old Headmaster is out of touch, however well-meaning and upright.Forty Years On, Alan Bennett's first full-length play, has an enormous scope, which is both its glory and its limitation. Bennett satirizes a whole panoply of subjects as he explores seventy years of British social and political history. The satire is pointed--and hilarious--and the reactions of the faculty, students, and Headmaster are indicative of generational changes. The scope is so broad, however, that the impact is diluted and there is no grand climax, other than the Headmaster's reaction, to bring together all facets of the play. The fact that the vignettes do not come in chronological order is also distracting. The play is delightful in its humor, however, and relevant even now, forty years after it was first produced--a sensational debut for a man who has become one of England's most successful and prolific dramatists. n Mary WhippleThe Uncommon Reader: A NovellaThe History Boys: A PlayThe Lady in the Van by Alan Bennett (BBC Radio Collection Audio Cassette)An Englishman Abroad: Starring Michael Gambon and Penelope Wilton (BBC Radio Collection)The Complete Beyond the Fringe (Screen and Cinema)Talking Heads"},{"Title":"Forty Years On (Dramatized)","review":"Wonderful play with wonderful cast.

But I liked it.I did not, however, LOVE it. I respect good writing to the utmost. You get that here. I respect an author who has control over his stories in every aspect. You get that, too. I love humor more than anything, but...but...but I couldn't get around the fact that there was NOTHING nice in this book. I mean, zero.

Instead he seemed to think the family was pre-e-etty edgy for entertaining a prostitute (a PROSTITUTE! har-dee-har-HAR! an unattractive one! chuckle! in ripped fishnet stockings!) in their nice suburban home.Wouldn't all NPR listeners like to be so awesomely cool and free of social prejudice as to have over for dinner a real-live beaten-up prostitute who works at a cafeteria and smokes?

I've heard quite a bit about Sedaris, but I've never had the pleasure of reading his work. Holidays On Ice did not fail to delight.An exceptionally quick read, this book is a collection of mostly previously published material. It contains both fiction and nonfiction alike, and at times I seriously couldn't be sure to which genre some stories belonged. This ambiguity made things all the more fun.Sedaris takes a rather sarcastic approach to how people treat Christmas, and while it may seem snotty and cynical, I found it painfully accurate in many cases, especially if you read between the lines.While I wouldn't consider Sedaris as skilled a writer as McCarthy or Chabon in terms of technique, he certainly knows how to convey his humor through the written word, and I believe such aptitude is incredibly rare. He is one of the few writers I've ever experienced who had me literally laughing out loud as I read.~Scott William Foley, author of Dr. Nekros: The Tragedian (Volume I, Episode I)"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"At 134 pages, Holidays on Ice is one of the shortest books I have read.

This is David's diary of working as an Elf at Macy's SantaLand. Great inside look at working during the holidays at New York's Macy store. The other story that is a work of nonfiction is \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" where David talks about his sister's rescue of a woman during the holiday season. Extremely funny interaction at the Sedaris house, and David learns something about his family.\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a very funny look at the tradition of sending out a letter to family friends recapping the year. A rather dysfunctional family, to be honest, and the ending has a nice twist. If you ever send out those letters, this letter is not one that you usually write. And that is what made it funny (and at times, laugh out loud funny). \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" gives a whole new meaning to the phrase. One-upmanship like you have never seen.If you have kids, and you have attended the \\"Holiday Pageant,\\" \\"Front Row...\\" is a nasty review of the children's pageant. But I guess that is what made this story so amusing - you may think it, but you would never say it. David lays it all out for you. Finally, \\"Based Upon a True Story,\\" takes the whole reality TV/Made for TV genre to a new, lower, level. After reading those two stories, you realize that David can be dark and twisted.I think that David is best when he writes about himself or his family. \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah\\" are the two best stories in the book, as he relates his own experiences for you.

It's a short, fast, and hilarious read on a topic that brings much joy, sorrow, laughter, and terror to us all: Christmas.Flipping through the book before purchasing it I see a chapter titled \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore\\" and I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride. \\"The Santa Land Diaries\\" should be made into a movie. Or at least should be something read to your family instead of that tired old \\"Twas the night before...\\" rot. Blisters the Elf had me in stitches during this story. And the fictitious family letter \\"Season's Greetings\\" was a laugh riot.I will definitely be reading more of Sedaris in the future."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I liked Me Talk Pretty One Day better. Holidays on Ice is a mix of autobiographical stories and fiction. I prefer his autobiographical ones, but I still thought all of the stories were great except for one.It's a very short book - I read the whole thing after dinner last night."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. I heard about it when the author read an excerpt on a late night talk show. Two entries really stand out: the elf story and the Christmas Pageant critique. If only the others were as good.The last entry, &quot;Christmas is for giving,&quot; is just NOT FUNNY. I appreciate satire, but this just goes over the edge. Sedaris is at his best when he doesn't grasp at straws and instead just points out the foibles of human nature. He does a much better job making us laugh at situations that really happen.The Christmas letter and &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore,&quot; are somewhat redeeming, but the book starts off so well that it's hard to believe it could end so anti-climatically."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Heartwarming stories of Christmas are common - tales of holiday cheer, families coming together to celebrate, and perhaps an unexpected miracle. This book doesn't have those stories.Rather, what it has is a laugh-out-loud funny look at David Sedaris's stint as a SantaLand elf at Macy's in New York City. This story is both believable and uproarious, and shouldn't be missed. Any holiday shopper needing a pick-me-up from the hour-long lines at the mall will certainly get it from this story!The most poignant of the stories is contained within the chapter called (if you can believe it), Dinah the Christmas Whore. This story points out the importance of serving others, and how families can come together.The four other chapters are worth reading for an interesting, if cynical, look at the role of the season in contemporary culture. They aren't nearly as enjoyable as the other two, and have some dark twists, so do be forewarned."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"My husband and I listened to &quot;SantaLand diaries&quot; on our way from St.Paul to Milwaukee in a snowstorm and have yet to hear a funnier Christmas tale. It's an incredibly humorous twist to what many of us have as as a Christmas memory. If you don't find this funny, get a humor transplant."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David's humor is never-ending. He has the knack for finding humor in the most degrading situations. These stories are hilarious and show that the world is all in how you look at it. Being short is one thing, but being an elf is someting else all together!!!!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"My younger brother, who works at a bookstore, brought this audio book along on our road trip to Cleveland, Ohio. I really like David Sedaris' sister who is in &quot;Stranger's with Candy&quot;, so I opted to listen to this tape. It was so hilarious, I cried. I got mascara in my eyes and almost had to pull over. I asked my brother to get out my inhaler(I have asthma)because I was laughing so hard. David is warped. I loved it! If you listen to this in the car, be careful while you are driving."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"A funny book by a funny guy. Got it for Xmas and couldn't put it down until I was done and then went back to the first story again. The first story is the strongest in the book, but the others are entertaining as well. He writes, like I think."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'll do a breakdown on what I thought about each of the stories.SantaLand Diaries - This one I would have to say is my fave out of all the stories. This one hooked me right from the first page. I just couldn't stop laughing. My other half was looking at me like I was nuts! LOLI'll give you an example, 'I often see people on the streets dressed as objects and handing out leaflets. I tend to avoid leaflets but it breaks my heart to see a grown man dressed as a taco. So if there is a costume involved, I tend to not only, accept the leaflet, but to accept it graciously, saying, \\"Thank you very much,\\" and thinking, You poor, pathetic son of a bitch. I don't know what you have but I hope never catch it.'Just too funny!Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family! - This story was funny to with a very odd ending. It's about the Dunbar family, with whom the husband at one point in time went to war, had sex with a Viatmenese woman and had a child who showed up their doorstep one day. Well, let's just say that this one was pretty darn funny!Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol - This one was short and sweet and pretty much to the point with talk about television and plays. It has a lot of talk about the shows that the schools put on for the holiday season.Based Upon a True Story - This story is told by a gentleman who is taking the place of a minister. So he is practically preaching to the people in the crowd. He wants the help of this poor congregation so that he can get his 'story' to be 'based upon a true story'. This one was pretty funny.Christmas Means Giving - Two families who take Christmas way beyond the 'means giving' part to out-do each other every single year. This one I found to be pretty hilarious.Dinah, The Christmas Whore - Who takes a whore home? Well, in this story, this family takes her in like she's a celebrity!Jesus Shaves - Talks about religion in a French class full of adults who are trying to do an exercise where they are going to be using the word 'one' as a pronoun. A lot of referring to the different holidays. Funny.Us and Them - A young boy is recounting his life with his mother when they moved to North Carolina. He found it interesting to spy on the neighbors to see what they did in their time off. Lots of talk about TV and why some people watched it continously and others didn't 'believe' in it.Let It Snow - It snowed and snowed and lucky them got snow days. Their mother had a nervous breakdown and then someone lost their shoe!Six to Eight Black Men - A story about the local gun laws that interests him and makes him a proud American. This one was pretty good.The Monster Mash - Dead bodies, anyone? Let me give you an example of this story, 'By this point in my stay, my list of don'ts covered three pages and included such reminders as: never fall asleep in a dumpster, never underestimate a bee, never drive a convertible behind a flatbed truck, never get old, never get drunk near a train, and never, under any circumstances, cut off your air supply while masterbating.' Okay, I think you get the point! LOLThe Cow and the Turkey - A Christmas story with animals who are playing Secret Santa with each other. There is a lesson to be learned at the end of this one.All in all, I enjoyed the entire book! I laughed out loud, oh, I don't know how many times. But it really was good to read something that put a hilarious spin on the holiday season!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I read the original version of this collection a few years ago and really enjoyed it so I jumped at the chance of reading the stories again and the new additional stories! The new stories are definitely a welcome addition!Of the original stories, The SantaLand Diaries starts the collection off on a hilarious note. You get to read bout the inner workings of being a department store Christmas elf. The crazy santas, elves and customers! Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!! starts off innocently enough as a family holiday letter and quickly takes a turn for the hilariously insane, like a lot of Sedaris's stories.Of the new stories, Jesus Shaves is by far my favorite. It had me crying from laughing so hard. I don't want to give anything away, so just trust me, it's hilarious. Six to Eight Black Men was also hilarious along the same line. Definitely learned things I didn't know about how other countries celebrate to holidays.I wasn't totally fond of The Monster Mash, about a trip to a medical examiner's office, it spoke to my weak stomach and my stomach said no thank you. But it still had it's funny moments.All in all this is a hilarious holiday collection and the new stories are a welcome addition helping add additional holidays to this collection."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The holidays bring out something truly special in David Sedaris, making this more a &quot;best of&quot; than a mere holiday book. It's simply brilliant and, as many reviewers have experienced, one of those rare books that may cause you to laugh out loud in spite of yourself. Its only flaw is that it's a short book, but in content it's a giant.Avid NPR listeners will instantly recognize the first essay in this book, &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;; the author's reading of that story is their single most requested encore. His description of becoming a Christmas Elf at Macy's is a true guilty pleasure; scathingly unkind and screamingly funny. If you ever held an undignified job, this is somehow your story - even if you never (pardon the pun) stooped so low as to play an elf.Sedaris writes like a post-modern Mark Twain, with a dry and piercing wit that drips with charm and cynicism in equal measure. His is the kind of writing that makes me go back to re-read a sentence, a paragraph, even a whole story hoping to savor some particular gem I only wish I'd written. His tone is often dark, even bleak, but there's a wry quality in his stories that lets you know he's really doing it all for effect - setting you up for an even bigger laugh because you know he's enjoying every minute of telling his sad, hilarious stories.Get in on his story now so you can savor the feeling of waiting impatiently for his next book - and there's no better way to start than to read Holidays on Ice."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book was a really fantastic collection of 6 short stories regarding the holiday season. I had heard so much about David Sedaris and what a talented satirical writer he was, and I was much impressed by his ability to parody the American publics love/hate relationship during the holiday season. His life as an elf in the Macys's shopping store in New York had me laughing out loud. And the upbeat Christmas letter that includes the introduction of a Vietamese stepchild was hilarious.I finished the book in two days of light reading and realized the author is truly dark and twisted but extremely talented. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is next on my list. I guarantee you'll like this book, but just to add to the fervor of the writing, I suggest you read it a week before Christmas during your most hellish and frantic points of your life; it'll add to the hilarity of your situation."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"To say that David Sedaris doesn't see the world the way that others do is a grievous understatement. He finds equal humor in the bizarre and the mundane. His wit can be both razor sharp and gentle as feather. He writes and says things that maybe you've thought about before and if you haven't thought about them before you'll certainly give them plenty of thought afterwords.Sedaris gift for storytelling is on display at its finest in this audio collection of holiday-themed stories. The most famous is, of course, &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot;, in which Sedaris relates in hillarious detail his experiences working as an elf at Macy's Santaland in New York. This piece is an American classic which should be compulsory reading for anyone who has worked a retail job during the holidays, not to mention anyone who has ever shopped a store during the holidays. Almost as good is &quot;Front Row Center WIth Thaddeus Bristol&quot; which skewers both a pompous theater critic and the sometimes attrocious children's holiday plays he's reviewing.In all, this collection contains six stories read by Sedaris himself, his sister Amy and actress Ann Magnuson. The different voices work well to set the tone for each story over the course of the tape, and the variety helps sustain interest which can be an issue with single reader audio programs.For many of us, the holidays mean laughter and tears. David Dedaris understands this and has given the world six of the finest tools with which to cope."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have always enjoyed David Sedaris' humor, and although I generally listen to his audio books (read by him), this time I picked up the printed version, just under 200 pages. The Holidays on Ice title was originally released in 1997. This 2008 release contains some of the same stories and several new ones as well. Featured are:* Santa Land Diaries* Seasons Greetings to our Family and Friends* Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol* Based Upon a True Story* Christmas Means Giving* Dinah, the Christmas Whore* Jesus Shaves* Us and Them* Let it Snow* Six to Eight Black Men* The Monster Mash* The Cow and the TurkeyOne of the funniest for me was: \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" an essay describing the dysfunctional world of David Sedaris. He tells how his sister Lisa brought her friend Dinah home four days before Christmas. He describes the humorous way in which his family reacts to her, and the questions they ask her about her interesting life in prison and about her experiences as a prostitute.Sarcasm and cynicism fill this collection of short stories. You will be laughing your way through each story. If you are looking for something to cheer you up during the stressful holiday times, pick up this little book. It would make a fun gift for your family and friends who might need some cheering up this holiday season as well.Although I really did enjoy this book, I am still a bigger fan of the audio books read by this author. In fact, I'm in the process of listening to his latest book: When You are Engulfed in Flames right now, and it's terrific."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"OK, I love David Sedaris on This American Life and loved his previous books about his family. This little book was more bitter and violent than I expected. \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is a classic and a great read, but after that there are stories of people dismembering themselves, family members treating each other cruelly, and a barnyard animal being led to slaughter. Not denying Sedaris' talents but I enjoy it more when he is turning is razor wit and observations to his hilarious, off-kilter, endearing family and less when he is creating stories that seem designed to shock us out of whatever little holiday cheer we have. Sorry David!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is an excellent collection of some of Sedaris' earlier works, and the story for which the book is named is one of his best. But beware, if you are already familiar with Sedaris you may have already read this one without knowing it; all of the stories contained within appear either in Naked or Barrel Fever."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris has a sick sense of humor, and he conveys it well in this book of Christmas shorts. It opens with the extremely funny &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;, giving an insider's view of elves at Macy's. Next comes &quot;Season's Greetings&quot;, an overenthusiastic 'family newsletter' that spins off into satirical tangents with the unexpected addition of a Vietnamese daughter. &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot; tells of young David's encounter with his father's &quot;Christmas present&quot; ::wink:: &quot;Front Row with Thaddeus Bristol&quot; is a theatrical review of the Christmas pageants in the elementary schools (we've all had to suffer). &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; is a somewhat sickeningly funny look at a hustler trying to gather holiday special ideas. Finally, &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot; rounds out the collection, telling of two families who can't stop competing with each other. I'm a newcomer to Sedaris's wit, and the next book on my list is 'Naked'. This was a great way to be introduced without being overwhelmed--even if they are Christmas stories being read in July."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if I was \\"OK\\". I was uncontrollably laughing. Even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure, it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds I was embarrassing myself again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Actually, I toyed with giving this five-stars. However, I figure I should employ five-stars for IMPORTANT literary treasures, such as the collected works of Shakespeare, &quot;War and Peace,&quot; and &quot;Valley of the Dolls.&quot; So, need a laugh? Well, any of Sedaris' books will do. They...&quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and the even better &quot;Naked&quot;...are funny, provocative, and full of weird and colorful people. While &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; takes from his other books, it is a veritable laugh-o-rama. And &quot;SantaLand Diaries&quot;? I have read it a half-dozen times, and I STILL chortle merrily. David, what are you writing? This Midtowner wants more. And, folks, not only is Sedaris an intelligent, witty writer and essayist, he is just as cute as a button. I enjoy getting his books so I can see his little impish face peering out from the end page. And, really, when it comes right down to it, isn't that what it's all about: the author's CQ (Cute Quotient)?"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Most hilarious Christmas tales around. You will never look at Christmas the same after exploring Sedaris's amazingly funny but somewhat dark world. It's a blessing that I read the stories, especially the now classic SANTALAND DIARIES in the end of October to remind myself not to fall into the trap of the Christmas commercialism. Totally refreshing after years years years of overly sentimental and corny holiday tales. I am amazed at Sedaris's guts to write down a lot of things that most of us would rather to keep to ourselves and that makes me realize what a hypocrite I am. You all must simply have this holiday gem!!!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice is a book of short stories written by the very funny writer David Sedaris. Unfortunately, with the exception of the first story, these aren't that funny.SantaLand Diaries recounts the author's experience as an elf working for Macy's during the Christmas season. His dry wit and excellent insight into the annoying holiday shopper make for a highly entertaining and occasionally laugh out loud chapter 1.Season's Greetings to all our Friends and Family starts off promising enough. It is in the form of a family letter sent out to everyone the family knows that recounts the family's happenings for the past year. Everyone gets at least one of these each year and most people roll their eyes as they read it and mock the family that sent it. However this letter goes on and on for entirely too long and has a dark, twisted content that stops being humorous and becomes confusing and sad.Dinah the Christmas Whore has a promising enough subject, but doesn't wind up being particularly funny or entertaining. Beth, David's sister, works with a woman who in addition to being a prostitute at night, trends toward extremely unsavory clients. Beth gets a frantic call from Dinah when she is beaten up by one of her regulars and the Sedaris family takes her in for the night. David tells the story from the point of view of the confused child who is surprised by the reaction to Dinah from the rest of his family. But the story never leaves the realm of odd into the world of entertaining.The remaining three stories are dark and fairly humorless. There is a sense of irony in some when the author illustrates how out of touch with the season people are - the very same people that think they are in the throws of the Christmas spirit. But somehow the writing misses the mark, isn't funny, and borders on depressing. Me Talk Pretty One Day set the bar high for me as a fan of David Sedaris and I haven't been satisfied since. This isn't terrible, but not what I was hoping for either. You may want to simply read the first story and then put the book back on the shelf."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The lead story in this book is hysterical, and was definately the best of the group. The author has a great style, inserting creative names and products throughout his writing to make humorous points and help the reader laugh at some of the idiocies of the holiday season. I especially enjoyed both the lead story (about working as en elf in Macy's during the holidays) and the story about school Christmas pageants. Both left me laughing at the holiday and feeling cheerful about the season.The remaining stories were not as enjoyable, and a bit dark, especially when dealing with the death of an infant and the plight of the poor. While amusing, they did not express the holiday spirit in a way I was looking for as I read the book on Christmas Eve. The last story I found somewhat tasteless, though it started well and had some exceptionally funny lines.Overall, a book with very funny lines from a funny author, but not a \\"feel good\\" Christmas humor book like I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This makes an excellent gift or &quot;Sedaris Starter&quot; for the unsuspecting fan of David's twisted sense of humor and outlook on life. Most of the stories are reprints from his two previous books, &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot;. I received this book as a gift, and put it out during the holidays to judge how enlightened my holiday guests are. However, if you're looking to get a good sampling of David Sedaris's work, consider his two other books."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Although I have enjoyed Mr. Sedaris's sarcastic humor in the past and found his occasional murky perspective both truthful and poignant, this book was simply too horrific to continue reading. There is nothing entertaining or profound about the murder of an infant. Needless to say I was disapointed in this book. I can only speculate that those who find any entertainment value in a story describing the torment and torture of a baby the very reason our society is rapidly sinking into a state of depravity from which we can never recover. How I long for more of Erma Bombeck's sense of humor."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I don't read a lot. But when I find an author that I like, I anxiously await every new work. (So, Lawrence Block, when are you going to write another Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery?) David Sedaris has been one of my favorites ever since I heard him on NPR many years ago. I have read every one of his books, and so when we went to San Lucia and didn't have a television and the only radio station was broadcasting in Spanish from Venezuela, our only entertainment was listening each night to a half hour of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" on a rudimentary tape player.So I was very pleased when my daughter gave me Sedaris' new book Holidays on Ice for a Chanukah present. However I was put off by the statement just beneath the title on the cover: \\"with six new stories, including one never before published.\\" Doesn't this imply that five \\"new\\" stories have been published? Then what is the meaning of new? I'll leave this problem for English majors to solve.The first story \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" was in the old Sedaris mold - delightful, insightful, and funny. But starting with the next tale, the author leaves his world of possible reality and enters the fictional world. Not a wise move judging from the results.\\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family!!!\\" is a takeoff of the infamous end-of-the-year letters that some families type up and send out to family members and anyone else they know. It had its moments, but the depressing ending was not among them.\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" was a mean-spirited take on children's Christmas shows. Unfortunately it was not saved by any humor whatsoever.\\"Based on a True Story\\" is so unbelievable and unfunny that I quit reading it after a couple of pages.I plodded through \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" even though my previous comments could apply to this sordid tale.I haven't read the rest yet, since I wanted to write down these comments while Sedaris' stories were fresh in my head. I hope that in the future, the very talented and very funny David Sedaris will revert to his embellished but true-sounding stories that only he can tell."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book simply has no satirical value. Once you get beyond the first chapter, it continues downhill. I read &#34;Me Talk Pretty One Day&#34; and just assumed the writing in this book would be just as good or at least interesting but the author was incapable of mixing funny into any part of the book. Not worth reading."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'd never read anything by Sedaris prior to reading Holidays on Ice for a book club, and it was by far one of the most hilarious things I've ever read. I would suggest not reading it around others because you will laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was my first encounter with David Sedaris and I'm sorry to report that it will probably be my last. I was severely underimpressed with this collection. The very first story about working as an elf in Santa Land elicited a few small smiles, but beyond that, most of the stories were rather dull, or I waited for a point to be made or a humorous twist, neither of which ever came. I am usually a fan of the dark and sarcastic humor that Sedaris is lauded for, and this book just missed the mark for me."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Too bitter and jaded, even for me. The first story, The Santaland Diaries about his time as an elf at Macy's in New York, resonated with 12 years of holiday retail experience. It was also funny. The other stories were just... ugly. Not funny, not entertaining."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Another collection of essays from a brilliant wit who you know you love to read. It's like I've said in my reviews before. There's no need to review each book when I can just give the author a blanket endorsement and guarantee you'll love whatever you find by the guy. I love it when that happens. I may have annoyed Jan by laughing out loud too often. Sedaris is like that."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"It has been more than a month since I ordered this book and it never came. I emailed the sender and they never responded. Next time I won't buy Amazon."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Apart from the Santaland Diaries, which has its amusing moments, this is one dreadful book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, said it was a pleasant departure from standard sweet holiday writing. It was a departure, for sure - but NOT AT ALL pleasant. I actually enjoyed Sedaris' writing style, even the sarcasm, but much of the content was disturbing at best. I gave up after a section that ended in a particularly horrific death. Only one nice thing I can say for it - it made me appreciate the high-calorie sweet holiday stories once again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and I hope it'll be my last. For starters, there's his voice--a grating, oddly inflected whine that frequently made me want to eject the tape. As for the material, some of it is amusing, but many of the stories cross the line between sharp satire and sick, unfunny (and often boring!) discourse. Maybe there are better works by this author, but this one is really terrible."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, \\"aren't I hilarious?\\" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book. Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales. (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely. So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher. I'll never know. Neither should you.)I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters. They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"A writer of any caliber, with any skill, would not need to sink to the depths of Sedaris to make a point. There is nothing funny about killing infants or using the mentally or physically disabled to make a satirical point. Have we, as a society, lost all our sensitivity? This book is quite sick. Its definitely not funny!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sedaris writes in the same style as Nick Hornby but his stories aren't nearly as humorous or interesting. I found 'Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!' to be particularly annoying and disturbing. I was going to give this book as a Christmas present, but after reading it, I threw it in the garbage."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I put this book on my wish list after reading various David Sedaris reviews. I am currently reading another book by him that I am enjoying, but this collection of stories was a bit disturbing for me."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"An Abominable book - I have read Dress Your Family which I recommend but this thing is trash."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"CD is OK for Sedaris - I've heard better- package was a little crushed but that was a small factor. Otherwise, happy with item and service."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I intended the item to be a Christmas gift, but when it came, it was so inconsequential that it became just an item in her Christmas box and I found something else to wrap as her main gift, which was fine; it just wasn't what I expected."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love David Sedaris. I think that he's a wonderful author with a great ability to convey his sense of humor through his words. I purchased this book for my sister-in-law for Christmas, and she told me today that she's already finished reading it. I would recommend his books to anyone."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"He's funny I have yet to find an author like him or Augusten Burroughs. I love all of his books."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've seen the one man show of 'The SantaLand Diaries' in Portland, OR and Carlsbad, CA. and wanted to hear the story from the source. Great. The other stories - not so much. But I do recommend seeing the stage play."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The first story was good...classic Sedaris...several of the others were boring and to me a bit silly and over the top. Obviously this was written before he got his grove on as a humorist story tell."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I did not listen to this exact recording (I bought this as a gift) -- but I read an earlier version of the book. It will crack you up!I've noticed each Sedaris book has a certain number of stories that knock me over, and the rest don't quite hit the mark for me... and in each successive book the percentage of laugh-out-loud stories has increased (ending with Engulfed in Flames, WOW). This happens to be an oldie but is a goodie. It is a great, distilled set of stories."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Love David Sedaris so much! This book is a classic. I already own it, but I had to buy for others."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Folks, this is one of my favorite reads.David Sedaris says he doesn't do readings from it anymore b/c it \\"reads aloud\\" a bit choppily.All I know is that this little book made me giggle from beginning to end. Usual for Mr Sedaris' work."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"My favorite of D. Sedaris' book is Dress your family in Corduroy and Denim. Hoilday on Ice was promising in the beginning but had a few repeat stories I've read before somewhere in his other books. I like the ones where he worked as an elf in NYC Macy's but the other ones were forgetable."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Paging through David Sedaris' \\"Holidays on Ice\\" does not, in any way, call to mind Burl Ives crooning A Holly, Jolly Christmas.As the title of this slim volume suggests, these darkly comic tales have a (sometimes tenuous) link to the holidays, primarily Christmas. But the black humor to be found in several of these essays bears no resemblance to the saccharine tripe that TV programmers foist upon us during our annual celebration of conspicuous consumption.\\"Holidays on Ice\\" is largely devoid of restraint, gentility, tastefulness or subtlety. But what it has in abundance is a wonderfully wicked mischievousness. These essays, some of which claim to be autobiographical, have an arch tone that leaves the reader laughing out loud - snorting, even - more often than not.Perhaps the highlight of the collection is SantaLand Diaries, in which Sedaris recounts his purported exploits as a Christmas elf at Macy's department store. Here, as elsewhere in this collection, Sedaris' take-no-prisoners attitude is on display, along with his disdain for correctness, political or otherwise.When Sedaris and the other elves learn rudimentary sign language to better communicate with deaf children, for example, one of Sedaris' sisters, who can sign, decides to help him out with a few lessons of her own. The result? Sedaris can now tell the kiddos: \\"Santa has a tumor in his head the size of an olive. Maybe it will go away tomorrow but I don't think so.\\"Things come to a suitably bleak head on Christmas Eve, when Sedaris witnesses a fist fight between two mothers. A father insults Santa for refusing to sing a carol to his kid, a manager swears at a customer, and parents in long lines leave disposable diapers at the door to \\"Santa's house.\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!! is a hilarious send up of those insufferable family letters that make the rounds at Christmas. In another essay, Sedaris' sister Lisa rescues a prostitute and brings her home. And a ridiculously pretentious newspaper critic pens scathingly cruel reviews of grade school Christmas pageants in Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol.Christmas shoppers are sheep, Sedaris tells us in one essay, \\"stupid animals programmed by nature to mate and graze and bleat out their wishes to the obese, retired school principal\\" who portrays Santa \\"in the mall's sorry-looking North Pole.\\"Sedaris even visits a medical examiner's office at Halloween and shares a few how-not-to-die tips with his readers, such as: \\"never fall asleep in a Dumpster, never underestimate a bee, never drive a convertible behind a flatbed truck, never get old, (and) never get drunk near a train . . . .\\"There's an occasional passage in \\"Holidays on Ice\\" that almost begins to approach something vaguely resembling merriness. But don't worry. It's just a passing illusion. Burl Ives is nowhere in sight."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice is perfect for those who give no apologies for complaining about the ills of society during the holiday season. It feels nice to have affirmation for the complaints you've been making over the years. Whether it's the tension that mounts while waiting in line to see Santa or the humble-brags found in family Christmas cards, Sedaris seems to have a knack for observing all the naughty acts of the holiday season. I laughed at ever story, without guilt."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris always comes through. I read and love all of his books. His humor is dry and clever. Looking forward to a new book; soon I hope."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Not at all what I expected, very negative - expected more since I had read the sample. Wouldn't recommend at all."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Ive enjoyed David Sedaris's other books, but this one just didn't seem as entertaining. It struck me as sort of forced and was more offensive to me than the others. Go back and reread one of his other books instead."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The holidays can be difficult for many of us. I opened this book to find a few laughs amid bittersweet memories and family gaggles. It was well worth it. Sedaris brings just the right sardonic touch to his tales of growing up in suburbia, his first jobs, and, primarily, his life as an elf. Alas, Sedaris also reminded me that men see humor from a certain angle, and I found myself missing the writings of the late Nora Ephon. We need a new funny woman on the horizon!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Snarky and not all that humorous. More cruel than insightful. I may try and read something else by him later but only if it is free"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I downloaded this book from the library onto my kindle. I pretty much read anything but I could NOT even get through the first story. I don't know who proofread the kindle edition but I found words repeating and then sentences dropping off not making any sense. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I had no expectations since I have not read from this author before so I guess I wasn't as disappointed as most. I never even got to the baby killing I see people reviewing about. Thank God for that."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If I am not mistaken this is an earlier collection by David Sedaris that has been reprinted with new stories from other collections added in. I own several of his essay collections, but I was disappointed in this one. The first essay about his experiences as an elf was very good, but after that they kind of disintegrated into too-long, too-morbid stories that just didn't hold my interest. When you get to the new stories that were added in (ex: Jesus Shaves, which came from another collection and which never fails to have tears of laughter rolling down my face) it picked up a bit, but overall I was glad I got this for a very reduced Kindle price (because I have read most of those essays already). Overall, this book leads me to say something I never thought I'd say about David Sedaris.....\\"Meh.\\""},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I bought this after we lost our home in super storm sandy. the dark nature of the comedy fit my mood. i read it every free moment and plan to re-read it before passing it on to deserving friends. he is a detailed enough writer and my memory is bad enough that a second read will be as enjoyable as the first read."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor. In the first story he explains his job as an Elf at Santaland and describes his daily life. It is so funny, some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time.Don't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside.But if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time, then by all means buy this book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Within the first story I knew that I had gold in my hands. But when the person sitting next to me in the airplane, on my way back from thanksgiving, busted into superlative compliments, I was even happier about my choice.Holiday on Ice is the Christmas spirit antidote. It's the Bible for all of us who are sick and tired of the commercialism surrounding this time of year. Read this book now, and save yourself from the holiday spirit.\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" had me rolling down the floor from the laughing. David Sedaris' observations, are hysterically funny, and hold a high degree of truth from what our pop culture has made of the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family\\" had me confused for a moment. The story is told on a woman's voice, in first person, which made me double check the cover of the book, and make sure of the author's gender. Yet, he has done an excellent job with this short story, and the narrative will make you begging for more.\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is probably the best story of them all. If you are as sick of the holiday commercialism as I am, you will enjoy this as well. This story embodies, exactly what Christmas should not be about. The competition between two families during the Christmas season goes beyond any normal person's conception. Is it madness? I think not. Just take a look outside of your decorated suburban windows. You will know exactly which people \\"Holidays on Ice\\" is talking about."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book will make you both laugh and cringe. That's even if your a desensitized lad like myself. It's like nothing else I've ever read, clever, mean, and unforgiving."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice may be David Sedaris' finest collection. The humor here is concentrated by its theme and diverse in terms of point of view and varying shades of dark humor. I certainly enjoyed the rest of Sedaris' works, but I think having a general theme guides his essays the best. Me Talk Pretty One has a guiding topic, and Sedaris works hard to tackle it from his American childhood to his French adulthood.But like Me Talk Pretty One Day, most of Sedaris' works trap the reader in both his mind and his body. I get bored with looking at the world from the perspective of David Sedaris, the man and author. This does not happen in Holidays on Ice. Instead, Sedaris channels his witty weirdness and gives the reader variety that is not generally available in his other collections. Maybe it's the precise choice of stories behind the success of Holidays on Ice. Perhaps Sedaris' other works would be more successful if they were more balanced.Thus, I find Holidays on Ice to be Sedaris' best collection due to the concentration of theme, the variable points of view and perspectives shaping the essays/stories, the choice of works, and the brevity of the volume."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"My friends all told me how hilarious this book was, so I bought it. Maybe I'm not in the right mood for satire (it is Christmas, after all), but it just seemed like one big curmudgeony rant. I was even bored with most of the rants, they were too long and stopped being even remotely funny after a page or two."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'd heard how wonderfully funny David Sedaris's writing is and looked for to my book group's December read, and the first story was entertaining, but had to force myself to complete the 2nd story. Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice was really a slight waste of time for me. Again, Sedaris set the bar SO high with his previous publications that anything else will simply not do. I forced myself to finish this and did so with barely a chuckle. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Mr. Sedaris, but his missed the mark on this one. But just a wee bit. If you're a Sedaris fan, by all means, read this book. Just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris' books, but other than the \\"Santaland Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah\\" stories, I couldn't get into it. The other stories weren't funny, the pace was plodding despite the fact that these were short stories, and I was actually somewhat uncomfortable reading them.I'd recommend most of his other books, just not this one."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Santaland Diaries is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. It is currently circulating amongst our friends."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I am a great fan of David Sedaris - but this book is sort of like expecting Frank Sinatra and listening to Frank Sinatra Junior instead. Yeah, it's good, but it is not the same...For long time readers of Sedaris, this is a reminder of how good he can be. Nothing makes me laugh as hard as \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" and of course for those who have not discovered the author's stint as a Macy's Elf, you are really in for a treat.Let's just say that various nephews and nieces are now reading \\"Dinah\\" to their children, and I suppose that I need to find new material to redeem myself as the family curmudgeon. (Note: I also read excerpts from \\"The Painted Bird\\" by Kosinski at Thanksgiving, so I am well known as the family downer. But I digress...)So why so few stars? This material is available elsewhere, and the selection has a bitter tone -- even for me. I was somehow hoping that there was something new that I had not seen yet. For new Sedaris readers, this is gold. For longtime fans, this is a rerun."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Immediately before reading this I had read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and loved it so much I thought I'd pick this up. It just happened to be the holidays so this seemed a natural choice. I was very disappointed.Four of the six entries here are fictional which halps make his biographical essays that much more believeable. The \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is decent. There are funny parts but the diary aspect of it makes it choppy and I have found his humor best when he controls the flow of the story rather than cutting together some events.The other biographical essay here is \\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" which I found the best essay here but is what I would call the literary version of a b-side.By the end I found that I was enjoying the entries so little I was skipping large chunks hoping to get to a good part.After my first book from David Sedaris I was eagerly looking forward to another one. After this I'm not so sure."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Simply did not like the book. Couldn't get past the Season's Greetings ridiculous account of an illegitimate daughter from Vietnam showing up on the family's doorstep."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"What else can you say, but it is yet another well written Sedaris book. I am always amazed at the wonderful sense of humor this writer has. Dark, dry sense of humor without sounding above it all."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you've read David Sedaris's writing before, you will be familiar with the tone of Holidays on Ice. In fact, if you've read Barrel Fever, you've read two of these stories already, and if you've read Naked, you've read one other. Out of six, three new stories is barely a compelling reason to shell out the bucks for this slender volume. For those not yet familiar with Sedaris's style, he writes cynical and witty short stories. They are often autobiographical (unusually in this tome half the stories are clearly fictional) and at their best full of piercingly true and hilarious observations of human nature. Sedaris spares no one, least of all himself, and so although there is nothing of an explicitly graphic sexual nature here, this isn't the book to give to sweet old aunt Betsy as a stocking-stuffer. Sedaris is matter-of-fact about his homosexuality and his drug use, and similarly about the sexual side of American life. &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot;, for example, is an uncommon Christmas tale. Conservative readers who find themselves offended by the irreverence of the title should stay away, not only from Holidays on Ice, but all of Sedaris's writing. Unquestionably the first story in this collection is also the best. In &quot;SantaLand Diaries&quot;, his on-the-job expose of life as a Macy's elf, Sedaris's customary cynicism is tempered, albeit only slightly, by an occasional touch of sentimentality. The final three stories go to extremes to avoid such influence, and suffer greatly for it. I find myself wearied by such non-stop cynicism. The jaded outlook of these last stories is not alleviated by the fact that they clearly seek to parody that very outlook. In &quot;Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol&quot; a theatre critic roasts three children's Christmas pagents, concluding with the line &quot;Is it just them, or am I missing something?&quot; Fair enough, although not especially funny or profound, but then this is the sole point of most of the book. Sedaris often seems eager to embrace sentimentality, but afraid that in so doing he will not seem sufficiently cosmopolitan. Taken individually these stories are fine, but not representative of the author at his best. As a collection I was rather disappointed. My recommendation--buy Barrel Fever, Naked, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, and skip this one."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you. He may push it sometimes but isn't that what a good writer should do? Knowing he is half Greek, so am I, I was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard. Unfortunately there wasn't one. Santaland was my favorite."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Summary:The book is a collection of short stories, some fictitious, some based on the author's actual experiences. Probably the most well known story is 'SantaLand Diaries', the author's account of his time spent working as an Elf in Macy's SantaLand.\`Based Upon A True Story' is about a TV producer who shows up at a Pentecostal church one morning hoping to convince one of the members of the congregation to sign a contract allowing him to produce her miraculous story. Apparently, the woman saved her son by transplanting one of her kidneys to him in their house. I'm assuming it was meant to be a fictional commentary on the ridiculous lengths TV executives will go to to get a story.\`Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family' is a wife's account of the havoc that has been created in their family due to the arrival of her husband's love child from his time spent in Vietnam. The love child, Quesan, arrives one day, unannounced, and proceeds to destroy the narrator's family. The story is written as though it were a holiday greeting card and is also fictitious.\`Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol' is a strange critique of elementary school drama productions.\`Christmas Means Giving' is a fictitious account of two families whose competition to give the most ends with the ultimate sacrifice - their lives. This is another social commentary, though its target isn't perfectly clear.\`Dinah, The Christmas Whore' is, I believe, a non-fiction account of when his sister brought home a co-worker, who also happened to be a prostitute, around the Christmas holidays.My Comments:All of the stories are well-written, engaging, and entertaining. SantaLand Diaries was by far my favorite, but I think that is primarily because it isn't fiction. At least, I don't think it is fictitious, which leads to one of my criticisms of the book - the author never reveals when a story is fictitious or not. Of course, some are obviously fiction (Christmas Means Giving), but with others you can't be certain (Dinah, The Christmas Whore). It probably doesn't really matter if the stories are fictitious or not, but it would be nice to know.I'm also not sure what, if anything, I missed because I listened to this book on CD, but there was definitely one element of the CD that probably makes it better than the standard book - Sedaris's Billie Holiday style singing. On the CD he sings; you won't get that in the paper back.I was impressed by the author's candor about his personal life (once again assuming he is relating non-fictional stories). Though these 'secrets' are more extensively revealed in later books, I did find his fixation on soap operas to be a bit unsettling. Sedaris is also quite adept at producing one-line summations of points. For example, in commenting on how similar people are, the author ultimately concludes, \\"When all is said and done, it just comes down to fingerprints.\\" As much as I'd like to disagree, I'm thinking just about everyone would want to disagree, which makes my disagreement moot.Though the stories jump all over the place and don't really seem to have a common thread, I don't think anyone can argue that Sedaris has a gift for telling poignant and humorous short stories. Not all of the stories make sense, but given that some of the most non-sensical stories are true, I don't know that making sense is the author's goal. Perhaps what Sedaris is really trying to do is illustrate the absurdity of life. If he is, he's doing a good job of it. The stories are a bit outlandish and the author is blunt, meaning they probably aren't for everyone, but I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Since when did the murder of a baby and two 10 year old boys become funny or even \\"dark\\" humor? Not only were they murdered, but the two boys are murdered by a sex offender who was \\"given\\" the two boys as a Christmas gift by their parents in an attempt to \\"out-do\\" their neighbors! The baby is murdered by a long lost daughter from vietnam who, after her step-mother asks her to \\"watch the baby\\", \\"WATCH THE BABY,\\" which is screamed at the listener again and again, promptly puts the baby in the washing machine and then into the dryer. The stories are just bad...really, really bad. Thankfully I checked this CD out at the library and I can say, I will not choose this author again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"My husband received this book from a co-worker and I finally got around to looking at it this month. The first story was okay but nothing brilliant or particularly funny. The 2nd was dumb. I didn't even want to read the rest of the stories and am selling my copy to Half Price books though I don't expect they will give me much for it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day, is normally one of my favorite authors. His essays and short stories are usually humorous and enjoyable. However, Holidays on Ice proved to be the exception. This was an audio edition of four of Sedaris' essays/stories about Christmas. While the first story about a department store elf was marginally funny, the rest were horrendous. Sedaris' normally charming narration was grating and whiney and while I did listen to the very end, I honestly wish I hadn't. Perhaps this one would be better if read, rather than listened to, but I think not. I'm not a fan of the Christmas holidays and, seemingly, neither is Sedaris, but his stories didn't prove amusing - they were just annoying."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Two of Five stories were good.I first heard David Sedaris on NPR and laughed out loud then. He may have read the Front Row Center piece. I was happy to receive the new book on Christmas morning. I was naive to this depressed guy.I have learned from this book that Sedaris has a gloomy dark side. If he writes humor, great. These black essays are creative writing exercises for manic depressives, great ones though. The review does not report that these are such un-fun stories. That was my expectation and David did not deliver. I want my money back. ( Oh well, it was a gift )Here is the editorial review which suggests that, &quot;Holidays on Ice is a collection of three previously published stories matched with three newer ones, all, of course, on a Christmas theme. David Sedaris's darkly playful humor is another common thread through the book, worming its way through &quot;Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family! '' a chipper suburban Christmas letter that spirals dizzily out of control&quot;.... Yea, and dizzyingly black and un-funny.Glad I did not buy it. Don't if you expect humor. Do if you want a collection of other stuff."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have read plenty of Sedaris. They have all been enjoyable and this one is no exception. I enjoyed reading this book however it was not my favorite."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Fun holiday read. Liked the first short story, the one about the adopted daughter and the Dutch Santa the best"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The stories would start, introduce the characters, a plot, and then stop. No climax or resolution was reached and it was really unsayistfying. Many of the stories seemed pointless. This was definitely not as funny as other reviews make it out to be."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I am thrilled. Sedaris never disappoints, and I feel like I am next to him while he tells me details from his mishap adventures. He is totally my style; I should be, or wish I was, a Sedaris."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Davis is dark and amusing. A great pick for a twisted holiday read! This is not for the easily offended."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Funny at times but not as good as some of his previous work. It makes one wonder, if some of us just have a finite amount of talent."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"It was a little out of season to read David Sedaris', \\"Holidays on Ice\\", in May, but I had to push through it, because I am seeing him speak at UCLA tomorrow night! Even out of season, this was another fantastic collection of Sedaris essays. One of my favorites was \\"Santaland Dairies\\", where Sedaris describes the ins and outs of working as an Elf at a department store during the Christmas season. It actually reminded me a lot of working as a ride operator at Universal Studios, a lot of pushing groups of people through an attraction, while keeping a smile and getting those numbers up! My absolute favorite story is the one of the students in a foreign language class trying to explain the concept of Easter. Easter becomes very complicated and absolutely hilarious."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"DS doesn't dissappoint. Even if you've heard some of these stories before, they come to life again, just as funny and as witty as the first time."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've loved every David Sedaris book I've read and this one did not disappoint. It made me lol, I highly recommend it even if you've not read his other books"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book had a great start and just like the holidays it all went downhill from there. Better books by Sedaris abound."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"These Christmas stories really are very unique, and uplifting. They are a great partner to travel with by plane or train to the family's house for turkey and plumb pudding. Out of all the stories, the one which gave me the most laughs was the final story &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot; which shows just how far competition between neighbors 'could' go. Each story is very well written, and they are so different from one an other. I certainly want to read more of David Sedaris's short stores, and I hope also he goes the distance and tries to write a full length novel."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you haven't read 'Barrel Fever' and 'Naked' this is 4 stars. If you have, you've already read 2/3 of this book, so give it just another 2 stars."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris always delivers a great story. I giggled all the way through this book. Can't wait to read another!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The book shipped fast and well packed. The book comes with six new stories, the description says it does but I didn't see it so it was a nice little surprise. Great price for a great book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"There are many essays where you'll just laugh out loud. Sedaris has a unique viewpoint, to be sure. This is the second time I've read this book, and it is just as hilarious the second time around."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've heard many of these essays before on This American Life, and I've read them other places, but they're still entertaining. I will read anything David Sedaris writes."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The below is a review of the abridged audiobook edition of the bookThe author is quite humorous and his humor is quite witty, sardonic, satiric and sarcastic. The author's voice carries his humor quite well hence the audiobook is also a pleasure to read. The type of humor, however it should be stressed, is not the bright happy type. It is definitely the dark type, filled with melancholy. Many of the stories told involved children being killed in a variety of manners, including in a clothes dryer. Hence for a holiday themed book maybe a little too much for some people. Still quite funny in its own way though."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"As usual...very funny with his own unique way of looking at the world! David Sedaris never disappoints with his stories."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is a fun book to read around the holidays as it shares a variety of stories containing a lack of cheer concerning the season."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"It's a good book to pick up for a few minutes here and there. Not meant to read straight through. All the vignettes are amusing, and picturing a grown man in an elf costume is hilarious by his description."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Easy read, funny but not as funny as some of this other works. Still, you can't go wrong ordering this book - especially for the holidays."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is BY FAR my favorite Sedaris book. It is a quick read for the holidays (or really anytime) and every story is funny- one of the few books that I honestly laugh out loud at, every time!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I admit that this was the first book from Sedaris that I have read, and it prompted me to purchase more of his books. It was given to me by a close friend, and it completely got me hooked! The first chapter, was genius-something I feel almost anyone that has ever had a crappy job can relate to. Sedaris puts a funny twist on the words, making me wish that I had thought those words myself.As far as wording, he is extremely creative, adding to his amazing thoughts. He makes you think, laugh out loud, and want to share it with other people as well. I remember over a year ago reading chapters out loud to my friends, and I even took this same book on the plane with me to Iraq (still here!) to take the edge off of leaving family and the long (16 hour!) plane ride.I have since passed this book on to another friend that I felt needed a good laugh, and hopefully got him hooked as well.To the people that are offended for some reason by this book: It is sarcasm. Not serious. The author is simply making light, using fantasy situations and wit. If you can't take a joke, then maybe this book isn't for you. If it bothers you, it is a simple concept to just not read it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris never disappoints! His twisted yet dry humor makes mundane things hilarious. He's a great story-teller in the same league with Garrison Keeler (albeit a bit naughtier)."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you are a David Sedaris fan then this book is for you. It is a collection of Christmas stories about his family and working as an Elf."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you are in need of a laugh, I highly recommend reading this book! I read it on an airplane as my husband tried to watch the airline movie. I kept laughing and snorting. My husband could not share my enthusiasm, having no idea what I was reading, so he became annoyed. When I thought I could finally compose myself, I would read on, and that was it, forget any composure! Sedaris not only has a great humorous mind, his words are brilliant. I believe this and much of Sedaris' work qualifies as lasting literature. I purchased eight books to give to friends for Christmas... a perfect gift!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Luckily I have read other Sedaris books before, so I know what he is capable of. The first story was funny, the rest, not so much. The story of the family in competition with their neighbors, which was supposed to be a satire on our one-upping our neighbors, was so over-the-top to not even be entertaining and certainly not funny."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you're looking for a collection of funny Christmas stories to lift your spirits, I wouldn't suggest this book. The first story has quite a few funny moments, is believable and written well, but I found the rest of the collection to be a little too bitter, minus the foreign Christmas story. That had a funny ending but then the last line put a damper on even that one. Also, who uses the word \\"retarded\\" anymore..? It's so NOT funny to call anyone that."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Love, love, love David Sedaris. It's a great take on the holidays: snarky and dark and it fills a void in the sometimes over-merrified season. The recording of Holidays on Ice is worth checking out, too. It's fun to hear how he interprets his work."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Being a huge fan of Sedaris' laugh-out loud work, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with Holidays on Ice. Although this collection of short stories, some fictional, some not, starts out on a great note with \\"The Santa Land diaries,\\" the humor quickly dries out with \\"Season's Greetings,\\" and \\"Christmas Means Giving.\\" Overall, his autobiographical work is much more entertaining than the far-fetched humor he tries to convey in his fictional work.Overall, I found this book good only as a travel companion and as a light read to get you in the mood for the holiday season. Aside from \\"Santa Land diaries,\\" don't expect to be rolling with laughter, for the humor in the other stories reeks of Saturday Night Live or MadTV. However, do not be discouraged by this book if this is your first encounter with Sedaris; his other material is much more original and manifest much more shock value than can ever be found here. I would recommend starting with \\"Naked,\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to avoid getting a bad first impression from his work."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"There are few authors who make us laugh out loud. David Sedaris will."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I limit my reading of Mr. Sedaris's works to the privacy of my home, as the involuntary bouts of snorting laughter his works produce in me prove too disruptive in public."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris never fails to entertain me!If you've read him before, you won't be let down by this little compilation of great stories.If you haven't read any of David Sedaris' works, I recommend you start! He has a wonderfully dry sense of humor and a gift for living through and writing about the absurd.I think the beauty of this book is the fact that each new chapter is a new story. So you can put it down and not lose a laugh. Perfect for summertime at the beach or pool."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Very enjoyable. I've often heard David Sedaris on NPR, but this is the first time I've read any of his work. The dark humor is right on target, and the stories definitely contain some unexpected twists and turns. I'm already planning to read some of his other books!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, I'll admit it wasn't as big as I had expected it to be, but it was worth it!! I, unlike most reviewers, enjoyed &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; the least, I really liked &quot;Greetings to our family and friends&quot;, &quot;Based on a true story&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot;! You definatly have to have a sense of humor when reading this book and don't take the stories too seriously (especially &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot;!) But all in all the book really humored me and I enjoyed reading it!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The first story, &quot;SantaLand Diaries&quot;, is hilarious, as funny a piece of writing as I have ever read.The other stories are quite amusing, but don't rise to the level of the first. Sedaris clearly has exceptional talent, and I will definitely try out his other works. Comedy(whether performing or writing) clearly being the most difficult art, makes this collection worth the modest retail price."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is very dark humor. Not a light holiday read. I have a rather extensive book collection and this book went straight to the recycle bin. Not a keeper for me."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"His previous books were laugh-out-loud funny; I once had to stop my car because I was laughing too hard when listening to one of his books on tape. But this one was sad and disturbing. I struggled to keep reading after the woman killed her grandbaby in a clothes dryer, in an attempt to frame her husband's newly discovered adult illegitimate Vietnamese daughter (yes, that classic Xmas story). There were funny moments in the department store elf piece, although even that just sounded angry by the end.Gifted humorists make us laugh at our own shortcomings, but they do this from our side of the line. It feels like Sedaris has crossed the line, really rather hates most people, and believes he can only top previous writing by developing more outrageous and darker plots -- ones that I can't relate to at all. It's a shame because there's a wealth of information to be mined from day to day 'normal' human interactions around the holiday season."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was my first David Sedaris book. While some of it was not as funny as i expected, Season's greetings was worth the price of the book for me. I thought it was hilarious. I did laugh out loud. I would recommend this book, especially around the holidays. I will read more of this author."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'm just thankful that I had the chance to see David Sedaris live so that I could have both his face and his voice in my head as I read his stories--that made them even funnier. If you love Sedaris on shows like This American Life, you'll just love the book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Quite amusing! Great author and great book!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"\\"Holidays on Ice\\" is hilarious! The story about Sedaris working as an elf for a mall Santa is hysterical. I laughed out loud many, many times. This book would be a great stocking-stuffer.One little word of warning, some of these stories appear in other books by Sedaris (the Santa story is in \\"Barrel Fever\\"), so don't expect all new material. However, it's a great collection of short stories for the holidays."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book got me through November and December, two months when I'm weighed down with holiday depression. Sedaris crafts these stories with sincerity and humor and he makes you ponder how such events could ever happen. You'll read the book in a matter of hours because of its shortness, but the following year, you'll want to pick it up again and revisit the hilarity."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Drop this li'l book on the coffee table when the family is over, wait until someone picks it up, and within 5 to 10 minutes expect laughter. The kind of laughter that, even if you're at work, or in church or on a plane, will shake your whole body. Sardonic, wild, socially observant and irreverant, this is the first Sedaris I've read and know now what the interest is about. Really goddamn funny."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"In a word: hilarious. This book is not long, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in laughs. I took this slim volume on a flight to visit the family during the past holiday season, and it was just the thing to put me in the spirit. One story is formatted as a newsletter to the writer's family, and I thought I was really going to disturb all the passengers seated around me with my hysterical laughter that I tried so hard to subdue. I must say that you should avoid this book like the mistletoe at an office Christmas party if you don't go for dark humor. These short stories are not warm, fuzzy Tiny Tim scenes, but they do make you draw parallels with people you may know and (...*gasp!*...) even people in your own family. The price is right, and the time is now to buy this wonderfully funny book! I also recommend the other books by David Sedaris! You'll laugh until you cry."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"By now just about everyone has heard that this is THE book to read during the Holidays as well as being the perfect little 'stocking stuffer' gift. In some regards this may be the case - especially with the brilliant first short story in this tiny tome, 'The Santa Land Diaries,' a hilarious memoir of Sedaris' experience working as a seasonal elf at Macy's. Unfortunately the remaining five stories fail to sustain the high level of excellence delivered early on making the remaining 2/3's of the book somewhat of a disappointment.If you are a fan of Sedaris or curious about all the hoopla surrounding his style of humor then this book is certainly worth your while, especially with its brilliant opening and the fact that it shouldn't take you more then an hour to read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"So far I have only read, \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" by this author and I can say that it was one of my favorite books! I had never laughed out loud so hard at a book before. That book left me very eager to read another one of Sedaris books and over the holidays I picked up \\"Holidays on Ice\\" - - If you are looking for something to cheer you up during the stressful holiday times, pick up this little book by Sedaris. It's short but full of great short stories that will have you chuckling out loud!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If anyone thinks that they own the title of World's Worst Christmas Elf, buying this book is a must! The selections are short and sweet-bittersweet that is. I hate the holidays; I hate spending time in \\"lockdown\\" with my family, but this book is worth all of the suffering. Sedaris is a must, from the fun of \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\", to the ghastly family newsletters every spunky family feels they must send me, \\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family\\". I picked this baby up at a white elephant grabbag. It is, by far, superior to the pretzels my uncle selected or the chocolates snatched up by my mother. If anyone out there is a sarcastic, humorous, realist-this is the book to go for."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This holiday book by David Sedaris is a collection of sophisticated, sardonic, and quite superb stories. His style reminds me of Cleveland Amory (remember him? several years ago he wrote reviews for TV Guide--yes, this bit of information dates me)--somewhat crumudeonly, but very entertaining and funny.Among other things, Sedaris shares his take on Christmas pageants and working as an elf during the holidays.Written in a totally different style,Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voicestakes a look at how simple acts of thoughtfulnes came have a great impact."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This collection of short stories is great for those cold holiday nights when you're curled up by the fire with a plate of cookies. The first story, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\", is by far my favorite. It's the tale of a Macy's Christmas Elf who witnesses the worst humanity has to offer in the form of overbearing, stressed-out parents, overexcited kids, disgruntled Santas, etc. I laughed so much that I almost spilled hot cocoa all over myself.Some of the other stories are good, too. I liked \\"Dinah\\", which is a story about one of the author's sisters' less sophisticated friends, and \\"Front Row Center\\", which is a scathing critique of those lovely Christmas pageants we faithfully attend each year. \\"Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family\\" takes the form of the ubiquitous Christmas newsletter, but with an interesting twist. Honestly, the last two stories, \\"Based Upon a True Story\\" and \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" weren't my favorite, but that's not to say they weren't well-written ~ it just wasn't my sort of humor. But overall, a good, witty, gift book for the reader on your holiday list."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy & hearty laugh.I adore this man!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Truly the author's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on Christmas, parents, children, evangelical Christians from Kentucky, television, Macy's, the result of a dalliance during the Viet Nam War, and \\"keeping up with the Joneses\\".This short book is much funnier than his best-selling \\"Me Talk Pretty Some Day\\" as the author's humorous cynicism is at its best. One can't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the American psyche.Three of the stories appear to be autobiographical (with obvious changes made to \\"protect the innocent\\") wherein the author \\"tells\\" the others in the guise of another.Regardless, Sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches, even if there's a little guilt attached to that feeling."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is a short very easy read containing essays and stories regarding the Christmas season.There are some real gems here including 'Seasons Greetings to our Family and Friends' and 'Santaland Diaries'. These two pieces in particular generate several laugh out loud moments. Both of these have also been adapted for the stage and are also available to buy.I have re read 'Seasons Greetings...etc' three times and each time I am tickled pink.A good stocking filler!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sort of a cross between an anti-Christmas card and a greatest hits package, Holidays On Ice makes a great introduction to Sedaris' biting wit or a reminder of why you loved him to begin with.Of course, the centerpiece here is &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot;, the hilarious retelling of working at Macy's as an elf to the boorish and overbearing parents and spoiled children who come to visit Santa. Sedaris always seems to me to be blasting both the elite and corporate worlds at the same time he looks down his nose at those that he perceives as lower on the ladder than himself. But, all's fair in satire, right?Three of the stories are printed here for the first time (three came from his first two collections), and the best is undoubtedly &quot;Based Upon A True Story&quot;, in which a television producer attempts to bribe a church congregation to pressure a fellow parishioner to sign over her story to his network for a mini-series. The woman in question had surgically transplanted a kidney to her dying son with only a Bible, a barn, and rudimentary cutting instruments. Although the story is both funny and tasteless, Sedaris' opinions are scathing and clear.This collection is so appealing because all of the fat has been trimmed away and we're left with a short collection of holiday themed stories from one of America's angriest satirists. If this hooks you, Sedaris' longer collections are just waiting for you to be horrified by them (and I mean that in the best possible way)."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This year there are no shortage of Christmas books on this site or in your local book shop to fill you with all the images of the holiday season: snow crested fields, roaring fireplaces, carolers, holly and ivy- you get the picture. There are newcomers like Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas\\" and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark's \\"He Sees You While You're Sleeping\\" and \\"The Mitford Snowmen\\". Booksellers pile them right next to classics like Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\\" \\"The Polar Express,\\" and Dr. Seuess' \\"The Grinch that Stole Christmas\\". Just like the annual search for the perfect tree, the search for the perfect holiday book is no less daunting.So while browsing for my holiday selection, I was directed to a small paperback volume in David Sedaris' \\"Holidays on Ice\\". It's been out for a few years, but I missed this one (after reading it, I think I missed it because the Christmas police must have ordered it off the shelves for fear of causing a national laughing epidemic). Forget the antisocial behavior of the Grinch, he's just an out of work elf compared to Sedaris. Nothing, absolutely nothing about Christmas is immune from the sarcasm and cynicism displayed in the collection of short stories that make up this small volume. After reading this book on my train ride to Rockefeller Center to watch the annual lighting of the Christmas tree, I don't think that I'll ever be the same. Imagine that Santa's \`Ho, Ho, Ho' greeting is really his egg nog induced shout to a streetwalker; or that Macy's dresses ex-cons and thugs as its Christmas elves; ever receive a Christmas letter from a cousin inside the annual holiday card only to have him recount his indictment for murder and invite your family to his bail hearing; or what about a contest with the neighbors over who can donate more blood to show the spirit of giving. Like I said, I'll never be the same.If you like to laugh and can appreciate the acerbic wit of someone whom must have gotten too much coal in his stocking as a child to come up with this collection of irreverences, then this one's for you."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays are trying at best, you try to get the shopping done, you try not to gain 10 pounds and you try not to kill your relatives.David Sedaris has captured the true spririt of the holidays in his collection of short stories &quot;HOLIDAYS ON ICE&quot;. And no way is Tiny Tim gonna make us feel all warm and sappy.With a sharp tongue and even shaper typewriter, Sedaris tells the tales of being an Elf at Macy's. Another about how his sister brings home a co-worker who is on a work-release program from prison and the most absurb tale on giving until it hurts, literally. If you have just been turned on to Sedaris you might be a little dissapointed in this book, but there are a few laughs but all tales are so well written you will be compelled to finish this book in one evening.For those of you new to Sedaris, you will get a quick look into the sense of humor of one of America's up and coming humorists."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"An oustanding and hilarious book describing holiday events. It describes well, normal people and families who shop at the last minute and whos children have holiday plays that bore your brains out. I highly recomend this book for anyone with the least bit sense of humor.Max"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"&quot;If the guy doesn't like being an elf, find other employment..but don't bother us.&quot; But Sedaris himself says that he took the elf job partly because he thought it was the most &quot;frightening career opportunities&quot; he had ever seen. And near the end he enjoys the holiday rush. Factual inaccuracies aside, this story is brilliantly and bitterly funny. The other five in this collection are wonderful and typical of Sedaris' ability to create full-bodied characters with acerbic twists. A nice small christmas gift to put under the tree. Not as essential as Barrel Fever, but a treat still."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"One of my favorite Sedaris collections. It has some new stories as well as some old that I have read elsewhere. Great stocking stuffer for a Sedaris fan. All the stories are hilarious - especially \\"Santaland Diaries.\\" Sedaris has a gift for humor that shines throughout this book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"\\"This afternoon I sat in the eighth-floor SantaLand office and was told, \` Congratulations, Mr. Sedaris. You are an elf.'\\" This is one of the many hilarious quotes from David Sedaris' novel Holidays on Ice which contains six enlightening Christmas stories. Also known for his other hilarious books Me Talk Pretty One Day and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, middle aged humorist Sedaris writes about his own experiences and thoughts on the Christmas season.In the first essay entitled \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" Sedaris tells his about his crazy encounters working as an elf in the department store Macy's after getting rejected from UPS. He describes the shoppers and fellow employees with sarcastic humor. He tells about his various jobs that he works, and explains about the Magic Window position. He has to stand there and exclaim, \\"Step on the Magic Star and look through the window, and you can see Santa!\\" One day he gets bored of saying the same fifteen words over and over again, so he decides to mix things up a bit. \\"Step on the Magic Star and you can see Cher and Mike Tyson!\\" People start to get upset when they sacrifice their spot in line to see Santa to go into the Magic Star line. Needless to say, David Sedaris is never positioned in the Magic Star line again.The next essay, \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" is a fictional story about the ridiculousness of long family descriptions on Christmas cards. \\"He's made the honor roll every semester and there seems to be no stopping him!!! A year and a half left to go and already the job offers are pouring in! We love you, Kevin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" exclaims the narrator Mrs. Dunbar. Mrs. Dunbar's ideal world, however, soon comes crashing down when a stranger named Khe Sahn suddenly comes to live with them. As it turns out, Mrs. Dunbar's \\"perfect\\" husband had a daughter in Vietnam named Khe Sahn. As the story unfolds, Khe Sahn turns their world upside down.\\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is another essay describing the bizarre world of David Sedaris. He tells how his sister Lisa brought her friend Dinah home one day four days before Christmas. He describes the humorous way in which his family reacts to her, and the questions they ask her about her interesting life in prison and about her experiences as a prostitute.Another essay, \\"Christmas Means Giving,\\" tells the fictional story about one family's competition with their neighbors, the Cottinghams. Every year, the neighbors try to out-do the other's Christmas deeds, and as you will see it gets pretty crazy as the families try to be the best and most \\"giving\\" in the neighborhood.Holidays on Ice is a hilarious book of essays that will keep you laughing non-stop. I recommend this novel for anyone who wants a good laugh, young or old. I personally give this book two very enthusiastic thumbs up for its dry humor. Each sarcastic and humorous essay will make you want to read the next. By the way, this collection of essays would make a great Christmas gift!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sedaris has written a collection of holiday gems! Although the quality of story goes downhill after the first of the book, \\"The Santaland Diaries,\\" it should be noted that this is only the case because his account of life as a Macy's SantaLand elf is the most hilarious retail story ever put on paper. Anyone who has ever worked at a busy store around the holidays will be unable to contain their laughter while reading this. I recommend you don't do it on the subway.Other great shorts include \\"Front Row Center at Thaddeus Bristol\\", an account of Catholic School Christmas shows from the perspective of a grade school theater critic, and \\"Christmas Means Giving\\", where a wealthy family gives their limbs, major organs, and children to charity in an attempt to best their neighbors in philanthropy.Holidays On Ice is a must have for the stressed during the holidays."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"A couple stories are a little dark, but it's not a dark book. It's just hilarious. The stories are short, so if you don't like the one involving the baby in the clothes dryer, skip it and go straight to the critic's review of the school Christmas play, or the tale of rich neighbors taking their consumer competitiveness to new heights.Reading this in December is one of my favorite holiday traditions."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you are looking for the literary equivalent of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"-this book is definitely NOT for you. However, if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays, you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by David Sedaris. From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the \\"Christmas [...]\\" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris gives holiday reading a whole interesting twist in this short-story collection. Holiday on Ice features six stories that vary from being darkly funny to surrealistically twisted. Christmas is shown in a whole different and satirical perspective in these short stories. I couldn't put them down and laughed myself numb with the hilarious passages and dialogue. I wished there had been more stories in this collection. My favorites are \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (this story is somewhat autobiographical), \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!,\\" and \\"SantaLand Diaries.\\" All six of the stories, three of which had been previously published, though I hadn't read any of them before, are incredible, but the aforementioned three are the ones that stand out the most to me. I loved Me Talk Pretty One Day and am glad I gave another Sedaris book a whirl. His style is quite similar to the works of Augusten Burroughs. They both write dark, satirical and surrealistic fiction. Are you in the bargain for cynical holiday stories? I cannot recommend Holiday on Ice enough! This is a not-to-be-missed holiday read."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Brilliant! Disturbing! Deliciously short and appropriate for holiday evening reading. Tuck this one in your travel bag when you go home for the holidays to use as an escape or distraction. I don't want to give too much away, but the piece on working as an elf at Santaland should be familiar to public radio listeners, and it is hilarious. The visciously biting review of an elementary school Christmas pageant, \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" is another terrific read.This is a book to own and open up every holiday season to read the stories over again. Pass it around the house. It's a very quick read."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Like many other people, my introduction to David Sedaris was through \\"The Santaland Diaries,\\" broadcast on NPR's \\"This American Life\\" (I think). Maybe it was Sedaris's down-on-his luck history, his brooding delivery, or Ira Glass's fabulous production, but the readings (and their musical segu&eacute;s) were masterpieces. They captured all the ironies of the Christmas holiday -- the humiliation of grown people wearing elf costumes to bring in a few bucks; the madness of parents force-feeding reluctant children into the gaping maw of Macy's Christmas machine; the delicious naughtiness of elves cavorting behind the snowy scenery; the stinginess of the retail business to its own employees.Now that Sedaris has become successful, his readings have lost their desperate edginess. And without Glass's sure and sensitive production, they lose their aural appeal. I'd recommend reading these stories rather than listening to audio versions.That said, \\"Holiday on Ice\\" has a few delights that make it worth a listen. \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" still has a few moments that will have you shaking your head at the lunacy of the Christmas experience. The encounters between the physically and mentally disabled with all-too-human Santas is an exercise in pathos, if not hilarity. \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is a classic Sedaris piece, whose innocuous beginning lurches without warning into a collision between David's wacked-out family and the bizarre Southern characters that populated Sedaris's youth. For an added treat, \\"Dinah\\" is voiced by Amy Sedaris, the author's talented sister.Other pieces don't succeed as well as these. \\"Based Upon A True Story\\" has a creepy, big-city TV exec blackmailing a \\"hillbilly\\" Christmas church audience, but seems more mean than mirthful. \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" -- in which a theater critic savages children's Christmas pageants -- misses the comic mark entirely. Others, like, \\"Season's Greeting To Our Friends and Family!\\" -- a loonily bitter Christmas letter from a suburban Mom hurled over the edge of sanity and civility by her husband's long-lost Vietnamese daughter -- fail to play the knife-edge that separates a piece that finds humor in discomfort from one that is plain discomfitting.Since the publication of \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" David Sedaris has proven himself as a writer of subtlety, humanity and wry humor. This uneven collection shows him on the way to discovering his voice."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The first story about the Santaland stood out more than the others, but I would give the story about the baby in the dryer just as much credit for being just as creative and almost as funny. This is a book that you will find yourself laughing outloud, which I have never done before until now. The best part is that it is small enough to fit in a purse and the stories are short enough to read while trying to waste time. I gave it four stars because there were a couple stories that drug on and could have been deleted and the author is very forgiving when you read another one of his right after"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have read Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim and Me Talk Pretty One Day. I love them both with everything in me. So, I was very excited to backtrack and read Holidays on Ice. I waited until I went to New York for Christmas and took the book with me with high hopes. I was very disappointed. I was not aware that a lot of Sedaris' early writing was simply fiction and did not really have grounding in his family or life--most of this book is like that. The stories are mildly entertaining and imaginative. They seemed even darker than usual and even more cynical than I could handle, which I found strange. David's cynical outlook framed in a humorous, matter-of-fact manner is one of the things I love about him. A couple of the entries in this book almost made me feel dirty, due to disturbing violent imagery. However, the very thing, which took it way over the top, also is what helped get the point across. I would still recommend this book for any Sedaris fan. Don't read it to get in the Christmas mood and you will be fine, come at it with the framework as a social commentary."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Beware -- wet your pants, snort out loud, shake uncontrollably funny! This is a great gift to yourself or that person who would rather listen to a book on cd rather than read. And, David's reading style is delightful. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Book in excellent condition; contents disappointing. Would not recommend to any of my friends/relatives. Not much more to say after what that."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, despite the fact that it is a seasonal book. The way David Sedaris observes the world is no doubt a bit dark, but utterly hysterical. If you are not looking forward to the holidays, or even if you love the holidays but have a somewhat dark sense of humor, this book will leave you in tears from laughing so hard."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Buy this book -- a paperback copy is good, not a Kindle version -- and put it with your Christmas/Holiday stuff. Just store it in the boxes along with your tree stand (not to be confused with your deer hunting tree stand...), Christmas balls (don't confuse those either), family recipes and homemade ornaments. Then pull Holidays on Ice out each year and read it during the holidays. Preferably with a stiff drink in your hand. Add a rosemary sprig with a few speared cranberries to whatever you're drinking if you want to really get festive about it. The stories are short, quick, and highly enjoyable (TWSS). I swear it's been a holiday tradition of mine for years. Happy Holiday Reading!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love David Sedaris. I read this one in about 20 minutes and could not stop laughing. Highly recommend anything by David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I absolutely LOVED his other book, Me Talk Pretty One Day and laughed out loud the entire time I was reading it!Naturally, I thought Holidays on Ice would be of the same caliber, but it was a little bit of a letdown. His opening story about working as an elf at Macy's was absolutely HILARIOUS, but the stories that followed seemed to be progressively less and less funny. Several stories had very little, if anything at all, to do with Christmas so I really don't understand how this book even really qualifies as a holiday anthology to start with.I'm not saying the book was bad, because it wasn't. You might buy it and it might be right up your alley. I read the whole book cover to cover and mostly enjoyed it and had a few quiet chuckles, however it just didn't have that laugh-out-loud quality that his other books have."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is the first book I haven't like as much as the others ...but his elf experience at Macy's is worth the price of admission.

I've been wanting to read something by him for quite some time and it was certainly worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is a hilarious book. It made me laugh and laugh. That is the uniqueness of the \\"Holidays on Ice\\" book by David Sedaris. You may want to pity the characters, yet they are amusing in the way they deal with situations in the stories. It is easy for us to relate to the characters, because we deal with people like them in our everyday lives. The characters remind me of those in The Usurper and Other Stories. I can understand why many people love this book too. The smooth writing, fabulous descriptions, amazing dialogue and gripping pacing are the elements that made this story an accomplished piece of writing."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Did not like the language, found the &#34;humor&#34; unpleasant.

It turned out to not be much of anything. I don't know, I guess I expected the shenanigans to be more interesting than &#34;Look through this window and you can see Cher!&#34; I read a couple of the other stories too, but they likewise failed to hold my interest, so I gave up before finishing."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I had not heard of David Sedaris until barrowing the NPR Christmas CD, which included a sample of this book.

The audio books are best, I just love Sedaris' voice."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Santaland Diaries is the showpiece of the great collection of holiday essays. Have given this as an (adult - one story is Dinah the Christmas Whore) gift many, many times.

A few of the stories, particularly the first one, were funny and I enjoyed them. Others were kind of blah, and some I had to skim through as they weren't interesting at all. If you're a fan of David Sedaris then my guess is that you will enjoy these stories. I'd never read anything by him before, and found it okay but not something I'd purchase again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"\\"Holidays on Ice\\" is a holiday-themed collection of mostly previously published stories by the American humorist and short-story writer David Sedaris. Since two-thirds of these stories have been published in other anthologies of Sedaris's work, this book might most be appropriate as a holiday gift for the uninitiated or for the collector.The piece that leads off the collection is Sedaris's wry \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" which brought Sedaris national acclaim when he read versions of the story on NPR in the early 1990s. Later, in the mid-1990s, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" was adapted for the stage. The story consists of a series of anecdotes based on Sedaris's real-life experiences working at Macy's Herald Square.For the benefit of those unfamiliar with his work, I'll point out that Sedaris often finds humor in dark and absurd subject matter. (At a reading once I heard him recommend Gordon Grice's \\"The Book of Deadly Animals\\" for its humor value.) His detached and jaunty air about such things can be unsettling and yet perversely funny. For example, in \\"Let It Snow,\\" a story set during his childhood, Sedaris and his siblings convince their baby sister to lie on their snow-covered street so that she'd get run over and shame their mother, simply because she'd forced them to go outside and not come back in the house. In another instance that made even me cringe, in \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" a foreign youth acting as a babysitter kills a child after misunderstanding directions given her in English. At the very least, you are never going to be bored by a Sedaris story.Occasionally, a story can be touching, even one that bears the unpromising title of \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\" I particularly liked reading this tale in which one of Sedaris's sisters at Christmas time heroically reaches out to rescue an abused woman. Sedaris's usual bluntness and uncompromising observations helps bring out the sweetness of the piece. It's the closest to being a \\"true meaning of Christmas\\"-type story in the book.The cover art suggests that these are all winter holiday stories, but, in fact, there are a couple of stories that relate to Easter and Halloween. These, too, are delightful yarns, but feel a little out of place in a book of stories principally set during Christmas."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Not a badly written book, it just didn't hold my interest. Some humorous episodes, but a bit too much rambling for me. Simply a matter of taste"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was a great book and was entertaining. Most of the stories had to do with Christmas with a few having to do with Easter. Overall, very entertaining."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've seen this book described as delightful, acerbic, sardonic, charming. It isn't humorous at all, instead it is a heavyhanded bitter collection of short stories by someone who apparently doesn't like the human race very much."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I got this for a gift and it was well received. You people should not require me to use a certain number of words, it just doesnt make sense. I only wanted to say it is good."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I've purchased and attempted to read. The first couple of chapters were interesting and funny but didn't have anything to do with dealing with family. It was about his Christmas job. I didn't necessarily like his view of families and children in which the humor was a little too dark for my taste. Halfway through, there was really more mundane daily stuff that didn't hold my attention. I didn't have any interest in finishing this book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book was quickly shipped and error on my part handled courteously.

Gordon and Sara de Holmes (a.k.a. \\"The Americans\\") recommended to me this wonderfully short little plopper of a writer, and I couldn't be happier to have taken the advice. As Gordon pointed out in a recent SF Bay-Area appearance - after he and De Holmes re-enacted the final love scene from the Marquis De Sade's lost novel, The Merit of being Meretricious - the contemporary literary repertoire has taken a disturbing turn with its obstinate stance of high-falootin'ness. I don't mean (nor did Je.X.x.X., to my knowledge) to bemoan high-falootin' literature *per se*, but the lit journal hegemony has seemingly chosen high-falootin' writers to the point of exclusion of all others....Enter David Sedaris...With Sedaris, we finally have an author who can satisfy both the high-falootin' crowd and those with at least a marginal sense of humor [litmus test : if you laughed out loud (LOL'ed to you interweb addicts) during the encore of Madonna's Oklahoma City concert during the Papa don't Preach tour, you most likely have at least a marginal sense of humor.]. Here he is, a U. of Iowa graduate (or so Gordon says - I haven't checked for myself..) with a knack for post-modernistically meaningless sentences such as \\"We turned instinctively to our mother\\" (page 88, Holidays on Ice), a cleverly unoriginal first name that brings up images of infuriatingly incoherent short story authors, and cool pictures of himself smoking cigarrettes (probably either hand-rolled or European.. no, wait, probably the cheap brand that your retarded uncle buys..). Add to that formula a public-radio-worthy wittiness and a cute smile, and you've got yourself one of today's rising literary stars.Sedaris owns!

The only problem is that the stories are not new. Nowhere does it say this on the book cover.

His pieces on family life and French expatriate living in Me Talk Pretty One Day stand out as examples.Holidays on Ice features fewer such gems. Most of the stories here are fictional, and in my opinion do not work nearly as well. The standout exception, however, is the hilarious SantaLand Diaries, one of the funniest things I've ever read and which in itself is well worth the price of the book. This is the real-life story of Sedaris' stint as a Macy's SantaLand elf. Sedaris focuses on our collective stupidity, but as always he mixes in just the right amount of self-depreciation to make the piece come off perfectly.I believe that it was Tom Clancey that said that the difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense. The figures in SantaLand Diaries (elves, Santas, and the Great American Public) behave just irrationally enough that the story has to be true. Ironically, aside from being hilariously funny Sedaris uses all of this illogical behavior to give us an interesting look at human nature.This is a two star book that is saved by a five star story. Buy it and read the last thirty pages."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"While all of the stories and essays in Holidays on Ice are good, the standout is clearly \\"The Santaland Diaries\\". I always think that if I laugh out loud while I'm reading something, then that by itself makes the book worth the price of purchase. I actually had to put the story down till I pulled myself together enough to resume reading it. \\"The Santaland Diaries\\" is a glimpse at our own attitudes and behavior during \\"the festive holiday season\\". Perhaps it is a clicheed sentiment (if a cynical opinion can be sentimental), but it is true that during the one time of the year when we should be celebrating peace and love for our fellow man, we behave like looters and scavengers in an orgy of mass consumption, ready to slit the throat of anyone who we percieve is trying to interfere with our quest to have a picture taken with a guy in a Santa suit. Sedaris illustrates this with biting humor and, of course, fiction is never as funny as what happens in real life. By the way, I'm pretty sure the story in \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" actually happened too. Besides, I just love a story with a good whore in it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"To call David of Sedaris's sense of humor unique, might be an understatement. In \\"Holiday's on Ice.\\" David delivers his wicked black humor with a Christmas theme that will doubtfully ever translate into a classic made for TV movie. These are certainly not heart warming, life affirming tales to read in front of the fire place with a nice glass of eggnog. To Sedaris, Christmas is an odd assortment of disgruntled department store elves, ..., tv executives, and suburbanites struggling with the \\"true\\" meaning of Christmas. \\"Give until it bleeds.\\"As always Sedaris uses his unique viewpoints, and sometimes personal experiences to create rich and creative stories. \\"Holidays on Ice\\" is a collection of his finest holiday based stories. While not as involving and complete as \\"Naked,\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" \\"Holidays On Ice\\" is a nice Sedaris for beginners book. Stories like \\"Santa Land Diaries,\\"and \\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" are as involved, and as well told as any other story in his longer works. \\"Holidays on Ice\\" proves once again that David Sedaris is one of the finest Humorists, and all around story tellers in America today."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris' &quot;Holidays On Ice&quot; has become the gift of choice for several of my friends this year. His smartass writings are full of vivid imagery, and his characters have a real feel to them. I love to flip through a book while in a bookstore, and have it make me laugh within the first few seconds. This book easily accomplished that. Never cruel, his matter-of-fact statements easily dulled the shine of plastic Christmas', but I still appreciated the wit and wisdom he offered in this work. Although I was unfamiliar with his work until this book, I have already ordered his other two books, and look forward to reading them on a cold night in front of a warm fire."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I give this book/tape the highest recommendation, but I definitely don't recommend listening to it while driving in traffic, because it will cause the listener to laugh too loud, too hard and too often. Sedaris' reading is a little saccharine at times, which is a little surprising for someone who writes with such supernatural dry ironic wit. Apparently, perfection on both counts is too much to ask. On the other hand, the level of dry, ironic wit in his writing is so far above the mean that it would be unjust to expect more from a reader. Actually, describing Sedaris' wit as dry is pretty much akin to comparing sulfuric acid to Bourdeaux wine. Ann Magnuson gives a reading performance every bit as good as the author's black humor writing. [Amy Sedaris' work is also wonderful, but any Strangers With Candy fan will expect that as a matter of course.] With the holiday season all but upon us, Holidays on Ice is a perfect antidote for the obligatory flood of Christmas culture. I simply can't recommend these tapes too strongly and I imagine that the written text is every bit as good. Just exercise extreme care if you drive while they are playing."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I was first introduced to David Sedaris through NPR's weekly show, &quot;This American Life,&quot; and there's been more than one occasion while listening to his pieces when I've had to pull my car over because the tears in my eyes were obscuring my view. He's just that funny.He's also sick and twisted, but that's great if you like that kind of thing. His stories are almost best heard, so if you can find the book-on-tape it's worth adding to your collection. The problem is those tapes often leave out one or two of the stories from the written version, so I end up with both, anyway.Start a new holiday tradition with your family and bring this one to dinner! It'll be a year you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Another collection of essays from humorist David Sedaris, Holidays on Ice is not his best work. The stories, all dealing with the holiday season, are hit or miss, making for a very uneven book.Far and away, the funniest, most irreverent essay included here is \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" wherein Sedaris recounts his days working as a Macy's elf -- at the age of 33. This story alone makes Holidays readable, but if you're looking to begin reading David Sedaris, pass on this book and pick up Me Talk Pretty One Day instead."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice: Stories was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and this collection of 6 holiday essays is the funniest book, ever. With Sedaris, nothing is sacred about the holidays. He lampoons working at Macy's as a Christmas elf, holiday newsletters, school pageants, and excessive gift giving. Some of his humor is side-splitting, tears rolling down your cheeks funny. SantaLand Dairies, about Sedaris working at Macy's in SantaLand is the funniest and the longest story of the bunch. How Sedaris kept himself sane while parading around as an elf will have you laughing out loud.Other stories are written with a deeper, darker, more satirical wit. One story, Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family, was a little too morbid for my taste. But all the stories are good, and all of them make us realize how over-the-top our Christmas celebrations have become.I listened to this book on CD, which made it even more enjoyable as it's read by the author. Simply reading the book will cheat you out of hearing Sedaris mimic Billie Holiday singing Away In A Manger.So in addition to the three or four other Christmas \\"classics\\" that I enjoy reading each year, I now have a new one to add to my list."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love David Sedaris, but honestly this particular compilation of short stories was beyond dark.(1) \\"SantaLand Diaries.\\" By far the funniest of the bunch. This is an extremely comical recollection of time spent working as a Macy's Santa elf. The essay has a rather abrupt ending, but it'll make you laugh out loud.(2) \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!!\\" Here the collection already starts to take a toll for the morbid and frightening. Written in a holiday-letter form by a desperate, murderous housewife this story stretches the limits of dark humor to places that are just wrong. Infanticide + attempt at humor = bad, not funny.(3) Dinah, the Christmas Whore. Sedaris almost redeemed himself. Almost. The story was okay. It wasn't a laugh-out-loud tale like \\"SantaLand,\\" but it was decent.(4) \\"Front Row Center.\\" At least it's short. In this short story, a \\"reporter\\" gives reviews for all the Christmas-themed school pageants. Kinda creepy that someone would go to all of them, and there's only so much kid-acting-bashing one can take. Guess that's why it was short(5) \\"Based Upon a True Story.\\" This was absolutely criminal. A TV producer pays the local town preacher off in order to give one of the most insulting, degrading, soul-less \\"sermons\\" in history.(6) \\"Christmas Means Giving.\\" This one had potential. Sedaris at least was creative in his exaggerations. However, it did seem once again to go a little over the line.These essays had potential. The biggest problem was that Sedaris frequently confused sarcasm with humor. It won't exactly put you in the Christmas spirit, but if you like Sedaris, you'll probably still manage to find ways to like the book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Another collections of hilarious short stories by David Sedaris. All of them were hysterical. I loaned this book to many a friend and have yet to find an intelligent person who does not get this author! He is so well crafted at the art of writing, I laughed so hard I cried reading it!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was my first time reading a David Sedaris book cover-to-cover. I've read a few of his other stories and excerpts based on recommendations. I chose this book for my book club and am not sure how the group will respond to it. I found it cynical and disillusioned, as expected. Unfortunately, for the most part, these tones were not accompanied by the humor I was expecting. I will definitely try some of his other books, but overall, was let down with this particular collection."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Nothing is off limits in this collection of essays. Sedaris let us into the world of department store elves, most of whom should not be anywhere near children in the SantaLand Diaries essay. Seasons Greetings is Sedaris' answer to those wretched holiday newsletters bragging about how great everything is for everyone complete with family photos of everyone in their matching holiday outfits. Holiday pageants and their butchering by teachers are the subject of Front Row Center. Religious zealots and rich yuppies also get their own essays.Even though there are only 6 essays in this book, all are funny. You'll be grossed out by some, but what's a David Sedaris book without some gross out humor. Chances are you probably know people who closely resemble those being mocked in this collection.Perfect for those who loathe the Christmas music on the radio starting November 1st and store displays in the middle of summer. This collection is one that I re-read every Christmas season and treasure along with the annual Christmas Story marathon on tv."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I really liked the Macy's Elf portion of the narrative but the remaining tracks left something to be desired."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The first book I read of Sedaris's was Me Talk Pretty One Day, which was a mistake since I think it is probably the funniest book I have ever read. Holidays On Ice is still a good read, although it pales in comparison. It is funny, and if your family is as twisted as mine, then you could use it as a stocking stuffer. The best essay was clearly the Santaland Diaries, but Six to Eight Black Men was also extraordinarily funny."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Classic Sedaris! The first vignette is the best, I even burst out loud reading \\"Season's Greeting to our Friends and Family.\\" It is perfect if you think your family is screwed up, they do not really measure up. Sedaris moves on to what is actually an uplifting, yet disturbing act of charity in his short entitled \\" Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\"After those first two, the remainder of the book takes a familiar Sedaris dark turn, especially the disturbing look at competitive \\"giving\\". You will probably still enjoy it, but the final chapters seem to sputter out compared to the first couple of chapters."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Seven out of the twelve stories in this book have appeared in other books by Sedaris and are reprinted here. The reprinted stories are all his typical non-fiction, commentaries on his life. The other five stories are fiction, and while they are creatively written I don't find them as interesting as Sedaris' true accounts of his own life. The fiction stories are over-the-top ridiculous. They're not bad, just not what I'm used to and not what I expected.Here are the stories:\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" (from Barrel Fever)\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" (fiction)\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" (fiction)\\"Based Upon a True Story\\" (fiction)\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" (fiction)\\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (from Naked)\\"Jesus Shaves\\" (from Me Talk Pretty One Day)\\"Us and Them\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)\\"Let It Snow\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)\\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" (from Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)\\"The Monster Mash\\" (from When You Are Engulfed in Flames)\\"The Cow and The Turkey\\" (fiction, new story for this edition)If you want to read something really unusual from Sedaris, namely fiction, then check out this book. The non-fiction stories reprinted in this book are also very good with a couple of them being some of my favorites by Sedaris.This is a new edition of this book. Theoriginal edition, which is a few bucks cheaper, only contains the first six stories, while this one has twelve."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris's humour and experiences over the Christmas holiday season is just what the Dr. may order to help you through a hectic and over stressed holiday season. Very funny. It could make a long distance road trip in the dead of winter enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice is a timely book and would be a great Christmas gift to someone who is in need of a good chuckle. The author, David Sedaris, pokes fun at his dysfunctional family and the way he has resolved this issue by stumbling through is own life, finding humor at every turn. I hope you can find time to read this most enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I had checked out this book at the college library back in 2004 by chance. It was my first exposure to David Sedaris and I later realized I'd known of his family through Amy Sedaris on \\"Strangers With Candy.\\" Since then, I've read all of his books and ran into other author's like him (Augusten Boroughs comes to mind.) I took my dad for his birthday two years ago to see David Sedaris read live, from his then upcoming book, When You Are Engulfed in Flames.I don't think there is a single Sedaris book I would not recommend. I've bought several copies of this book as holiday presents to cheer up grumpy family members and co-workers. I doubt any of David Sedaris's humor is lost on even the scrooge-iest of Scrooges. The book is short and broken into several articles/ segments as heard on NPR in the 90's (they occasionally replay them to this day.) Fast and quick and always a pleasure!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Very good collection of David Sedaris works around a holiday theme. Enjoyable commentary on modern holiday life but very sad that much of it is all too true. If you like Sedaris this is a good holiday read to make you appreciate what you have."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I enjoyed this immensely and have given it as a gift to a couple of my friends because it makes a great read anytime of year. I think it's better to read it when it's not the holiday season because you appreciate it more when you aren't immersed in your own brand of holiday funk. Thumbs way up."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"On the Friday after Thanksgiving 2003, a news report circulated telling us of a woman trampled nearly to death during a mad rush in an early morning sale at her local Wal-Mart. Underneath her bruised and broken body was discovered a sad cardboard box containing an ultra-cheap DVD player, which the store managers kindly put on hold for her.The above story is something that isn't a million miles away from the non-fiction Christmas stories told in HOLIDAYS ON ICE. All these stories have the ring of truth about them even (as in the anecdote I mentioned above) if one suspects that the facts may have been somewhat embellished. It's their inherent believability that makes them funny. But once David Sedaris moves towards outright fiction, his stories are less successful. It feels as though he is constantly trying to outdo himself, making the stories more and more outrageous for fear that the mundane may not be as funny as the shocking.In any case, here are some quick comments on each of the five essays that make up this short collection:\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" -- David Sedaris entertains us with his stories of working a terrible job as one of Santa's elves in a Macy's department store. This is the highlight of the collection - a very funny piece indeed. People are funny to Sedaris. From the utterly bizarre people who take on the role of Santa and his elves to the equally strange people who show up to wander through SantaLand, all of them provide us with many laughs.\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends And Family!!!\\" -- Not one of the more successful efforts in this collection. Oh, the initial idea is amusing enough, but the execution leaves much to be desired. In short, this is a parody of one of those over the top generic Christmas letters than some people will mail out to everyone they know in an attempt to compress an entire year's worth of news into a single newsletter-sized message. The essay is funnier when it's mocking the little things that go into these communications (the overuse of multiple explanation points, the disturbingly flowery language), but less funny when it tries to tell it's story.\\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" -- The story of the Sedaris family taking in a lady of the evening. This essay is rather short, and ends up feeling more sweet than funny (though it's definitely amusing).\\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" -- An even shorter essay than the previous offering, but it is hilarious. Yes, one of the more annoying things about the holidays is being dragged to the inevitable children's production of some Christmas themed story. Or, to be more specific, an adult directing a group of unenthusiastic children in a horribly boring play. Sedaris perfectly captures the deep, deep horror that each self-aware member of the audience will experience if forced to attend one of these ghastly affairs.\\"Based Upon a True Story\\" -- Yikes. I didn't care for this one at all. An amoral television producer comes to a small town on Christmas to ask permission for the filming of a Based On A True Story TV Movie. This might have been much more amusing had Sedaris not beaten us over the head with his satire.\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" -- Again, a fictional story, and, again, not as successful as the true-life memoirs. This details the escalation that two families undergo in their attempt to become the biggest present-giver in the neighborhood. Sedaris abandons any attempt of subtlety and instead goes for over-the-top laughs.As you may have gathered, all of the stories in this small collection revolve around the holidays, and there's a lot of comedy fruit to be harvested from that time of year. But for as many as he successfully picks, he bludgeons others to pulp. It was a short collection so even the uninteresting pieces don't drag on for too long. HOLIDAYS ON ICE makes for a handy antidote to anyone feeling overwhelmed by the \\"holiday cheer\\" that comes around without fail every year at this time."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was a horrible selection for our book club. I didn't finish it & neither did most of the club. Very bleak & twisted."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book was not very good.

However, the story that includes the mindless death of an infant is not strong enough to justify the really shocking events of the story. Hey -- I like biting satire, but this story isn't good enough to carry it off. This one story really ruins the book for me -- it's a pretty crass attempt to shock, and it backfires. Sure, Sedaris has the right to write it, but prospective readers have the right to be warned."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris is a witty author who writes essays that can be simultaneously humorous and disturbing.This collection of stories confirms this impression, and they are loosely autobiographical, and sometimes veer into the purely fictitious. \\"Santaland Diaries\\" falls in the first category as the humble author writes \\"I am a thirty-three-year-old man applying for a job as an elf.\\" He writes about the dark side of a full time elf job, selecting his elf name of \\"Crumpet\\", donning a green velvet elf suit, and seeing things in Santaland that no living person would ever care to see.An elf with a handle bar mustache hitting on the moms, a child peeing on fake snow. Dark, yes.In \\"Let It Snow\\", he writes of being locked out of his house with his siblings on the fifth day of a snowstorm, as his mom suffered a \\"little nervous breakdown\\" and enjoyed drinking wine while the children desperately clammered to get in the house, eventually faking a death to get inside.\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a family holiday season newsletter, which starts with desperate circumstances and goes on methodically listing a crescendo of catastrophes; the perfect antidote to those sweet bragging holiday letters we all have received, and maybe, even written.Mr. Sedaris either works for you or not. You get to choose."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I read Sedaris' \\"Dress Your Kids in Curduroy and Denim\\" *I think I got the title right) and found it hilarious. So when I saw this by the same author in the bookstore, I bought it. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.The first story, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is hilarious, though. The best story in the book. I probably liked it so much because it was based on his life, (at least I think so), while the other stoies were unclear and coming from another person's point of view. I guess I like Sedaris' writing because he turns his own experiences that seem so ordinary and well, sometimes odd experiences, into such hilarious stories. So when I read this, I was expecting to read another compilation of funny stories like those he wrote about in \\"Dress Your ...\\" But I guess not. If you want to read the \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" I suggest you buy the other book that has it nd not spend the money for four other stories that aren't his best."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The Santaland Diaries was quite amusing. However, I did not find the remaining stories engaging."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is over the top and under the edge and into your face type humor. I didn't sense a single misstep: David Sedaris is a writer's writer. As a humorist, you, the reader, must decide if his style appeals to you. I know some people who would be horrified by this book. But I liked it.I did not, however, LOVE it. I respect good writing to the utmost. You get that here. I respect an author who has control over his stories in every aspect. You get that, too. I love humor more than anything, but...but...but I couldn't get around the fact that there was NOTHING nice in this book. I mean, zero. I honestly feel that as humans we have SOME redeeming qualities,and I know he was kidding, but it was kind of creepy.David Sedaris is really, really good at what he does. In fact, there is no one out there who can top him at this. So go ahead and get this book if you like, but don't expect me to say &quot;I laughed out loud through the whole thing&quot; or &quot;I laughed so hard the tears were falling down my face&quot; because, for me, that wasn't the case. Four stars for top quality writing from a top quality writer. One star missing for humanity.best, jean"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Okay, it's true: as other Amazonian reviewers point out, &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; is the crown jewel of this collection of essays and stories.

When my wife is depressed, I read her random sections of &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;: it reduces both of us to tears of hysterical laughter. Okay, so the lampoon of those obnoxious &quot;What Our Family Did for the Last Year&quot; Christmas letters is over the top: so is much classic Monty Python, Woody Allen, etc. If you loved the film THE REF, you'll adore HOLIDAYS ON ICE. (By the way, the marketeers who took the Santa-at-the-urinal photo off the front cover of the paperback edition are disgusting wimpoids.)"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I got this book as a christmas present and liked it so much I shared it with someone I truly liked and cared about but I did preface the loan with the statement that I wanted it back. When the relationship didn't go as expected I knew my book was in jeopardy, I asked for it back but instead of giving it back he gave it to someone else who he knew wouldn't give it back to me. So the moral of the story is &quot; Don't give out your David Sedaris books to vindictive sore losers.&quot; By the way the book was very very funny."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris is like an angry dysfunctional Dave Barry, only much funnier."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have played Santa in a big-budget holiday review for 8 years, and really love it. One of my fellow actors brought this tape into my dressing room one night. I laughed so hard I could hardly go onstage. Sedaris captures perfectly what it feels like to be in the Holiday Business. I'll share this tape with all of my &quot;serious actor&quot; friends who must do these shows just to make a living. Its nice to know we're not alone."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Buy this book. My sis was right when she gave it to me; you'll embarass yourself laughing out loud at all the wrong times even if you're not reading it - just THINKING about it! It's affected my writing a great deal, I now look for the humor in EVERYTHING. You'll love it unless you're a buffoon like the guy above who gave it three stars. Did anyone love Barrel Fever? I'm reading it and a bit disappointed so far. Oh well."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book was my first introduction to Mr. Sedaris, and I know that I will be reading more from him - soon. His wit is extremely sharp, and entertainingly cynical. He uses the language of that intelligent class clown that made everyone laugh in school, including the teacher. Further, his writing is as frank, honest and comfortable as a letter from a close friend. This book treads the common ground that most readers can easily identify and find much humor with. From the brazen condemnation expressed in &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, to the satirical, if not sarcastic &quot;swiftian&quot; essay entitled &quot;christmas is for giving&quot;, Sedaris keeps his reader's face suspended in a grin puncuated with out loud knee slapping laughter."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've been trying to get my husband to read Sedaris ever since I read Barrell Fever. So I bought the cassette of Holidays and played it on a long road trip- he was hooked by the end- nothing can compare to his ascerbic wit- when David is upset that his sister has brought Dinah home- because she is a whore- the mom decides to offer her booze in alphabetical order. Christmas means giving is as Swifitan look at yupppie greed styles.The reviews of Xmas pagents smarts! And one will never look at mall santas the same after hearing of his experiences-- I always laugh so hard I cry when reading or listening to David..."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Thank you, David Sedaris, for making us laugh about Christmas again. I heard about this book on NPR and I plan on reading it every Christmas from now on. Okay, it is dark humored and odd, but if it's well written, and it can talk about a theater critic going on and on about &quot;if I don't see another hat made out of a oatmeal box, it will be too soon.&quot; it's my type of book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"it's only with the help of writers like David Sedaris that X-mass is bearable. SantaLand Diaries is the best, but one of his new stories, Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol is also devastatingly funny. everyone in my family can expect a copy of this (and probably nothing else) under the tree."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is very funny. I read it a few months ago and there was one story I was not very fond of, hence the 4 stars (instead of 5), but I totally recommend it for the other great stories."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" save this one. Sedaris is at his best telling tales (tall or otherwise) of his own life and family. I like the satirical stories less. Still, it is David Sedaris after all... which means you'll no doubt laugh and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is an acerbic look at Christmas through stories that might be true to some extent. The story of parents at Macy's not wanting to send their children to the \\"chocolate\\" Santa captures so much of how Christmas can really pan out. The fact it's narrated by a man working as an elf makes it all the richer & funnier. The parody of those annoying letters people stick in Christmas cards progresses from ridiculous to unbelievably ridiculous. This would be the best gift for anyone with a good sense of humor who tires of Christmas hype and sentimentality of the Folgers tv commercial variety. I strongly strongly recommend the audiobook version of this book. Nothing will take the sting out of drives for holiday shopping or visits as much as it will."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'm a big David Sedaris fan. I think that Me Talk Pretty One Day is one of the funniest books I've ever read. I've checked out several of his books, the most recent being Holidays on Ice, a collection of holiday-themed comic essays.If you've seen the stage production of Santaland Diaries, then the anchor story in this collection will be very familiar to you. It details Sedaris' stint as a Macy's Christmas elf one year, and it is freaking hilarious. From the humiliating \\"uniform\\" to the strict instructions by the Gestapo-like Macy's Christmas management team, you will chuckle during this one.I found the rest of the book a bit uneven. \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" went on far too long, as did \\"Christmas Means Giving,\\" which took one joke and spun it out for more than 10 pages. I did enjoy reading \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" though, as well as \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol.\\"Though every story isn't a gem, the book is a quick read and worth checking out if you're in the mood for some subversive holiday humor.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Must read - brilliant!For everyone who has felt weird or knows weird people - these are the voices and stories.We've all been there or been near it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"While I enjoyed this book (especially the final story), I did not find it as outright hilarious as his other books. Which is not to say it isn't funny. It just did not meet the very high bar the other books set."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I am very pleased with the book. The condition was perfect. It arrived on time. I would purchase from dealer again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've heard David Sedaris on NPR, reading his own stories aloud. This is my first purchase of one of his books, and my reaction was mixed. The first story about being an elf in a department store was hilarious, especially when read aloud. The other stories, so far (I'm almost through it) have been less successful but still well-written. I'm happy enough with it to purchase other of his books (I see three of them are on one of the top ten fiction lists now) and see if his writing style is one that I truly enjoy."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David and Tom Elsa are my favorite comedy writers and there books make me laugh hysterically! I cant wait for engulfed!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I've read and I loved it. The stories had me crying because I was laughing so hard. I didn't laugh as much with the last 2 stories but they still made me chuckle. I really enjoyed Sedaris' sarcastic humor and the way he left me wanting to read more of his books. I plan on buying the rest of his books on my wish list!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Another collections of hilarious short stories by David Sedaris. All of them were hysterical. I loaned this book to many a friend and have yet to find an intelligent person who does not get this author! He is so well crafted at the art of writing, I laughed so hard I cried reading it!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is a riot. I was laughing so hard, I thought I'd need an oxygen mask to catch my breath. The SantaLand Diaries was by far the funniest thing I have ever read, and well worth the price of the book. The other stories weren't as hilarious as that one, but they were all funny and I'm glad I read them. This book is a great pick-me-up anytime of the year!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris, playwright and commentator for National Public Radio, gives us six seasonal tales in this slim volume of his short stories.\\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" the recounting of his days working as an elf at Macy's, is far and away the gem of the collection. Sedaris is hilariously funny as he hits on the universal truths and human patterns of behavior that make Christmas the beloved, harried season that it is.The second story \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!\\" begins in an equally funny vein posing as the Christmas letter from hell. What cheery news does the family who has seen a member murdered and another arrested for the crime write? Again, hilariously funny, but a rather dark turn at the end left an unseasonably bad taste in my mouth.\\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" continues this walk on the dark side as a young boy follows his sister to her secret life and they bring home a prostitute for Christmas. He gets a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing they have something no other family does.\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" returns to a lighter version of Christmas as Sedaris takes the reader to a variety of elementary school Christmas plays. Mini actors that only a devoted camcorder-toting parent could love have us laughing even when we know we shouldn't. Anyone who has ever sat through one of these amateur productions will relate to his wry insights.\\"Based upon a True Story\\" is the most cynical of the selections and hits at the materialistic baseness that lurks in everyone.\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" takes the idea of outdoing your fellow man to the most bizarre of all limits and again, may not be the cheery Christmas feel-good story one is looking for."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"After a glowing recommendation from my sister, I got this book and have to say I have mixed feelings about it. The (pseudo) non-fiction essays (Santland Diaries and Diana the Christmas Whore) are extremely funny and well worth reading. Unfortunately, the fiction essays are horrible. They are very mean spirited, pessimistic, and well, just not very funny. The satire is laid on thick and shameless, as if he had a bet going to see how absurd and over the top he could make a story. And each one is worse than the next. I was drowning in it. I've heard better reviews about some of his other books, so I'll give those a try. I would never recommend anyone buy this book, but please check it out from your library if just to read those non fiction essays."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"...the content can be found in all of his other books, which makes this one more of a &quot;collector's item&quot; for those of us who have read literally every other thing Mr. Sedaris has written.Well, what the heck! It's a cute little book and it's on sale."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Since I have reviewed many of Sedaris' books, it will surprise no one to know that I love his writing. He can make me weep with laughter. Holidays is no exception... the piece about applying for a job as a Santa's elf at Macy's in NYC is the one that NPR listeners will recognize and it is no less hilarious in print. It's the fact that you know this is probably EXACTLY what it is like as a Macy's Xmas elf - together with the emperor-has-no-clothes-on kind of truth that can make the whole essay a keeper. The other essays in this small collection of Sedaris gems involve other holidays themes. &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot;, changes how a young David views not only his sister Lisa but his family and what the bigger world is all about. &quot;Season's Greetings,&quot; is a screamingly funny suburban family xeroxed Christmas letter - let's face it, we've all received them, and although we love hearing what's happening in the lives of our friends, sometimes the gloss-over is a bit stretched - in Sedaris' version the life of the family starts out as plastic and suburban as usual and quickly degenerates in a wild tale of illegitimate children, lawsuits, implied incest and a bizarre and very funny host of other issues. Take a breather, find a corner, read this through while the tree is still up and laugh and laugh and laugh."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris was recommended to me by several friends who, like myself, enjoy sarcastic, dark and witty humor. While this book may contain a mildly funny passage or two in a ho-hum kind of way, it is completely devoid of any wit. Holidays on Ice appears to be Sedaris' desperate attempt to copy some of the humor found in drastically exaggerating the facts - as applied very successfully by authors like Bill Bryson or Peter Mayle. Unfortunately Sedaris completely fails in doing so.The first Santa Land story made me smile, but then the remainder of the book is like a stand-up routine gone terribly wrong. Knowing that it was intended to be fiction, I wasn't particularly troubled by the baby in the dryer part, but the way Sedaris wrote that story was so angry and over-the-top, lacking any kind of intelligent humor or wit. Half way into each story you feel like saying \\"OK David, I got it\\" but at that point he's usually just getting started.This is my first book review on Amazon. The only reason I felt compelled to write it, was to warn other readers on how uninspiring and non-entertaining I found it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"It certainly does not take long to get through this collection of short stories, and you may even end up with a whole new view of the holidays! Sedaris used biting humor throughout to get his holiday message across. Some of the stories were more &quot;enjoyable&quot; than others-- I loved the SantaLand Diaries. The Christmas letter story was harsh but humorous and one based on a true story was over the top. Worth reading if you don't mind a lump of cynicism in your stocking this year!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love David Sedaris, but even I will admit that sometimes he takes a gag and runs too far with it. While the letters and narratives are funny, inventive, and well-written, they occasionally go on a little too long. The exception of course is the Santa Land Diaries, which could go on through Valentines Day and I would not complain."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love David Sedaris. I love his writing - it's witty and amazingly observant. His commentary on daily life is brilliant and I'm quite certain that if we met in real life, we'd be best friends. It was because of this that I was interested in finally, after all these years, reading his Christmas collection Holidays on Ice. Sadly, in the end, I'm very torn with the book.Some essays are hilarious, like \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\" They share memories from his past Christmases worth mentioning (working as one of Santa's Elves at Macy's, having a prostitute join his family for Christmas). Some were published in other books of his, so I've already read them, such as \\"Let it Snow\\" and \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" (which are both terrific, nonetheless). And then some (three to be exact) I really didn't care for. They were okay, sure, but not written in his usual style. Rather than being first person narratives, he assumed the role of someone else and wrote their story (a angered wife, a rich competitive man, a TV executive) I didn't care for those stories and found myself skimming the pages rather than indulging. When it got back to his voice, I was comfortable again.The book didn't exactly get me into the holidays spirit, but it did bring out the jaded side of me. And that's just as good, right?"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I own all of david sedaris' books. This is absolutely one of my favorites. I even bought the audio book to accompany it because when he tells it, it is even better! Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift many years ago. Laugh out loud funny so I lent it out to a co-worker. He left the position and I never got the book back. I bought the book again and the exact same thing happened. I have a copy now that I will never let anyone borrow again. Buy your own because you cannot have mine! Seriously, David Sedaris is one of the most brilliant writers I've ever read and having dressed up as an elf myself once before, I was crying because I was laughing so hard. Definitely a great stocking stuffer if you are thinking of shopping early for Christmas..."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Omigosh, this was one with like a hard ice tea in the middle of the dessert. I thought the conversational essay was dead. Reading Dave is such a treat, he is the kind of guy I should date,polite,observant,with a dark witty, messed up sense of humor.Anyone who has worked in retail during Christmas can relate to The Santaland Diaries. He tells you about the highs and lows of being a christmas elf.Dina the Christmas Whore was a great visual essay and The Christmas Letter was a scream.(although in the most twisted way )The last two are confusing and not worth reading. But other than that its a great book."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book will give you a new perspective on holiday dread. Compared to these stories your holidays can't be all that bad. This book is well written, engaging and hilarious. Buy a copy!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I loved When You are Engulfed in Flames and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Sedaris' wit, sarcasm and ironic outlook on life, friends and family made me a fan and I am now reading his back catalog. I picked up Holidays on Ice figuring it might be a tonic to the over commercialization of the Christmas Season. I was right and I was wrong.The first story Santaland Diaries was exactly what I was looking for, a skewering of all the things wrong with the mad rush holiday shopping season. It was funny and witty and I knew I was in for a treat. Then I read the next story, which was Greetings to Our Friends and Family, a twisted look at the ubiquitous holiday letter, it was a little too dark and nasty for me. I moved on to Christmas Means Giving, a tale of keeping up with the neighbors that turns very grisly. Several of the stories I had read before in Flames and Corduroy, so that was a bit of a disappointment, I didn't realize all the stories weren't new.One of the other more memorable stories was Dinah, the Christmas Whore which was quite funny and rather touching. Of course it was a story involving David's family, where I find his humor at its best. I also really enjoyed Jesus Saves, a hilarious story of David's French class where everyone of a different nationality tries to explain Easter. So overall this collection was very uneven and it actually took me a month to read this very slight book, because parts of it were just too dark and a little shocking."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I never knew Sedaris could write fiction until I read this book. \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" had me laughing out loud in a restaurant (so not me), like I was some crazy, addled ol dude sitting at a corner table sharing a joke with his imaginary friend. It is a very rich little book. Read it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This is an updated collection which contains some previously-released works and some new stories. It was actually all new to me, as this was the first time I've ever read anything by author David Sedaris, although his reputation certainly preceded him. Overall, I definitely enjoyed his cynical, wry humor.I think Sedaris was most successful here in his more autobiographical stories (I'm assuming that these were somewhat true yet highly embellished). The chronicle which opens the book, \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" was by far my favorite; this is Sedaris's description of working as Santa's elf for a major department store during the holiday season. Some of the other true tales weave in favorite odd moments from Sedaris's childhood. The fictional stories, on the other hand, tend to be way over-the-top, with almost a surreal aspect to them. However, I thought that the best of these was \\"Seasons Greetings,\\" about a holiday newsletter that truly tells all.I would definitely recommend these stories for fans of Sedaris and lovers of off-beat Christmas stories. If you are in the latter group, you might also like Maeve Binchy's This Year It Will Be Different and another collection by various authors, The Worst Noel. Merry Christmas!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I've heard some great things about David Sedaris. I've seen some interviews with him that were painfully funny and I've been enjoying my audiobook of Barrel Fever, though I'm only one hour into the three hour book. This is a long way of saying that Holidays on Ice was the first book I've actually read by David Sedaris.So did it live up to the hype? Well, it depends on which stories you're talking about. Santaland Diaries? Hilarious! Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family? Eh. Christmas Means Giving? Unbelievably funny.Basically, Holidays on Ice is like any other story collection: some stories are better than others. Some had me laughing out loud multiple times, others had me impatient to get to the next story. What's unique about it is David Sedaris' sense of humor. He has that biting and witty character that makes you want to keep reading, yet you almost feel bad for laughing. (At times, you definitely feel bad for laughing - some of the things he say are so wrong. But so funny!)Sedaris is definitely not for the easily offended. He sometimes uses crude humor. But the bottom line is that he really is very funny. Books don't make me laugh out loud very often, but Sedaris has me cracking up left and right. Like I said, not all the stories of all the same quality, but generally they are very funny. This holiday collection is great for any Sedaris fan, or for anyone who wants a short introduction to his work. Holidays on Ice is small and very easy to read, so if you are trying to decide whether you want to give his larger books a try, this is probably a good book to pick up!A big thank you to Miriam @ Hachette for sending me this book to review!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Holidays on Ice by David Sedaris is the perfect Audiobook for this time of year. It's actually 12 short stories and most of them are about Christmas, but there are Halloween and Easter stories too. The Audiobook consists of 4 CDs, so it's about 4 hours long and the stories range in length from about 10 minutes to about an hour. This was ideal for me this time of year; I started listening to it while I was cooking Thanksgiving dinner and finished it in 3 or 4 more sittings. Since it's short stories, there was no picking up where you left off.These stories are humorous, and some of them are laugh out loud funny. David Sedaris reads most of them and he has the perfect tone for the sarcasm and dry wit in the stories. My favorites are \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" and \\"Jesus Shaves\\". \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is the true story of David's experiences working as an elf in Macy's SantaLand. \\"Jesus Shaves\\" tells the story of the bells delivering candy to French children for Easter. (I think this one struck a chord with me because we used to live in France.) Both of these stories made me laugh out loud. This Audiobook contains language that is not appropriate for children."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Mr. Sedaris little book of Christmas jeer is perfect for anyone with a quirky, sarcastic sense of humor. This is not a heart-warming compilation, but still a very funny perspective on the less holy aspects of this popular season. It would be quite the stretch in saying that some of these stories are applicable to Christmas. Mr. Sedaris also takes tangential potshots at Easter and Halloween. Though his piece about observing pathologists working in a morgue is entertaining, I failed to see its relation to any holiday theme. A quick, silly, caustic and enlightening read. But please be warned, this book will not fill you with the stereotypical holiday spirit unless you just so happen to be Ebenezer Scrooge before the ghostly visits."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Possibly my favorite book of all time, Holidays on Ice is Sedaris' best book. Each story will have you literaly laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"David Sedaris gives us a book on Christmas with a twist. This is not a book about how wonderfull Christmas is but how sick and screwed up the world is with Christmas as the backdrop. My personal favorite story is about working as an Elf with Santa at a department store for the holidays. The little vignettes within the story about the going ons in the Santa department is truly funny because it is true. I worked at a famous toy chain one year and the same stories happened to me. Not one of the stories is traditional, but written with a New York sense of humor. \\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" is about a serious review of children's Cristmas pagents and is every bit as blistering as if they were a Broadway play. \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is about one-up-man-ship of trying to keep up with the Joneses and is every bit as funny as it is sick. If you want a book with a warped sense of Christmas that is funny, this is for you. This is definitly not for children, but it is for their parents."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I love this book. I've given this book as a pre-holiday gift to my friends heading home for the dreaded winter get-togethers. It's a must have survival tool!!!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"If you like sarcastic social commentary, you'll love this book. These short stories &amp; essays are hysterical! &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; is especially funny. So is &quot;Based On A True Story&quot;.

A stocking stuffer, a secret santa gift, or something just to share with a friend, this is one of the best pieces of literature few dollars will get you. The SantaLand Diaries is worth the price of the book alone, quite possibly the funniest short story ever written. ..."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"But it does make for a great &quot;Intro to Sedaris&quot; you can use to get your friends and family hooked. Also a far more convienient size to keep in the bathroom for the holidays....A great stocking stuffer for anyone who might think there is definately something odd about grown people prancing around department stores herding other people's children."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Recounts what has already been said in the three other books, although it makes a great 10 dollar gift. If you have the others, dont bother. J."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sedaris' work makes me laugh, and this book was no exception. His wit is dry and sardonic, and really, what better target for irreverent wit than the holiday season. His short stories are all rooted in his life history, his recounting of truly hillarious incidences. I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates dry humor. If you want to be amused, read his work."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sedaris once again knocks out six stories that will knock your socks off. One story deals with a woman's notes to her freinds after her family is forced to take in a young, female Vietnamese adult (a vestige of the husband's war mistakes) who speaks a language learned from Sesame Street watchings (\\"shiny, big bird, five dollar\\"). There is nothing but hilarious bedlam for the family, accented, of course, by the Christmas Holidays. Another deals with a true story of Sedaris' sister taking a crack whore home for the Holidays. The family considers this very cool and with his family, you'l easily see why. However, the ultimate laugh is Sedaris' short-lived stint as a Santa Claus elf in New York's Macys. Born of adult men and one midget, all because they are short, Sedaris describes the outrageous tedium and shocking marching orders they have to endure. The Santa crowds with or without children are mercilessly dissected, as well they should be, as Sedaris wonderfully describes this terrible thing that is 'visiting Santa'. This book is far too short, but well worth the endorphic giggles it induces."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"You may recognize someone you know in at least one of the six, occasionally dark, often amusing short stories in David Sedaris' Holidays On Ice. Stories which have been brought together like wandering members of the same family at Christmastime.There is the first person account of one of Macys elf-hirelings. There is the newsletter writer; a woman who puts a thinly veiled cheery holiday spin on her family's life of tragedy, horror, and despair. There is Dinah, who happens to be a whore. There is the children's' holiday pageant reviewer who brings us front and center with all of the effrontery and mercilessness of a Broadway reviewer. A Hollywood television producer delivers the sermon for a Christmas Eve service at a very rural church. Finally, there are the competitive neighbors who sacrifice more and more every season in the true holiday spirit of one-ups-man-ship.You know some of these people. They scare you, they should. They also amuse you. They may even be you. The identity connections and the feeling that these tales aren't as made-up as they seem are what makes these stories so funny, and at the same time so frighteningly real."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"An easy to read collection of essays about the holidays. This book was so much fun, laugh until you cry fun. Because it's a collection, it's perfect to pick up and read when you need a break from the chores that surround the holidays... all of them."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Picked this up for $5 at Boarders just before Thanksgiving. Quick, fun read! Prior to Holidays on Ice I'd never read Sedaris. Will definately seek out his other work."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"One of the funniest and most entertaining stories Sedaris has ever written is the first story in this book, \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" his story about working as an elf in a department store Christmas display. It turns out that it is actually borrowed from one of his other books, Barrel Fever. The second best story I would say is \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" which is borrowed from his book Naked. It's a story about an unfortunate woman who is friends with David's sister Lisa. Those are the only two nonfiction stories in this collection.The other four stories are all fiction, and while they are creatively written I don't find them as interesting as Sedaris' true accounts of his own life. The fiction stories are over-the-top ridiculous. They're not bad, just not what I'm used to and not what I expected.Here are the stories:\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" (from Barrel Fever)\\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\"\\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (from Naked)\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\"\\"Based Upon a True Story\\"\\"Christmas Means Giving\\"\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a seasonal letter written to friends and family, telling of the crazy events of the last year. \\"Front Row\\" is about attending childrens' Christmas plays, giving reviews of the actors, etc. \\"Based Upon a True Story\\" is about a man giving a Christmas speech from the pulpit, with an ulterior motive. \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is about competitive and materialistic neighbors.If you want to read something really unusual from Sedaris, namely fiction, then check out this book, otherwise buy one of his other books for his more typical fare."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Not the best book I have read by him, but a great book in general!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The best way to appreciate David Sedaris is either live or on audio cd. The man is hystericaly funny, in a condescending, sharp-tongued manner. He is the Mark Twain of his day (if Twain had been a gay midget)."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Okay, so there's no way anyone can say this author doesn't possess that gusty type of humor. No way! SantaLand Diaries, I remembered being the reason Sedaris's name stayed penned in my memory as \`that gusty humorous author.'But I stopped cold with Season's Greetings... thank God it wasn't as long as SantaLand... which made it difficult to laugh getting through the Christmas Whore. Season's Greeting literally made me sick to my stomach. Ridiculing the Vietnamese girl and her language, yet leaving a child in her care, the dryer, the legal scuffle... My God! ...Why was this story even included!?! But least I stop and digress as enough people have already pronounced their displeasure here...To conclude, struggling as I did getting through the whore to actually get back to the chuckle bubbles that kept erupting in SantaLand, I eventually recognized what makes Sedaris an attention grabbing name.Let's see: \\"...industrial-strength lasagna,\\"... \\"pea-sized conscience\\"... \\"...wrong-headed and pointless\\" ... \\"disposable boats, ultrasuede basketballs...\\" --these unsullied phrases are littered throughout the book. As noted above, I am finicky and draw lines quickly where it concerns children, but Front Row Center... I cried laughing! I mean come on now, comparing bad entertainment to treating cancer early, that's just over the top brilliant humor... and a bit clique I must add.Saved for the stories pulled from the dark side of someone's traumatizing suffering, the way Sedaris lays humor on paper otherwise is among the cleverest in this time!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"After finishing a depressing novel, I know that I can always rely on Sedaris to bring a smile to my face. I just knew it would be a fast and fun read! I love David Sedaris' books, and though I knew this collection included some essays that are published elsewhere, I really looked forward to the new essays. I was a little disappointed that the three new essays were fiction, but they are still very funny. I just prefer the stories about his family, like \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" but I really did enjoy \\"Front Row and Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" quite a bit! I hear there is another, more recently updated version of this book out and now and it has even more new material, so I will have to get around to picking that up!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I am a David Sedaris fan. I thought this would be humorous. It was, but some of the stories were pretty dark humor. It was still good reading."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Although this book is seemingly seasonal, I would recommend it to anyone, anytime looking for some dark humor. Although this book is rather small in terms of pages and does admittedly have a few stories that are also included in Sedaris's book 'Naked,' I still found enough new, laugh out loud content to make this book worth my time. Definitely worth adding to your library if you're a Sedaris fan."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"It is hard to pick one set of stars for a book that is full of different essays. I would give some of the essays 4 stars, others 3, and maybe even some 2s. If I look at the book as a whole, I liked it. There are a few stories that stick out -- like Santaland Diaries (about Sedaris' stint as an Elf at Macy's Santaland in NY) and Six to Eight Black Men (about how the Netherlands celebrates Christmas with \\"black peters\\"). All of the stories share Sedaris' wit, and some star people who probably belong on Santa's naughty list. I enjoyed the stories that were about Sedaris and his family more than the ones that were not."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I was mildly enjoying this book when just a few pages in David Sedaris got REALLY nasty and made fun of a group of mentally disabled people. He didn't simply use the term \\"retarded\\", he flat out made fun of a group of mentally challenged people he met when he was working as an elf at Macy's. I don't care if the story is made up and posing as real. He nastily described and made fun of how they look and act. Yuck. I don't need to waste time on an author who is downright cruel. I'll never read another David Sedaris book again."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Once I had purchased this for $8.99 on Kindle the price dropped to $3.99 so I am not completely satisfied."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I thought a book with a holiday cover and a title containing the word holiday would be a great one to read during the holidays. Much to my disappointment, it was anything but cheerful. What wasn't depressing and horrifying was tiresome. So much so that I put it down and did not finish it. I am very sorry I spend my money on such a terrible book!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book was okay. it was a downer for our Christmas book club . This the typical happy Christmas story"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I really enjoy David Sedaris. However, this compilation of stories didn't sustain my interest. Partly because I have read some of the stories in other collections, and partly because they just didn't flow together as naturally as his other collections of essays. I liked the theme of the holidays being less than perfection. It wasn't as hillarious and wake your husband up because your laughing out loud as the others."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Nice cd, great for the long trip to work except for others wondering what is so funny. A good eperience."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I'm a huge fun of Sedaris and his humor. Having said this, I am so thrilled to have Christmas stories Sedaris style. Some of these stories are more funny than others.

The first story - Santaland Diaries was great - the others, not so great. Some were absolutely horrible-- things no one wants to envision during the holidays. Does that make it funny? The others were just plain boring. He could do better. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was so much fun to read!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I enjoyed the first story about the author's adventures as a department store Christmas Elf. This was a true gem that made the book difficult to put down and I eagerly looked forward to the next 5 tales. Unfortunately, they all fell far short of the expectations laid out by their predecessor. The first story is great, but that fact alone can't hold the remainder of the book, therefore, I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have never read any by this author before but have heard about him for years. With the Christmas season in full swing and a bit overloaded with \\"sweet\\" holiday reads, this seemed the perfect tonic. A collection of stories that is largely entertaining, I didn't find them to be absolutely hilarious as others have but I did find them interesting and enjoyable. The first story appears to be the most widely known and relates the experience of working in retail as an elf during the holidays. Anyone who has worked in the retail industry will appreciate it. While I enjoyed most of them tremendously, there was one story that turned my stomach and I wish I had skipped it. The story starts out innocently enough as a parody of the typical, annual Christmas letter distributed by many but it slowly decends into ugly and then takes a turn that was repulsive to me. I wish it had not been included since it spoiled an otherwise good collection of stories.Definitely worth a read with that one exception."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"The stories are disjointed and pointless. I have read Sedaris' work before and couldn't stop laughing, I didn't even chuckle reading this book, was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"there is a quite a few short stories in this book. some are ok then some i just rather skimmed through. The Santas elf story was the best"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"A collection of holiday stories that had me laughing so hard I cried. David Sedaris' dark and twisted sense of humor makes these stories a welcome remedy to holiday stress. In Santaland Diaries, he relates the misadventures of a grown man working as a holiday elf in a department store. The trials of two competitive families whose holiday \\"giving\\" gets out of control, a holiday letter that goes off the deep end, and a TV producer addressing a congregation of hillbillies, are just a few of the stories that had me laughing until my sides hurt. Wickedly funny!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I read this every few years at Christmas for a good laugh between shopping excursions. A light, easy read. Quirky look at \\"traditions\\"."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This was a good book, but I'd read several of the stories already and it was a pretty short book overall. For people who have read most of David Sedaris' books already, there isn't a lot of new material here. Still, it got me in the holiday spirit, and I could see myself re-reading this next year."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Hilarious dark humor, must read. Holiday humor that anyone that is annoyed by the holidays can relate to or find joy in reading."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book is not for everyone but was perfect for the people in this house. Clearly the author brought some real-life memories and experiences to these unexpected stories and characters that live outside the pristine snow globe. Only David Sedaris could pull off &#34;Dinah the Christmas Whore&#34; and manage to entertain his following. I can't wait to read my next David Sedaris book - &#34;Naked&#34;.

Maybe his sister Amy,but not by very much.Laugh out loud in the library funny."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I read this short book every Christmas season and laugh aloud every year!

This was purchased for a long driving trip and made time pass quickly. Would definitely recommend this!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"...and no, that's not a typo. David Sedaris' uncanny wit, insight and odd family history combine in a potent cocktail (sorry, could not resist that) that never fails to entertain. I can't say enough about Sedaris, other than to note that I bought four copies of this book this year as gifts for people who have everything. Always funny, bizarrely honest, and somehow both graceful and crude, Holidays on Ice is a classic."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I was not familiar with David Sedaris' humor, and turns out it's not really my style. I did find the first short story interesting, but the rest of the book was boring and/or I didn't get it. Why did he puplish this book? It must be popular, as this is a new version with more stories that the prior edition.I guess you have to be a Sedaris fan for this one."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"... but the rest of the stories disappoint. The first story, Santaland Diaries, is a classic. I have rarely, if ever, laughed so hard at a short story. It is a true, though possibly embellished, story of the author and his experiences as a professional elf in a mall during the holiday season. As I said, this story alone is worth the cost of the book.Sadly, the rest of the stories don't even come close to measuring up. They are all cynical holiday season fare but very uninspired. My high hopes after reading Santaland Diaries were dashed."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"I have heard amazing things about David Sedaris for a number of years now and I have always been curious about this book. I decided to go ahead and read it this past holiday season. From what I heard about Sedaris I expected a gut busting, laugh out loud collection of short stories.The book is a collection of holiday stories. Each story is either set during a holiday or includes holiday ideas. Unfortunately, the stories were not the hilarious type of stories I had anticipated from Sedaris. The humor in the book was more sarcastic than funny. I actually found the book rather boring, offensive, and I only laughed out loud once...in the first story. I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor and some dry wit but in order to appreciate this book and its stories the reader must be beyond simple sarcasm. Sedaris leaves nothing as sacred. The first story about working as a mall elf in SantaLand was somewhat humorous because I have worked in retail before. However, I was rather distraught and angered by what happened in the second story with the family and the new child. I think this story tainted the rest of my enjoyment of the book.Sadly, I was disappointed in this book and am somewhat apprehensive to read any other work of he has done."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"At least for Christmas, I got this last year and Could not stop laughing....if only Mr Sedaris had meant these essays to be funny! Dinah The Christmas Whore in particular! Buy this if you get depressed at the holidays or even if you don't, the Macy's elf one is a hoot and the X-mas letter....you gotta read this book!"},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Sedaris is indeed at his best with non-fiction. &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; is terrific, and &quot;Dinah the Christmas Whore&quot; is very good. The fiction pieces, however, are all weak, repetitive, and overlong; &quot;Seasons' Greetings&quot; in particular is painful to listen to, and mean-spirited in a way that none of the other pieces are."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"This book goes from being brilliant in Santaland Diaries (hence the 2 stars) to being offensive against minorities to being simply disgusting and appalling: children being raped and murdered.

His way of turning a simple subject such as trying to ask a butcher for meat in French or getting some remodling done are turned into hilariously insiteful tales due to his attention to detail and wonderful ability to mine for the ridiculous in almost any situation. His books have kept me awake at night laughing and this CD made me wish my morning commute was longer so I could hear it all at once. He has many imitators but is still the best."},{"Title":"Holidays on Ice","review":"Huge disappointment. I have read three David Sedaris books previously and had found them laugh-out-loud funny. \\"Holidays on Ice\\" nearly ended up in the fireplace when I hit a particularly dark chapter.

It starts off with a nice Table of Contents giving it structure but the problem you get into is that the author Mr. Angha is writing in the Persian language attempting to spell out Classical Arabic concepts but then he turned it over for English translation to someone who was not a native speaker. Because &quot;the Persian language has no distinct gender denominations&quot;, you get to a point where you don't know if he is talking boy, girl, it, or anything on either side. If you do what this book says, you will find &quot;reality of prayer&quot;, but otherwise, this is the WAY of prayer according to a Persian trained in Classical Arabic. There are too many Classical Arabic concepts thrown into too few pages. This was my first encounter with Sufi - I was used to Nation of Islam and the Moorish Science Temple so the numbers games and alphabet games linked with body positions in the back of the book reminded me of numerology. The body positions are supposed to mimic Classical Arabic letters like alif. The letters have their own significance like pictographs in Chinese. There are editorial comments made, too, like you are not supposed to I guess he was talking about the intentional spread of biologic diseases. Also, he points out, in agreement with Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam): &quot;Islam is submission&quot;, but he adds in clumsy English, &quot;submission to certainty, certainty in cognition, cognition in confession, confession in obedience, and obedience in actions.&quot; I'm the only person yet I know that speaks English that knows how the word cognition is different from higher-order thought or just plain thinking or daydreaming. This is not a meditation manual and the poetry has been polluted.

This is not an easy book to be casually read in the hope of securing instant gratification or wisdom; it is a serious work which the reader will have to read through quite a few times, and think through even more. At the end, though, the reader will be rewarded with a profound understanding of the reasons behind the societal collapse in large parts of the third, fourth and Soviet worlds; of why Europe remains, and could continue to remain, politically a pygmy; of why the &quot;free market&quot; will keep the majority of the world's peoples and nations &quot;free to stagnate&quot;; and why the folks living in &quot;God's own country&quot; can bid goodbye to the good old days of carefree plenty."},{"Title":"Capitalism in the Age of Globalization: The Management of Contemporary Society","review":"In this offering Samir solidifies his position in the field of IPE. Center/periphery polarization is concomitant with an antidemocratic constuction of a global political system that subverts the once auto-centerd nation state. By virtue of the five monopolies, the West has controlled both the political and economic development of the world and given rise to a market economy that, in collusion with the political sphere, has subverted political rights and powers to the advantage of capital and its minnions.

But it doesn't. If you have an interest in early PNG studies (and it should be noted that the years 1948-1953 can be thought of as early, particularly with reference to the Southern Highlands peoples) there will be some matter to be gleaned from this r&eacute;cit, but in the main, the author remains aloof and fails to comprehend very much at all about the people with whom it has been her privilege to come into such close contact.It is difficult to ascertain just where the author stands. She readily admits that she came to PNG as the \\"wife of a boong-lover\\" but it seems evident that she did not develop any enthusiasm of her own for most of the people with whom she came into contact. It is understandable that she was both frightened and appalled by the behaviour of the remote tribes that dogged her footsteps as she set off from Mendi towards lake Kubutu on a patrol with her husband, the like of which no white women had ever undertaken in that country. Yet her fleeting impressions of the \\"savages and barbarians\\" are symptomatic of the white person's natural superiority in regard to so-called stone-age man, whose addiction to tribal warfare is marked down as a serious point against him and this, only a few short years after the second most disastrous war in history masterminded by her own civilization. It is hard to accept much of the evidence in this book, although when not pooh-pohing the natives, Mrs McLeod is apt to provide tidbits of interest. Unfortunately, it appears that no editor was available to tone down the flowery prose which is also a highlight of the book.On the whole, I am glad this book was written, but I would not like to think it had ever had any of the influence that the author seems to have intended. I don't think it is commonly realized to what extent these \\"primitive\\" peoples in Australasia, Polynesia, Melanesia and South-east Asia, whose tribal civilizations were quite intact only a bare fifty years ago, could give our own civilization some pointers on how to live."},{"Title":"BLADUD OF BATH: THE BRITISH KING WHO TRIED TO FLY: EXTRACTS FROM OLD CHRONICLES AND HISTORIES RELATING TO BLADUD, THE NINTH KING OF ENGLAND, TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL PORTRAITS.","review":"Highly entertaining, if spurious, yarn.Any proof of a real Bladud or Blaiddyd is elusive. He was mentioned by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who claimed he was a son of \\"King Rud Hud Hudibras or Rhun Paladr-fras\\", the tenth ruler in line from the first \\"Trojan-British\\" King, Brutus. The dubious tale of Bladud was embroidered by later authors. Supposedly he ruled from 863-843 BC or perhaps in 500 BC, at which time he allegedly built Kaerbadum or Caervaddon (Bath), using magic and necromancy. He dedicated the city to Athena-Minerva.He is said to have constructed a flying apparatus with which he tried to fly to (or from) the temple of Apollo in Trinovantum (London) or Troja Nova (New Troy) but crashed and was killed. He was supposedly buried at New Troy and succeeded by his son, Leir. Eighteenth century Bath architect John Wood, the Elder suggested Bladud was none other than Abaris the Hyperborean, linked with Pythagoras whom Herodotus claimed \\"had travelled around the world with an arrow symbolizing Apollo\\".There were 3 royal Bleiddudds in early Welsh genealogy. Geoffrey of Monmouth mentions two in his Chronicles, inlcuding Prince Bleiddudd, lord of Dyfed, celebrated in a 9th-century Welsh poem 'In Praise of Tenby'.

It is this book and others such as \\"The Time Machine\\", \\"The Island of Dr Moreau\\" and \\"The War of the Worlds\\" by which Wells is defined.Written in 1897, \\"The Invisible Man\\" tells the story of Griffin, a scientist, who has struck upon the means of creating invisibility. At the novel's outset, Griffin arrives as a stranger on a winter's day in a small town in Sussex. He is heavily clothed and his face is swathed in bandages. The locals assume that he has been the victim of a terrible accident. Invisibility is not the first conclusion that people would reach.As time progresses, it becomes clear that invisibility has effected Griffin's mental health. From simply being obsessive, Griffin becomes increasingly maniacal. Indeed, he eventually seizes upon the idea of a \\"reign of terror\\". Over a hundred years later and the same concept still exists albeit without absolute invisibility! However, as with so many maniacs, Griffin overreaches. His plans become increasingly absurd and his demise becomes inevitable.\\"The invisible Man\\" is not Wells' best work. My personal favourite is \\"The Country of the Blind\\" with its obvious allusions to the nave dogma of faith. Nonetheless, \\"The Invisible Man\\" is classic Wells. He was a wonderful writer of what could be loosely defined as science fiction. Over a period of one hundred years, Wells still stands high in the pantheon of the genre."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It's astounding when one considers just how innovative and influential the works of H.G. Wells are. It's perplexing (to say the least) that no-one before him had the imagination to fathom such whimsical tales as a man who travels through time or a man who becomes invisible, and subsequently pen them in such an enduring and compelling manner. Wells may have benefited from being in the right place at the right time - on the precipice of new sciences and possibilities - but it would be a bit of peevish arrogance to short-change him the credit that he is so justly do. The first half of this book is fodder for the second; the novel becomes infinitely more interesting during its latter moments, and becomes almost impossible to put down. The work's greatest flaw is that it is a product of it's time; a great deal of Well's vernacular has become somewhat antiquated...the prose also a bit impeded by what I interpret to be a distinctly \\"British\\" dialect and overtone. This of course is not really a problem, and really only minor quibbling on my part.The only other thing I've read by Wells is 'The Outline of History,' his ambitious attempt at summarizing the history of humanity - something which I had to purchase used, as I believe it is out of print. Having read that and now this, I've become determined to read all of his major novels and would encourage you to do the same - for to waste the opportunity to peer into all remaining visible recesses of the consciousness of such a man would be a most deplorably foolhardy thing."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Although \\"The Invisible Man\\" might not be for everybody, it certainly does provide a unique reading experience. As the title implies, the story is about an invisible man and a short period of his actions. This book has an interesting writing style, which isn't surprising considering the fact that it was written over a hundred years ago. The diction and syntax are still fully understandable, so the writing style doesn't interfere with the plot. Some might say that an invisible person is a generic and overused clich&eacute;, but this book takes an unconventional, and even scientific, approach to the matter. It is written almost like a police report about the invisible man and provides an involving storyline. If you want to try something different, \\"The Invisible Man\\" is an obvious choice."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"During my current tear through a list of the great English-language classics, this book quickly bubbled to the top as one I wanted to knock off early. H.G. Wells' 1897 novel, The Invisible Man, is a fantastic book worthy of its high-ranking position among the great science fiction stories of our time.Well's masterful ability to describe not only the story's environments, but also what goes on within the often fatally flawed psyches of the characters who inhabit them is as apparent in this book as his other classics such as The Island of Dr. Moreau.At under 200 pages, this is a great book if you're looking for something to read over a long weekend or while on the beach.Incidentally, if you've ever seen the movie Hollow Man, you'll quickly see the selfish and at times psychotic similiarities between Sebastian Caine (played by Kevin Bacon) and the book's main protaganist Griffin, although the film borrows little more from the original story."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a remarkable story that involves a stunning exploration of the psychology of human nature, especially in terms of interpersonal relationships. Wells delivers one of literature's most memorable characters here, surrounds him with a strong supporting cast and makes a plot that satisifies and moves with an agreeable pace. Wells even sprinkles the book with some very humorous moments. This is a great book that you are sure to enjoy no matter your age or reading interests. If you are new to Wells, this is the perfect starting point. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man really isn't sci-fi, in spite of Wells' good efforts to explain it as such. Even so, it's a perfectly enjoyable fantasy. It takes the whole \\"what would you do if you were invisible\\" idea and turns it on its ear. Most of us think being invisible would be all fun and games. Well, maybe not.The main character ranges in personality from jerk to raving psychopath. And it works. We're no less interested in the outcome because of it.The suspenseful climax, where the doctor is barricaded in the house, is great. One realizes that if that were to actually happen, it would be utterly terrifying.To raise a point I've raised before, how can you see if your eyes are invisible? How can these various parts of your eyes refract any light? Invisible people should be blind.If you were invisible, wouldn't your whole digestive process be visible? How would that food turn invisible? In this novel, it does after a little while, but no explanation is given. Wells conveniently avoids a rather nasty situation. I, for one, would like to see somebody write a book about a Digestive Man.And why are albinos always bad guys?RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"What caught my attention nearly immediately was how adept H.G. Wells was at conveying the rage held within Griffin, the Invisible Man. Admittedly, initially I was somewhat sympathetic to Griffin, trying to imagine how the total frustration of the circumstances might cause a nearly uncontrollable rage; however, within a matter of pages - if not paragpraphs - Wells removed any reader sympathy by developing the Invisible Man into a man most unworthy of such sympathy. To put it plainly, the Invisible Man was just a real jerk, and worse. The progression of the story displayed the extremely selfish position of the Invisible Man towards the surrounding society. Oddly, I finished the book with some small amount of sympathy toward Griffin, but sympathy only that a man should end up leading such a pathetic life, and that his rage and selfishness should ultimately lead to his violent demise. Unfortunately, such pathetic lives and violent endings are still too commonly found today."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Having read the Ralph Ellison novel many years ago, I felt compelled to finally lift Wells' of the shelf recently. What a clever and accomplished man, and so prolific in his writing.So, what did I make of this one?Wells obviously explores the age-old tension between science and morality, examining what happens when the latter is not regarded in pursuits of the former. Naturally the story is largely, therefore, allegorical (aren't most?).We meet the invisible man and hear his story, after which we follow him closely to his final breath, relieved that he is gone.Personally I felt no sympathy for the character and did not feel I 'owned' him, unlike other novels where I have felt I could, to some degree, sympathise and identify with a protagonist with a distorted sense of reality or even a murderer. Yet, the story was effective,well written and achieved what it set out to do.It is one of the classics that you need to have read also, because there are so many references to it in other works, such as Joanne Harris' 'Gentleman and Players'."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"My knowledge of this tale dates from the old Claude Rains movie, so it was interesting, as usual, to go back to the source and see what Wells actually wrote. While very short,the novel falls into two halves: the first faintly comic (you can see it peopled by all those Universal British character actors), the second more suspenseful and more of what the whole novel should have been.The \\"explanation\\" chaper (i.e. how he did it)was fascinating in the way all these pseudo-science chapters are (one of the best was in \\"Jurassic Park\\") and the ramifications of being invisible were constantly intriguing. The problem with the book is that while Wells had a great idea he couldn't construct a great narrative to go with it.This book is not as creepy as \\"The Island of Doctor Moreau\\" nor as horrific as \\"War of the Worlds\\". And for sheer metaphoric brillance and poetic resonance nothing can top \\"The Time Machine\\". But Wells was such a wonderful writer that several hours in his presence is never time wasted."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"\\"The Invisible Man\\", by H.G. Wells, is a classic sci-fi novel by one of the pioneers of the industry. Like many of Wells' other novels, however, it has an underlying theme about society.Throughout the book, the Invisible Man, Griffin, is feared, attacked, and chased out of town once the people find out that he is invisible. Close to the end of the book, the reader will also find out that Griffin was a near albino before he made himself invisible. He apparently was made fun of a lot by the societies that he lived in and was the subject of many jokes throughout his time in university. This treatment caused Griffin to become obsessed with the idea that he might be able to make himself totally invisible and therefore not be subject to the humor of the society around him.If one is to analyze Griffin in a Freudian manner it would be logical to conclude that he is therefore not responsible for his heinous actions, such as murder and theft. The treatment that he recieved from society is what caused him to become what he is and therefore society is to be blamed for what he does. This is one of the messages that Wells was trying to convey to his readers in writing this book. The time that it was written is was a time when Freudian thinking was first becoming prevelent in Europe and Wells might have been trying to promote it with this book.\\"The Invisible Man\\" is a very good read that everyone should at least try. Being roughly 130 pages, it is considered to be extremely short for a science fiction book of today and is really quite easy to read."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and very much enjoyed it. I like Well's writing style, and it is a good as ever in this book. In this book, a scientist discovers a way to make himself invisible, and once he does so, goes insanse and becomes a mad scientsist. Normally, a mad scientist is hard enough to be handle by anti-chaos forces (i.e. police, superheroes or the like), but an invisible mad scientist is even better (or worse, depending on your vantage point).I am not sure whether Wells had a point in writing this novel, but if he did, it is surely this: those things which we often wish for are not quite as good as we thought they would be when we actually receive them. Griffin wishes for invisibility, achieves it, and then wishes he didn't have it. Being invisible, he has an awfully hard time interacting with people, and he soon discovers that life is rather difficult when you live among people and cannot interact with them in any way. He ends up having an awful time trying to get food, and, of course, clothes aren't invisible on him so he can't wear any, which gets terribly cold. Things of this like drive him to try to make a cure for his invisibility, but it fails, and he ends up going insane, and, thinking himself superior to the human race, thinks nothing of murdering them. It is a rather good picture of the consequences of being cut off, in any meaningful way, from human society. I would highly reccomend this book, as well as most other Wells books."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"On a cold day in February, a stranger arrives in the small village of Iping. He is completely covered from head to toe and all you can see is his nose. He demands a room at the inn and is persistent to tell be he wishes to be left alone. He spends two days in the room muttering and talking to himself. He then goes out to get \\"a thousand and one bottles\\" to start these secret little experiments. Then one night a store is robbed and not a clue is found to figure out who robbed the store. Then later that month the owner of the inn tells the stranger that he needs to pay his bill for the inn. He had been putting the payment off and now he immediately pays her. She then becomes suspicious and asks the stranger where he got the money. He says that he had it, but the inn owner doesn't believe him. She insists on finding out where the money came from and then truth is reveled. The stranger admits that he stole the money from the store that was robbed and then reveals that he is invisible!The invisible man then runs away from the town and no one knows where he goes because he is invisible. The invisible man then meets a poor man named Thomas Marvel who decides to try to help him. Thomas Marvel then discovers the invisible man is slowly going insane and begins to run for help and to warn other people of the invisible man. The invisible man then goes out to find a school buddy from college who can help him. He finds him and his name is Dr. Kemp. Dr. Kemp is amazed at what he sees and tries to help the invisible man calm down. The invisible man then tells his story of how he became invisible.He was a very pale person and wanted to experiment with invisibility. He killed his father and stole all of his father's money. He then created a machine that creates an absents of light on whatever object it is used on. He also created a drug that makes the blood of your body invisible. He first experimented on a cat and it was almost successful. The claws did not become invisible and the tapetum behind the cat's eyes did not become invisible. The cat then ran away and the invisible man decided to perform the next experiment on himself. He took the drug and turned the machine on to himself. He felt like he was dieing. He then watched his hands slowly fade and his body went with them. After he had become completely invisible the pain went away. He then wanted to go out into town invisible. However, he realized that he just got dressed and went out people would see the invisibility. So he robbed stores for covering for his body. Nothing on him could be seen.After explaining the invisibility, the invisible man explains to Dr. Kemp how he wants to start a reign of terror! Dr. Kemp realizes that the invisible man is going mad! The invisible man then leaves Dr. Kemps home. Everyone is then put on guard to watch for the invisible man. Then it is reported that a man was killed, assumed to have been done by the invisible man. Dr. Kemp then gets a note the invisible saying that the he is going to kill him. The invisible man comes to Dr. Kemp's house but is stopped by a friend of Dr. Kemp's. They get into an argument and then both go up to Dr. Kemp's door. When the door opens the invisible man shoots the friend and starts to go after Dr. Kemp. Dr. Kemp escapes and runs to the police. He tells them that a man is trying to kill him so the police follow him. They meet him and find out that the man is invisible. The invisible man then runs into town with the police following him. They are shouting to stop the invisible man and then one of the town's people whacks the invisible man with a shovel. He falls to the ground dead and then people see the real invisible man.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan. H. G. Wells is a really good science fiction author. His books are awesome! However some parts of this book do get a little boring. Over all it was a good book and I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"After reading this book, I realised how gook science fiction is. The Invisible Man is a great book for all ages. This great piece of literature is about a scientist named Griffin who created a potion that turns people invisible. After using it on himself, he slowely goes insane, as in the part when he blindly rages through the town of Iping. I'm not going to tell anything else about this book because I'm afraid that I'll ruin the ending. If you want ot be sucked in a strange world of mystery and action, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"From early times, men have fantasized about what it would be like to become invisible, as witness medieval stories about cloaks of invisibility, and the like. Wells's novel, placed at the turn of the last century, puts the dream into a modern context, but in it, the dream becomes a nightmare.The beginning of the book deals with the coming of the man, who has invented a way to become invisible, and used it on himself, to a small English town. He is essentially a refugee. The Invisible Man is irritable to the point of homicidal madness, a trait engendered both by secretive overwork on his discovery and by the effects of the decolorizing agent. Because his invisibiity has caused him to go about naked, the Invisible Man has suffered terribly in the English winter, and he has clothed himself in bandages and stolen clothing to hide his newfound status. Still, he is undone by the nosiness of strangers and eventually flees again to find himself in the home of a former acquaintance, one Kemp.In explaining his dilemma to Kemp, the Invisible Man, an albino scientist named Griffin, discloses that he discovered a compound that decolorized blood, and that as an albino, he was the perfect test case. Discussion of the refractory powers of light dominates this portion of the book, in a manner understandable to anyone. However, taking the chemical creates great pain, and madness.Wells's analyses of the problems facing one who has become invisible is extremely thorough, and done in the context of Griffin's narrative. One must be careful not to go about in the rain, where he would appear as a bubble, or in the fog, where he would appear as an opening in the vapor. One cannot walk through mud or puddles without his feet becoming visible, and must eat in hidden places, because the food eaten remains visible until digested. The curiosity of dogs and persons with keen senses is aroused because the Invisible Man still leaves a scent and makes sounds as he moves about. And the lack of protective garments makes one extraordinarily sensitive to heat, cold, and inclement weather.Eventually, the Invisible Man turns to murder and arson to cover his &quot;tracks&quot; and, in the end, is undone and killed when he returns to attack Kemp. The novel bogs down a bit here.Wells's importance to creating s/f writing as a genre is that he used available science to explain how his fantasies came about. In this respect, he differs from Verne and other predecessors, as well as a good many successors. This trait makes his stories possess a veneer of believability uncommon to most s/f. The Invisible Man is one of Wells's best novels, and I can guarantee that you will enjoy it if you like s/f. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This was a fabulous novel by the likes of H.G. Wells. Though it may be science fiction, it does have a science fact sort of feel to it. Hearing the characters interact provides for the fleshing out of such personages.I read this book around the same time I read some Edgar Rice Burroughs. They both have a way with words which make the blatantly false seem all the more real, while I suspend my disbelief indefinitely.The world needs more writers like this."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Well, this is not the drum I march to. Nevertheless, this is an interesting piece of literature. H.G. Wells does a very good job of creating images. He also manages to offer us suspense, comedy, drama, and chills. One thing he does very well is that he grabs our attention in the 2nd half by revealing the identity of the invisible man along with his background. Perhaps the worst I can say about this book is that I enjoyed the movie with Claude Rains better."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It moves so slow. And I mean slow. It'd take a page for a modern author to write what it took Wells ten to do. It's not so much scary as it is eerie. There's some cool stuff in this book. Being invisible did get freakier than you'd think. And I liked Griffin. Be prepared with a good vocabulary to read this book. It's unnecessarily wordy science fiction stuff."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible man, being one of H.G Wells finest books, is well portrayed in audio form by the most incredible actors. John DeLancie as The Invisible Man is wonderful, his voice well fitting to the character, and makes it easy for one to imagine what goes on through his characters mind. Kate Mulgrew as Mrs. Hall does an amazing job with the voice, well convincing you that she is, indeed a nosy irish wife. I'd advise anyone who enjoys the voices of Leonard Nemoy, Kate Mulgrew, and John DeLancie (among others) to read this. It truly is one of the best among the ranks of Alien Voices."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Having read other reviews, I could not hold back. The actors take you into their recreated world of H.G. Wells and make it possible for you to forget where you are completely. One warning however, do not listen to this wonderful tale alone in the dark (especially not while playing it on your walkman), b/c it might frighten you. (as you can see, that was my mistake ;-))"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I think I expected too much from this book and was therefore disappointed with it. It was an interesting account of Griffin's follies, but it wasn't as eerie as I had thought it would be. If you're into sci-fi you should read it, otherwise...well, it's up to you."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is another book that I loved. I remember watching the movie long, long ago. This is a classic tale of a brilliant scientist who makes a wonderful discovery, and then loses his mind.The book was long in the build up, and did meander a bit. I liked it when the Invisible Man decided that he wanted to create a reign of terror. I would, personally, have loved a little more exploration of the subject at this point. The evil genius, the evil joker, are all subjects that have fascinated me for years.HGW was such a great writer, he would have been brilliant had he delved deeper into the mind of the scientist."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This novel, science fiction, is quite entertaining and holds your interest right to the end. Written in the late nineteenth century is gives you a snapshot of an English village during that period."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I had heard about the Invisible Man all of my life, but had never read the book. WHen I finally did, I felt glad that I did. The story was good, but I think the pace was a bit slow. Wells seems to allow the pace to bog down in the early portion of the book, and when reading, if you're not careful, you might even be tempted to abandon the book and never finish reading it. However, finishing the book was worth it and now I know why the story is remembered."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This book is not for the reader with limted vocab or who have trouble felowing a plot line things go by vary fast some part you have to read fast and the book really is not that exticted.

When trying to be alone the people, around him start to wander who is that man covered in bandages. As the village finds out about his secret what will the invisible man do?This book has many good points to it like story line and how the book was written. This book is very old but is considered a classic. Books published now have many characteristics of the Invisible Man in there story. I really liked the characters in this story; they had a lot of life in them. The written description in the story is so good that it makes you feel like you're in the story.Some things like understanding what's going on is kind of hard because it changes perspectives a lot. The reading comprehension is really different compared to the comprehension used now. If you can get through that, then this book will be compelling and fascinating.This is one of H.G.Wells greatest stories, which is known around the world. This story has many movies based on it. But remember the book is always better than the book.If you want to read something out of this world and full of imagination. I strongly recommend this to the above average reader and any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This novel, is by all means, a classic. It tells the story of a brilliant scientist, who goes raving mad after turning himself invisible. At first he is just secretive and only wishes to be left alone, to complete his work, and become visible again. But the residents of the town of Iping are too curious for their own good, and the formula begins to take a negative effect on the Invisible Man. This story has inspired many movies, starting off with the 1933 classic, and working it's way up to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I strongly reccomend H.G. Wells'The Invisible Man, to any H.G. Wells fan or science fiction reader."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I heard about this \`classic' book a long time ago (who hasn't?) but didn't take the time to read it. Just recently, after having my curiosity aroused by the League of Extraordinary Gentleman, I decided to see what the whole thing was about.Griffin, a brilliant English scientist, in the course of his work discovers the ability to make things invisible. But before he is able to properly develop and patent his idea and thereby secure eternal fame, he runs into the problem every scientist who isn't working for NASA faces; a shortage of funds. This, along with his imminent eviction, leads him to take the solution that will make him invisible.The rest of the story deals with his mental descent and we witness genius distorted until it becomes something grotesque. Freed from the restrictions that visibility brings, the Invisible man indulges his fancies at the expense of society. His new powers inflate his ego and cause him to disregard the norms of society; he feels he is beyond them.Along with all this drama, the book has its funny parts -\\"This, this Invisible man, then?\\" asked the man with the black beard with one hand behind him. \\"I guess it's about time we saw him.\\" ...p 114.O.K it may not be laugh out loud funny, but it has its moments. There are many such tragicomic events in the story where you don't know whether to laugh or to feel sympathy toward some of the victims.I felt that the story had merit and it was not altogether improbable. However because of the story's shortness it was unable to develop Griffin's motivations completely. His lack of humanity throughout the book must have had a cause. Unfortunately Wells was not able to provide a plausible reason for this, as a consequence, the invisible man seemed one dimensional to me since there was no inner conflict; not much agonizing over his actions. You may interpret it differently from me, but this was the impression I got.Overall an interesting book, I guess you could call it a classic, but I'm not totally convinced. Read it anyway to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"&quot;The Invisible Man&quot; by HG Wells is a compelling story of a scientist, named Griffin, who discovers a method in which he can turn nearly anything invisible - including himself. At first thrilled at the idea of being invisible, he soon discovers the many negative aspects and must continue his research in pursuit of a method of reversal. He is drawn to a small town where he remains heavily clothed and suspiciously clandestine, causing the townspeople to investigate his activities which sparks an incredible chain of events and eventually drives him crazy.Similar to his novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, HG Wells has written &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; on a scientific, albeit theoretical, basis which gives the story a stronger foundation in reality. With an exciting plot and unique characters, all described in vivid details, Wells creates a whole new world of reality filled with suspense, thrill, excitement and wonder up to the very last page. Furthermore, the characters' unpredictability and complex personalities combine to toy with your emotions throughout the entire read, as you slowly discover the intricate web of variables created by each individual's role in the Invisible Man's quest for satisfaction.This toying of emotions is what gives the novel its unique substance - you feel sympathy for Griffin, despite his being a homicidal maniac, and you must consider his position as you ponder what would you might do in the same situation; yet opposite to this, you also feel sympathy for the innocent, unsuspecting townspeople who are the victims of Griffin's immense rage. Even by the end, you are still left pondering.I would highly recommend this classic novel to anyone who enjoys reading thrilling-to-the-end adventures with an emotional side to them; it is definitely a must-read for every HG Wells fan."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Wells' writing style is easy to read and enjoyable - it's clear that he had fun writing The Invisible Man. The plot is truly impeccable, there is a great deal of action and the pace never slows. The only weakness here is character development. It is difficult to really care about any of the characters, even those that are hurt or killed by the Invisible Griffin.The story begins when the bandaged invisible man comes to Iping to rent a room. Though at first overjoyed to get a renter in the off season who doesn't quibble about the rates, Mr. & Mrs. Hall soon have their fill of their rude and truculent guest. When his suspicious behaviour begins to garner the attention of the rural citizens of Iping, the invisible man's rash and impudent reactions to them bring on a whirl of actions and reactions that ends up with the the Invisible man on the run and several of the citizens of Iping requiring medical attention.Events continue to escalate out of control when he runs into an acquaintence from school, Dr. Kemp, who knew the invisible man as Mr. Griffin. As Griffin explains how the story began, we lose all sympathy with our villain as we hear his callous treatment of his first victims prior to Iping. He then comes to the idea that his only method of 'escape' from his troubles is to bring about a reign of terror and declares the city of Port Burdock to be under his reign and not that of the Queen. By this time we are wholly ready for the resolution which speedily ensues.This story is not particularly scary although it had potential with the reign of terror bit. Good character development would have enabled this to cross the science fiction genre a bit more but you can't argue with results. As it is it will definitely be an enduring story and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This book had me on the side of the Invisible Man for most of the book. Its hard not to root for something that more than once in our lives we have all imagined. The problem with rooting for the Invisible Man is that Wells writes of him as being an insane, out-of-control pychopath so you teeter back and forth with wondering if its the right thing to do. This is the second book of H.G.Wells that I have read, the first being The War Of The Worlds, and I enjoyed this one more."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a tale about a researcher who, while he was the equivalent of a graduate student in physics, discovers a treatment for making himself invisible (using chemicals and mathematical expressions containing four dimensions). He quickly discovers how dependent he is on others and that he doesn't have the power he thought he would. I had always thought, based on what I had heard about the film based on this book, that the invisibility process made the researcher (Griffin) mad. However, upon reading the novel, I find that Griffin is morally and ethically bankrupt long before he takes the treatment. His initial reasons for becoming invisible is to avoid paying his rent (as he sneaks out of the building, he sets it on fire as a &quot;lesson&quot; for his landlord). All he thinks about is himself and to have power over others. He steals from his father who, since it wasn't his money, commits suicide. Griffin goes to the funeral simply because it is expected of him; but, he feels no remorse. He is a man who feels that the end (his power) justifies the means. Wells clearly has Griffin as the villian."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed by this book. I won't dispute the fact that Wells is a fantastic writer, but this strikes me as a sub-par effort on his part. I never got &quot;into&quot; this novel at all. Largely, this is due to the characters, not one of whom I liked or identified with. The invisible man himself is a wholly irredeemable character. A mad scientist like Dr. Frankenstein earns some respect in my eyes because he is pursuing a grand mission; the mad scientist in this novel pursues invisibility solely for the purpose of satiating his own wishes and desires. On top of that, he really lacks even a basic gameplan, so he ends up pillaging whenever the idea strikes him. His harsh treatment of his fellow human beings and of animals is not adequately explained, so I do not know why he should be so mean-spirited. His decision to suddenly institute a reign of terror among his fellow man seems rather silly and immature. Thus, I simply dislike him.The explanation of invisibility and how it is achieved seems rather unconvincing to me. Certainly, such an imagined explanation is hard to put forth, but I felt Wells could have delved more deeply into the subject. I was glad to see that only the man's body, and not his clothes, achieved invisibility, and I also liked the notion of his ingested food and drink being visible until such time as they are adequately digested. As for the action, the characters all seemed to run around like Keystone cops throughout the story, an impression only intensified by Wells' use of dialect in the words of the less educated men and women. There was an air of unbelievability inherent in the actions of both believers and nonbelievers in the invisible man. The whole thing seems like a comedy of errors performed by wooden, puppetlike characters who did nothing to capture my attention. Even the plot is rather unimaginative, culminating in a less than surprising ending. I am a great admirer of H.G. Wells, but I just can't offer many praises for this particular novel. If you want to read Wells, though, you almost have to read The Invisible Man at some point. I would not start out with this book, but I would certainly put it on a short list of Wells novels to read simply because it is recognized as one of his more famous half dozen or so novels."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Yes, the book is one of the best science-fiction stories H.G. Wells wrote, it is very detailed, with very well formed characters, seems believable (if you don't get too nitpicky) and even the Invisible Man seems interesting to the reader, being smart, yet slightly mad and even unhappy with his new discovery.But let us not forget the humor within the pages - the reactions of the common masses, the problems the Invisible Man has with just dealing with every day life and the fact that he seems to have more problems being invisible than he ever did being visible."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"What a great idea to assemble scifi icons from Star Trek to perform various H.G. Wells's classics!

I was quite disturbed by the inconsistant flow of the book, quite irritating."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"and probably the second-most regarded HG Welles novel after War of the Worlds. There is no doubt in my mind that he was a competent, imaginative writer, but the Invisible Man fails on many levels.A bandaged stranger, latterly known as Griffin, arrives at an Inn in the village of Iping on a cold February afternoon and takes up residence where he plans to work on his experiments in peace. But the locals grow suspicious of his behavior and soon he is chased out of town because of the color of his skin, which is no color at all. While loose in the countryside he concocts extremely vague plans to get revenge or conclude his experiments. And then it ends.Many of the chapters are no more than 5 pages long, giving the narrative a serialized feel. The story may move quickly, but it moves in short bursts with no bigger vision other than what is immediate. Griffin is also a completely unlikable character and since the rest of them only appear for no longer than a few pages we never get to really know any of them or root for someone else. It reminded me of Frankenstein in many ways (a novel I did not enjoy at all) in regarding man's arrogance toward his own kind and perversion of science as soon as impossible boundaries have been transcended, though it doesn't stick with it long enough to properly do anything with such heavy subtext.A disappointment, but it's such a quick read that it won't weigh on your mind for very long. Curiously, my edition had a big printing error but for contrived reasons I had another identical copy without said error. I suppose that the first printing that Modern Library got out there was defective and that they soon corrected it. I do wish that they had revised the text ever so slightly as some of it becomes quite hard to follow towards the end."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I grew up on all the invisible man movies and still think of him as Claude Rains.

The Invisible Man follows the story of an un-named man who enters a tavern/inn in a small town. The man is wrapped head to toe in bandages, eyes covered by goggles and a hat pulled down. Assuming the mysterious man to have been horribly scarred, the innkeeper's wife rents him a room without even asking his name. Very quickly the reader learns that the man is invisible, and not all that pleasant to begin with.Although the book starts out slowly soon there is a robbery and mass pandemonium ensues. Whilst escaping from the chaos he has caused, our invisible man comes across a man he knows from his days in the university. Instantly trusting his old professor we learn the invisible man is actually an albino medical student named \\"Griffin.\\" Griffin sets down and tells his long tale to the silent professor, a tale of murder, violence, theft, animal testing, and the general mad scientist messing with nature.To keep from revealing too much of the plot I will stop there, this book can be very easily taken at face value and thoroughly enjoyed as a scientist creates a monster tale. However if you want to delve deeper you might get a glimpse at what Wells thinks is the true soul of man. What would you do if you knew for a fact that you could not be caught? Would an innocent man steal? Murder? or worse? Society is filled with the concept of \\"invisible\\" people, faceless crowds that the most could not remember... whether they be the poor, the destitute or whatever the undesirable race of that particular timeframe was. Does their being ignored and viewed as a mass rather than an individual give them the feeling of anonymity encouraging crime? Then there is also the rather xenophobic aspect of this novel, in which an outsider enters a small town and is immediately ostracized, speculated about, followed, harangued and finally viewed with suspicion. The fact that the stranger does turn out to be a not so nice figure may be there as a warning to the reader against the taking in of strangers that we do not know the motivation of (perhaps on a grander scale than the local inn and tavern). One could write papers on this book and its possible concept about immigration, racism, or the basic nature of human morality.This is not a long story and could feasibly be read in an hour or two. It is also not one of Well's most exciting entries into his literary cannon, but it may be one of the most simple to discuss in groups in relations to the theories and possible societal commentary included within such a simple story. This is also an excellent introduction into classic literature for the young adult group... I would assume that most 12 and older children should have no problem reading and comprehending this, children as young as 9 might be capable of reading it, but would need explanation and discussion about the difference in the times. Also some of the older language may be difficult for a younger child to comprehend on their own, but they should be able to comprehend it with a little bit of help from a parent or teacher."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"THE INVISABLE MAN BY H.g. Wells is a great book that any one 9 and older would enjoy. It all begins on a cold December night and a blizzard just struck a quiet English country village. A train also arrived and a strange looking man got off. His name was Griffin. He was wearing a long heavy coat, he had bandages all over his face and the only thing you could see was his nose, dark glass, gloves, and a hat. When he got off he started going towards town. He fought his way through the storm and came across a hotel. So he got his room, he had tons of boxes full of things. Little did the hotel keeper know this short tempered man would cause this town more trouble then it could handle. Slowly the small town realizes there is something different about Mr. Griffin then meets the eye.Mr. Griffin is a scientist who found a way to become invisible and it has gone to his head. He is trying to terrorize every one and overpower the small town and will kill anyone in his way. Griffin was not always this way once he was a scientist who was working on medicine and graduated top of his class. Then he switched his studies. He found out how to make a human transparent. My favorite part is when the town gets together and searches for the invisible man. They use attack dogs and lock their doors so the invisible man has no where to stay, and nothing to eat, but that doesn't stop him.All in all this is a great book that you should read."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"\\"Frankly-it is uncommonly fine...Impressed is the word.O Realist of the Fantastic!whether you like it or not.\\"Joseph Conrad(1857-1924),the great english novelist,born in Poland,penned these words to H.G.Wells in a letter he wrote to the author of THE INVISIBLE MAN(a Grotesque Romance),on December 4,1898,praising the novel.And Conrad was wright.Wells had a fine and original mind,a great imagination,but never forgot the world he lived in.His \\"Scientific Romances\\"(as his novels were called then) are full of realistic details mixed with startling futuristic concepts.I'm not a literary critic,so I recommend to all persons interested in H.G.Wells's novels,the following title: THE SCIENCE FICTION OF H.G.WELLS by Frank McConnell (paperback edition,Oxford University Press,1981).In an interesting and scholarly book.McConnell treats the author as a major literary figure,and after presenting the details of Wells's long life(1866-1946)offers a broad overview of his work.The emphasis of this long study is the analysis of the five major Wells's Science Fiction novels:THE TIME MACHINE(an Invention,1895),THE ISLAND OF Dr.MOREAU(1896),THE INVISIBLE MAN(a Grotesque Romance,1897),THE WAR OF THE WORLDS(1898) and THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON(1901).I first read THE INVISIBLE MAN in the CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED adaptation(Number #153,November 1959,with a catchy cover by Geoffrey Biggs).Years after,I saw the UNIVERSAL film directed by the great JAMES WHALE(THE INVISIBLE MAN,1933).It's my favorite Whale's movie.And Griffin is Claude Rains.When,finally,I read the book,I could not forget Rains's performance as Dr.Griffin,\\"The Invisible Man\\".The copy I own is a beautiful HC/With DJ COLLINS CLEAR-TYPE PRESS edition(1953).The novel is wonderful.Funny,suspenseful and tragic.Wells is acknowledged as one of the \\"fathers of science fiction\\".But he was,in reality,a real genius."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man was a very good, descriptive piece of literature.

The only problem is that Griffin doesn't know how to make himself visible again. Though the Invisible Man tries to hide himself in public by wearing bandages all over his body and claiming he was in a bad accident, he is found out anyway. After a while, the Invisible Man goes crazy because of nobody accepting him, people double-crossing him, and his possessions being stolen.

He is now able to do anything and not be discovered. His main trouble is trying to keep his destructive reign of terror under control while trying to live a normal life. The Invisible Man is blammed for everything that troubles the small town.My main reason why I liked this short story was how well Wells made the Invisible Man's body completely invisible but not his clothes. Many men who searched for the Invisible Man only saw the clothes he was wearing. A part in the story was, Huxter stuck his hand down the Invisible Man's collar. From the air a voice called out, &quot;I wish you'd keep your fingers out of my eye.&quot; Huxter and the other men had know idea.Another reason why I liked this book was the dramatic twist to the ending and because it was totally unexpected. You'll be truly surprised and possibly pleased with the ending. If your a reader who loves suspenseful and unexpected endings I reccommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is the classic story of a scientist who is obcessed with working with optical stuff, and develops a way to make things invisible. His life gets complicated when he makes himself invisible, thinking he can do almost anything he wants, since nobody can see him. The problem is, he's a little bit crazy, and gets very angry when he can't get his wishes done. Wells created a very interesting character in Griffin. If he was a nice guy, the story simply couldn't exist. Griffin is a complete selfish person, revolted by the fact that he is an albino, and through invisibility he wants the world at his feet. But he's such a disastrous person that he does everything wrong, and has everyone he has contact with against him. Although the story is over a century old, it still grips the reader. It's a simple story, but one of the pillars of the modern science fiction. There would be no Asimov, no Heinlein, no Scott Card, no Stanley Robinson without existing Wells before them."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This novel is truly a great. It sucks you in in only that way that H.G. Wells can. A very intelligent and logical man discovers how to make himself invisible. That's great, except that the process is quite painful. You'd think being invisible would be great, only it's not. You can see through your eyelids, so you can't sleep. Sleeplessness leads to madness. And what about food? You must procure it somehow, and being invisible makes that difficult, as is making friends. All this leads to a madness no one can truly understand, only H.G. Wells makes you see behind this madness to see the logical man gone mad."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I hated it. HG Wells takes way to long to get to the point.It was annoying trying to finish this dull book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"On the surface, THE INVISIBLE MAN concerns a scientist named Griffin who has discovered the means to invisibility--but who has gone mad in the process. When frustrated in his efforts to restore himself to visibility, he determines to embark upon a reign of terror that will make him master of the world. It is worth noting, however, that Wells was very much a social writer and that his novels are inevitably commentaries on various social evils. Once you scratch the surface of THE INVISIBLE MAN you will find that it is very much a parable of class structure that dominated British life during the Victorian age: there are many &quot;invisible men;&quot; this particular one, however, is in a very literal situation.And it is the literal situation from which the novel draws most of its power. Invisibility sounds attractive--but what if you were to actually become so? How would you cope with the ordinary details of every day life? Griffin does not cope well at all, and although Wells suggests that his madness have arisen from a number of sources, he also implies that it may arise from the fact of invisibility itself, again twisting the context back into the social criticism on which the novel seems based.First published in 1897, THE INVISIBLE MAN is one of Wells earliest novels, and for all its charms it creaks a bit in terms of plot and structure. Some may disagree, but to my mind the most effective portion of the novel are the chapters in which Griffin relates his adventures to fellow scientist Kemp--but regardless of its flaws remains extremely influential and it has tremendous dash and style throughout. Short enough to be read in a single sitting, it is a quick and entertaining read and it is also quite witty in an underhanded, subversive sort of way. Extremely memorable!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"First, this edition: it's reasonably well-formatted for a free ebook, with few typos, although the table of contents is not clickable; it clocks in at 1,841 \\"locations.\\"As to the story itself:This is H.G. Wells' foundational science-fiction tale of a mad scientist who discovers a way to turn himself invisible. It's a masterfully told story that's been entertaining readers for roughly a hundred years, and I'd lay good odds you'll find it well worth the read.What many readers might miss, though (I certainly did, my first time through) is that this isn't just a sci-fi potboiler; it's a modernization of the Platonic story of the Ring of Gyges. Beyond being a master storyteller, Wells was also an ardent philosopher and socialist, and like all of his other tales, there's a major political point here -- that morality derives from society -- and some additional minor political themes, like the plight of the urban poor.Wells' genius here was to take the Platonic story of a Ring of Invisibility that inevitably led its wearer to commit injustice, and revitalize it in a modern context and in a way that made a sophisticated philosophical point.Where Plato's Glaucon states:--------\\"For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.\\"--------Wells extrapolates to the present, not only making the story amenable to modern readers by substituting a scientific process for a magic ring, but also by building on Plato's point: not only does Wells' protagonist commit selfish injustice after selfish injustice, but his self-severance from society drives him into a murderous megalomania, and his end is quite the inverse of Plato's Gyges (who ended up king of Lydia and, supposedly, an ancestor of Croesus)."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a absolutely wonderful book that can be read quickly, maybe even in one sitting. It is told in the first person by an observer who knows the invisible man and is appalled by the transformation that is taking place as both drugs and power corrupt his acquaintence's mind.What is so fun about this book is the pace: you really feel like you are there. It is all realistically imagined, down to the slowness of the undigested food that can still be seen in the invisible's man stomach. This makes the book far better sci-fi than the films, with the possible exception of the one with Claude Rains, which is the best one and the closest to the original novel by far.In addition to Mary SHelley and Jules Verne, Wells helped to set the standard for all hard sci-fi that followed. Thus, if you like sci-fi as literature, this is a MUST read. But if you want a really fun read, this is also good for that.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Roughly a century ago, H.G. Wells and Jules Verne virtually created the Science Fiction novel. In a period of less than 4 years, Wells wrote three seminal classics of the genre: The Time Machine (1895), The Invisible Man (1897) and The War of the Worlds (1898). The Invisible Man, which owes an obvious debt to Frankenstein, is based on one of the eternal themes of mankind and one of the perennial themes of Science Fiction. First, it explores the nature of man by asking whether an invisible man would still be bound by normal morality. Second, it develops the theme of science as a two edged sword; after initially conveying great power, scientific innovation turns on its wielder, driving him mad. One hundred years later, this ambivalence about technology and scientific progress has remained a central part of our culture.As in all of the best books of the genre he helped to create, Wells combines these speculations with an exciting, fanciful tale. He and Verne truly set their successors a lofty standard to aspire towards.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"First off, the book is amazing--taut, tantalizing and fast-moving. The protagonist is . . . fascinatingly horrible. I really don't want to reveal more. It was fun for me because I knew so little about what was going to happen!Wells does a masterful job of leading the plot through several points of view. Some parts you see happen before you, some you only hear about and some you can only guess at. It leaves the reader wanting more until the very unexpected, very horrifying end.Now, as for this edition, I found it very meddlesome and cantankerous. The footnotes took particular pleasure in pointing out every mistake Wells made, whether with the timeline or in describing events. It was frustrating to read, as I didn't dare skip the notes because some of them were necessary to get definitions of words we are not familiar with today.So, yes, read this book. Please. But no, don't get this version. Got it? Good!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"H.G. Wells was a prolific Victorian English author who is best remembered today by four novels written in a three year period early in his career: \\"The Time Machine\\" (1895), \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" (1896), \\"The Invisible Man\\" (1897) and \\"War of the Worlds\\" (1898). He was writing \\"The Invisible Man\\" at the same time he was working on \\"War of the Worlds\\" which came out just a few months later. According to one commentator, a common characteristic of all four novels, and the secret of their success, is their graphic violence contrasted with the innocence of their settings.Wells was not the first to write of invisibility, other works from the 19th century include Gui de Maupassant's \\"Le Horla\\" and American novelist Fitz-James O'Brien \\"What Was It?\\". However it was Well's who created the mythological character that is immediately recognizable to anyone who has never even read the book. The invisible man, Griffith, is partly a mad scientist in the tradition of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll dabbling in the mysterious arts, and partly a warning about the dangers and fears of science to an innocent public which was seeing dramatic change brought on by scientific advances.The first part of the novel is fairly light-hearted with the invisible man seemingly a sad victim of his fate trying to hide his true nature and scorned by society, and even dogs. But then he begins to commit petty crimes, even gleefully taunting those around him - and then he designs to go on a \\"reign of terror\\" - similar to Frankenstein who was born innocent, but taught by those around him who saw only the fearsome and loathsome, he lives up to his reputation and becomes the evil which others \\"see\\" (or don't). His creation of invisibility is an innocent act, but it is man reaction and use of that invention that leads to evil.\\"The Invisible Man\\" can also be contrasted with the English 'Invasion Literature' genre that was popular at the time (\\"War of the Worlds\\" is invasion literature canon). Similar to \\"Dracula\\" (1897) which played on the fears of a foreign invasion of the \\"dark\\" Eastern Europeans, \\"The Invisible Man\\" was a \\"Stranger\\" (the title of the first chapter), invading the otherwise peaceful confines of a quiet and normal English village."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"&quot;The Invisible Man&quot; by H.G. Wells is not your standard sci/fi-horror novel. Wells wrote in a different era of time, and so uses a different style than what you might expect. The book begins in the village of Iping, and Wells does a masterful job of presenting each character with thier own style and the impact that Griffin/The invisible man has on them. In fact the entire first third of the book is almost a study in using dialog and mental asides for characterization. Then the novel shifts to Dr. Kemp and his relationship to Griffin - along with a healthy does of Griffin's account of his youth and scientific discoveries. Again Wells does a good job of explaining Griffin's temper and growing dementia. The conclusion of the novel depicts Griffin's final plunge into outright megalomania - spurred on in fact by his own genius and the reaction of others to his invisible condition. The book is a good read, but not without it (minor) flaws. If you are not into characterization, you will probably find the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the novel pretty uninteresting. If you are expecting excessive violence you will be dissappointed (only 2 persons die if I recall properly). In the end, this book is a very good example of the amount of detail a great author can heap into a small book. In our day and age of 'More Is Better' pop-hack authors like Eddings and Jordan, Wells still proves that with writing - size isn't important, it's how you use what you know. Wells squeezes more into 1 page than Jordan 'squeezes' into 100 pages."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A mysterious stranger cloaked in bandages arrives in a sleepy town only to be discovered as invisible. This magical discovery breeds distrust and fear among the town's residents, while further isolating the invisible man from society and driving him mad with envy and loneliness.It is easy to imagine the impact this short novel had during the 1890's, but it holds no surprises for the modern reader. The theme and plot developments have been done so many times that all original impact is lost to new readers. The writing is not particularly good and there is not much character development. What you are left with is an appreciation for how this book influenced generations of authors and movie makers.Although the plot does not hold the readers attention as it must have when it was written, the commentary on the affects of human behavior when shunned and isolated from society is very much relevant today. As an outcast the invisible man's loneliness and fear of society destroys his empathy and he seeks solace in the only thing that makes him feel alive: hatred and revenge. I could not read this transformation without thinking about the recent violence in the schools by displaced teenagers. Could they be today's invisible man?The impact may be lost, but the commentary and influence are very much felt today. For that at least it deserves a reading."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Imagine an insane lunatic wandering around your town. Sounds creepy, eh? On top of that, say the man is invisible! That is the basic plot behind The Invisible Man. This story is an excellent piece of science fiction literature by one of the world's most reknown sci-fi authors-H.G. Wells. At the beginning of the story, the invisible man appears (or not!) in a small village in England called Iping. He presents himself wearing bandages around all of his features to hide his invisibility. After an extended stay at a local inn, the man begins to draw suspicion from the citizens of Iping. Soon the man's secret us uncovered by the suspicious townspeople. After a wild getaway sequence, the invisible man must escape the angry people of Iping. In the story, there are many different twists and turns. There are plenty of exciting details that make the magnificent ending even more unpredictable. Another plus for the story is the outstanding web of characters. Some of the characters are people such as Dr. Kemp or Thomas Marvel. Each character has a unique personality. All of the characters strongly influence the outcome of the story. One final element of the story that caught my attention was the theme. The story emphasizes that care should be taken so that valuable information should not be used for evil. I would definetely strongly recommend this book. The Invisible Man is a great sci-fi-mystery-thriller combination. It contains interestin characters and a surprising outcome.

Nasty pranks, then theft culminate in murder and egomaniacal threats--dark traces of his personal journey to depravity, in this classic cautionary tale of genius run amock. The author presents this absurd hypothesis in such scientific terms that it Almost seems within the realm of possibility.Thirty-year-old Griffin, an albino, spent his post graduate years working secretly on a formula which would render living organisms invisible to the eye. Prematurely forced out into the world which he schemes to dominate without well-laid plans or adequate resources, he turns viciously bitter. Trusting no one--until he reveals the sordid details of his social and chemicaltrials to a former university colleague, Dr. Kemp--the Invisible Man suffers the pangs of hell as he finds himself cursed and conspired against. Yet he brought it all on himself, by his callous disregard for human feelings and customs. Griffin ultimately becomes the object of an intense manhunt by the people he scored as naive and helpless sheep. HG Wells moves us to both despise and pity the wretch, as all humanity is ill at ease at this mockery of creation. A man needs a body, a shadow and a reflection in order not to arouse suspicion in arelatively balanced world.

Well's third book, in which a man named Griffith discovers a way to make the human body absorb and reflect no light at all, and thus become invisible.The story itself is straightforward enough, beginning in media res, then explaining the background through narrative. Over the course of the story, we see Griffith rob, attack, and manipulate people to serve his owns ends. He later resorts to murder and we learn that his end is, in fact, a \\"reign of terror\\" in which he rules absolutely through fear of violence and regular executions. After disclosing this, he loses any potential friends, and the remainder of the book is spent detailing the conflict leading to his eventual capture.Unlike his first two books, this is told in third person, which conceals Griffith's motives until he explains them to Kemp. I'm used to second-guessing literature of this age, sympathizing somewhat with the \\"evil\\" presented by the authors, who seem often to focus on nature over nurture to the extent that evil has no choice but to be evil. I was surprised here. I think Wells managed to create a character who doesn't deserve any sympathy; he chooses evil and suffers the consequences for it.The characterization isn't particularly deep. We know next to nothing about why Griffith has these motives. He seems almost completely detached from society even before his invisibility, which becomes a physical manifestation of those invisible connections which should bind us to everyone else around us.Kemp is presented as a simple white hat, an honorable scientist and medical man standing up to the vicious Griffith and his plans for domination. He treats his servants well and is well known in his community. He stays up late researching problems and has an insatiable curiosity, though we don't know what the problems are or why he's curious. We're left to assume simply that Kemp is the opposite of Griffith.The other characters we know even less of, but that's OK. The story is paced well and is entertaining despite the flimsy characterization. More information on Griffith and why he's evil would be fantastic, but perhaps that's a modern preoccupation. Wells seems more concerned with the fact that he's evil than with any reason for it, and maybe that's a good thing."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Pretty good book with a pretty good story line. Glad I read it. Keeps you entertained and keeps yours attention."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A very positive transaction: fast, easy, painless, as it always is with buying kindle books. Hard to think of anything to improve the process - thank you."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Wells' 'The Invisible Man' is one of his earlier novels and therefore amongst the lighter of his political commentaries. To call it \\"standard\\" or a \\"classic\\" (in the \\"format\\" sense) is to forget that it was superb for its time, and to belie Wells' invention of the science fiction genre as a whole.While most of its themes and presumptions have been copied by and inspired countless tales, it still holds its own as the original invisible man story. The writing is lovely, and the imaginative way in which the plot unfolds remains gripping.Nevertheless, it cannot have the same effect as it must have when it was first published, given the intervening time. It reads nostalgically, and in the end comes across as a well-known and well-thumbed tale of the mad scientist turned psychotic villain.Well's main character was probably not altogether sane to begin with - which is implied as much given his obsession with his research. Although several devices are introduced to explain his tipping into an evil megalomania, it still smacks as an artificial method of not only moving the story along, but allowing it to wind up neatly.The painful difficulty of the process of becoming invisible, the frustration at having to deal with a world of seeming simpletons (who belie this judgement by continuing to foil the Invisible Man's efforts at achieving anything) and the unforeseen menace of being invisible in itself (for one thing, the necessity of travelling naked in the chilly English weather) just don't seem enough to explain the central character's modestly criminal aims. Rather than expose his research to the scientific community, to garner fame and help, to make money off it, he merely wants to terrorise and subjugate a few small towns.Still, it's a worthy read and we have much more to thank of Wells' and of this story than the mere content implies. The simple act of fabricating such a shocking and successful scientific fantasy has given us a century of countless worlds to enjoy from the pens and fingertips of thousands of authors."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The invisible man is a big, fat jerk. He is the villain you love to hate. As I was reading this book I started out sympathizing with him and his impossible situation only to become more and more horrified and disgusted. Despite my abhorrence of the main character I found myself fascinated by his story. He is both practical and fanatic, a genius with enough character flaws to add real depth to his character. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This was my first time to read a book electronically. I wasn't sure I would like it, but I did. I'm not saying that I am going to give up on hardbacks but I'm willing to expand my horizons."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A mysterious man all swathed in bandages so that his face can't be seen takes up residence at the Coach and Horses Inn, in the small Sussex village of Iping. He claims to be a disfigured scientist doing important research. The inn's owners, George and Jenny Hall, find their guest suspicious, and so do the other villagers. When the vicarage is burgled, suspicion falls on the stranger. In addition to turning out to be the thief, the man unveils his horrifying secret - he is completely invisible underneath his clothing and bandages!After assaulting a constable and various villagers, the invisible man, named Griffin, makes a hasty escape from Iping to avoid police capture. Only he forgot his notebooks. He forces a tramp named Thomas Marvel to help him acquire the books, but Marvel, terrified of his unseen \\"partner,\\" escapes, taking Griffin's books with him - and with them, the secret of invisibility! An enraged Griffin finds his way to the neighboring town of Port Burdock where he meets his old college friend Dr. Kemp, and tells him of his experiments to turn himself invisible.But Griffin, already an antisocial person even before he became invisible, is now mad with power, hellbent on finding and killing Thomas Marvel and recovering his books, and thenceforth to begin a \\"reign of terror\\" in Port Burdock - with Kemp's help! Kemp, refusing, alerts Colonel Adye of the Port Burdock police, whose men attempt to apprehend Griffin, and fail. A furious Griffin swears that Kemp will be the first victim of his forthcoming \\"reign of terror\\" because of his betrayal. A desperate Dr. Kemp and Adye try to formulate a plan of capturing the insane invisible man... but how do you fight what you can't see?!Next to The Island of Dr. Moreau and The War of the Worlds, this is probably my favorite of H.G. Wells' science fiction novels, and one of my favorite sci-fi novels, period. Whereas Wells' other novels lean more towards the serious end of things, 'The Invisible Man' is (despite its violent content) quite lighthearted and cheeky. The Griffin character is very amusing and even a bit of a mischievous scamp despite his obvious evil qualities. He makes a very excellent villainous protagonist/anti-hero. As the heroic antagonist/hero, Kemp is a bit bland, but he's introduced late in the novel, so you can't fault Wells for not developing him properly. Still, he gets the job done, I suppose, and isn't completely boring."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Though I read this book during school days, more than 20 years ago, the story still haunts me, but what makes me write this note is, though it's fiction, there's really an invisible man upon earth now - he's Sri Sathya Sai Baba, living in Puttaparthi, India. He appears at random to people all over the world, in America, Africa, Australia anywhere, though his physical form is in India. Hard to believe but this's non fiction, beyond the realms of science. My wife, a medical doctor saw him a number of times in this country where I live, also my brother, a medical doctor too, quite frequently sees him and even converses with him, but not all can see the omnipresent Sathya Sai Baba; but the book The Invisible Man by H.G Wells is really worth reading."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The I.M.by H.G.Wells isn't a standar sci/fihorror book.He wrote in a different era of time,and used a different style that what youmigth noexpect.

You really need to concentrate while reading it, though, as it is easy to get lost in the language that Wells uses. The story is decent, but I felt a little dissapointed at the end. Maybe I will just always see the Invisible Man as the voice in those old black and white movies instead of a mysterious man in England's country; I'm not sure. What I am sure about, however, is that while the book is not the easiest to follow, it is worth reading.

You don't care if you put it down or not, it doesn't hold your attention.

The book is 110 to 150 pgs long (depending on print size); there's not really a whole lot of room for such.

Now, I've been through many books having to do with science fiction and invisibility. The plot of this book is interesting, man makes himself invisible on accident with a medical experiment gone wrong. He then meets trouble in a town. He ends up being isolated.

H. G. Wells makes this novel put you in suspense by just turning the first page."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"\\"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snow fall of the year, over the down, walking as it seemed from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand.\\" This quote describes the stranger of Iping. There is a lot of foreshadowing going on in this quote. \\"Walking as it seemed\\" give the allusion that he could barely be seen. H.G. Wells, in The Invisible Man, describes the setting and the characters very well. The dialect used throughout the book is typical of the era this novel is set in. The main plot in this novel is really very short, but is stretched out with creative descriptions of the setting and the current actions of the characters and their surroundings.In this book, Wells starts off having a stranger coming into town. He finds a local hotel to stay at; Mrs. Hall, the owner of the small hotel, treats him very well. She notices the stranger has bandages all over his body, and soon there after the whole town notices. He was very weird. Staying at the hotel he always did experiments in his lab that he set up. Test tubes were everywhere and explosions happened frequently. Mrs. Hall asked him to take off his bandages one day and he did, and he was invisible. The whole town goes into shock, and the \\"Invisible Man\\" runs away. Through out this book, it tells of his story how he finds old friends and gets help to become visible again.The setting is consistent though out the book. It is all in the same little town of Iping. This is very effective in the book because the reader gets to know all the people in the book. When H.G. Wells talks about the characters in the novel and how they act, readers of this book remember the characteristics are of each person.Also the characterization is prepared very well. H.G. Wells gives the Invisible Man some wonderful description of how he walks and how the clothes look when he has his bandages off and just wearing a robe. The descriptions of the characters are excellent. All of this detailed descriptions also takes away from the plot. Sometimes Wells goes into deep detail, and pulls away from the main point of the story.The plot of this book travels a lot slower than most other books. H.G. Wells gives such great attention to everything and everyone else that the plot seems to be slow. The descriptions of the setting and how the weather is in Iping is described in such detail. The whole novel itself could have been a lot shorter or a lot longer. If he would take away some of the details it could be a lot shorter. He could also add more to the main plot and make the book longer and more intense.The language in the novel is very native to the time period. The setting of this book is before London had electricity. There are slang words of the time like \\"nigger\\" which relates to the period. English language is also used in this book which ties into the setting of the book.H.G. Wells', The Invisible Man, is a very well written novel. This book deserves four stars. The plot is very interesting but the book as a whole is very lengthy. The plot should have less description, and more to the actual plot. Overall this book is suited for most reader and enjoyable to nearly everyone."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Don't confuse this book with the piece of trash written by Ralph Ellison called The Invisible Man. This is another masterpiece from Wells."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man, by H.G. WellsI literally finished this book not 15 minutes ago, and I'm not sure how I feel. I think that I was supposed to sympathize with the townsfolk and think that the invisible man was evil, but I don't feel that at all. In fact, I rather hate the townsfolk and sympathize with the invisible man.Apparently he figured out some method of turning himself invisible. Shortly afterward, his landlord showed up and tried to break into his apartment because he didn't believe the scientist when he said he wasn't doing anything illegal in there. Really, that was his excuse to break down the door! And to cover his escape, the now invisible scientist burnt down the building. As far as I'm concerned, the landlord deserved it!So then he robbed a fellow who owned a costume shop for some money and a disguise; okay, illegal, but he's naked, broke, and hasn't eaten or slept for days. I don't much blame him for that, either.Finally he gets to a town where he tries to undo what he's done to himself. Everyone there is unbearably nosy, and eventually his money runs out. By this point everyone thinks he's doing something illegal and hiding from the law because of his costume. He again steals some money so he can pay his bill. Without any evidence whatsoever, a Constable shows up for his arrest.He fights his way free and injures some folks in the process. Eventually, everyone wants to arrest him all over. He never hurts anyone severely until he is finally backed into a corner by a man carrying a walking stick. He defends himself, and the man is killed.He eventually ends up being killed by the police. If everyone had just minded their own business, all of this might have been avoided!For more reviews like this one, visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is my first completed ebook on the Kindle and I found myself, with work in the morning, to be reading too late into the night! The main character is developed in the first half of the book and the plot propels you through the second half. H.G. Wells wrote this novel quite awhile ago and its great to experience how interesting timeless classics stories can still be in a world with flat-screen televisions, mp3 players, etc. In addition to the great story, the author also reveals how the scientific break-through did not make its way to the public. If you haven't read this in your younger years, don't miss your opportunity now as you can simply add it to your ebook reader, at no cost, and enjoy it at your leisure."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I listened to this book with the text to speech option (this feature is far from perfect) on the kindle while driving. Just listening to the story kept me glued throughout. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a great story still. It follows the theme set in Frankenstein of an obsessed scientist who single mindedly works on his project - and only on completion realizes he has unleashed a monster. With the twist that he is the monster.Where Mary Shelley delves into the emotional side of the story, H. G. Wells takes on the action and writes a compelling climax.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This again reinforces my experience that using movies to get an idea of what classic novels are about does not always work. There have been many Invisible Man movies, but I don't remember any that were like this book. The main character was significantly different than I expected. He was brilliant, but deeply flawed. He would not fall into my list of literatures most likable characters.I appreciate the kindle freebies, which has given me a chance to easily read many great works and novels. This edition was very readable. As with many freebies, there is no links in the table of contents, but that is not important to me in a novel like this. You can do a search for the word \`Chapter' is you want to see how long a chapter is.I recommend this short book for anyone interested in literature from this period. As an engineer, I was impressed by the author's explanations that made the invisibility sound plausible."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"In the beginning of The Invisible Man, by H. G. Wells, attention is brought to a scientist named Griffin who has discovered the means of invisibility with an invisibility serum. Griffin has apparently gone insane in the process. The book is very descriptive and with so much of a scientific background you may think that the serum that the invisible man produced is real. Very frustrated and upset with his situation, Griffin causes a major upset at an inn in rural London which makes him an infamous beast, with London at it's peak of terror already because of the Boer War. When frustrated by failure in his many attempts to restore himself back to visibility, Griffin is determined to embark on a reign of terror upon the world.H. G. Wells was a very strong writer and it is the situation from which the novel draws most of its power. Invisibility sounds quite enticing, but what if you were to actually become invisible? How would you cope with the ordinary details of every day life? Griffin does not cope well at all, and though Wells suggests that the invisible man's madness had arisen from a number of places and past events, he also implies that it may have arisen from the cold reality of invisibility itself.Published in 1897, The Invisible Man was one of H. G. Wells's earliest novels. It is an extremely influential novel and it has tremendous energy and style throughout it. It's a very entertaining read and is also quite witty in a sort of way. The sense of realism and scientific explanation creates a story so heart pounding that you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Imagine if you were invisible and could come and go as you pleased, with nobody able to see you. Cool, right? Well, not really. H.G. Wells' \\"The Invisible Man\\" has the sci-fi master exploring what would happen if a person took an invisibility elixir, and discovered too late that invisibility has some definite downsides. It's possibly Wells' funniest novel, but it also has some wonderfully chilling moments.A strange man arrives at a hotel in Iping, wrapped up in goggles, bandages, scarves, and heavy clothes. He spends most of his time hidden away in his room, doing odd scientific experiments, and avoiding contact with other people -- while still keeping everything except his nose hidden. Meanwhile, the local vicar and his wife are robbed by a mysterious thief... who is completely invisible.Well, you can guess what's up with the stranger -- he's an invisible man, and after a blowup with his landlady he reveals his true.... um, lack of appearance to the entire town. After a series of disastrous encounters, the Invisible Man encounters Dr. Kemp, an old friend to whom he reveals how he became invisible, and what he's done since then... as well as his malevolent plans for the future.H.G. Wells isn't really known for being a funny writer, but the first part of \\"The Invisible Man\\" is actually mildly hilarious. He writes the first third or so of the book in a fairly light, humorous style, and there are some fun scenes speckled through the story, like a homeless man dealing with the Invisible Man (\\"Not a bit of you visible--except-- You 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese?\\").But things get much darker after Mr. Kemp enters the scene, and we find out that the Invisible Man is... well, kind of malevolent and crazy. Very crazy.And as the plot grows darker and grimmer, Wells also inserts a clever (if far-fetched even by Victorian standards) explanation for how a person could become invisible, using a mix of science and fantasy. The plot hurtles through wild chase scenes and the occasional riot, and some moments of bleak tension (\\"When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing...\\")The Invisible Man himself (aka Griffin) is a pretty mysterious character for most of the story, since all we know about him is that he's invisible.... and also kind of a jerk. I mean, the guy constantly flies off the handle and even robs a nice little old vicar. And the more we find out about him, the more malignant and insane he turns out to be.Even if you had a way to become invisible, \\"The Invisible Man\\" would be a pretty effective way of dissuading people from using it. A deserving classic."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I'm a newcomer to the fiction of H.G. Wells. I was convinced his writing would be stodgy and old-fashioned, irrelevant, and plodding. Never have I been more wrong about an author of the classics.\\"The Invisible Man,\\" like other Wells' books, starts with a strong hook and moves forward at an ever-quickening pace. A mysterious man, bandaged, wearing blue goggles, moves into an apartment and sets the township of Iping talking with his strange actions, mumblings, and accoutrements. The mystery intensifies after he is bitten by a dog, and soon he is on the run. But the hunted is no victim here, and the man we come to know as Griffin is in fact a pathological personality, intent on using his strange experiment for personal gain and public havoc. We are given little motive, yet the menace seems to grow with each chapter--and we do get some clues as to Griffin's thinking by examining Wells' own frustrations at this time in his career.The book is readable, unaffected in its prose, and Wells wastes little time in interior monologues or backstories. Griffin is a man we come to despise, and yet we empathize with his alienation and isolation. If any one of us could do things without being seen or caught, what would we find ourselves capable of? Are we as noble as we like to think? When cut off from community, is it any wonder that some go to extremes in satisfying their own desires?Wells gives us the story and lets us read into it what we will. His main character is invisible, and the moral implications are transparent without needing to be hammered home. Even after a century, \\"The Invisible Man\\" is a book worth reading and discussing."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man is one of those stories I've seen referenced a number of times, though until recently I had never read it myself. When I picked this book up on a whim I didn't even really know the story all that well.The Invisible Man is a story about a man who has discovered a way to make himself unseen. He was experimenting with his neighbors cat one day, trying to make it invisible - which turned out to be a successful test. Not wanting to fess-up he made himself invisible. Soon the invisible man discovers there are more problems with being invisible than he anticipated. He finds himself at an inn and tries to make himself visible again, though he is unable to do so. The invisible man goes mad!I really can't think of anything more terrifying than having a ticked-off invisible enemy! Think about it! Yikes!H.G. Wells is a fantastic author and does a great job painting each scene. Wells does a good job breathing life into the characters. This book is quite short and paced very fast, I was glued from the first page to the last.I think the only downside is in the end of the story. The ending isn't terrible, I just anticipated more of a twist. I had an idea of what might happen, but I over-thought it and it turned out to be much more simple than I guessed.I highly recommend this book. The writing is excellent and very visual. The pages fly fast! You can easily read this in just a sitting or two."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a quick and easy read that should be enjoyed by readers of all ages. On the surface, an adventurous story of a disgruntled mad scientist whose experiment succeeds tremendously but leads to unanticipated difficulties, and his struggles to find a place in a world that he no longer fits in. Deeper, this book represents a poignant social commentary by Wells. Is it society's distrust and misunderstanding that lead to the Invisible Man's madness? Are these the inevitable outcomes of tinkering with nature? Would most people loose all sense of right and wrong without being observed by others? What makes it so hard for society to accept someone different? There are plenty of rather deep questions to keep in mind when reading this simple-seeming novel.However you read it, this is an interesting and entertaining read that will stick with you long after you've finished it. Take the little time it takes to read this classic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is one of those books you can read two ways.

It had my attention throughout the whole of it. Here's something about Wells: he writes the best pandemonium scenes. Ever. There's one in here that makes you feel for the people that don't know what to do, and at the same time you can't help laughing at the whole thing.If you want to get a little deeper, the main character comes off as rather endearing at first -- and maybe not so much later on. I think we all might wonder what we'd do in his shoes, and hope not the same things.It's a good read and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room. This stranger guards his privacy and desires solitude. His luggage consists of many bottles of powders and fluids as would be used by an experimental investigator. The local general practitioner visits the stranger, and sees something he can't believe. Then someone steals money from the Reverend Bunting although he and his wife see nobody. Later Mr. & Mrs. Hall, innkeepers, see the stranger's room is empty, until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits. When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose! Then the bandages and spectacles go, and the people see no head! When the constable comes to arrest him, the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air. The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes.Mr. Thomas Marvel, a wandering tramp, is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him. They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing. This sets off a commotion among the people there, and another chase. The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes. There was a story about \\"flying money\\" that was removed from shops and inns. At another inn Marvel seeks shelter, he has escaped from the Invisible Man. When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away, a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver. Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound (his blood can be seen). The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college, and is fed and clothed.The Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way. If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases (Chapter XIX). The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science. But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work! Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility (Chapter XX). The next chapters gives Griffin's history. But Kemp has written to the police, and they arrive. Griffin escapes once again, and Kemp warns the police about what must be done (Chapter XXV). Griffin is mad and inhuman, \\"pure selfishness\\". His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction, and his body becomes visible after death (Chapter XXVIII).If accurate, this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time. It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual. H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition. There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real (like \\"childproof guns\\", etc.). Readers of Wells' later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were. This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments, from poison gas to atomic bombs, or the current craze for cloning or \\"genetic modification\\" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people. In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn't always happen in the real world."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room.

Later Mr. & Mrs. Hall, innkeepers, see the stranger's room is empty, until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits. When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose! Then the bandages and spectacles go, and the people see no head! When the constable comes to arrest him, the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air. The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes.Mr. Thomas Marvel, a wandering tramp, is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him. They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing. This sets off a commotion among the people there, and another chase. The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes. There was a story about \\"flying money\\" that was removed from shops and inns. At another inn Marvel seeks shelter, he has escaped from the Invisible Man. When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away, a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver. Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound (his blood can be seen). The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college, and is fed and clothed.The Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way. If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases (Chapter XIX). The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science. But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work! Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility (Chapter XX). The next chapters gives Griffin's history. But Kemp has written to the police, and they arrive. Griffin escapes once again, and Kemp warns the police about what must be done (Chapter XXV). Griffin is mad and inhuman, \\"pure selfishness\\". His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction, and his body becomes visible after death (Chapter XXVIII).If accurate, this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time. It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual. H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition. There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real (like \\"childproof guns\\", etc.). Readers of Wells' later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were. This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments, from poison gas to atomic bombs, or the current craze for cloning or \\"genetic modification\\" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people. In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn't always happen in the real world."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"this is a good book, a must have since its free. i happen to adore the island of dr moreau, but this is good too."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I have always dreamed of being invisible and all the fun it could be.

H.G made it interesting and as usual I compared it to the old movie I saw years ago. I read the book twice...You can imagine what was going on while reading..loved it."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A timeless classic. A must read. Wells is at his best with this tale of science, progress and humanities failures."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells is a science fiction classic written in 1897. The novella was first serialized in Pearson's Weeklythe same year it was published.Griffin is a scientist who devotes himself to the field of optics. While working in his research Griffin discovers that he can change the body's refractive index to absorbs all light and reflect none, which makes him invisible.The scientist uses himself as his first experimentation subject but fails to reverse the process. After his friend betray him, Griffin decided to murder him and begins his own personal \\"reign of terror\\".What if what you consider a blessing is also a curse?The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells touches on this very same question.How many of us wouldn't like to be invisible? That's what the protagonist, Griffin, thought when he became invisible only to find it to be the bane of his existence. Yes, there are some positives aspects but H.G. Wells concentrates mostly on the negative ones.I thought Wells did a good job building up the eerie atmosphere that is prominent throughout the story. Actually, the atmosphere is the star of the book as none of the characters resonated with me and the storyline, which mainly consisted of wrecking havoc for havoc's sake, was not very inspired. The story itself is also quite funny, I thought and many of the scenes played in my mind as slapstick.However, one could certainly tell that Wells is a master storyteller and I find myself engrossed in the story for several chapters (mainly at the beginning and end). I also found the period details in the book very interesting.The Invisible Man is the ultimate story of an insane anti-hero, before insane anti-heroes became popular. Griffin himself becomes more and more pathetic as the story progress and from the comical start Wells moves away to a darker, subtle satire of small minds in small towns can be just as dangerous as any psychopath."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"After reading one of Wells's other novellas, \\"The Time Machine\\", I expected similar treatment: a new idea (for the time) with an inventor-hero on a voyage of discovery, with lots of charming retro-isms and \\"look, here is the first use of XXX in a novel\\" scenes.\\"The Invisible Man\\" has that. And more. Surprisingly, the protagonist has more depth as a character than just \\"invented invisibility and started using it\\". I can imagine what he would be like in different milieus even if he had never come near invisibility.The other characters are less complicated. They come on the stage, perform their part of the plot, and go.Also, I like novellas. The book is as long as it needs to be to tell its story, not padded out."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I had read some of Well's work before I came across this book. He is truly the father of sci-fi. I had seen the movies with similar titles but unlike in the movies, Well's \\"Invisible Man\\" is not entirely black and white. He has shades of grey. He is very much human... just invisible.The book outlines the trial and tribulations of a scientist who makes himself invisible and is not able to reverse the process. The story tells about his adventures, his fate and people's reactions to his singular characteristic.The narrative is very simple and though the book is science fiction, like most of Well's other works, it focuses more on the psychological and emotional aspects of human nature rather than the science behind it. It is difficult to let go of this book easily. It lingers in ur mind and ur imagination. It consumes you. A true classic!!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man is not just a science fiction story. It is a story that examines human nature.On the surface, this is a cleverly written narrative about a scientist who figures out how to manipulate his albinism to make himself invisible. At first, he can see only the allure of invisibility: privacy, mystery, power, freedom... not to mention shocking the world with an incredible scientific discovery. Disadvantages did not come to mind.At last, after many years of experimentation, Griffin discovers how to make himself invisible. The excitement, however, was short-lived. He soon realized that people would fear him, and he would be in constant danger. In attempting to remain hidden from the world, he must walk barefoot all the time, suffer heat and cold completely naked, and steal in order to survive. Eventually, he comes up with some sort of costume to disguise his invisibility and attempt to appear \\"normal,\\" but even that does not last.When the people of Iping Village finally realize that this strange man is invisible, Griffin is forced to flee, and becomes desperate and violent. He threatens a reign of terror upon the town, even issuing death threats. I will leave the fate of the Invisible Man and Iping Village up to the curious reader to discover.In sum, while I found this book difficult to read at times (it is heavily detailed), I admire the fact that Wells is able to make invisibility almost believable, by citing studies of optical density and albinism. (This is one thing I feel modern science fiction lacks -- some kind of actual science, instead of a \\"just go with it\\" approach.) I also appreciate what is a continuously unwinding study of human nature."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"H.G. Wells was an incredible author, and this book is a great demonstration of his creativity (not only in overall plot, but in the way that he presents the material). The narration throughout this book flows seamlessly, having the reader viewing each event from multiple perspectives - personally why I enjoyed the book so much. Also, his character portrayal was brilliant, making each figure linguistically unique in their own way. Brilliant book, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The message of this book still rings true today. In a world with ever-changing technology and scientific advances, we must still be careful of the impact of those changes and advances. Their effects can be far-reaching and sometimes can be irreversible.As to the writing in this book, the author creates a vivid picture in the mind of the reader of each character and their actions, building the tension with each page. In the days before technology brought us the \\"moving pictures\\" of the movies, this author was taking his readers for a suspenseful, action packed ride with only their imagination to paint the pictures in their minds. It is rich in the details of each person, each room, each scene that is before you. I pictured them all in my mind - making my own \\"movie of the mind\\". I have seen several movies that were based on this book in the past, but had never read the original book by H. G. Wells. The reading of this book made the best \\"movie\\" of all."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Many books about an invisible man tantalize readers with adventures where an invisible man takes immoral advantage of other people, sexually and financially. An example is the ancient fable of a man who obtains a magic ring that makes him invisible. He enters the palace of the king, kills the king, and takes his wife, kingdom, and gold. Wells turns the tale in an opposite direction. He details the difficulties that an invisible man would face in society.The invisible man in Wells' story, Griffin, needs to find the formula and then the chemicals to restore himself to visibility. While invisible, he needs to cover himself entirely from his hair to his toes; otherwise people would realize that he was invisible, fear and mistreat him. This causes many difficulties. When he wants to go out without being seen, for example, he needs to remove all of his cloths; and since it is winter, he catches a cold, coughs and sneezes; and walking without shoes, he cuts his feet, bleeds and leaves tracks.Griffin had robbed his father of money to finance his discovery of invisibility, but is now, books and go out to find the chemicals that are required to restore him to visibility. He resorts to theft again and is discovered because of his bloody foot prints and his sneezes. The police and town people pursue him determined to kill him. He persuades a tramp to help him. Since he cannot carry his scientific books, for people would see the apparently floating books and know that he is carrying them, he gives them to the tramp to carry, but the tramp runs away with them. He goes to a friend from his school days who seems to sympathize with him, but the friend thinks that Griffin is insane and calls the police.Readers will puzzle over the question \\"Has Griffin become crazy?\\" and answer it to their satisfaction. In reading the gripping tale, they will have to decide whether the many deaths in the story can be blamed on Griffin. Also, does a great discovery justify theft? They will be curious what happens to him and to the tramp. They may also ask, \\"Is Wells offering us a parable and, if so, what is the message?\\""},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I grew up on all the invisible man movies and still think of him as Claude Rains. I was surprised in the similarities and differences the book has to the movie. The scenes are rearranged from the book to make visual (or invisible) sense as a movie script.A man all warped up in bandages except for his large pink nose requires a room at the inn and pays well. Slowly the Innkeeper and her companions suspect there is more to his than just a man with bandages. Everyone in a while they glimpse light where there should not be. And the stranger is so cranky that the money may not be worth the trouble of keeping him. Soon there are strange happenings and the cat is out of the bag sort of speaking.The trail leads to murderer and a possible reign of terror. Read more to find out where the secret is reviled and how a man named Griffin got in this situation.If I had read this story a year ago I would have said it was a fairly well put together sci-fi story. I would just enjoy the writing and wonder how H.G. came up with the idea. However now after reading much of H.G.'s political writings I see that this is a thinly veiled social commentary. We find that unlike the movie where Griffin goes mad in the invisibility process, that in the book Griffin was always amoral and anything stressful could set him off. Also, somewhere out there is a couple of floating eyes that belong to a cat.Now one habit that .G. has in most of his tales is that just when you think he is finished on the subject, he will go off in another direction with some sub plot he has slipped in earlier. Therefore, what should have been a short story becomes a novel. Another good example of his witting style can be found in \\"The Food of the Gods.\\""},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible ManIf you enjoy reading fictional, thrilling, suspenseful novels then The Invisible Man is for you. This novel was written by H. G. Wells.The book starts out on a day in February in a town called Iping, which is located in London. Cold weather blows in an outsider. This stranger decides to stay at a bed and breakfast called Coach and Horses. While there Mr. and Mrs. Hall, the owners of Coach and Horses, realize how odd this man in disguise really is. He is very curt and likes his privacy. When his luggage does not show up on time he flips out. Interestingly enough, all that is in the foreigner's bags are glass bottle and three books labeled Diary.Later in the book unusual things start to happen. Money is missing and the burglar was heard taking it. Peculiarly, the burglar was not seen. Then, in chapter seven, Jaffers, Mr. Hall, and Wadgers see that the visitor is invisible. The Invisible Man also leaves his possessed three Diary books at Coach and Horses, so he has to come back to get it. This creates a ruckus. Mr. Thomas Marvel ends up helping the Invisible Man and being his \\"slave\\". Marvel ends up keeping the books. This infuriates the Invisible Man, so he threatens to kill Marvel. Because of this, Marvel ends up going to jail and having them lock him up in the greatest, sturdiest cell.In chapter seventeen Dr. Kemp gets a visitor. The Invisible Man shares information with Kemp, how he became invisible, and that his real name is Griffin. Griffin tells Kemp about his plan for terror. The plan consists of robbery, murder, and terror. Dr. Kemp pretends to go along with Griffin and what he is saying. All of a sudden, Colonel Adye comes in to Kemp's house. Together, Adye and Kemp team up to stop Griffin. They try and trap him in a room but he tries to choke Kemp and escapes.Dr. Kemp later gets a letter from Griffin.

What can he do when there is no reflection holding him accountable of his own guilt? This is what Wells tries to answer in his book, among other things. He also flirts with the idea that what we may want, that thing that gives us an advantage over others, may really be a curse.I love this story. A strange man enters the village, surrounded my mystery. He takes a room at the inn, and like the villagers, the reader wants to know more about him. Then as we see the stranger's story mature we begin to feel sorry for him. His pursuits in science are at first genuine, then they become more a quest for fame, and when the experiments work, the brilliant man turned mad-scientist is consumed by his own disturbing creation, forced to see it through to the end. But while he is stuck in his invention, he is faced with moral choices-- do what is right, or do what is self-serving.H.G. Wells does a brilliant job telling this story. It's written as if it were an account of witnesses analyzed and compiled by the author. It's almost more like a report of a curious writer, rather than a fictional story. It's only a hint of reporting, though, just enough to suggest that it might even be a true story.

Steven Yum, ASI"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This is a very good book, and as another reviewer said, Wells gets the most out of his words; an astonishing amount of detail and plot is put into what is really a rather short book. One of the great things about it is that Wells makes a seemingly impossible task (making humans invisible) seem possible. After we find out a lot about Griffin we learn about his adventures and difficulties as the invisible man. The main themes seem to be the horrors that would abound if a major discovery were found by an evil person. Also, it is a definite attack on narcissism, as most of Griffin's terrible acts were spurred by his needs and disregard for others.

He wrote this book in the burgeoning scientific society (The book is published in 1897), which was to transform the entire world in the 20.th century. H.G. Wells was acutely curious about the most far reaching possiblities of science. This book actually ponders upon a scientific theory about making matter invisible. According to this theory matter is visible because it is granulated. Wells gives an example with glass: When glass is whole it is transparent and you can look through it. If you break the class and crushes it into a powder, you granulate the glass and makes it into a white powder, which is not transparent. It is the uneven surfaces of the granules which makes them non-transparent. If you can smoothen these surfaces of the granules you can make matter more transparent. Wells gives an example with paper. We can't look through paper because it is made of tiny paper fragments with uneven surfaces. But if you poor oil on the paper it has the effect of smoothening the jagged surfaces of the paper fragments making up the piece of paper, thus the paper is becoming more transparent. This is fundamentals of the theory which the scientist of the novel, Griffin, uses to make himself invisible."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I expected this story to be similar to Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but it wasn't. In those two books the researchers/scientists struggled with the morals of their work. The story revolved around the struggle of IF they should have done what they did and the results of their actions.The Invisible Man could have been titled The Violent Man. It basically followed the events of Griffin who, while invisible, hurts, burns, and kills people at every turn. There really was no story, lesson, moral or point.I do give kudos to Wells in that his fight scenes were very well written."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This was a great first book for my first Kindle.

Wells novel. Honestly, I didn't enjoy The Invisible Man quite as much as I did The War of the Worlds. The storyline and writing were both top notch, but I just found it hard to REALLY enjoy a novel in which I totally despised the main character.In all actuality, I guess my feelings towards the protagonist/antagonist (yes, both are the same character) would be considered a win for the author, as I feel that Wells didn't intend for the reader to truly like this character. What I find interesting is that as I was reading the novel, I did feel a bit of sympathy for the main character's plight from time to time, but then he would do something so over-the-top or horribly nasty that I would immediately lose any sympathetic feelings and replace them with something more akin to loathing.I did enjoy the novel for the most part though and Wells crafts a wonderful story that keeps the reader interested throughout. I found the science behind his explanation of events to be sufficient to carry the story especially considering the time in which it was written and think that this is another fine example of early Science Fiction before Science Fiction was actually defined as a genre."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":". . . and that really did make this book for me.I expected this book to be a bit more enthralling (on a level withThe Island of Doctor Moreau). While I was let-down there, I really did enjoy the character of Griffin, the Invisible Man. Griffin, a scientist who made himself invisible without considering for even a few moments what it would mean to be invisible or if he might be better off staying visible, was a major jerk even when he was visible. The headaches and hassles associated with invisibility just makes him more cranky. And invisibility gives him freer reign to move from regular jerk to murdering invisible jerk.The focus on the book shifts a great deal -- Griffin travels around a fair amount and it isn't until he runs into a fellow scientist and old schoolmate, Kemp, that the book settles into a more enjoyable pattern for me. The science behind the book is interesting, but I feel that I wouldn't have liked it half as much of Griffin hadn't been such a hilariously short-tempered, impatient, and easiy annoyed jerk.Kindle formatting is good."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A mysterious man rents a room and is all bandaged up.

Well's novel \\"The Invisible Man\\" tells a story of a man who rents a room in Iping, England. What makes him suspicious is he is swathed in bandages. Pretty soon stories circulate from eyewitnesses that he lacks a body underneath the bandages. When a house is burglarized by someone who is unseen, and the police hear that an invisible man is staying at a place, they go to arrest him for interrogation.One thing that struck me as interesting about the novel is that the characters, rather than being fascinated by the invisible man, simply view him as just another criminal. If someone succeeded at making themselves invisible, it would be a major scientific discovery. The invisible man, enabled by his condition to get away with breaking the law certainly does engage in crime unfortunately. Finding a major scientific discovery is no excuse for breaking the law. But I still have to admit that what the invisible man discovered was a major scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man by H. G. WellsLike its predecessor The Island Of Dr. Moreau, Wells' novel is another portrayal of science gone wrong under misguided scientists. Short enough to be read in a single sitting, it is a quick and entertaining read and it is also quite witty."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A stranger arrives in Iping, where he books a private room in the pub. His behaviour intrigues the locals. He is foul-tempered and rude, and never removes the bandages covering his face. He remains confined to his room, working on mysterious experiments. We gradually discover that he is a scientist called Griffin who has made himself invisible, and is now desperately trying to regain visibility. He fails, goes on the rampage, and terrorises the surrounding countryside. He kills, and in the end is killed.Like in other stories by H.G. Wells, there is only one impossible hypothesis: that of invisibility which is then thrown into the ordinary world and the created fantasy becomes as real and vivid as a dream and inhabits the reader's mind. What matters to the author is probably the impact that a scientific invention would have on the world and the way in which people would react to it. In \\"The Invisible Man\\" he shows the unforgiving cruelty of the mob to the unusual, to the hunchback, the cross-eyed, the disfigured or the simpleton. The invisible man is just a powerful allegory for such people and that is why the novel has remained so powerful through time. It is also a clever study of character because Griffin strives to make himself unusual by becoming invisible and thereby placing himself above his fellow men and he becomes a man who sees in himself and in his uniqueness a power over others, a man possessed with the element that dictatorship is made of.Edward Hardwicke's fantastic reading of the novel for BBC Audiobooks is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This compelling story begins in a small country inn, with a mysterious customer who is wrapped in bandages. He carries with him only the desire to be in complete solitude. Later when his luggage arrives it consists of bottles, test tubes and thousands of books. This stranger stays locked in his room, doing what it seems to be like scientific experiments. As the story goes on, many unbelievable events occur and the inn-keepers, Mr. and Mrs. Hall, are quite disturbed. This strange man, Griffin, is very much a scientist and has come up with a potion to make himself invisible. He has many advantages and many disadvantages. This serum that he has created has not only changed his physical state, but his mental state as well. He roams the streets of London in complete nudity, doing his best to not be discovered. He has a longing to kill, but at the same time to be understood.The Invisible Man is a wonderful book that keeps its readers wanting more. It consists of a great story line with very detailed characters. But I often got the feeling that I was reading the short version. It seemed very rushed at the conclusion of the story. It would have made a much better impression of the book, if it had a little bit more at the end. But besides that I really enjoyed every part of this thriller.

I would definitely reccommend this fantasic book to anyone, because I will always keep it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man, written by H.G. Wells, is an outstanding book. I give it a 4 out of 5. The characters in this book are amazing to read about. Especially the Invisible Man himself. Wells is a master at shaping the feelings and emotions of the characters. Mrs. Hall, caretaker of the inn, was not properly greeted one day by a man who showed no skin an all. He wore a hat and large blue sunglasses and kept his whole head covered by a white bandage. He also wore a tan overcoat and gloves so you could not see his feet or hands. He demanded that he would need a room and Ms Hall gave him one. The strange occurrences that happened throughout the book are too many to name, bt some were the 1001 bottles that the Invisible Man ordered to do tests and experiments to find out if he could reverse his invisibility, or the disturbing interview with the Invisible Man where the interviewer could see, or well, couldn't see under the cloak of secrecy where the Invisible Man hid. I will not give away the fantastic climax to this book so you will have to buy or check out a copy yourself and experience the fantastic story of the Invisible Man.
