However, those who do like the book will enjoy it a great deal. The theme is one that has been explored by almost every male author of note: A young man is attempting to sort out his own values while asking himself if he is living his life properly. This is, of course, a serious topic. Because of the gravity of the subject, many writers seem to cave in to the temptation to go overboard and the resulting work becomes hopelessly melodramatic. Julian Barnes, however, has avoided the cliches of this sub-genre by mocking the main character's periodic self-absorbtion. The result is a protagonist that the reader can truly care about and (ultimately) admire. Metroland's dialog is witty, and the narrative is very clever. The chapter dealing with Chris's attempts to impress his new French girlfriend are so realistic that they must be autobiographical. Metroland would be best enjoyed in small bites, a chapter or two at a time at the end of the day. You might hate this book, and I honestly wouldn't blame you, but I loved it."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Metroland is undoubtedly on my top 10 list for life. The story is, above all else, touchingly honest. Vivid pictures are painted with the subtlest of language. The writing gives keen insight into the head of a young boy and his passage into adulthood.There is nothing more satisfying than when you read a book that is written as if it could have come from your own head...The absurdity and comedy of some of the conversations will make you laugh as you think about times in your own life when things don't have to be mature and sensical - you just say them, and magically, everyone understands.The scenes in the museum where the two main characters are observing peoples' minute reactions to artwork is my absolute favorite. The passage describing how art is the most important thing in life, and how people, simply by viewing art, are in some way improved, is in my wallet and I make sure to show it to everyone I know.I have read Talking It Over, also by Barnes, and enjoyed it, but Metroland stands alone because it is so completely and honestly genuine.kidTiger"},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Metroland is a very intimate and enchanting novel written in the first person. The reader is drawn into Chris, the narrator's, world at the very outset and from that point on, we are taken on a journey through life, time and age.We start out in the mind of a 16 year old boy, feeling all his hopes and ideals alongside him, sharing his philosophies and questions with his closest friends in a haven of teenage, mutual, intellectual exchange.Then comes Paris, May '68. Chris has matured. We sense that he has begun to live, and has become increasingly uncertain of how the realities of life fit in with his childhood ideals.As the work draw slowly to a close the narrator is experiencing \\"real\\" life to the full; the marriage, the mortgage and the child, and yet the need to question seems to have been appeased. We now sense his readiness to live life day by day, without too much forward-thinking. With age, he no longer really asks why things happen, he merely accepts.The ageing process we feel in the novel is fascinating, in particular when we consider the relationship between the two childhood \\"best friends\\", Chris and Toni. As children they seem to parralel so closely, with similar beliefs and concerns, yet as time passes their priorities and goals move in conflicting directions. Chris adapted his ideals to reality. Toni, on the other hand, tried to live by his childhood ideals as an adult, torturing himself in the process in the hopes of being true to his past self and his broken dreams.Some of us mature and develop and some are children forever ....who is happier?"},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"I agree with KidTiger's review that the museum scene is priceless;many others are too.I don't think the book depicts a stereotypical account of English boys' adolesent thoughts, but I would love to believe they are all so pensive and aware--even in the sometimes sophmoric ways of Toni and Chris. The way these observations and thoughts are conveyed are refreshingly honest and admittedly naive. I have recommended this fast-read gem to all English guys I know who want to revisit an awkward time and laugh."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Yes, this is another sensitive-young-man-coming-of-age story, but a very good one. It's well-written, humorous, and sensitive. But its take on growing up is dreary and somewhat fatalistic.There are many comparisons to be made here. Barnes explicitly mentions Flaubert's &quot;Setimental Education,&quot; and that is apt, but I thought more of Joyce's &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot; The main difference, besides Barnes's much less intellectual tone, is that Joyce's book left me joyously inspired, while Barnes's left me despondent and a bit angry. In the start of Metroland, the two young men are full of curiosity and joy -- as they mature, they inevitably become, well, old and boring and defeated, seeking contentment rather than joy. Joyce's protagonist went off to forge in the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscience of his race; Barnes's protagonist just becomes a bitter suburban man. And Barnes doesn't even seem to reproach him for this. To Barnes, this seems to be the natural process of growing up. (John Cougar Mellencamp: &quot;Life goes on, even after the thrill of living is gone.&quot;)I am giving Metroland four stars because it is unfair to give a book demerits for an unhappy ending. Barnes certainly knows his stuff as a writer, and the dialogue, especially in the start of the novel, is crisp and engaging. But it's getting four stars instead of five because the ending could have been a little more original (and, a tiny voice in my head says, happier too) than &quot;And then we became old and boring.&quot;One note: you may enjoy Metroland more if you know French, since many of the key expressions, and even entire sentences, are in French. It's not crucial to know French, but it's helpful."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Les evenements? What?The secret shame of the book's main character is having been in Paris through May of 1968 and not even noticing the student revolution, much less participating in it.But then, he was in love.This book lays foundation for almost every recurring theme of Barnes's future writing: the anxiety of growing up, the middle-class identity, the French connection, sex, love, etc.It is less enthralling than \\"Talking It Over\\" or \\"Before She Met Me\\", but still an excellent novel.Oh, and yes! It must have been noted already, and probably many times, but for me it was a small personal revelation. In \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" the narrator ridicules the author of some first novel or other, who mentiones in his book the first forbidden edition of \\"Madame Bovary\\". The narrator's sting points at the fact that there have never been such a thing, and the poor chap must have meant \\"Les fleurs du mal\\".The passage ridiculed in \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" is taken from \\"Metroland\\".Postmodernism rules. Or does it?"},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"The thoughts and conversations of the two teenage boys and this book are certainly not typical of those of 'real' children. The device used by the author in attributing such sophistication to adolescents parallels one of the themes of the book, that of utilty versus aesthetics.In the first conversation we read between Chris and Tony since Chris' marriage, Chris asks Tony to explain to him the use of their childhood, heartfelt, agonising studies of reactions to the arts.As adolescents, the boys have no power but no responsibility - Tony, it seems, never develops responsibilty and is embittered by his subsequent lack of influence on the real world or, indeed, on the literary world.Chris accomodates real responsibility with a gradual softening of his views on other peoples jobs and lives, (see school reunion,) and the novel ends with Chris looking at the effect of a sodium light - this time he doesn't worry about it turning the colour of his clothes brown, but is content that his daughter is comforted by the light outside her window.Art has no 'use' other than to sustain our spirits and give support to our more duties as adults.There is no 'selling out' in this novel, just a wish to avoid the bitterness, loneliness and futility of a life driven by criticism and cynicism."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Julian Barnes is my preferred author for the present time. I read the great majority of his books. They contain a lot of life philosophy. I felt richer spiritually after reading each of his books. The most beautiful page I read about fiction was the preface of his latest book &#34;Through the window&#34;. I read it for all my friends"},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"A good book of course but of the 4 or so I have read it has the least substance.Definitely no Sense of an Ending."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"I was immensely disappopinted with this novel. In contrast to the thoughts of most other reviewers it was the opening third which irritated me most. The two central characters as children were quite preposterous. Whilst recognising that Barnes wished to track the arc of their development from immature pretentions through to adult acceptance (in Chris's case) I really don't think he carried it off well. Unless these children attended a school for the outstandingly gifted, I suspect they could not have reched such a level of erudition and linguistic profficiency. I also found that the author pandered (perhaps unwittingly) to a certain strata of reader. Yes, the novel examines some universal themes, but much of it is devoted to the angst of the unknowingly privileged and after a while I found my face twitching as I read. As for Barnes' reputation as a witty and observant writer, if his Man Shop anecdote is his best attempt at humour, I suggest he sticks to the plays on words. Barnes' brand of humour is slick and clever, as you would expect, but it seems far too constructed and simply isn't amusing. Like most readers I admire Barnes greatly for his brilliant use of language and his insightful thoughts on the human condition, however this novel is ridden with hubris and an overall dillusion of applicability to the world in general. As a teenager in Newcastle I learned French at school. Most of the time I could barely remember the days of the week, and yet, compared to most kids, I was thought of as fluent! Perhaps this genius generation only ever existed in the Home Counties of England, but then since Englishness is defined, de facto, by those counties I suspect this offering is regarded as a representative piece of 'English' fiction. All in all, a highly insulated view. Posh twaddle - avoid if at all possible."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"This was the first of Julian Barnes's novels, but I came to it after reading a selection of his later essays in 'Letters from London' and the 'Pedant in the Kitchen' as well as his intellectual postmodern history novel 'A History of the World in Ten Chapters'.The sharpness, wit and originality prevalent in the aforementioned works I found to be sadly lacking in Metroland. The story seemed to be implausible and trite. The narrator is Chris Lloyd, a sensitive teenager growing up in a part of suburban London served by the Metropolitan line - hence the book's title. With his friend Toni, he peruses the world with a mixture of cynicism, scorn, curiosity, cheekiness and boredom. In the middle third of the novel, Chris comes of age, finding the traditional intellectual shelter spots of Paris coming to his rescue as he loses his virginity to an attractive French girl and meets his future wife. The final third highlights Chris's maturity into the mellow contentment of middle age - a condition acidly mocked by Toni, who is still trying to remainin true to the bohemian, artistic ideals of their shared adolescence.The coming of age theory is one that has been tackled by virtually every well known male novelist, usually early in their career, and there is no shame in this. But first novels should be a fresh, energetic footprint on the existing field of literature. Metroland is a mere scrabbling in the soil. It is a neat, clever book, but the prose bumbles along in a bland, bored manner, reminiscent of the Metropolitan tube line itself. The themes covered for instance include:Teenage Chris and Toni going into a mans shop and asking for 'One man and two small boys please' - come on Julian, you can write better jokes than this surely.Chris nervously chatting up a French girl in a cafe by asking her about the book she is reading - a trite clich&eacute; if ever I saw one.Chris comparing his emotional state at various stages in his life by considering the objects around him - notorious critic, Dale Peck's assertion that Barnes is motivated by little more than boredom and hubris begin to hold some resonance here.Chris in middle age going to a school reunion and reflecting on how his peers have grown up and matured - please, is this not a theme covered a thousand times in navel gazing contemporary literature? even in great novels such as 'American Pastoral', the school reunion scene is rarely treated originally or creatively.Julian Barnes did go on to become one of Britain's foremost novelists and essayists, and deservedly so. But you wouldn't think so from this uninspiring debut."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"As always, books mean different things to different people.For me, this book is about how we change as we grow older. Or rather, not the fact that we change, but the way that we move in different directions.Its about the wedge that time drives between us, and it reflects the experience of every one of us.In places it is a little painful - it offers no rose-tinted view of life, merely tells it how it is.For those who prefer to escape into their reading list, it is probably not ideal. But it is extremely well written (as always! Barnes is a very accomplished author), and flows nicely.All in all, an intelligent, and very observant book."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"Without saying too much of anything that anyone else has already written, I really liked the first 2 sections of the book. I loved the descriptions of Chris and Toni growing up, and I loved the descriptions of Chris in Paris, doing some growing up and falling in love.Though I think Toni never grew up, contrary to what the author would have me believe, I think Chris sold out instead of simply becoming an adult."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"True, the coming of age story has been written ad nauseum. It is also true the coming of age in the 1960's slant will also cause a reader to contemplate the feeling during the moment just prior to the aspiration of food particles. However it is also true that this version of the oft-told tale is the first offered to readers by Mr. Julian Barnes. And finally it is, or should be true, that whether or not an Author is the first or one thousand and first to pen his or her version of a familiar tale, it should be judged on it's merits, not graded upon its location in time relative to other familiar themes.That's as far as I can go in defense of this particular work. I have read 5 novels by the Author, and this I enjoyed the least. However, Julian Barnes writes with a qualitative consistency superior to most novelists, that his weaker work can be so described is valid, only when placed in relation to other of his works.The two young men we follow were just a bit too clever in their own estimation to be enjoyable. Their faith in change, which we expect to fail, rings true in the narrowest of confines, between only themselves. Their antics when younger quickly dissolve as time and their proximity to each other changes.One of the young men has an encounter on a train with a more elderly gentleman, one who by definition of their teenage beliefs is deserving of only scorn. And while there is no epiphany at the moment of the exchange, the faith of all he believes are proved to be false, and further are proven to be in terminal health, he just isn't prepared to accept defeat.The stars and my comments may be contradictory. The only defense I offer is that when this man writes, he is very good, and even this work has moments that are exceptional.Not his best, but better than most that have gone before."},{"Title":"Metroland","review":"The book was great, but the movie is wonderful.

It purports to be grounded in the principles of classical psychoanalysis, but is really rather disappointing on that score, and others. If you are looking for a text that catalogs 19th and early 20th century appearances of the doppelg&auml;nger in literature, this text will fit your needs. Rank describes these appearances fairly exhaustively, and he separates the examples of the doppelg&auml;nger into helpful categories. However, he touches only lightly on the psychoanalytical significance of these examples and he refrains from attempting any general theory of the doppelg&auml;nger. The final page comes close to a conclusion, but there is a certain level of ambiguity throughout which is, perhaps, justified given that he was breaking new ground.It is also important to remember that the book is dated and therefore limited in scope. For example, Rank spends time discussing the mental trials and traumas of the authors who use the motif, ascribing an autobiographical basis for its employment. This is potentially the case in some of his examples but is not relevant in contemporary terms. Rank makes some general points about how and why the double appears, i.e. the paradoxical case of the suicide who destroys himself, projecting his fear onto the double, in order to escape the fear of death. Chiefly he defers to Freud, leaving to him the finer points of psychoanalytical theory which may be said to underlie the appearance of the double. (See for example Freud's essays 'The Uncanny', 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle', etc.) Rank provides a chapter on the anthropological significance of the doppelg&auml;nger, but the chapter disintegrates into a further survey of the literary appearances of the motif, which had already been covered ad infinitum in the previous chapter.There are a handful of contemporary studies of the doppelg&auml;nger which are far more in depth, although they are also heavily theoretical (see Vardoulakis, Webber). Rank's study is brief, a mere 86 pages. It is certainly helpful and worth the read, but it remains only a preliminary study of this phenomenon."},{"Title":"The double: A psychoanalytic study (Meridian book) (English and German Edition)","review":"A recurring figure in European literature, especially of a gothic sort, is the double, an identical figure who appears to torment the hero in works such as Poe's 'William Wilson', Hoffmann's 'The Doubles' and Doestoevsky's 'The Double'. One night Otto Rank, an Austrian disciple of Freud who later broke away from his master, watched a film on this theme, Wegener's 'The Student of Prague', leading him to ponder it from a psychoanalytic viewpoint, resulting in this famous 1914 study.firstly, he discusses the multitude of literary examples, including Musset, Stevenson, Maupassant and Wilde, and the different kinds of doubles - literal doubles, shadows, reflections, portraits, psychological projections, fathers/brothers (it's always men), past/future selves etc. More dubiously, he then analyses the mental biographies of the authors.There follows a review of the anthropological origins of the double figure - e.g. as a symbol of in/fertility and masculine im/potency, or the soul - utilising a lot of now outmoded, pre-pre-structuralist material, and much use of terms like 'primitives' and 'savages'. Finally, he discusses the double in relation to the theory of narcissism, seeing the trope originating as a positive symbol of both sexual desire and immortality, both ways of warding off the ego-threatening dissolution of death.Rank has a lot of interesting material here, but he is so limited by his psychoanalytic framework that his few insights, after so many exhausting lists, seem superficial (Freud, in 'the Uncanny' is much more open and convincing). His methodology is wayward, and while never syntactically obscure in the manner of Lacan, it is often difficult to make out what he's saying intellectually."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Westerns - Cabin Gulch: A Western Story","review":"Cabin Gulch is the restored version of The Border Legion and has without a doubt the greatest of Zane Grey's villains--the blond beast, Gulden, whose way with women was a rope and a cave, the most vicious and depraved of the border bandits. And as in earlier works by Zane Grey this novel had undergone many editorial changes demanded by his publisher before they would print it. Things today which seem very tame indeed, but yet his editors felt did not belong in fiction, regardless of how historically accurate Zane Grey was being to actual events upon which this book was based. When Joan Randle decides to follow her 'boyfriend' Jim Cleve after he departs because of a quarrel she finds herself captured by this outlaw gang and held, only to find out Jim has joined them as well. (She had accused Jim of not being man enough to even be bad, so he sets out to prove her wrong.) Cabin Gulch is a fascinating look at what happens to men, I should say, mankind, when driven by their passions and left to revert to the barbaric when the environment is one of dog eat dog i.e. \\"survival of the fittest\\" a phrase used by Darwin and popularized by Zane Grey, as he subscribed to some of Darwin's theories, as seen in many of his novels as he expressed his philosophy of life, and concerns for America in his writings. But if one goes beyond any \\"hidden\\" agenda and reads this book as a novel of escapism and adventure and romance it is a good read I think you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Westerns - Cabin Gulch: A Western Story","review":"Since I am a fan of Zane Gray, this was a really good book to me. There was a part in the book where the main female character was raped. That was the first time I had read that type of violence in one of his books but it was a really good book. I am glad I got it."},{"Title":"Biography of a River: The Living Mississippi","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating book about the Mississippi river. Although it's written for schoolkids, as an adult I found it covered the material in an interesting and enjoyable way.

I recommend this book for anyone who cares about this country and the river that has contributed so greatly to the development of its interior."},{"Title":"Alicia Maldonado: A Mother Lost","review":"&#60;P&#62;August 25, 2004Based on a true story, Ardain Isma tells the turmoil surrounding one family forced to flee Havana, Cuba to escape political unrest during the Batista Regime of the 1940's.Miguel Maldonado along with his wife, Elena, and their two children, Mario, and Alicia settle in Haiti.The Maldonado's are wealthy real-estate owners and all adjust to this change except, Alicia. She is quite homesick and a loner who has trouble learning the language, as well as adapting to Haiti's diverse culture.Alicia and their neighbor's son, Richard, of mulatta descent become fast friends at a young age. Their friendship grows to love and they eventually marry. The mixed couple overcomes racial and cultural differences, and blessed with two daughters. Then Richard dies, and Alicia falls into a deep depression.Sometime later Alicia remarries a devout Haitian Military Officer, who is divorced with two children of his own. This blended family then has two additional children. But suddenly, Alicia is slapped in the face with her husband's infidelity. She is unable to come to terms with Georges unfaithfulness. Along with her youngest son, Jean-Marie, Alicia disappears without a trace.Twelve years go by, before fate intervenes, and Alicia is face to face with the family she walked out on.I thoroughly enjoyed this tear-jerking, tragic drama of life gone wrong by the choices we make.

Such is life, anywhere you put it, in the Caribbean or otherwise. Many people might have problems dealing with the material in this book. But it's involving, shocking, yet mellifluously elegant in its portrayal of a wealthy woman's humble and downtrodden existence. She cannot fathom the dark side of life, and in her pure yet misguided rebellion, she becomes a metaphoric symbol for humanity in general--not to mention impoverished, yet mysteriously happy.Professor Ardain Isma's excellent first novel painstakingly describes the fact-based life story of Alicia Maldonado, a young, aristrocratic white woman born in Cuba to a land-owning family, members of a seemingly elite class. Alicia arrives in Haiti with her parents and older brother Mario after fleeing Cuba, following the political turmoil within the Batista regime. But what she discovers there is that, in its own way, there is no such thing as fleeing. What her family left behind had to catch up with her slowly, surely, like a creeping plague of sophisticated reality that could only draw to a bad conclusion...She marries her next-door neighbor and best friend, Richard Laveaux, the son of a rich mulatto family, in spite of her mother's protests. The marriage is happy at first, and Alicia enjoys working for the family business and raising their two children. But the altogether too soon deaths of her father and her alcoholic husband raise questions in her mind about the sanity and purpose of her carefully kept upper-class existence.Was she really meant to be happy, or is something else, a mysterious fate much darker and deeper, in store for her?Unable to cope with her problems, Alicia leaves Haiti with her youngest child, Jean-Marie, and vanishes without a trace. None of her family or friends knows her exact whereabouts, and a prolonged and heated search for her begins. How does it ever end? How long must she suffer, and what happens?You must find out, by reading this gripping, poignant and sophisticatedly charming book--full of the flavor of the islands, the richness of the soil, and the death of all meaning.Review by Karen ColeExecutive DirectorRainbow Writing, Inc."},{"Title":"Alicia Maldonado: A Mother Lost","review":"As a child Alicia Maldonado moves from her native Cuba to Haiti and must learn a new language and a new culture. Alicia's brother Mario fits right in but Alicia has to work at it. Richard, the boy next door who is near her age, helps her with the transition. Richard's family is of the elite mulattos of the island and they aren't exactly happy about his association with the white Cuban girl, but neither is Alicia's mother thrilled to have her daughter associating so closely with a mulatto. In spite of their families' reservations, they grow up, marry and have two children. It should have been 'happily ever after' but since life seldom is, a number of unsettling situations occur and Alicia wonders what she has done to be the target of so many tragedies. Because she is unable to withstand the many blows that life delivers, she frequently goes into deep depressions. One of her moods leads her to life changing decisions that affect everyone around her.ALICIA MALDONADO: A MOTHER LOST is an interesting novel that gives a vivid picture of life among the elite and the middle class of Haiti. It also plunges us to the depths of despair and poverty with Alicia as she moves through her star crossed life. While it is well written, it lacks a certain tension and suspense that would keep the pages turning.Reviewed by alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Invitation To Love: 108 Reminders for the Enlightened Ones","review":"FOR MANY YEARS I HAEV BEEN A DEVOTEE OF THE TEACHINGS OF PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA.

It made me reminisce about what was great about growing up in the 80s in NYC, and it equally reminded me of the tragedies that came with it. The significant event in the life of Kemp Powers was a shooting, but so many of the struggles he faced, and the way he illustrated them, cause a reader who has never picked up a weapon to understand, to remember their own stories of life-altering, heart-rending moments that never leave you, that become part of your blood, that keep you awake at night and somehow drive you throughout life."},{"Title":"The Shooting: A Memoir","review":"I ran across this when I googled Kemp's name years back.

Although he does not end up doing any jail or juvenile time, he ends up paying for it psychologically for decades. It is obvious that Powers has played out the incident in his mind on an endless loop, going over the \\"what ifs?\\" thousands of times.Also, the imagery of his childhood growing up in New York City is fantastic. I never heard of this book before coming across it on Amazon and buying it because it was listed under used books for just a couple of cents. But it is by far one the best memoirs I've read, and I've read a lot. Even though I may have nothing in common with a black man from Brooklyn, it touched my heart, made me laugh, and made me cry.

Then I found this book in the public library, and it answered the need. In spades. It is a textbook, but like law school textbooks, it follows the case-study method, which I think is good. The author addresses not only the major categories of law--contracts, property, torts, criminal law and procedure, et al.-but also starts with an enlightening and useful chapter on the philosophical and historical underpinnings of the law. Showing that he is up to date, he includes chapters on administrative law and employment law, which I haven't seen in other books in this category. A useful book for any citizen trying to understand the American legal system.

These manuscripts were written by members of the primitive Christian Church who called themselves Gnostics. The Greek word 'gnosis' means knowledge, more specifically insight. Gnosis is synonymous with the term Spirit Baptism. The manuscripts were Coptic translations made about 1500 years ago of still more ancient manuscripts which had been written in Greek. It is opined by scholars that most of the original manuscripts were written between 120 150 A.D., however, some of them may even have predated the New Testament which is currently dated between 60 110 A.D. Thus the Gnostic Gospels, like the New Testament, are partially a recording of the primitive oral gospel. These texts are of major historical importance, particularly since they provide a very different view of Christ, his theology and of the early Church than the New Testament. And, it is well known that the New Testament documents were changed many times by early Church leaders. However, the Gnostic Gospels are completely uncensored. Shawn Patrick Thornton's riveting, In Defense of the Christ: Why Jesus would Disown Christianity, uses the uncensored historical data available from the Gnostic Gospels, as well as his own profound spiritual understanding, to reveal the Jesus that primitive Christians knew nearly 2000 years ago. If you have ever wanted to know the real Jesus this is the book. You will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"In Defense of the Christ: Why Jesus Would Disown Christianity","review":"(reprinted from my Ebooks-n-Bytes Review)With the current slew of fundamentalist Christian fiction filling the book market, it's a relief to find a book about Christ that doesn't rely on fire, brimstone, and Left-Behind grotesquerie to talk about the malady of theocon fundamentalism affecting American public life now.Thornton, in clear lucid prose (albeit occasionally marred by a spell-checker's error) explains the basic problems with the fundamentalist mindset, the experience of mystics, and just why references to hell are attributed even to someone as spiritually-awake as Christ must have been. And that's just in the first two chapters.It's obvious that Thornton has done his research; quotes from Christian, Buddhist, and other mystics (as well as godless heathens) pepper his work. It's also obvious that he's done some heavy thinking: his careful tracing of the difference between spiritual awakening, satori, and the persistent thread of ecstatic gnosticism in Christianity is just one instance. His assertion that all mystics are talking about the same thing and the success of a sacred text lies only in how well the mystic has communicated the ideas is so simple and clear as to be shocking to a nation lost in hysterical trumpeting public discourse based on obfuscation piled atop Biblical obfuscation.The only wrong note is Thornton's continuing insistence on the Twelve-Step program as a model of a system that promotes individual mystical experience. I've hung out with a lot of Twelve-Steppers, and it seems that the program is just as prone to fundamentalism as any other religion- Thornton's assertion that fundamentalism is indeed inherent in the human mind is jarring when compared to his touching faith in the Twelve Steps.This is not a scholarly critique of Christianity, it is a dedicated amateur's attempt to explain how something as beautiful as Christ's injunction to \\"love one another\\" could have gone so horribly wrong as to become a platform for intolerance and naked temporal power-grabs. In Defense Of The Christ manages to be a chilling indictment of the recent wave of fundamentalism because of its even, level, reasonable tone. The fact that Thornton never raises his voice to stinging invective only underscores the rabid frothing of fundamentalist literature.Thornton's last hurrah is a note on the problem of religious pluralism: Islam is incompatible with Christianity is incompatible with Buddhism, repeat ad infinitum; it is worth the price of the book itself just for its clarity of the basic problems for any seeker of spiritual \\"truth\\" and anyone wondering just how otherwise nice decent people can be yanked into cultlike fundamentalism. All in all, this is the type of dedicated intellectual and spiritual effort the Founding Fathers would have approved of--and the appendices, with their passionate calls for tolerance and their kalaidescopic range, are strangely satisfying even if a bit overwrought.Thornton should be proud of himself. In Defense of the Christ is the book I wish I could put next to every stinking pile of Left Behind offal, every shelf of Falwell hysterics and Purpose-Driven drivel. True spirituality requires more than the slavish following of the cult rhetoric of the day--it requires passion, thought, and independence, all three things Thornton's book possesses in abundance."},{"Title":"In Defense of the Christ: Why Jesus Would Disown Christianity","review":"This is a must read for anyone who wants a rundown on not only Christianity, but all religions.

The hallmarks of Taize services are simplicity, peaceful spirituality, and music based upon the chant styles of the Taize monastery in France. Founded in the aftermath of the second World War, Taize is dedicated to peace and ecumenical action.Taize music is both simple and sophisticated. Brother Roger, founder of Taize, seeks to add a prayerful element to music, and a musical element to prayer, believing firmly in the old dictum, 'those who sing, pray twice'.The songs of Taize are designed to be sung by those who have difficulty carrying a tune, as well as those whose training and background in music extends to high levels.This book contains fifty of the best Taize chants. Given the international outreach of Taize (it is a great pilgrimage site for people all over the world), the chants here are presented in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin and English. The Latin is not due to Catholic influence as much as it a shared language among many people's linguistic heritage while no longer being anyone's first language. Brother Roger reclaimed Latin as a language for the monastery so that no one \`living' language would claim a dominance over others.Prior to the fifty chants, there is a section on basic ideas of the Taize worship service or liturgy. Taize worship relies on psalms heavily, as well as periods of silence, Bible readings, and prayers. Some suggested psalms, biblical passages, and prayers are included, but other things may be used appropriately beyond the rubrics here. Preparation is important - not so much the physical preparation of the space (which should be kept as simple and meditatively conducive as possible), but also preparation of the spirit.The way Taize chants \`work' is that they are simple phrases and simple tunes that gradually reveal depth and sophistication by being repeated over and over. All chants presented in this text are put in multiple-part harmony (usually four-part), and some are marked to be done in rounds.This small book is a rich expression, wonderfully presented. According to Brother Roger, all who follow this journey of the spirit remain alongside other people, adding their prayers and voices together. \`They do not separate prayer and commitment.'"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Giovanni's RoomBy James BaldwinJames Baldwin! For me, writing his name sends joy and awe straight to my heart. I have loved him since I was a teenager and found him on a library bookshelf. I devoured as many of his novels as I could find and each was more than satisfying but when I found Giovanni's Room, I found what I had been searching for in my constant reading. A few pages into it and I felt that stab in the gut, that overwhelming rush that one gets when hearing an absolutely perfect piece of music or falling heart-first into a work of art. I know that it was the elegance of Baldwin's writing in this particularly elegant short novel that sent me head over heels in love with words.Giovanni's Room is a painful story of a young man in Paris who is uncertain and uncomfortable with his sexuality. Baldwin presents a complex series of events with an understated, brilliant use of character and dialogue that lead to the destruction of several characters. Baldwin wrote so very well (or I am so very dense) that it took several readings for me to understand that it was not merely a tale of repressed desires but also a cautionary tale of the cost to others of random, casual acts of selfishness and unkindness. I re-read it every few years. Baldwin died of cancer in December of 1987. I miss him, I really do. Each Christmas I choose a few friends and gift them with Giovanni's Room. It is a deep pleasure to hear their reactions to this author's soulful genius and it is my small way of sending my loving gratitude to James Baldwin.Sherry Harvey Podobnik"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"in this book. i am neither male nor gay, yet i identified with the main character. baldwin shows what it is like to leave america for europe looking for something, only to discover that you can neither find what you are looking for nor return home. his style is sparse, like hemingway, and like hemingway you can tell he knows what it is like to be an expat. this book touched me and i give it to everyone i know who is searching..."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"In this book, a white American, David, goes to Paris, meets the Italian Giovanni in a gay bar, leaves his girlfriend Hella....Will today's readers feel that David's self-hatred of his basically-gay identity (his &quot;internalized homophobia&quot;) is dated now--much like some say the 1968 play THE BOYS IN THE BAND is, for example? We're past such agonizing? But aha, major personal growth against the norms is always turbulent. Anyhow, I have loved this novel for 3 reasons: its Paris, its prose, and its psychology. PARIS: Baldwin vividly sketches in words that great city. Onion soup at 4 A.M. in dubious cafes....the indomitable concierge....the sweeping quarters....and the rest. PROSE: Baldwin's long sentences, preaching-inspired, roll and swell and flow on and redouble. And, PSYCHOLOGY: sure, the bleakness of David is &quot;pre-gay-lib,&quot; let alone pre-gay marriage plus parenting! But homophobia is not yet slain, is it. Plus, more universal is David's struggling with the major human issue of (as Baldwin said in ANOTHER COUNTRY) &quot;the life you have, you want, you think you want, you should want, and you think you should want.&quot; Today, more of us can sooner arrive at where David only started, in his first surrender to Giovanni and male love: &quot;With everything in me shouting No, yet the sum of me sighed Yes.&quot; Baldwin's unique portrayal of human emotions as risky, vulnerable, dubious--a great gift of his--energizes this novel for me; always has."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"One of my favorites novels of all time and perhaps the finest gay book ever written. This is the brilliant story of David, a closeted expatriate living in 1950s Paris whose world is rocked to its very foundations when he falls in love with bartender Giovanni. The spring affair ends in disaster, leaving both death and mournful regret in its wake. A driving narrative, numerous passages of incredible insight, poetry, vibrancy, and emotional gravity combine to make this pre-Stonewall classic a profound and unforgettable reading experience. Tragic and terrific!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"\\"Giovanni's Room\\" is unique among Baldwin's novels for its all-white cast of characters--a decision that, his letters revealed, worried Baldwin somewhat, fearing that his portrayals would not seem authentic. His concerns turned out to be baseless; both Giovanni and David are convincing characters whose magnetism and flawed idealism stand in sharp relief to the cynical, grimy atmosphere of the bars and rooms they inhabit.David is engaged to be married when his fiancee, Hella, travels to Spain to \\"find out\\" what she wants from life--and from David. He then meets Giovanni in a Parisian bar and their fate is sealed as soon as they enter Giovanni's tiny, claustrophobic room and its \\"outlines of clutter and disorder.\\" David's internal struggle begins immediately: \\"if I do not open the door at once and get out of here, I am lost. But I knew I could not open the door, I knew it was too late.\\"I've come to think of Baldwin's \\"Giovanni's Room\\" as the inverted (no pun intended) example of Forster's \\"Room with a View,\\" the book it oddly and inexplicably reminds me of. Although Baldwin is tragic where Forster is comic, the impossible coupling of stalwart David and carefree Giovanni echo the equally improbable pair of straitlaced Lucy and bohemian George. And in each novel, the foreign setting strips away David's and Lucy's inhibitions while it enhances Giovanni's and George's forwardness.Both books, too, deal with a typically nineteenth-century theme, pitting moral honesty and romantic love against what \\"proper\\" society expects of its members. David is expected to marry Hella, as Lucy is expected to marry Cecil, and the comic or tragic outcome of each novel is determined entirely by the sincerity of the choices made by its characters. In Baldwin's more modern version, however, the virtue of David and Giovanni's relationship and the (yes) innocence of their love cannot ultimately withstand the pressures of society and the strictures of David's upbringing, and, inexorably, the couple become as sullied as the \\"clutter and disorder\\" of Giovanni's room."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"\\"Giovanni's Room\\" by James Baldwin is a beautiful novel about the struggling sexuality of a young American expatriate, David.David is living in Paris, and while there, he meets Hella. David is quite determined to live a \\"normal\\" life, with wife, kids and all. But while Hella is away in Spain (\\"to consider David's proposal\\") David has an affair with the handsome Italian bartender, Giovanni.Although the time setting of this novel is in the 1950's, \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is a timeless novel, and anyone regardless of time-period, can easily identify with the different characters.Once I started reading this book, I found it almost impossible to put it down. Actually, I finished it in one long day...In the 1950'ies it wasn't easy to be neither gay nor black. The author James Baldwin was both. I think he was immensely brave to write \\"Giovanni's room\\", especially since he did so, in a time when it was hard to be either one, black or gay. Some of the other reviewers said that \\"if you are not paying a lot of attention you probably wouldn't even know that the book is about homosexuality\\" - not to be disrespectful, although Baldwin's writing technique in this book is impressive, I have a hard time understanding how one could possibly avoid picking up that the book is about homosexuality...Anyway, I think that \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is one of James Baldwin's best works, and I highly recommend the book!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I loved this book. It is one of the top ten gay and lesbian novels of all times. I was shocked to learn that Amazon was instituting a new anti-gay policy and censoring it from search lists. Hopefully people can still find this gem."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"One thing I'll say right off: This is a book that can require several breaks from the reader, simply because its well-written despair worms its way into your mind and stays there. It's not the book you should read on a relaxing vacation, on your birthday, the day before your wedding, when you've already had an awful day. Still, it is a book you should read, because of Baldwin's insights into his characters and their situations.David, the main character and narrator, is an emotionally stunted man without any direction in life, whereas Giovanni, his lover, is exhuberently emotional and, if not ambitious, seems to have a genuine optimism that ebbs and flows. We never know very many details about his life before meeting David, but a few revelations later in the novel give him more depth than he seems to originally have. Whereas David never has any convictions about the future, Giovanni is the one who wants them to stay together and find what happiness they can.One area of the novel in which Baldwin falls short is in his thoughts on the roles of women in relation to men, as expressed by Hella, David's girlfriend-mistress-fiancee (the variety of titles she is given further indicate David's indeciseveness). It is unclear whether Baldwin himself believes in Hella's opinions, but they come across as cliched and, frankly, somewhat whiny. They don't add much to the novel, except to contrast Hella with Giovanni, something that can be done in far less space.An interesting aspect of the novel is the question of how much of David's repression is due to his external circumstances, and how much is due to the ways he represses himself. It is definitely a combination of the two, but what exactly the combination is is the part of the novel that stays with you the most."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"My now-deceased cousin Charles was a gay painter who gave this book to me when I was 16. Back then I followed him around like his shadow, loving his stories of travel and lovers. I grew to travel and thought of how no matter where I went, I took me.James Baldwin's Giovanni's room, seems to be a story of this realization, of not being able to escape yourself; despite being in the free-est position you'll probably ever be in again. Too bad San Francisco wasn't up and running for a man in his position, back then. Nowadays the pilgrimage to self identity is the same by plane, and having lived in both Paris and Frisco, Paris (for me) is definitely the place to face oneself.James Baldwin's David seems to be fighting a demon that surfaced long before his sexuality came into question. Between the lines I'm seeing a portrayal of Mr. Baldwin's 1950's America as the P-envying society of self-hate that he has escaped. He arrives in America's parallel universe, Paris; a place where he is accepted without having to reinvent himself.I lived in Paris for 4 years. I went there with my pre-conceived notions, and was introduced to theirs. Being an American woman in Europe, men see you as the unfulfilled dame who has not been allowed to blossom. They see you as the accepting and unsatisfied victim of a cocky, selfish, binging male culture. They feel obliged to help you recover. to show that quality not quantity is the answer. finesse not excess.Baldwin's Giovanni's room is a book that makes me think, that the plague of identity issues, sexual, societal, etc., is a monster empowered by self-doubt, a parasite in which strength of character can only defeat. You are your own worst enemy."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"It's rare to find a book that so perfectly combines a powerful, compelling story and beautiful prose. James Baldwin blew me away with this tale of a young American man in 1950s Paris struggling to find his place in the world. Though it might sound trite-a young man's journey of self discovery-it is a unique story. It is safe to say that Giovanni's Room was my introduction to \\"queer fiction,\\" as my roommate calls it.Of course, I've read tons of books with homoerotic undertones and overtones (Nathaniel West and Hemingway, not to name names), but never a book explicitly about a relationship between two men. I say \\"relationship\\" and not \\"love affair\\" because the protagonist has a tragically impossible time fusing love with sex.He has his first sexual encounter with a boy while still very young and then shortly after he is engaged to woman. His fiance takes a trip abroad and leaves him to his own devices in Paris, which eventually lead him to Giovanni. Due in part to poverty, he begins living in Giovanni's Room. Their few months of time together is anything but blissful young love. Instead it is riddled with shame, anger, uncertainty, and even hatred. The protagonist cannot seem to figure out how to rectify the 1950s social constructions of manhood with homosexuality."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Very powerful writing.

Baldwin displays the mind of an individual reluctantly discovering a new piece of his identity. The work is thoroughly 'gay' insofar as it adopts an incredibly diverse personality. It seems impossible to say plainly what a gay man is, and Baldwin's narrative testifies to this impossibility. His narrator is observant, yet obscure.

The only way to truly enjoy this novel is to see past these surface level details to the true message, which simply tells us of passion and pain. The characters and subject matter are practically interchangable; the protagonist could be a black woman in love with a white man or a white woman in love with a black woman or a black man in love with a black woman. Baldwin must have known that love stories of all kinds must battle intolerance, conflict, struggle.

While a writer as great as E. M. Forster only skirted the surface of his homosexual feelings, Baldwin treats them with depth and clarity; indeed he makes the best case for the lifestyle since D. H. Lawrence in WOMEN IN LOVE with the Gerald/Rupert relationship. GIOVANNI'S ROOM goes much further of course, but in never becomes political as much modern literature does. Baldwin concentrates on the emotions, the painful beauty of love in its many forms, and the conflicts that become inevitable.

They strike up a friendship, and for financial reasons, he moves into Giovanni's tiny room. But, the friendship grows into something more, and David must decide which life he wants to lead.Throughout the novel, David is conflicted with his feelings of love, loathing and guilt for Giovanni. He loves Hella, too, but desparately wants to find out if her love is what he truly desires, almost willing her to save him. Author James Baldwin uses a very flowing style to permeate his novel with these emotions, allowing the reader to both sympathize and distrust Giovanni and David. One is strong and sure of himself; the other is fighting a battle in his head over what he feels.\\"Giovanni's Room\\" is one of the great novel dealing with someone coming to terms with his or her own sexuality and all the emotions associated with it. A truly fine novel."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I read Giovanni's Room for an English class at the college-level on the experience of foreignness. This has been one of my favorite classes and favorite teachers (not to keep beating on the word favorite, but maybe everything just came together really well?). We explored different ways of being foreign, first the more obvious - literally being foreign like being an immigrant, traveler, etc. Next, ways we could feel foreign, either by our personal interests or our political views.Giovanni's room was just beautiful. It was a story of a man who felt foreign in his own skin, and traveled half way across the world to escape himself, only to trap himself, unable to escape. In Giovanni's room, he is exposed but cannot face himself, destroying himself and those around him. Baldwin is poetic. rhythmic. violent, emotional. and excruciatingly beautiful.Revisiting the book again with the context of the author's background gives it another layer of complexity. Giovanni's room was published in 1956, during the post war era of social conformity. Baldwin, though black, writes exclusively about white characters experiencing sexual exploration. He himself left the US and went to Paris in 1948 due to American prejudice against homosexuals and blacks. In many ways, this novel has autobiographical elements."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Although advancing in its fifties, Giovanni's Room is a novel which does not get older, it only gets better. It still strikes the reader with the courage and opennes with which James Baldwin tackles his largely unspeakable (at the time of its writing) subject matter. The pains and tortures of search for sexual identity are rendered with real mastery and even if the ending may seem a bow to the demands of an age long gone, it only adds to the psychological truth of the novel. An absolute classic!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This is one of James Baldwin's best novel.

Baldwin was a double threat, both black and gay, and brave enough to write about what it was to be both, in a time when it wasn't fashionable to be either. A novelist, playwright, short story writer, and essayist, Baldwin wrote uncompromisingly of an America largely unrepresented in our literature. &quot;Giovanni's Room,&quot; is simply one of the most beautifully written works of fiction produced in the last century. It deals with a young man's conflicts over his homosexuality, his feelings of isolation, despair and grudging acceptance. That it reveals emotions and sentiments which have subsquently become all to familiar in our literature and yet remains as potent as when it was published forty-five years ago, is a tribute to the genius of Baldwin. Five stars are not be enough for this cherished work. God bless you Jimmy."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"It is a beautifully written work filled with powerful imagery.

It is a heartbreaking work."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"\\"Love him and let him love you.\\"A young American expatriate in Paris is torn between relationship with a woman and love affair with a man. Set in the 1950s, Giovanni's Room is a man's excruciating repentance, or rather reminiscence, of one particular lie among the many lies he has told in his life. Could it be the first love, or maybe his only love, because David has never for an instant truly forgotten his first love, Giovanni, and the thought of whom often gives a guilty lurch in his stomach. He feels in himself a faint, dreadful stirring of what so overwhelming stirs in him. He meets Giovanni at the bar while his girlfriend Hella vacations in Spain. But David is uneasy about this relationship that is no more than just a sexual escapade with Giovanni. A feeling of contempt and pique conquers him to an extent that fear and anguish have become the surface on which he slips and tumbles. Is David really confused as he claims to be? Or is he just afraid of being despised? He is on a constant struggle for social approbation that he will forfeit his Giovanni's love for him - maybe his love for Giovanni as well? He thinks being with Hella will rescue him from his love for Giovanni.At first I am not sure how much David cherishes Giovanni until he confesses his irrevocable love for him. That he will never be able to love anyone like he loves Giovanni intensifies his mental struggle with the forbidden love: What kind of life can two men have together? He keeps on fighting his life, fighting his love because he sees no prospect of a life shared by two men. Beneath this struggle for social acceptance is laden with a deep calling to abandon the conventional norms of success, worth, and love. He views this abject terror of desire with interminable cynicism and cruelty.Giovanni's Room explores the troubling emotions of man's heart with unusual candor and yet with dignity and intensity. It delves into the most controversial issue of morality with an artistry. The most touching and absorbing thing is Giovanni's unconditional love for David, whose fearful intimation opens in him a hatred for Giovanni that is as powerful as his love for him. This love for Giovanni has been meticulously suppressed, and is not recognized until the ineluctable separation, which compounds David's scruple. The loss compounds his regret of not confessing his love. Even though Giovanni is very fond of him already, Giovanni's affection and loyalty do not make him happy or proud, as it should. Aren't we all somehow like David? We always want to wait to make sure the feeling is right, but how can we be sure? To David Love can only be measured by the grief so inconsolable that is concomitant of his loss. To the rest of us it's a message to drop our ego for an ideal relationship."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Everything about this book made my mind spin in awe. The story, uniquely told through fluid &quot;flashbacks&quot;; the characters, especially the narrator; and the prose, that sang like poetry (and I am not a poetry person) were all placed perfectly in place.This is the first novel from Baldwin I have read, and it will definately not be the last. I can't remember ever reading a book where it is told not through flashbacks, but through memories tempted by anticipation of an event yet to come. I love that. It's not just a cold recollection, it's as though each scene was tinted with David's emotions about himself and about what will happen to Giovanni.At first, I was waiting for Hella's part to become apparent, but then I saw that she isn't what David is thinking about as he awaits the dawn. (Hey, sometimes I'm a little slow.) This could have easily been just a long inner monologue within one character, but it contributes the fascination and entertainment of a story.Wonderful.

I really knew very little about him or his style. All I knew was that he was an openly gay African American male who exiled himself in Paris during the 1950s. That's enough for me to be curious about what he has to say. (As an aside: those few one and two star reviews for this novel are given by readers who lack the curiosity to see the world from a perspective not their own--the exact opposite of what reading is meant to be about). Anyway, \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is perfectly compact and has a fluidity so smooth that reading it straight through is simple (being just under 180 pages helps too). But do not let the short length of this novel fool you. It is chalk full of emotional depth and wonderful detail. Baldwin's prose style is so lush, without being unnecessarily complicated. He creates complex, multi-dimensional characters with whom many readers can relate. Even the antagonists in the novel are given a certain level of humanity so that we can sympathize with their plights.This is not a gay book. This a story of heartbreak, regret, and the despair of not being able to be oneself. These themes are as timeless as Shakespeare. Vacillation between two separate parts of oneself (Hamlet). The desire to be with a forbidden love (Romeo & Juliet). Those who criticize this novel as simply a gay-themed book are missing the more human aspects that apply to us all. Don't be fooled by their false objections! Read this book."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"GIOVANNI'S ROOM was not James Baldwin's first novel; his debut came three years before with GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. Nor was it the first post-war novel to deal with homosexuality; Gore Vidal addressed the issue in 1948's THE CITY AND THE PILLAR.But Vidal, as good a writer as he is, is not a poet. And GIOVANNI'S ROOM is the work of a poet.Baldwin's writing is uncommonly beautiful. Even when dealing with the darkest of emotions and the most devastating of tragedies, his prose soars like an eagle above the usual form of the novel, giving the events a depth and meaning that, to my mind, most forcibly recall Tennessee Williams; it is a shame that none of Baldwin's novels or plays were ever filmed.The fairly simple story concerns David, an expatriate American in Paris, aged about twenty-seven or so and somewhat of a drifter. He is involved with a young woman named Hella, whom he has asked to marry him; at the start of the story, which is told in flashback, Hella is off traveling in Spain, considering David's proposal, which despite the appearance of importance she is giving it, has a hollow ring to it.While Hella is gone, David, needing money, becomes involved in the homosexual world of Paris. He does not go so far as to have sex with any of the men, but he learns quickly how to use them to get the money that his father keeps refusing to send him from the States.One night, with one of these acquaintances, a middle-aged businessman named Jacques, David goes to a bar owned by Jacques's friend Guillaume, and meets the new barman, a beautiful young Italian named Giovanni. The two young men hit it off extremely well; without revealing too much, suffice it to say that the evening ends in Giovanni's room, in his bed.The remainder of the novel deals with David's inner turmoil over the fact that he has fallen head-over-heels in love with Giovanni, a love, though this is not said directly, much deeper than whatever it is he feels (felt?) for Hella. Later on, naturally, Hella returns to Paris, and David, afraid to face Giovanni, simply abandons him and takes up with Hella at her hotel.The inevitable happens, and Giovanni and Hella eventually meet on the street. Giovanni is with Jacques, and they invite David and Hella out for a drink. Hella, perhaps sensing something, begs off on the grounds that she does not feel well. David takes her back to her hotel.The following evening, David returns to Giovanni's room and attempts to explain to him why he must make his life with Hella, but at this point it is obvious that he is trying to convince himself.The novel turns tragic after David and Giovanni separate forever. Giovanni commits a murder and is sent to the guillotine; David and Hella rent a house in the south of France, but inevitably, one night, David disappears and takes up with a sailor. Hella tracks him down and finds him, very drunk, with the sailor, in a gay bar. Embittered, she leaves for the United States almost immediately. David, who appears to be planning to stay in Paris, leaves the house and goes to the bus stop to wait for the bus to the train station.I don't know to what extent David's self-loathing mirrored Baldwin's, or if Baldwin felt that way at all, but the really remarkable thing is that all of the people in this novel, American, French, and Italian, are white, yet Baldwin, who seems to have had an almost musical ear for dialogue, speaks in all these different voices with amazing accuracy and precision.This is an astonishing work of art. To describe it as a novel about homosexuality is to trivialize it. It is a deeply human story about people with flaws, and how these flaws sometimes can be our undoing."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"It is a shame that James Baldwin is so overlooked by the younger generations of readers. There is no parallel to the brilliance in his work and his writing style that is literary and thought provoking. \\"Giovanni's Room\\" packs a tremendous emotional punch with its narration of David, an American living in Paris during the 1950's. David's journey is the slow acceptance of his sexuality, as he carries on a relationship with the Italian bartender, Giovanni, while David's fiance, Hella, is abroad in Spain.This novel has withstood decades of censorship on gay literature and we benefit from it. Baldwin takes on sexuality with grace and patience as we watch the narrator battle his own inner demons. Very early on, David tells us that he knows he is at fault for the suffering of those around him and that Giovanni will be will be executed on the guillotine the next morning. David then takes us back into his history with Giovanni and their life in the small room he rents. As the story unfolds, we watch as David creeps into the subculture of Paris, dependent on the money of his wealthy friends who loiter in the gay underground. Yet, there is a sense of contentment from the narrator with his new surroundings, though he does not openly admit to it. He sees his sexuality and his involvement in this \\"forbidden lifestyle\\" as a temporary one and then that fragile stability is shattered when Hella finally returns.This book is a treasure that accurately documents one person's journey in self-discovery and questions the lines between love and desire.

To be honest, I never realized this on my own - someone else told me. This is proof of the greatness of James Baldwin, he created characters, scenarios so commonplace that there was a modicum of relativity on every level of the story. He treated the situations and problems in Giovanni's Room as everyday happenstance - because they were and because they are. To deny this fact is like denying that there is air and earth and sky. No matter how unique an obstacle is for the characters Baldwin created - they are still the reality of the world in which they inhabit.

The only way to truly enjoy this novel is to see past these surface level details to the true message, which simply tells us of passion and pain. The characters and subject matter are practically interchangable; the protagonist could be a black woman in love with a white man or a white woman in love with a black woman or a black man in love with a black woman. Baldwin must have known that love stories of all kinds must battle intolerance, conflict, struggle. And the fact that he was able to tell this particular love story in a &quot;foreign&quot; voice with such authenticity is one more indication of his presence as one of the most important authors of this century."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"i love givannis room so much, james baldwin writes a story that is short and compact, but oh so good.

Yet in writing this work, Baldwin deliberately ignored one aspect of himself---blackness. The protagonist here is free to espouse his sexuality, but this freedom stems in part from the fact that he is white and does not suffer the burdens that being black *and* gay would create for him. Baldwin's protagonist can roam around Europe with his educated and affluent friends, and he doesn't suffer the condemnation for betraying his race that many black gays face from the black community. He doesn't face rejection from families versed in intolerant Southern Baptist traditions. He doesn't face the racism within the overwhelmingly white gay community that often leaves black gays out as undesireables. In writing a book that gets praised by the (white) gay world, Baldwin chose to ignore the very different pains that confront black gays. In a work thatis purportedly about freedom to be oneself, Baldwin's wilfull ommission of the race issue is dishonest."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I had heard a lot of hype about this novel, but it just didn't live up to it. I have to say that I agree with the reviewer who said that this book gets praise because the characters are white. While Baldwin does deal with some fundamental relationship issues, his knowledge of audience -to be blunt-- believing that only white gays read books in the 50's- leaves the book hollow at it's core. I was always told that great literature comes from finding the universal in the specific, and Baldwin can't find the specific here because he is too afraid to present inner thoughts that could have lifted this novel up.To the other reviewer, color does have a lot to do with Baldwin's literature, and it does influence his writing. I am an amatuer Baldwin scholar, and I know his workd well, race should have been in this book. The fact that it is absent here, to me, says that his heart was not fully in this novel, only his head. And that's not great literature."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I had to read this book for class, otherwise I would have thrown it in the trash.

Such is the case of opening the cover of James Baldwin's inimitable, cherished novel GIOVANNI'S ROOM. Baldwin died in Paris in 1987 after gifting us with great novels and strong social commmentary. It is only fitting to return to the Paris of this wonderfully rich novel when the need to reflect on how writers of stature had the courage to begin the genre of novels dealing with same sex relationships in a manner of pure literature.GIOVANNI'S ROOM is a fluid, nonlinear exploration of alienation: the narrator is living in Paris (having escaped the US with the smilingly shallow American image descried by Parisians), heads toward a &quot;comfortably normal courtship/engagement&quot; with a very normal fellow American girl also living in Paris/Spain, and quite by accident encounters his repressed sexual self when he meets Giovanni, an expatriated Italian. The subcultures Baldwin details are palpably present on every page - many characters seem like enemies until their roles in the journey of these two men unfold and clarify. The title of the book is well chosen: Giovanni's room which he shares with David our narrator is claustrophobic, unkempt, dour, and threatening - an apt description of the mental environment this stumbling act of finding a new type of love creates. Baldwin lets us know from the start that we are entering a doomed affair of the heart and it is this atmospheric, eloquently written memoir that adds to the sense of the inevitable isolation that makes this a great novel.Enough cannot be said about the beauty of Baldwin's prose, the richness of his terse description of the city of Paris, his uncanny ability to paint characters that are wholly three-dimensional. This book merits frequent re-visits. It is a rare vintage wine."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin's _Giovanni's Room_ (1956) is a challenging work of literature that explores a summer in the life of an expatriate named David who is living in Paris after World War II. David must come to terms with his own contradictory desires. David's life in Paris in the 1950s--where homosexuality, while not illegal, is stigmatized--affords him a certain amount of space to discover what he wants and what he can accept. His dilemma, on the surface, can be stated simply: he is passionately in love with a young Italian man, Giovanni, yet he is also engaged to Hella, an American woman with whom he can live, on the surface, a \\"socially acceptable\\" life. On a deeper level, the novel is a study of the loneliness that comes with an absence of self-acceptance.David shares many characteristics with Ernest Hemingway's young, expatriate anti-hero Jake Barnes in _The Sun Also Rises_. In David, Baldwin has created a character who remains, ostensibly, detached from the world, which lends to his anti-hero a veneer of invincibility and hard assurance. There are a number of passages, especially intimate scenes, described from a mechanical third-person point of view. Giovanni at one point asks David, \\"Do you know how you feel? Do you feel? What do you feel?\\" to which David replies, \\"I feel nothing now, nothing.\\" David's inability or unwillingness to be honest about his feelings, however, undermines his relationships with others and his sense of self, and ultimately leaves him profoundly alone.The novel suggests, more hopefully, that the loss of innocence, if accepted, can be the beginning of a journey that leads to knowledge. The novel takes place as a flashback over the course of one evening in a rented house in the south of France before David will take a train back to Paris the next morning. Drinking by himself in the large, empty house and looking at a window, David recalls this statement from an acquaintance named Jacques: \\"Nobody can stay in the Garden of Eden.\\" This is an idea which frames the novel and perhaps offers David one way to understand his life.A few final notes: The final paragraph of the novel is incredible, suggesting how actions, despite our most earnest hopes when we have erred, stay with us. All of the descriptions of Giovanni's room are artistic and reflect David's psychology. The novel portrays a cruel side of Paris (a characteristic, I think, which all large cities share to some degree), where lives on the margins are often bought and sold, and where there can be a calculated indifference to suffering.This is a riveting work of literature that has many levels of meaning."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin is, without a doubt, one of the most eloquent and talented authors that I have ever been exposed to. In his novel, Giovanni&#65533;s Room, Baldwin explores the struggle between a man and his sexuality. Torn between his feelings for another man and another woman, we are taken through David&#65533;s journey of joy, love, anger, pain, and confusion. Through secrets and lies, the story unfolds, teaching that there are no excuses when it comes to real love.This is by far one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. Each sentence leaves you with a good taste in your mouth. Baldwin&#65533;s passion and power in writing is proved clearly all throughout the book. His word choice and sentence development is absolutely wonderfully printed, that each page simply flows one after the other. His ability to develop and express each character&#65533;s thoughts keeps the reader wholly engaged; feeling attached to their personal dilemmas. At the end of the book, you are left with the feeling of complete satisfaction. Although this is a story of a gay man&#65533;s struggle, it is a story that affects everyone regardless his or hers sexuality. Everyone who has ever been found in a conflict with themselves will discover that this book will touch the hearts, leaving the longing to come in touch with their true self. Anyone who has been caught between desire and morality will relate and find that this book captures the genuine feelings of that difficult and tense struggle."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Foremost, Giovanni's Room is beautifully written. Baldwin writes incredibly well.It would be a mistake to see this book as singularly about homosexuality (and to either read it, or not, because of that alone). Baldwin explores universal problems using a specific character and context.What's most impressive is the way he describes, and then captures the consequences, of the moral dilemma. Though the context is homosexuality, I think similar conflict happens all too often, especially in relationships. You think you should be one thing or feel one way, and everything in your social, religious, intellectual voice tells you're right - except how you deep down feel. Baldwin has this one line about how hard it is to say &quot;yes&quot; to life. In that passage, I think he refers to how hard it is to reject your conventional self and embrace your deep down feelings. And this conflict could be about anything.Then, too, Baldwin shows how, the stronger you love someone who provokes such internal conflict, the stronger your own self-hatred and hatred for that person. How terrible to most want to hurt the person you most love."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best literary works I have ever read! &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot; is all about a young American expatriate named David who finds himself torn between his fiancee Hella and an Italian bartender named Giovanni.

Narrated in the first person singular, this novel is deep and dark, making the reader feel the David's emotions and passions.David, who moved to France like many young Americans after the World War II, to pursue the freedom within the artistic atmosphere and the traditions of the Old World, found in fact the side of himself he did not expect to uncover.Starting the story at the point of total exhaustion, on the verge of madness, just about to leave the South of France for Paris again (and then, perhaps, finally to return to the States - although the ending is open in this respect) David recollects his relationship with Giovanni, an Italian barman whom he met on the night while searching for money to pay his hotel bill (or for another accommodation). When Hella, David's girlfriend, travels in Spain trying to organize her thoughts far from David and get to know herself better in solitude, David decides to ask Jacques, a man he knew casually, for money. Jacques invites him for dinner and then they end up going for a couple of drinks to the gay bar. Jacques is a friend of the owner, Guillaume, and they abandon themselves in a conversation, although Jacques clearly fancies the young barman. When two older men leave them alone, David and Giovanni immediately feel attracted to each other and by the morning they go together to Giovanni's room, where David subsequently moves. Guillaume, who gave Giovanni the job in hope to win the boy's heart, is very jealous; Jacques is also a bit upset, but both of them hope that the relationship won't last.Well... the relationship does not last, and this is the information revealed at the very beginning of the novel. David is, all in all, a disagreeable character (another novel in which the main character is not likeable, yet evoking sympathy in the reader because of his complexity and misery, and certainly possessing some charm, which he uses without scruples), who acts egoistically and opportunistically, but also according to convention. By being selfish and cruel to those who love him, he destroys not only them, but also himself. He cannot accept his love for Giovanni, because he fights his gay tendencies (he cannot even think about himself as gay and always tries to distinguish himself from \\"old fairies\\" like Guillaume and Jacques), but when he finally gives in, it is too late to rescue the relationship. Here lies, for me, the universal message in the story: what happens if by our own silliness, mistake, carelessness, or hard-headedness, whatever, we lose the love of our life and, worse, have an utterly destructive influence on him or her?Giovanni is a great character, he is a complete opposite of David - he follows his instincts to the point of abandoning himself in them, at the same time doing it completely unconsciously - he is convinced that he acts very rationally and has reasonable plans for the future. When David leaves him upon Hella's return to Paris, Giovanni loses all the grip onto reality and that leads to the tragedy.Hella, the only significant female character in the novel (except marginal, although complex, Sue, who is another person in the collection of people used by David) is also very interesting - basically, David treats her exactly the same as he treats Giovanni, but she is much more down-to earth and with typical American self- control manages to get back on her feet.The story takes place in Paris, the protagonist breathes the existentialis atmosphere, wandering in the narrow, old streets during the night. His desperation does not prevent him from perceiving the beauty of the city, but at the same time the city adds to his melancholy. In a different setting the story would undoubtedly be different, and so the novel seamlessly connects its time, place and plot.James Baldwin created a remarkable novel, full of introspective, universal questions that never get outdated. He managed to write about the problems, which at his time were rather hidden and unspoken. Very subtle prose and concise form round up the list of \\"Giovanni's Room's\\" qualities. This is the first book by this author I have read and I will definitely try more."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin's novel is a timeless, classic work. Everytime I read this novel I find new things and I fall in love with the book all over again. It is my favorite novel, period. For me the Paris that Baldwin writes about is not that far away from contemporary gay society. It is amazing how much has changed for the community while men (although not all) have remain mostly the same. There are certain parts of this book that will always remain with me, the shift in the narrative from present day to past memory, cental character, David's experimentation and later rejection of his friend Joey, David's first meeting with Giovanni, and the white, paint smeared window in Giovanni's room that separated two men in love from world that was not yet beginning to understand. In closing, I can't say enough how much I recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Giovanni's Room is my first taste of James Baldwin's brilliance. In less than 200 pages it transports the reader to 1950s France and tells of a complex love triangle between two men, one Italian and one American, and an American woman (who is 'off stage' most of the time touring Spain). What elevates Giovanni's Room beyond the realm of a soap opera or trite gay fiction are its brilliant prose (Mr Baldwin seemingly cannot write a bad sentence), terrific characterizations (especially of the troubled Giovanni and his pathetic 'friends'), and its ability to capture the atmosphere of Americans living in 1950s Paris (..it reminds me of Patricia Highsmith's latter 'Ripley' mystery novels). The book is sad and uncompromisingly honest.Bottom line: WAY beyond sterotypical gay fiction. Giovanni's Room is by any standard fine literature. Compulsory."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin's stories are more like poetry, describing painful circumstances as dreamy metaphors. I felt myself pulled away from the story a few times to ponder what Baldwin is expressing through this story, for example he writes something about not choosing your friends or who you love, just as you don't get to choose your parents. He forces you to stand in the shoes of each character, feeling as though you were naked, because the message, for me at least, is clear. If people would allow themselves to feel total honesty with themselves, then perhaps the way they are choosing to live their lives would be completely, way over on the opposite end of the spectrum then what is actually real. No sexual orrient, race, religion. Just looking inside yourself and saying &quot;yes&quot;. And if you think I'm just getting to romantic over a story, still read this book. James Baldwin is a master at story telling. Even if you don't feel as I do about this book, I'm sure you'll feel something. It is, for me, one of those stories you thin kabout long after you've read it."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Picked up the book in a shop in Paris.

This time around it struck me as a tad overwrought, but still a wonderful book. It's certainly one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. The prose just flows gracefully along like a Brahms Intermezzo. Baldwin captures the anguish of a man struggling with his sexuality and the impact that has on others beautifully. His insights into human nature are keen. Despite being written in the 50's when homosexuality was quite taboo, the book has aged remarkably well and in no way feels dated. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"The story of a man's attempt to avoid coming to terms with his passion and the inconvenience it represents. Love and guilt, sex and death. The writing could not be more beautiful and accurate in places, tho it does have a slightly slow beginning.

The book was not simply written for homosexuals. It was written to open our eyes to the possibility that perhaps, like David, we are repressing our feelings out of fear. I walked around in a daze after completing it. Baldwin had a truly amazing gift to be able to convey those emotions through his characters. For anyone who has not yet picked up this book, I strongly recommend, better yet, I strongly advise you to let yourself fall into Baldwin's world."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"First, ignore the review on the Amazon page from \\"The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature\\". What a horrible review! While it is not really negative about the book, it makes the book sound so sterile and boring!If you want to see what really great writing is like, try out Giovanni's Room. This was my introduction to James Baldwin and now I'm a huge fan. While I read the book because it was a groundbreaking early gay novel, I love it because it is an intriguing story and beautiful book. Baldwin's characters are so real you really can share their emotions, feel their pain, and experience their turmoil. You can certainly find more progressive gay stories out there, but for the 1950's, this was daring and new."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I had never read any of Baldwin's books before, and when I friend recommended this one to me, I hesitated.

It is a love story that takes place within the shattered confines of the human spirit. We are taken on a literary journey that can be both insightful and heartbreaking at the same time.

Yes he is black, but the book talks about a man who is a disappointment to himself and his surroundings, a man who discovers himself to be different, he wasn't born different. This book might as well be a buildungsroman, only we don't see any development or acceptance or even rejection! We just see a man who appears to be absolutely normal, aspires to have the American dream, and intentionally qualified unlike many black people at such times, yet we discover that even the seemingly mainstream population is in fact not so American! I think having a white protagonist did serve a very significant role and I think Baldwin wrote it beautifully!My book is marked on a paragraph I tend to reread often, it talk about the garden of Eden, the flaming sword, remembrance and forgetfulness! How can you say this book is not beautiful!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Although this was a book I read in one stretch, I had mixed feelings about the story after the last page. One of the striking things about the book was how recognisable the characters still are. The story is written in 1956, about the Paris gay scene of 1953. The story I read was about Amsterdam 1999.The main thing that bothered me was the main character. David is a guy who has the power to transmit to everyone around him a sense of defeat and purposelessness. He is an emotional parasite, who flourishes by draining out of Giovanni and Hella the vitality that both are trying to preserve with difficulty.In a certain way, I feel that the story should not have been told the way we read it. David (the main character) is a writer. He emotionally destroyed the two people closest to him. And instead of hiding out in shame, he tells us every nasty detail of it."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This is a story that maybe a little controvercial to some, but nevertheless it is such an EXCELLENT book!The story takes place in paris during a time when most blacks were in the US and few vendured outside the US. The twists and turns of the sexuallity context is handeled BEAUTIFULLY by means of letting the reader know but not know. The character ultimately is drawn between the woman and the man in his life and is frankly confused.Without giving too much away, the book just keeps your attention and has you drawn in so much that you want to complete the book in one sitting....Now that's what a book should do!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I liked the story, although it seemed more like the outline to a great novel yet to be written. It was just too short. The only thing I didn't like was the sudden strange ending that was unrelated to the relationships between any of the main characters."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"David is an American living in 1950's Paris, trying to flee from bad memories of home with his father. He has a finac&eacute;e Hella, who has just left for Spain to make sure that she is ready to wed David. While she's away, David allows his urges to take him to one a gay bar, where he meets Giovanni, a young, Italian bartender. They strike up a friendship, and for financial reasons, David moves into Giovanni's tiny room.Throughout the novel, David is conflicted with his feelings of love, loathing and guilt for Giovanni and for his own homosexuality. He loves Hella, too, but desparately wants to find out if her love is what he truly desires, almost willing her to save him. Author James Baldwin uses a very flowing style to permeate his novel with these emotions, allowing the reader to both sympathize and distrust Giovanni and David. One is strong and sure of himself; the other is fighting a battle in his head over what he feels. This creates one of the better novels dealing with someone coming to terms with his or her own sexuality."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Giovanni's Room was an excellent book about how society affects peoples lives.

I had thought of suicide when I was much younger, as, possibly, we all have, but then it would have been for revenge, it would have been my way of informing the world how awfully it had made me suffer. But the silence fo the evening, as I wandered home, had nothing to do witht hat storm, that far-off boy. I simply wondered about the dead because their days had ended and I did not know how I would get through mine.&quot;That, readers, sucks the marrow of life more so than many novels you'll come across in our short stay on this planet.

GIOVANNI's ROOM has established itself as an important queer novel. First published over 40 years ago, it captures the life of an expatriate, David, in Paris, and reveals his transformation. His transformation is multilayered, a complex and dynaic affair, yet the most obvious, and arguably, important one, is his sexual metamorphosis--brought about by Giovanni. The relevance of this novel is that most of us can empathize with David's struggle. How could we not? Balwin's words are rich and compelling. It lifted me from my reality into David's, and by the end of the novel (the last two sentences, I've read 1000 times), I felt like I knew exactly what David had gone through, because I was there with him, and because I'd been there in my own life as well."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I have always found James Baldwin's novels to be incredibly boring and extremely over-worded. It's nice to have a change; I actually enjoyed this book. Once I started it, I found it almost impossible to put it down. This is a great book for anyone who is struggling with sexuality, identity, lost love, or just everyday problems. Even though the time setting is in the 1950's, anyone, in any time period, can relate to the lives of the characters in this novel. I myself found a link between my life and the life of the main character, David. We both were trying, in vain, to escape a terrible past (rather a past that seemed terrible in our own eyes) only to have it come back later on in our lives. For David, it was his struggle with figuring out his true sexual identity. It seems that in Paris, where the novel is set, people are more accepting of the whole gay/lesbian &quot;conflict&quot; than we (should I even say &quot;we&quot;?)Americans are. A huge percent of the American population is either gay/lesbian/bisexual or confused about their sexuality. It's a shame that we, as Americans, can't accept people for what they are. Sexuality has nothing to do with the character of a person, it's just the lifestyle they choose. This book will help anyone (well, anyone with an open mind anyway) understand that anyone can fall in love with anyone - no matter what sex - at any given time. Don't read the book just because it's about &quot;gay people&quot;; read it because you need some directions and/or guidelines in finding out who you really are and what you really want in life."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Not what i expected it was not in very good shape with pages falling out. stains of some sort on the cover. not worth what i paid."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This novel capture the style of a European novel, and deals with both American and European characters.

Baldwin exposes the strife immanent in love between men which is as pertinent today as it was when he wrote this piece mid century past.

Many of us praised the writing and thought that it was far superior to the story, while others liked both the characters and the story, as well as the writing. Clearly, James Baldwin is admired for his precision, his observations, and his ability to create characters, situations, and realistic dialog. Baldwin is able to express complex emotions with contradictory feelings: \\"This fearful [expression of love from Giovanni] opened in me a hatred for Giovanni which was as powerful as my love and which was nourished by the same roots.\\"The structure of the novel is perfect. Baldwin starts us out in a house in the South of France as his former fiancee Hella is headed back to America and Giovanni is in jail awaiting his execution. We then alternate between meeting Jacques and Giovanni, the early story of David (the narrator), David's relationship with Hella, Giovanni's early story, how it all fell apart with both Hella and Giovanni, and David's presence in the house in the South of France.Themes of imprisonment appear throughout the novel, in Giovanni's cell as well as David's feelings toward both Giovanni and Hella. We also noted that the Europeans of 1950's in the novel were still impoverished after the war and thought that all the Americans were rich.After initially questioning Baldwin's choice in making David a blond white guy, we agreed that making him black would over-complicate the story.There was some disagreement on the growth of the characters. Some thought that the characters were strong and well thought out. But others thought that David remains tightly wound and does not learn to love and appreciate others, while Giovanni inexplicably goes from being a popular outgoing bartender to a whiny house-husband at the same time that Hella goes from being a free-spirited tourist to a stick-in-the-mud \\"Miss Clueless.\\"But our biggest discussion, however, surrounded the period when the novel was written. The novel is not dated (any more than Shakespeare or Dickens is dated) but \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is definitely a product of when it was written. The only sex scene is an anonymous \\"straight\\" pick-up between David and Sue, a woman from Philadelphia, which goes bad almost immediately but continues until everyone is unhappy. None of the gay characters are happy and, as the period demanded, a few of the obvious characters are old queens in the bar, one unhappy gay man is a murderer, another abusive gay man is murdered, and all the others are left lonely and unhappy."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Some notes:For gays interested in this book: I think Giovanni's Room is best for people who have been out for a while. It comes off as oddly homophobic for a novel written by a gay man, and based on a gay relationship.I'd rate it GAY-MA (for mature gay audiences). But then again, what the heck, it's a good book.For everyone: it's an excellent forbidden-love romance novel that is accessible to a wide audience. If like Baldwin, this book is a must-read. If you're not familiar with him, I suggest reading his short story called \\"Sonny's Blues\\" found here: [...], you'll probably fall in love with this writer after that"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"A deeply felt and personal short novel about an American ex-patriot who falls in love with another man in Paris. Baldwin establishes an undeniable tension between David's desire for Giovanni and his desire to live a normal life with his fiancee. There are many quiet and subtle moments in 'Giovanni's Room' that are as good as the best sections in early Hemingway. In a way this novel is more personal and reflective than Baldwin's much esteemed 'Go Tell it On the Mountain,' though it clearly does not have the same political involvement with race relations as the latter does. As always, Baldwin's dialogue is largely impeccable, weaving seamlessly from colloquial interactions, to French, to formal and reserved English. Truly a fine literary achievement."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"The first book I ever related to, Giovanni's Room tells the story of a man struggling to come to terms with his own inside self. The room from which we get the title, the barman Giovanni's room, comes to symbolize the gay life, the gay world. Through this book, the title character is grappling with whether or not he wishes to remain in this room, this world, or whether he needs to conform to what is expected of him by mainstream society. As a gay man, I can honestly say it is a struggle we all go through, and Baldwin captures all the nuances of this very hard decision with great feeling and an amazing eye for detail."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Oh, the boredom of reading these reviews by people who don't understand fiction. Ok, I'll try to explain it for you all. James Baldwin was a &quot;fiction&quot; writer. Understand? FICTION. He can write about whatever he wants. He doesn't have to have characters that are exactly like him: black. That is the joy of fiction.The writer can tell stories about anyone at anyplace at anytime. One person in this list of reviews said Baldwin wasn't being true to himself. Oh, please, get a grip. Every book doesn't have to be an autobiography. Do you know what that is? An autobiography is a non-fiction book that chronicles the author's life. Giovanni's Room is fiction, remember that. It's a great book.

The characters, each and every single one of them, are as real as anybody today in the 21st century. The emotions described in the book are so real and vivid that the novel rarely reads like a novel. A touching story, sharp social commentary, and a very vivid view of what homosexuality was like back in the 1960's in Paris."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"'Giovanni's Room' has the aching ring of truth and personal experience, and is written in sentences so beautiful and well-crafted that the novel seems more like poetry than prose. Baldwin's imagery is deep, subtle, and multi-layered -- one can honestly dig into this novel for days and weeks and come up with reams of symbolism and deeper truth even beyond the beautiful and poignant surface story. This is what makes the book a timeless classic and great masterpiece, rather than simply a well-written story of forbidden love.One example, out of many: Upon my second reading (like many, I've read this gem a half dozen times), I noticed the colors in which the story is written. It is painted in many and various and deep shades of grey -- like a great charcoal \\"painting,\\" or a black & white photograph of a rainy day. In terms of great novels, 'Giovanni's Room' for me is actually one that uses some of the darkest greys.Yet the dark greys are punctuated by a brilliant light, and the light comes from the character Giovanni. From the first moment that the protagonist David meets Giovanni, time stops and the world is set ablaze as from the brightest of suns. It's remarkable sensing the great shafts of light that Giovanni represents, in the midst of the greying darkness around him and around David.And since -- as the perspicacious reader will notice upon a deep examination of the book -- Giovanni represents, on a symbolic level, David's homosexuality, one can see that his true sexual orientation is the source of light and life in David's existence, and that to deny that is to cut off his light, his source of life and happiness."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"What a beautifully written book! I read it for my book club. I had heard of James Baldwin, but had never read anything of his before. I loved the depiction of Paris - the sleazier, decadent life underneath the beauty, and the depiction of the bars and the sad characters that Giovanni hung out with. The depiction of the main character's feelings for Giovanni and for his fiancee were just amazingly written - some of the best writing about feelings of love that I have read - the positive and negative.

When I read Baldwin's works, I am not as swept away by the struggles of race or gender as I am by the genius of his writing. Baldwin was primarily seen as a social commentator for his time, place and circumstances, but he was more lurid, in my opinion, in his observance and narrative of the human condition and struggles of us all. This novel is stunning, candid and beautiful. Baldwin has delicately placed each word to give us a lasting sensation of literary satisfaction."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"No assistance or convincing is required for one to acknowledge that Baldwin is indeed a very gifted writer. However, in GIOVANNI'S ROOM, it is less evident as to whether or not he is a great novelist. While his ability to describe complex emotions and deeply depict the political nature of courting and romance is superior, the plot suffers as the book progresses. Giovanni is an incredibly charming and likeable character upon his introduction; however, as soon as he forms a relationship with David, the protagonist, there seems to be a shift in the development of his character (or is it a regression of his character?), after which he remains rather unlikable and someone for whom you do not feel empathy.As a result, the romance between Giovanni and David suffers throughout the book - and the capriciousness of David's sexuality calls into question the legitimacy of his love for Giovanni. This is disappointing to readers who are looking for a love story - even a tragic one. For who wants to read a love story where the love isn't assured? I think the plot needed more time to allow the reader to fully accept and digest the magnitude that these two men, supposedly, feel for each other.The ending of the book, including the crime that Giovanni commits, seems irrelevant and forced - as if Baldwin was merely trying to come up with a legitimate way to end the story. This is perhaps my biggest complaint with the book. Again, the plot moves too quickly while characters change dramatically, all of which lead the reader to feel as though the plot is implausible.Finally, the book is littered with various French phrases and short sentences which add no substance to the book, but seem to exist merely as a way for Baldwin to flex his knowledge of the language - as if somehow this will give the story's setting extra legitimacy (which it didn't need). I have a background in French and was able to understand most of this superfluousness, yet still found it rather annoying and distracting.Many have suggested that David is rather unlikable; personally, I find his character to be the most honest and authentic, as well someone to whom I can relate. Through David, Baldwin hits the nail on the head when depicting the complexity and despair homosexuals feel when they are simultaneously involved with partners of both sexes. And while the honesty of David's emotions, with respect to both Giovanni and Hella, may be unattractive to some readers - it's clarity and accuracy cannot be ignored.The book is certainly worth a read, and its impact and value must be measured in the context in which it was written. It is/was an overwhelmingly progressive novel, and no doubt a contribution to \`gay' literature (if that's how you wish you classify the novel; I do not). However, this book being published today would hardly turn an eye. Read it to understand Baldwin, read it to understand the timeframe, read it for a glimpse into the complexity of homosexual relationships, read it to enjoy Baldwin's outstanding writing abilities - but don't read it for the plot."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"One reviewer stated that it was a shame more young readers were not reading Baldwin. It has taken me almost 35 years to discover him. One of the best writers of the 20th Century.The subject matter (as you can see in other reviews) is a bit controversial for the time. However, Baldwins lyrical prose is certainly an enjoyment to behold.I also read Notes of a Native Son at the same time as this book and its a great companion piece. Baldwin was an Expatriate living in Paris during the 50's and Notes give you further insight into Giovanni's Room.A must read novel...A must read AGAIN novel!"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"It's possible that James Baldwin's main strength as a writer is his ability to be subtly insightful. He gets his ideas across without overpowering the reader with them. Much of the imagery that he uses in this novel is very poignant when considering the plight of both the main characer and Giovanni. That is, when considering the main character's inability to accept certain truths about himself, and the ramifications that has for others (I suppose, himself included).While this book only occasionally sustains the lyrical flow that made Go Tell it on the Mountain so very distinctive, it's more daring in it's approach and subject matter. Very few writers would be able to handle the ebb and flow of personal denial and hard realization as gracefully and naturally as James Baldwin does. So, in a sense, what it gives up in style, it more than makes up for in content; which isn't to say the style of writing is bad (I wouldn't have given it five stars if it was). Compared to most other writers, Mr. Baldwin has a fluid, insightful pen. I'm simply basing my stylistic comparison on the near songlike quality of prose in Go Tell it on the Mountain (which I also highly recomend). Also, while toned down quite a bit, there are quite a few religious referances throughout this novel. So, If you have read, or studied the Bible, that layer will be readily apparent. It might also be a good idea to have an English to French dictionary with you (or at the very least a handy French student whom you can reference). This novel has an abundance of untranslated French snippets.I would recomend this novel for anybody who is interested in the struggle to resolve one's sexual identity. I would also recomend this to anyone who is interested in sexual politics. Although I wouldn't necesarilly lump it together with the books written by the expatriates (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein etc), anyone who likes those books may enjoy the European flavor of this one (with all of it's little snippets of french)."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"What I believe to be one of the most surprising and ground breaking novels of the twentieth century. Everything from Baldwin's style to his plot to his rivetting characters makes this book an intoxication. There is so much energy in this book, so much suspense, and so much stuggle. This book I find the most intriguing of Baldwin's books second only to Another Country. A Must Read."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin was one of America's preeminent authors of the 20th Century. He is most often associated with raising the awareness of Americans, in particular, to the plight of their country's black citizens. His best novel on that issue isAnother Country. InNobody Knows My Namehe took on William Faulkner, for his \\"go slow\\" approach on achieving racial equality. Given that background, the surprising aspect of this novel is that race is never mentioned; the reader isn't even told the race of the characters. \\"Giovanni's Room\\" tackles even a stronger taboo of the time (it was written in the 1950's): homosexuality. And not only was Baldwin black, he was homosexual.Most of the novel is set in the Paris of the \`50's. The recent war is never mentioned either. David is the American narrator. Americans in Paris is a familiar theme, particularly those trying to \\"find themselves,\\" and / or, as in Baldwin's case, were alienated from their home countries. Giovanni is an Italian immigrant. Much of the action seems to be set in what would be called \\"gay\\" bars today. Giovanni is a bartender in one. One of the realities of life in this sub-culture is that many of the younger expatriates seem to service, if you will, the needs of older Frenchmen, clients, again, if you will. The expat circuit is a well-defined one, it seems. They all seem to go to the \\"Closerie des Lilas,\\" a hang-out of Hemingway's, in the \`20's. Part of the book sent me scurrying to Wikipedia; early on, one learns that one of the principal characters is to be guillotined. Did the French still do that in the \`50's? The answer is yes; the last state performed execution was in 1977, and save for military crimes, they always used the guillotine.I felt the first and last chapters were particularly strong. Stylistically, the first was quite different from other writings of Baldwin. In it, he tells of his first homosexual experience with Joey, in New York, when they were still teenagers. Thematically, the most surprising aspect is that homosexuality seems to be a matter of choice, not one of genetics, which seems to be congruent with various right-wing critics who believe it is a \\"lifestyle\\" that can be \\"cured.\\" The principals are \\"bi,\\" and seem to routinely have affairs with women. In the final chapter Baldwin depicts David's disenchantment with his \\"bi\\" choice: \\"I don't know, now, when I first looked at Hella and found her body uninteresting, her presence grating... I trace it to something as fleeting as the tip of her breast lightly touching my forearm as she leaned over me to serve my supper. I felt my flesh recoil. Her underclothes, drying in the bathroom... now began to seem unaesthetic and unclean...All that had once delighted me seemed to have turned sour on my stomach.\\" Of course, one need not be homosexual for that to happen; but still, it is a remarkable descriptive passage.Middle portions of the book I found a bit hackneyed. Perhaps I have already read too many of the \\"Americans finding themselves in Paris\\" books, and if this had been the first, well, it might have been better appreciated. I also found Baldwin's sprinkling of French words throughout a bit pretentious, and does not add to the novel (in the interest of full disclosure, I do understand all the French, but often wonder how it might mar the experience for a non-French speaker.)Overall though, particularly for tackling a taboo subject in the \`50's, with grace, compassion and understanding... and, helping the rest of us understand, Baldwin deserves 5-stars."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Giovanni's Room is one of James Baldwin's best work of literature. In the book he expresses all the circumstance that went along with homosexuality in the 1950's set in Paris. His technique in writing the book is so great that if a person is not paying a lot of attention they probably wouldn't even know that the book is about homosexuality. Baldwin makes homosexuality seem like a simple everyday thing. He is not an explicit, provocative writer, yet you feel and see everything that he wrote. Instead of being all about physical acts, in the novel, he more discusses the emotional. Baldwin told of how homosexuality not only affects the person dealing with their sexuality, but the people that surround that person. He wrote of how most homosexuals have to live hiding who they really are just so that society will accept them."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This book is a milestone in writings about gay identity. The story seems to be very sad but atthe end one realizes that no characters in the book are positive or negative, all of them are victims of the cruel and hyppocrite society."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Hardly could i expect more from this book when i started reading it, my friends gave it to me as a gift with his highest recommendation. It lived up to almost every expectation except for length. Exceedingly sensual but without pathos that one would find in the vast majority of romantic stories. Book is moving though tragic and deep; besides it's very well written and stylishly employs French at times."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin is an overrated writer in my opinion. I've read three of his &quot;best&quot; works and am not just basing this sentiment on one novel. Giovanni's room begins excellently; it vividly captures the mood of Paris and its more colorful characters. It presents the inner conflicts of Jacques and the main character well. But by the middle, it goes downhill with stereotyping (Giovanni is the proverbial loudmouth chauvanist Italian who's prone to fits of rage and crying; Hella is the spoiled, scattered-brain blond with no backbone; and Jacques is the sad, empty queen). In the end the story becomes a melo/crime drama. And what was the point? The main character was always a cold, detached soul that never came to any realization at the end, wasn't changed, and made no decisions about his life and treatment of people. Even THAT wasn't made the point."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"While &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot; is a fine novel, Baldwin does a much better job with the themes presented here (identity, sexuality, place, etc.) in his later novel, &quot;Just Above My Head.&quot; My personal opinion is that &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot; has received such positive praise and hype in the gay (white) community becasue the characters are white. &quot;Just Above My Head&quot; is ignored and bastardized because it dares to challenge conventional (racist) white gay norms by showing clearly that black men can and do love other balck men. Because &quot;Giovanni's Room&quot; falls into one of the two acceptable camps (no black gays at all or black gays with white lovers) it is accepted. Baldwin's writing skills are strong here, however, and his use of the European backdrop is excellent. The confusion, anguish, and tension that Baldwin is able to generate in relatively few pages is truly outstanding. A worthwhile read, to be sure, but not the author's best waxing on the subject."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"James Baldwin is masterful in conveying underlying motives. In his book, Giovanni's Room, he deals very tactfully with the moral pitfalls of sexual relationships. The hero, David, is torn between feelings of homosexuality and heterosexual relationships. Far from being the politically correct propoganda most likely to be published today, Baldwin shines the light of his craft on this subject with startling honesty. He shows great insight into the psyche underpinning moral choices. The character development for the main characters is good but could be better for the others. Yet for such a relatively short novel he does a good job. If you want to read a novel that seems to honestly deal with the realities of this subject, this is the one. He shies away from being hyper-critical in a moral sense, yet doesn't attempt to soften the harsh realities of living this lifestyle. Overall, an excellent read."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"This book was written a long time ago for a completely different audience. That being said, this is still a good book that gives insight on to the lives of people in France in the early 20th century as well as possibly opening people's eyes to the idea of homosexuality in a whole new light. Baldwin creates real people, that could be me or you, and puts them in a situation that isnt too far fetched to consider, and does a good job of showing how people act.Although it is old and slightly out dated, it is still an interesting and worth while read in today's world."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"Giovanni's Room was a groundbreaking novel that exposed a topic rarely talked about, which is a surprise considering how bold American writers make themselves out to be. The topic offered something, but the book overall did not startle me for its perception and often I wished to give all of the characters a swift kick in the behind for being so annoying and for reading so much into so little. Baldwin is suppose to be, from his reputation at least, one of the greats. This book does not show his greatness, especially since he is known as a stylist and Giovanni's Room, with the exception of topic-falls flat and muddy. I would not discourage anyone from reading this novel, however, I would not encourage either. It was a decent read and, sadly, almost forgettable for an author of his standing"},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I loved this book! It was hard for me to understand at first but once I read it a second time :-) I understood it better and I am in the middle of reading it a 3rd time already and I got to thinking about his girl Hella. I find that near the end of the novel when she returns to David that some of the things she said is a way I possibly feel about my husband. It was a little scary at first almost as if someone had read my mind and wrote down my thoughts. But I think that Hella knew from the moment she and David and Giovanni were in the same space that David and Giovanni had been together. I think she should have left them to be because I thought that David and Giovanni should have been together. They shared many things together but Hella just always cut into it. I think it was Hella's fault that Giovanni was executed because she was playing games with David. But then again David should have seen her litlle games and left and been done with her a long time ago. I know I would have. She is the cause of David's problems I think. But what do I know, I'm only reading for the 3rd time so there is probably so much more I haven't been able to understand yet...."},{"Title":"Giovanni's room (Signet book # S1559)","review":"I agree with one reviewer in saying that the book is not really about race or gender, but passion and pain, loss and &quot;what if's&quot;. And I think that's why it fell short of my expectations. While you are told that the two main men feel this passion for each other, it's hard to internalize it because the writer has basically ignored what should be a necessary interrogation into the complete aspects, not just the nature, of their relationship. We get a summary of what their love was. I couldn't help wanting to know more - more about the room; about what they did together in a sexual, and day to day sense; about everything! Perhaps the characterization needed to be slightly deeper. Let's hear a bit more about Giovanni at least; it's apparent the main character can't describe himself better, being as he is completely unaware of his true nature. A bit more description and angst and this book would have had a bit more oompf."},{"Title":"The glass house;: The life of Theodore Roethke","review":"The author writes about Roethke from the viewpoint of a colleague, fellow writer, and friend. Seager divides the book into 15 chapters: Roethke's Birthplace, Roethke's Family, Childhood, His Father's Death, College, The Beginnings of Poetry, Trouble, The First Book, The Lost Son and Other Poems, Working Methods, The West Coast, Marriage and the Pulitzer Prize, The Prizes, the Awards, and The last years.Seager's Roethke emerges as a man of contradictions. Moreover, in many cases, says Seager, Roethke outright lied in order to forge himself ahead; yet the reader comes away with the suspicion that Roethke never really lied, that either he believed what he was saying was true or that it could have been true under the right circumstances.Seager doesn't so much discuss Roethke's work as he sets the stage for how Roethke's work came to be and how he wrestled with what it means to be a poet. During the course of the book, Seager considers Roethke's birthplace, his time of birth, his family, his education, and, finally, Roethke's need to find his noblest self. The introduction by Donald Hall is both informative and revealing as well.At the center of Seager's discussion of Roethke's poetry career is Roethke's mental illness which may have accounted for both the best and worst moments of Roethke's too short life.This is a book for Roethke's fans, those who love authors and literature, and/or those who are writers. Writers, especially, will be intrigued, I think. Seager's handling of the subject matter is as grand as his subject."},{"Title":"The glass house;: The life of Theodore Roethke","review":"Ted Roethke springs to life from these pages-brilliant, astonishingly arrogant and hugely insecure. Seager links this combination to Roethke's father's death, but acknowledges a great deal of it was either innate or due to Ted having grown up as a sensitive boy in a very non-literary area of the world. Ted believed his poetry was consistently undervalued. Seager labels Ted as an \\"operator,\\" by which he means that Ted strived in his poetry, not just to improve his skill, but also to bring it to the attention of poets who might critique it, publish it, review it, award him prizes for it, or otherwise be useful in his career. He worked tirelessly on improving his poetry and pushing the envelope OF poetry, while at the same time shamelessly promoting his own work and striving to become known as a poet. In between all this he suffered episodes of mania which led to various periods in institutions. A former co-worker of Roethke's, Seager paints an unforgettable portrait of the man behind the poems. A must-read for any Roethke acolyte."},{"Title":"The Emergence of Rus: 750-1200 (Longman History of Russia)","review":"I can't speak or read Russian and I'm not a trained specialist in Russian history. All I am is a person who is fascinated by the history of that great nation and people. And this book seems to me to be pretty close to essential for anyone who shares that interest.The Emergence of Rus tells of the origins of the Russian people and the first great Russian state at Kiev. Given that few written sources are available for the time period, this book relies heavily on archaelogical information early on. Such written sources as exist are compared and contrasted and the conclusions drawn seem eminently reasonable. Even though there is a lot of archaelogical data presented in the first part of this book, it is by no means dry. Franklin and Shepard have a interesting story to tell and they tell it very well.

The application exercises were more focused on converting from English units to SI units than on the variety of application problems. To add to the fun, the cgs system is also thrown into the mix. Granted, engineers and the like need to be able to switch, but that's not the point of a DE class.

Thus, small minds to the left of center absolutely hate him - much as they hated Orwell, Camus and de Beauvoir, and for the same reasons: He won't toe the line. (The Right, of course, simply chooses to ignore him ... or more likely can't understand him.)In this second installment of his ongoing autobiography, Hentoff's love of jazz is again front and center - there has never been a better chronicler of jazz, and if Hentoff's prose is a bit more stilted than his favorite musicians, he still captures that sense of life that jazz embodies.An unapologetic integrationist, Hentoff is also one of the most color-blind individuals you will ever read.Reading this book also brings you to a realization that Hentoff opposes abortion for the exact same reason he opposes the death penalty - it is a consistent ethos, even if the Left (such as it is these days) finds itself compelled to try to silence him.If you despair of the left ever finding its way again, if you feel dismayed by the increasing conformity of American liberals, then read this book."},{"Title":"Speaking Freely: A Memoir","review":"In writing his memoirs, a journalist has an advantage over a civilian, in having a record of his life. And where Nat Hentoff's notebooks left off, his FBI files provided items he'd forgotten, such as the name of the haberdashery where, at age 11, he'd had his first job, and some which he'd never known, such as his parents' Russian birthplaces.A Village Voice and Washington Post columnist, and the author of some 40 non-fiction and fiction books for adults and children, the catholicity of Nat Hentoff's interests and his career of taking gutsy stands have made him an institution in a profession pervaded by mediocrity and conformity.Hentoff's atheism, his support of trade unions and flag burners, and his quaint faith in school integration that most American blacks no longer believe in make him look like your standard-issue liberal. Yet the same man defended the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, Illinois, opposes abortion, and has fought against a purported \\"right of privacy\\" that would allow women to dispose of children born with birth defects. It is no wonder that many of Hentoff's colleagues at the Village Voice have stopped speaking to him.The sequel to Hentoff's 1987 memoir Boston Boy, which told of his \\"exuberantly anti-Semitic hometown,\\" Speaking Freely briskly covers his 50-plus years in journalism with a wry, self-deprecating humor that his columns and First Amendment books often lack.Hentoff enjoyed early success writing on jazz for Down Beat magazine, whose New York office he ran. In 1956, he got fired. It seems he had hired a \\"black\\" secretary without getting permission from the home office in Chicago. The magazine, which was devoted to black music, had never hired a black staffer. Ironically, Hentoff reports, \\"Several years later I found out that the secretary at issue was not black, but Egyptian. Of course, these days, the creators and practitioners of Afrocentricity would rule that, being Egyptian, the new secretary was, of course, black. Either way, I would still have been fired.\\"Hentoff sketches several poignant portraits of jazz greats. He tells of a 1980s concert at Lincoln Center in Dizzy Gillespie's honor. \\"I hadn't seen Dizzy...for a few years.... In the hallway, Dizzy was talking with someone, saw me, ran over, and grabbed me in a bear hug. To the man he was talking to, Dizzy, grinning, explained, 'It's like seeing an old broad you used to go with.'\\" Hentoff comments that \\"This old broad has seldom been so honored.\\"Hentoff tells sadly of the deterioration of New York's Village Voice, once as vividly unpredictable as it is now a museum of political correctness, and of his hopes for its reinvigoration under its current editor-in-chief, Don Forst. For the past several years, I have found Hentoff to be the sole reason for reading the Voice.Hentoff's turn against abortion quarantined him at the virulently pro-abortion Voice. He has subsequently campaigned against all forms of euthanasia. He also attacked the practice of testing pregnant women for HIV for research purposes and then withholding the test results from them-a policy demanded by the AIDS lobby, employing an obscene interpretation of \\"privacy\\" rights, which condemned thousands of children and their mothers to terrible, premature deaths. Hentoff compared this practice to the \\"Tuskegee experiments,\\" in which black men infected with syphilis were left untreated, to die horrible, slow deaths. The ACLU's support of this HIV testing policy led Hentoff to resign from the organization in 1995, after 35 years as a member.In the \\"Genghis Khan of the Catholic Church,\\" conservative archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor [alive at the time of original publication of this review], Hentoff sees a kindred spirit. He and O'Connor locked horns over Pope John Paul II's granting of an audience to Kurt Waldheim after his complicity in Nazi war crimes had been exposed. Before Hentoff could complete a second column attacking the Pope and O'Connor, a letter from the latter shut him up: \\"Now that I have won the argument, let us proceed. You may recall how Belloc ends his Path to Rome: 'So let us love another and laugh. Time passes and we shall soon laugh no longer. Meanwhile, earnest men are at siege upon us all round. So let us laugh and suffer absurdities, for that is only to suffer one another.'\\"The defense of an opponent's freedom of belief requires a kind of love, and the embrace of absurdities. In Hentoff's case, the loving and the embracing are done by a warrior journalist.Originally published in The American Enterprise, Spring 1998."},{"Title":"Speaking Freely: A Memoir","review":"In these pages, Mr. Hentoff relentlessly promotes himself, without even attempting to reconcile his contradictory positions. He's the great civil libertarian, yet apparently he believes that women have no civil rights where there own bodies are concerned!

I used to like Nat Hentoff's writings, but somewhere along the line, he took a wrong turn, and became a fawning sycophant of the right wing."},{"Title":"The Gifts of Christmas (Little Golden Book)","review":"This is a great way to introduce Christmas to little ones.

The macros don't work in the current version of MS Project. The macros are written in Visual Basic and I was able to debug through them, so I could at least install the material.The book was not well written, the narrators came across too stuffy. There is good material here, but I am having a hard time forcing myself past the middle of the book.I enjoyed the AMA Handbook of Project Management much better."},{"Title":"Effective Project Management: How to Plan, Manage, and Deliver Projects on Time and Within Budget- Includes CD","review":"I have worked in a lot of projects, large and small, but all the ones I personally managed were small and run by the S.O.P.M Methodology (Seat-of-the-Pants). When I signed up for a community-college P.M. class, all they wanted to talk about was &quot;soft skills&quot;, team bonding, Kum-Bah-Yah stuff. Necessary, but not the nuts-and-bolts. I got my money back - I wanted meat-and-potatoes Project Managment. To me, this book has a good overview of basics with common sense, then some good specific techniques with more detail. Plus, it goes cradle-to-grave. I have not finished, and I have not run the exercises yet. Maybe I'll come back and add a different rating after that. I wouldn't buy it to learn Microsoft Project software."},{"Title":"Effective Project Management: How to Plan, Manage, and Deliver Projects on Time and Within Budget- Includes CD","review":"Well developed description of high-level procedures necessaryto the process of &quot;planning to plan.&quot; CD includes exercises thatcan be used with MS Project 4.0, but the book is not tied to anyparticular program and is definitely not a software manual"},{"Title":"Effective Project Management: How to Plan, Manage, and Deliver Projects on Time and Within Budget- Includes CD","review":"It comes with a CD-Rom, but I was unable to install the 1995-era software on my system (I think due to x64 architecture). This meant the book was it, and as a book, it is BORING. The authors convey information in the form of bulletined lists, without elaboration. This means they dump loads of information without spotlighting which parts are important, or where to concentrate resources. Half of the book consists of supplementary material and exercises tied into the CD; useless without the CD.This book did not help me with effective project management."},{"Title":"Thrive! 7 Strategies for Extraordinary Living","review":"Felicia Scott is a truthteller who spurs you to action.

From his first-ever composition written in 1852 (at 13 years old!), taking in &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; about halfway through, all the way through to his original piano versions of music from his final (and never-completed) opera, &quot;Sorochintsy Fair&quot; -- it's all here.So what makes this collection better than its rivals? There are two primary attributes, in my mind, which make this collection superior.The first is its completeness. Not only does this collection include all of Mussorgsky's surviving compositions, but some of them are even represented in two distinct versions. It can be really interesting to compare the two versions of a composition, and obtain partial insight into Mussorgsky's composition methods.The second advantage this collection has is its accuracy. Unlike other Mussorgsky piano books on the market, this one is based on an &quot;Urtext,&quot; which means that special effort has been made to examine the original manuscripts, verifying that each and every note is what the composer actually wrote. This is especially important for Mussorgsky, whose work has suffered from &quot;corrections&quot; made by his contemporaries -- &quot;corrections&quot; which are often unwittingly passed along even today. (For example, not many people know that Rimsky-Korsakov made a number of little &quot;corrections&quot; to &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition,&quot; nor do they know that these &quot;corrections&quot; are still passed along by music publishers who don't even know they're there.) With THIS collection, you can be certain that everything is as accurate as possible -- so that the music comes the closest to representing what Mussorgsky actually wrote.In conclusion, this edition of Mussorgsky's complete piano works is magnificent. The print is large enough to use for performance purposes, and the multiple versions and technical notes at the end make this a good choice for research purposes as well. Combine this with its outstanding completeness and accuracy, and you have a collection that simply can't be beat.So even if you're only interested in the sheet music for &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition,&quot; you should strongly consider purchasing this collection. You'll not only get the most accurate version of &quot;Pictures&quot; available, but you'll also get accurate versions of Mussorgsky's other piano compositions as well. For those who already know they love &quot;Pictures,&quot; this is the ideal opportunity to discover more of Mussorgsky's music to love."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This CD gives an overall view of the Bible, yet is also teaches all the great stories in the bible and doesn't leave out Paul's letters to the churches. This is a great resource for kid 2-7. This is also helpful for an adult learning about the bible for the first time. Nice pace of music, you can play it in the car without falling asleep at the wheel."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This is a wonderful resource for parents and teachers! The songs are catchy, varied in style, and easy to learn/remember. Kids love the music and pick up effortlessly on the great stories of the Bible as well as the books of the Bible, the overall \\"theme\\" of the Bible (God's promised Savior/the gospel), and various key Scripture passages (10 Commandments, Fruit of the Spirit, etc.). I really love the narration between songs, too, because it emphasizes the connections between the Old Testament and New. Highly recommended. (great for preschool and early elementary ages)"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"My kids ask to listen to this series of cds over and over again in the car-most of the songs are quite catchy (and I find myself singing them). It basically goes through the whole Bible in song-and each song has a bit different style which gives it variety. I think this is why my kids don't get tired of it."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"My two little girls absolutely love these songs and are always asking me to play them. Mom loves the introduction to each song and the words that accompany the tapes. Truly a great way for teaching our children God's words and His stories. Now if they would only come out with these on CD!!!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This is one of the most entertaining kid's Bible songs. It is different than the overdone praise songs, and my church kids love it! we did a play using the songs a few years ago, it was amazing! I would love to do it again, but I need it on CD and in split track or instrumental (even better) pleaaaaaaaase :-)Patricia"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This set is really fun but the quality is not so good because it's on cassette."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I was so excited about getting this CD for my kids, love Scripture songs. But when I got it and listened to it I realized the songs are really bad. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"My children love the songs on discs 1,3,and 4. Then sing along everytime we are in the car. However, disc 2 does not work. We insert it and the player says error. I do not know who to contact on that.Other than that I would suggests this cd to all with young children!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"More than 50 great songs in numerous styles take you and your children through the Bible from beginning to end. You can't do better than that. I don't know why it's only marketed as 7-and-below. I'd say all the way up to 12 or so (and the adults will enjoy it too.) A Sunday School group could cover this over a year, have a great deal of fun with it, and develop superb Bible knowledge. It is also packed with humor and great characters in a musical-within-a-musical format.The Osbornes have created a marvellous resource here and I feel their wonderful work has been poorly served by their publisher's marketers. For years I tried in vain to get copies to give to children in my Children's Church class. I get the feeling it's becoming more widely available again. I'd like to see it on CD or MP3 download.Match this to a Children's Bible in 365 readings and you have the tools for excellent broad-spectrum Bible knowledge for your children. It worked for us, and we had a great time using it."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"We bought the cassettes four years ago and wore them out, so I was thrilled to get this on CD. My kids love these songs and you learn alot about the flow of biblical history from them. It is a really good compilation. I am surprised by what they can remember from the songs. My only complaint with the CD version is that occasionally the last few words of a song got cut off when they cut the songs for the CD. My kids notice it because we had the cassettes for so long so they know the songs very well. But I am so HAPPY to have it on CD. Now when we make the 5 hour drive to Grandma's, we listen to these all the way. LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This is the best collection of bible stories for youngsters that I've encountered thus far. It would be a fabulous show for any talented church group to perform on stage. The narration and story telling are top notch. The characters are played by adults and children alike. The songs are always a great compliment to the story and again are performed by both adults and children. It has a diverse genre of music to be enjoyed by all ages. Both my five year old and I love it! The music is professional and of Broadway caliber. Enjoy while you learn!!!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I bought these CDs because they were recommended in a book I read about helping children grow spiritually. While there's nothing theologically wrong with the CDs, I didn't like the music at all. Frankly, I was shocked at how outdated it sounded. There's only one song I can stand to listen to out of the entire thing. Small children may go for it, but it will drive adults crazy! Also, I was expecting there to be actual Bible verses, word for word, being sung, and thereby teach Scripture memory. This, too, was a disappointment. On the positive side, it does do a pretty good job of telling the whole story of the Bible chronologically. I would recommend checking into other Bible song CDs that are less annoying, like the Cedarmont Kids and Praise Baby."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I have bought a lot of cds with Bible songs for my son before but I came buying this because I was expecting it to be really interesting and easy to listen to. I have tried Vegetales, Cedarmont Kids, Psalty's Praise, and other good cds with songs (and my son loved them and even sings along right away), So I know how bad this one was. I still bought it to expect something different with more Biblical input for the children but it seems very loud and the music with the voices is all over the place. I hate to give bad comments on good resources like this but I am just disappointed and unhappy with this. The Narration was really good! I hope they just did narrations instead, but since it is the singing Bible, the songs must have been the main attraction of this album..wish the singers were clearer if the music isn't that bad. I hate the parts where there's \\"rap\\" in it, it doesn't sound religious anymore, and it made it harder for the kids to understand and listen to the good melody of the song. I think the music is too loud against the voices. It could have been a lot better if the background music is just a simple piano, classical, of acoustic background playing instead of the loud beats of the drums so that the voices and words will be clearer (just like the 2 or 3 songs in it) and by the way the adult singers are not really good. Just all in all I am not satisfied with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I am listening to the 4-CD set called \\"The Singing Bible\\" from Focus on the Family -- I am so impressed! It is fun \\"kid\\" music and is done well. Catchy tunes, good beat, varied styles (Caribbean, Scottish, Rock-n-Roll, Marching band, sound effects, etc.) with very well-thought through words, and a tiny bit of narration in between each song that weaves them together ... and tells His Story very well.NOAH BUILD A BOAT\\"Was anyone righteous? Could He find some? Was anyone righteous? Could He find one? God was the only one that Noah adored, so Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\\"Great present idea! This CD set would be appropriate all the way up to 10-yrs, and quite possibly up to 12 or 13."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I found this set of tapes several years ago. It is a wonderful set and has fun, upbeat, and catchy songs that appeal to little kids and older ones as well. I liked going in the car on long rides because I could listen to all three tapes. It makes the Bible (especially the old test) come alive and make sense in the big picture--not just little snapshots."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"As much as my children enjoyed this tape, I must say, I never tired of hearing it. It is accurately written to entertaining music. Our first tape was destroyed, and I haven't hesitated to replace it. I highly recommend it to all parents. A great way to educate your child on God's Word."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"Don't be fooled by the great reviews. Save your money.Our family was SO excited to pop these CDs in for the whole family to enjoy, especially after reading all the great reviews. Sadly, we were VERY disappointed when we actually listened to them.The first thing we noticed is that the songs are not useful for scripture memory; the actual words of the Bible are not being sung in a manner that assists with memorization. Aside from that, the songs were just plain BAD.While the idea and the general format of this CD's is okay (narrative interspersed with songs) the songs are really corny and poorly done. Although I can appreciate their attempt to use numerous music styles to vary the songs from one another (e.g. an Irish folk type song, a hip-hop style song, etc.), precious few were successfully done. Some of the songs sounded so ridiculous that my husband and I couldn't help but laugh aloud. Also, many of the lyrics were difficult to understand; my 7 year old daughter kept having to ask me what they were saying.This CD set was a fabulous idea that went horribly wrong."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I really wanted to love this cd. I wanted good music for my kids that shared about Christ. But DH and I can't stand the music and the kids (1.5 and 3) don't dislike it, but they don't actually like either. Pretty much they ignore it. I plan on buying them some of Dana Dirksen's music however. While it is still definately kid's music, DH and I don't hate it :) and the kids went wild listening to the samples (from the mp3 downloads) - both of them begging for more and the 3 year old already picking up on topics and talking about them, just from the song previews. So if you don't like this, maybe that will work for you."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"Songs are difficult to listen to. I was hopeful and disappointed. Songs were too long and not catchy.What more is there to say?"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I originally bought this CD set as part of a toddler homeschooling curriculum; at the time my kids were 2 1/2 years old.I was immediately drawn into the music and found it as my \\"go to\\" kids cd. My boys, on the other hand, didn't really seem to like it very much.Like everything else in my house, one day it disappeared and I never found it again. Since the boys didn't really seem to like it, I didn't bother to replace it, but I found myself WISHING that we still had it because I liked it so much.Finally, after nearly two years of not having it, I went ahead and re-ordered it. I am so happy that I did! I still love the music (certain songs are better than others, like any cd, but some of them I am willing to listen to over and over.) Now my boys are 4 and 2, and they love it as well (particularly the 4-yr-olds, so I think 2 may just be too young unless your kid really loves music.) Tonight at dinner we sat around listening to the songs, then as they finished, I'd explain the story in greater detail. It's wonderful to see my four-year-olds singing along to the books of the Bible... they don't fully understand it right now, but it will stick with them the rest of their lives and have meaning some day.I don't generally leave reviews, but I actually want to share The Singing Bible with others because I think it is an asset to every Christian child's home. If you want to raise your kids in a home that values lessons from the Bible, this is a great way to get them learning at a young age."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I have read reviews about out-dated music but some of the music is quite catchy. More importantly, it is a great way to get the stories of the Bible as well as some commentary on them into the children in a fun way. All my children know their books of the Bible in order because of The Books We Love the Best. This is great as they now can easily look up passages for themselves. They know the Ten Commandments and the plagues on Egypt. This 4 cd package teaches children what most adults do not know about the Word of God. I have six children from 5 - 15 and they have all had their turn learning from and enjoying the Singing Bible."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"Great way to get the Bible stories instilled into your children and I am even singing them!

Got this for my 2 and 4 year old. Songs are just long enough and very catchy. A great buy!!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I was looking for a memorization-type CD but could not find one that I liked so I went with this one that tells the Bible stories. My 4 yr old has read through a 365 day Bible storybook so he knows the stories (even obscure ones) but this just helps to remind him. He loves it. My 1.5 yr old seems to as well. Besides one silly reference to \\"sinful nature\\", there doesn't seem to be much theology in it which we really like."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This is the best children's cd I have ever heard. We played this over and over when we first got it. It's also great for road trips. I learned somethings too! No compromising of faith, it's fervent, it's doctrinally sound. God's word wonderfully presented to children (and adults-me, I enjoyed it as much if not more) in musical style. It's a work of art itself. Well done! I bought two more for a family member and a church friend. Another friends daughter heard it playing at my mom's house, she's twelve, and she loved it. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I have searched and searched for a chronological resource of Bible stories, and these are even better since they are set to music. It is our entire spring board for our daily lessons. Wore out the first set of CD's and working on our second one. LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I bought this set to play for my grandson. The music is pleasant to listen to with some of the tunes being very catchy. It is a great way to give your child some familiarity of the Bible. It covers many of the classic Bible stories in song which are presented in chronological order by a 'story teller' who speaks in between the songs & ties it together. My 19 month old grandson enjoys dancing to the songs & my 17 yr old daughter actually enjoys listening to the cds as well."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This CD set is WELL WORTH the money. My kids love it! And within listening to the songs for only a couple days, my three year old daughter was already singing along. This goes great with the Hearts of Dakota preschool curriculum, but also is great as a stand alone. Of all the purchases I've made online lately, this was one of the top ones for value and values taught!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This is a great survey of the Bible. The songs are well done and have a lot of variety in musical styles. Our 2 children enjoy the music - it is one of their favorites. I like that the series is not only well-done musically, but also does a great job describing who God is, what He is like and how He interacts with His people. A great Bible overview and fun too!"},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"This product is great--fun for the whole family and you learn a lot about the Bible through these songs."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"If you're not a fan of cheesy kid songs, you'll probably want to pass on this.If you don't mind (or even like) cheesy stuff and you're looking for songs that teach biblical stories chronologically without adding to or changing the story, then you want this.The narrator has a soothing, grandfatherly voice and explains concepts to transition in between songs. We use it in the car, but it's Bible-saturated enough to use one song at a time during family devotion/worship times. That's fantastic because our kids (ages 1 and 3) don't have a long attention span for a long Bible story if it's just read aloud. I think it will continue to be useful as they get older as well, and I plan to give it as a gift to several of our friends (which is the highest compliment I can give to a resource like this)."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"We stumbled upon this wonderful resource at our local library on cassette! My boys (2,7) both love the songs and stories, so we bought it on cd for them for Christmas this year. This is our second purchase and will be donated to the library to replace the cassette version so more people can enjoy it! It has a wide variety of musical styles and the songs are really fun, not \\"hokey\\" as some children's music can be."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"As much as my children enjoyed this tape, I've got to tell you, I never tired of hearing it. Accurately written, the music is fantastic, it's just an overall great Bible lesson. We were all distraught when our first tape broke while in the player. I was even more upset when I found that my local Christian bookstore did not carry it. I'm delighted to find this site so that we can, once again, enjoy God's Word through this delightful work."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"We love The SInging Bible. It is a great way to surround yourself with the Word beginning at a young age! We think the music is fun. It has never seemed outdated to us as other reviewers have stated.

He loves the songs and sings them all the time."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I am amazed at this series. My 4 year-old daughter has listened to it since she was born and she continues to ask for it 95% of the time we are driving in the car. It never gets old because all of the stories are true and accurately presented. Not only is the presentation fun and entertaining but it is amazingly accurate to the Bible in a concise way that children can grasp. It gives the listener a fabulous knowledge of the chronological events in the Bible since it follows the books of the Bible in order.This series uses a variety of music types and the adults and children singing have close to perfect pitch and excellent vocal ability, which is a plus when training a young ear. This is the absolute best Bible music I have heard for young ones and I've purchased many that are on the market.I am also very much interested in seeing this on CD or MP3."},{"Title":"The Singing Bible (Heritage Builders)","review":"I bought this for my toddler, so he could listen to it while we ride to and from 'school'.

I use this book as my main reference for Schoenhut dolls.I love this book. Carol's method of presenting the dolls by Schoenhut model numbers has changed the way modern doll collectors refer to these dolls. Now a collector might state, &quot;I have a 316 in mint condition&quot;. Thanks to Carol, others will be able to picture her doll clearly in our mind.Carol's stories about the Schoenhut family members and each of their very active involvement with the toy company puts a very personal slant on the history of this family oriented company. It should be obvious from this book that the Schoenhut family took great pride in producing the best quality, durable dolls and toys because they loved children and enjoyed the great fun of watching children at play.If you collect Schoenhut dolls, then you really NEED this book -- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"},{"Title":"Schoenhut dolls: A collector's encyclopedia","review":"I just love this book.

I like these odd stories set in isolated places with plenty of strange characters so I decided to buy the book.I enjoyed this story because of it's oddness. Sure there are a plethora of unbalanced people but there are families just like this. The main character, Leah, manages to suck the life out of everyone she is in contact with and the reader can't help but hate her. All the characters have reason to hate her too so the reader is pretty sure one of them is going to do her in. Not so fast..............I like the descriptions of the Cornwall country side, the old house and the characters' mannerisms.

And if you want to know, those two littlegreen forest people are Sammy Jay and Sticky Toes the tree toad,who people say were talking in the night when they were reallysound asleep. But soon everyone found out it was the MockingBird that was making all the noise in the night.

In fact, this is a very good book which we've had for about 2 weeks and my 4 year old has had me read repeatedly. We cover about 3 chapters a night at bedtime. It teaches that playing tricks on your friends is NOT the way to keep them, and can actually cause people a lot of trouble. I highly recommend it - along with all of the other Thornton Burgess books!"},{"Title":"The adventures of Mr. Mocker","review":"This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. Plus, unlike many of these Dover editions of Thornton Burgess' books, it has honest-to-god original Harrison Cady illustrations.Harrison Cady did two sets of drawings for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown editions, plus many smaller line drawings.This Dover edition has the 6 grayscale illustrations from the Little, Brown edition. In the Little, Brown edition, they were on plates (higher quality paper), while in this Dover edition they are on the same paper as the text. That does affect the quality of the illustrations a bit, but they still look quite good. Kudos to Dover on getting it right for this title. And at such a low price!If you like these illustrations, I'd recommend finding a used copy of the Grosset & Dunlap edition too. Cady did those decades later, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures."},{"Title":"The adventures of Mr. Mocker","review":"Wow...that sums up my reacation to the 'Adventures Of Mr. Mocker'.

Mocky could be doing anything throughout the book, for one man's nap is another man's adventure!Even though I have never read this book, I whole heartedly encourage everyone to do so.

With each story standing alone, it's an excellent book for casual reading."},{"Title":"Best Little Stories from World War II","review":"One of the fascinating things about war is the stories that come from it. Kelly has compiled over a hundred of these stories from World War II that would make any history buff proud. Books like this remind us that war is not only battles, generals and casualty rates. There is so much more beneath the surface. Wars are faught by people, by human beings, and when that many human beings share a common experience, there are certainly some good stories coming from it.The short tales show us the war from the eyes of those who lived it. Some are comical, some are sad, some are better than others. If nothing else, this book portrayed the human side of the war, reminding me that even at our worst times we are not animals. For the history fan, I highly recommend it, but it would also be a good read for all the generations that never actually knew those of the Greatest Generation, the men and women who saved the world. These are their stories, and they make for great reading."},{"Title":"Best Little Stories from World War II","review":"This book was really fun to read -- the stories seem to flow pretty well one to another.

I started reading this one, and then started thumbing around from front to back, and I still don't know what is going on -- but it was sure interesting while it lasted!I found this book at a library book sale, so excuse me for not knowing anything about its literary pretensions or context.WARNING, right off: You will have no idea what this book is about unless you take a class on this guy, which is probably unlikely, or have an odd, non-Hefnerian view of sex. Or if you're the sort to sit in a tweed blazer and monocle and snicker alone late at night over the Discovery channel with one hand down your pants.When an author starts off by telling you unabashedly that he's going to use the whole range of the English vocabulary going back to the Elizabethans, whether you know what he's talking about or not, and then goes off to frolic around in weird, wordy and highly literary word-acrobatics about copulation and who-knows-what, you know you've gotten into something not exactly \\"summer reading.\\"I'm not sure who this book was intended for (from the intro, I'd say no-one), but it's always good to have it on your shelf, especially if the title is prominently displayed, and you can pull it out periodically and read vague and archly erudite chuckles about pudenda and whatnot.As for \\"misanthropic,\\" well, ya got me there.

Dahlberg's intent seems to have been as much to display his bulging erudition and arch, archaic way with words as to decry man's slavery to the sexual urge. His ostensible subject is often buried beneath an avalanche of classical, historical, and anthropological allusions, but at least the book is riddled with eccentric epithets along the lines of &quot;Man is double, and who may know his heart: he is a moral hermaphrodite.&quot; The author's tone is judgmental and defiant throughout, but that doesn't energize the book. The tedium of reading finally overwhelms any interest his oblique approach might provide, and there are no illuminating observations about the eternal itch, merely a catalogue of references to Greek gods, Mayan myths, and &quot;primeval potherbs.&quot;"},{"Title":"And Berry Came Too","review":"I first read this book 66 years ago, and I still love it.

Michael Straczynski's Rising Star's, is currently the best comics in publication. The wonderful deep, and intriguing charachters and plot's set it a=part from most. But unlike most of it's contemporaries, it isn't stuffy crap that people only pretend to like so they'll look cool.(See the current crapfest known as X-Force/X-Statics.)Rising Star's is the life story of 113 extraordinary young people from they're birth, to their exile from society, to their retunr to grace, till the death of the last of them.In a small town in Illinois a flash in the sky one night changed every child in the woomb at the time. These children were bron with fantastic powers. They were raised by the Govt. after a Pirokinetic's power went out of control, and eventually were integrated into society. This first chapter tell's the story of their child-hood, up through their exile."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"When I saw this book, I thought perhaps this was an original novel set in Straczynski's \\"Rising Stars\\" universe, not unlike the \\"Bright\\" miniseries Fiona Avery is writing. I was surprised when I realized it was, in fact, a novelization of the first \\"Rising Stars\\" story arc, but I decided to give it a try. Comic novelizations aren't that common, but they can be done well, as Greg Rucka's \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" and Elliot S. Maggin's \\"Kingdom Come\\" can both attest.I wish I'd let those works stand alone as my examples of this art form, because both as a novel and as a novelization, this falls very flat.The book is, in many parts, a scene-for-scene retelling of the comic book, which is not what you want in a novelization to begin with. There's nothing new here, nothing to enhance the story, nothing to make you feel like you've read something you haven't read before. Furthermore, segments that worked in the comic don't always work in the novel -- the chapter with a one of the Specials describing her life to a mundane over dinner was fantastic in the comic book, but tedious and unnecessary in the novel.The way it is constructed is very poor as well -- the decision to write this book from John \\"Poet\\" Simon's first-person narration is a terrible one. The author keeps lapsing into interior thoughts of characters that the narrator couldn't possibly know, showing scenes that he wasn't present for and could never have assembled this much information on -- and it gets worse when he tries to pass it off. At one point he tells us (after the fact) that the narrator later viewed the scene on a surveillance tape, at another point we're reading another character's (immaculately detailed) diary. At one particularly frustrating point, the author just admits he's writing pure speculation -- \\"And Lee probably said something like...\\" It was really weak and really distracting.I can't quite figure out who the target audience for this book is. It can't be fans of the comic book, because the comic book is far too good and this book adds nothing to it. I can't be people who haven't read the comic, because it isn't written in a fashion that will entice any of them. All I know is, whoever the target audience is, it's not me."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"J. Michael Straczynski of Babylon 5 fame turns his epic storytelling to the comics page. In Rising Stars, he's laid the groundwork for an enormous story, one with a definite beginning, middle, and end, that will take years to tell (like Babylon 5). And he gets off to an amazing start.The first four issues in this 8-issue collection tell the story of a strange force which strikes the town of Pederson, Illinois. The force affects only the 113 in utero babies at the time of impact; all 113 are born with superhuman powers. The story is told by Poet, one of the 113, and he tells it from 60 years or more after the force struck. The story is told in an elaborate and fascinating flashback structure; and through it we meet many members of the enormous cast, and also learn that one of them began murdering the others.Issues 5-8 are a letdown from this incredible setup. Instead of continuing as an inventive superhero murder mystery, it devolves into a generic superhero punch-'em-up. We learn who the killer is in book 5 (WAY too early to be giving out that information), battle lines are drawn, sides are chosen, and shots start getting fired. Even more cliched are the shadowy government conspiracy figures who keep dropping in and out of the narrative. And, worst of all, the Bible-thumping televangelist is cast as the slimy evil manipulating vermin. I have no love for televangelists, that's for sure, but to make the televangelist the villain? It's SO easy. It's SO obvious. Straczynski can do better.Now, it's probably too early to be doubting Straczynski's storytelling skills. Babylon 5 only got better year after year, after all. And 8 issues is VERY early into the proposed run of Rising Stars. Which is why I will be sure to pick up Vol. 2, whenever it comes out. If it weren't Straczynski, and if he hadn't created such a fascinating world in the first 4 issues, I wouldn't be saying that. But I trust Straczynski to climb out of the rut he dug himself into in books 5-8.A note about the artwork: generic Todd MacFarlane/Image comics school of art. Totally lacking in distinction, but it gets the job done.5 stars for the 1st half. 2 1/2 stars for the second half."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"This is, by far, one of the greatest comics I've ever read. A great story line, well developed characters, fantastic artwork, and JMS's engrossing writing makes Rising Stars a true classic. The story is written with such authenticity and emotional depth you are drawn into the world of \\"The Specials\\". It's a real thinking persons comic (but don't think it's all dialogue...there are great battles and superhero action sequences in every issue !).I think JMS did a great job in portraying what would happen if ordinary people were given great powers. Who would use it for Evil? Who would use it for Good? Would the world embrace these \\"Specials\\" or fear them? JMS lays out a world where all these ideas are explored. Rising Stars is a comic that exemplifies all the qualities of great comics.Highly recommended !Also recommended: Anything by J.

Maybe... but if jms' other works are an indication, he's lulling the reader into a false sense of &quot;been there, seen that&quot; before really turning over the table. And without spoiling anything, readers who follow the newstand releases can readily tell that the story is now in a place far from what one might expect from the latter part of this book...

I'm not a fan, in particular, of JMS, but after an enthusiastic conversation in a comic shop about something on par with \\"Astro City\\", I decided to pick this book (novel) up.It's not Astro City. It's not \\"Wild Cards\\" (although, with only a little malice, I could say that it tries). I got a bit tired of the single-page descriptions of the Specials while the main characters, particularly the narrator, remained so undefined. Still, it was a good read, and I'll pick up the next one.I really like novels and fiction about super heroes. I feel something can be added in a purely verbal medium, and as much as I like plain old comic books, I think novelizations need to be supported; better to move the genre to a new form than to lose it entirely. ...For the rest, I see potential for a reasonably smart \\"super hero story\\", something that's not all that easy to come by.As for JMS & comic fans who stumble on this review, I strongly urge all of you to also look into the whole Wild Cards series."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"The story is told well, but that's because Cover is working off of Stracynski's original story. The Graphic Novel is better. I was hoping for more insite into characters, more depth than can be put into the GN, but that isn't so. If this had more depth I'd have appreciated it more. For what I got out of this novel, I could have read the Graphic Novel (and did prior to reading this). I got nothing new about the characters, no new details or insites into the chararacters or the story. Pity. If Cover had done more with it, it could have been quite good, considering he had really great material to work with."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"First, let's get this clear: This is a compilation of issues 1-8 of a comic book that's projected to go on for quite a while. Not a whole lot is settled by the time the book ends. If you get into this story, you're in for the long haul.That said, it's a very good story. Like my all-time favorite comic book, _Watchmen_, Rising Stars gets deep into the motivations of all the featured superheroes. Straczynski also has come up an new twist on the genre- while all the superheros share a common origin, they also share a particular bond that drives the plot. Furthermore, it's already been made clear that the creation of the superheroes is a significant plot element, and that we haven't been told the secret about it.Finally, the main character, Poet, has a mythic quality that has a lot of emotional resonance for me.

Michael Straczynski continues to impress me. This little-known book (Rising Stars: Vol. 1) is a storytelling gem. His character development is top-notch. He's one of just a handful of writers that can take a super hero story and make it feel real.Volumes 2 and 3 are also well crafted. My only complaint is the constant change of artists. All of the artists are good, it just disturbs the flow of the books a bit. Straczynski's masterful writing makes up for this minor gripe.Check out J.M.S.'s \\"Supreme Power\\" books, and also \\"Midnight Nation,\\" both are stunning titles. These books are for older audiences, not that they're overly sexual or violent, I just don't think they are intended for kids.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"Every few years a writer manages to create a comic book that sets a standard within the genre. Miller did so for revamps with \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", Gaiman did so for tragic heroes with \\"Sandman\\", and of course there is Moore's \\"Watchmen\\", which basically set the standard for comic writing in general.And now, we have \\"Rising Stars\\" which raises the bar for social interaction and commentary on the nature of man.While \\"Rising Stars\\" is indeed a superhero series, the most important aspect is not the heroes - it's the conflict of ideals between the Specials and the human race. Given the amount of racial tension present in human history, \\"Rising Stars\\" poses an excellent question: \\"How would humanity react to the sudden emergence of 113 superpowered beings?\\""},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"Straczynski is obviously capable of very powerful, insightful storytelling--just watch seasons 2-4 of Babylon 5. He's really off his game here, though. He starts creating an interesting tale in the vein of Watchmen, but without anything near the density and depth of that series/graphic novel. Here in Rising Stars the narrative is poorly paced overall and suffers from a number of other flaws:* It's sometimes hard to tell which characters are which at first. (And why does Flagg/Patriot have black hair in the first issue and blond hair later? That doesn't help matters.)* It's hard to get a read on what the various characters are all about. Give us more characterization, more motivation, more reason to give a darn about them. That's especially true of the lead protagonist, who's very bland and unsympathetic. It's hard to care about a conflict unless you first care about the people involved in it--that's Writing 101 stuff, very surprisingly neglected here, given the way JMS handled the Narn-Centauri conflict in Babylon 5.* SPOILER! The scenes where the killer reveals himself to Joshua and his father and where they create a conspiracy through the government are just horribly paced, seemingly thrown together in a heartbeat with no decent setup or sense of drama. You're left to guess at any deeper motivations, and not in the good sense of being left wondering in anticipation, but rather just wondering why the author painted everything in such broad, clumsy strokes.* As others have noted, the second half of the book devolves into very juvenile, cliched superheroics. The author is capable of way more than that, and so are comics (see Watchmen again, for a classic example). Please, no kids' stuff, JMS!Hopefully the storytelling will gain refinement, depth, and better pacing in the later issues, but I'm not even sure if I'll give them a try now.As for the art, it's all over the map technically and stylistically, thanks to an army of different pencillers, inkers, and colorists. It starts fine and mostly keeps going downhill, with the last few issues pretty pedestrian, if not weak.The real problem is that no matter how nice some individual images look, the visual storytelling falls flat almost everywhere--just one jumbled, cluttered, hyper-dense page after another. Check out David Lloyd's work on V for Vendetta to see a master of pacing, grace, and restraint at work.This series has some potential, but it really doesn't capitalize on it in this volume."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"First, he turned science fiction upside down and gave it a good shake 'n twist with Babylon 5. Now, J. Michael Straczynski is doing it again with comic books ala Rising Stars. JMS has managed to take the superhero genre -- rife with formulaic villians, \\"super powers\\", and card board plots just begging for gratuitous action -- and turn it into something original and believable. Yeah, that's right: believable. When you get done reading the first act of Rising Stars you feel like these are people you could meet on the streets. Just people with real lives and real problems who just happen to have extraordinary powers. JMS has made superhero comic books realistic, just like he did to scifi with Babylon 5. I promise you'll become attached to these characters and come to love them as people. Not as superhero characters with cheesy names and weird costumes. Granted there are names and costumes a-plenty in Rising Stars. The funny part is how they came about. Randy Fisk a.k.a Ravenshadow is the best example of that: He was a comic book nut when he was little so decided it would be fun to take on a sort of Batman-like persona complete with costume and name.

That doesn't mean that it is necessarily BAD for a young person to read it (there are other comics that are more graphic in terms of sex and violence), but slapping a &quot;juvenile fiction&quot; label on a work of art that is this mature and complex is a CRIME.JMS is a phenomenal writer in many genres. His venture into the world of graphic novels for grownups is a boon to the comics industry. This story is about kids who were saddled with special abilities they never asked for, and how they all grew up dealing with it. The series gives poignant insight into what it is like to have a misunderstood gift. It is also an ironic slant on the ubiquitous &quot;superhero&quot; genre that has dominated comics since their inception.Don't believe the Library of Congress label.

Each of the characters has depth and seems like a real person (unlike other comic book heros who are 'A' typical ect.) and their are a tons of different story lines running congruently that add a whole extra level of depth to the book.I like XMen, and I apologize to Hardcore XMen fans, but I think XMen has met it's match, and that's J. Michael Straczynski. (Good thing he freelances for Marvel, LOL!)"},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"If you're a reclusive, brooding, self-absorbed, anti-social individual like myself, you'll be able to relate to this book and the main character. Even if your normal, the action and other aspects should at least keep your attention."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"***SPOILERS BELOW!!!***Actually the above demeans Oliver Stone - imagine instead Oliver Stone lobotomized and heavily dosed on psychedelic drugs with super powers and you'll end up with something like this series. Straczynski evidently has some sort of goofy leftist utopian side to him which Top Cow was unable or unwilling to check in this series. As a result, we get some interesting ideas which mutate into a laughably foolish global civics lesson that would have seemed hokey in junior high.The specials empowered by the energy burst in the 60s are generally an interesting lot, and are well characterized. The unfortunate thing though is we eventually find out that all of them are virtual saints and even the nasty ones turn out to have been controlled by other villains and those who survive reform and perform altruistic acts of heroism. Conversely every normal person in the series is portrayed as either blandly inert or villainously evil (save for the saintly doctor). This dichotomy of \\"all the mutants are good, and all the humans are bad\\" would have seemed out of place in X Men plots of 30 years ago, let alone in the modern allegedly adult world of graphic novels.We also have a peculiar liberal boogeyman appear, the evil religious folks conspiring to shut down abortion clinics. Not by bombing them or killing doctors, simply by protesting in front of them with the aid of a glowing angelic Star being manipulated by his evil televangelist dad. Huh, how dare those villains shut down abortion clinics by exercising their right to free assembly! Fortunately the religious Star eventually sees the light, admits his secular humanist sympathies, begins cross-dressing, and sacrifices himself to save the lives of a bunch of Stars and normal humans in Chicago (see below). Sounds silly? Ah, this is but the tip of the iceberg!The general moral superiority of the Stars is shown irritatingly and unimaginatively by many Stone-like pictures of illuminated heros in crucifixion style poses getting riddled with gunfire, blown up with cruise missiles, etc. This becomes endemic in the third volume, as if someone has the DVD of \\"Platoon\\" set in a repeat loop at the scene where Willem Dafoe gets killed in the rice paddy. The art and coloring throughout is not exceptional, and the occasional loss of detail in the faces and expressions of characters is alarming. We also see immense artistic laziness, as the exact same scene is repeated over and over (e.g. Jason picking up big nuclear warheads and flying away while various human soldiers fire a variety of useless weapons at him...)\\"Watchmen\\" had generally leftist politics that nonetheless allowed the series to develop in a mature, believable, and thought-provoking manner. In comparison, the leftist politics here are juvenile, nave, and clich&eacute;d to the point of campiness. When the Stars eventually begin to \\"reform\\" the world, they do so unerringly and with only the best of motives. The mean ol U.S. is disarmed along with every other nation, cocaine crops are vaporized, large corporations exposed as villainous, Middle East problems solved by fairly allocating resources (How reassuring to see that religious differences play no role in the Mid-East Crisis!).Societal problems go away when the US simply stops spending money on defense and instead throws all its money at various sociological problems. A Star President is elected because he has communed with the spirits of the dead and knows all the Dark Secrets of the US, like Who Killed Kennedy. (Not to give anything away, but it turns out to have been.... the CIA!!! Huh!!!)To offend those on the libertarian Left, we have terrorism and crime solved by super-powered vigilantism where the Stars break down doors and beat up / kill the bad guys. None of the plans go awry, all of the bad guys are correctly and discretely eliminated, and none of the Stars abuses their powers in the least.This of course provokes a counter-reaction from the Evil Military Industrial Complex, shown by caricatures of chain-smoking mean old white guy generals, who nuke the President, most of Congress, and thousands of innocent civilians in order to eliminate the few dozen Stars left by the end of the series. Fortunately though the energy released from all the dead Stars permeates the world and makes everybody nice and cooperative, shown in a poorly drawn big panel that may have come from a \\"WatchTower\\" magazine, with various ethnic caricatures being nice to each other shown on a crude map of the continents. It is a surreal moment, but not in a good sort of way.Straczynski is a pretty good writer. Babylon 5 showed none of this weirdness, and his other comics like Supreme Power are far more restrained and subtle. It looks like he was either scripting this on cocktail napkins while drunk at various Al Gore fundraisers, or was simply preoccupied with other projects and giving this less than maximal effort. Top Cow evidently did not notice or care (or at least couldn't do much about it if they did) and as a result we have a saccharine cartoon of a civics lesson that makes Ralph Nader's worldview seem like Machiavelli's.The first volume in the series is a good setup, maybe too derivative of the mask-killer plot of \\"Watchmen\\" and the \\"normal persecution\\" plotting of the X Men movies. The second volume is probably the best one, with a good intermediate stage setting and plotting, but it ends too quickly and then Volume Three, aka Howard Dean's Fantasia begins. Begins kind of dull and shaky, develops nicely, then gets preachy / trite / just plain weird at the end.Straczynski can write decent characters when he tries, and the plot is certainly ambitious and complex. It looks like he simply needed more editorial guidance from his publisher here, and the resulting failure has made a dog's breakfast which has the potential to irritate the literal minded, or amaze the voyeuristic with what a fabulous disaster it all turns into. The worldview and plotting of Volume 3 would seem unsophisticated and unlikely to a high school Intro to Government class, and the spectacle of Straczynski presenting this to an adult audience with a straight face is both stunning and ghoulishly appealing, like a huge traffic accident involving cotton candy. If you like campy misfires that turn into earnest fairy tales loosely based on reality, stick with this series, but if you want a truly transcendent super hero series, get \\"Watchmen\\" instead."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"How many guys can you put in trenchcoats with long hair in a panel? Enough to not know who is talking.Top Cow cheaped their way through a number of artists to bring us a less than stellar tale. Chronic lateness, long term hiatus, dreadful art, cliche and insulting character design, the fact that we are given better writing and better art in Supreme Power and mostly the same story means don't bother.By the time a regular and decent artist was given the job it was to late and people were leaving this monthly title like rats leaving a sinking ship. I'd like to see Gary Frank start the whole series over at #1 so we can forget completely the first few issues.

I don't think a more intelligent superhero comic has ever been written.JMS has clearly given a lot of thought to what makes each character tick, and how they fit in (or don't fit in). For the most part, the characters seem to be drawn from real-world personalities, exaggerated to superpowered proportions, which helps the book's psychological plausibility.Rising Stars is also totally engrossing.

I like the \\"superheroes are people too\\" trend a la THE WATCHMEN and made even more popular by the television series HEROES. The line between hero and villian is blurred, nothing in real life is ever black and white so why must the world of superheroes always be so clear cut? RISING STARS does a wonderful job in keeping the humanity in their heroes, regardless of what path it eventually leads them down. It constantly begs the question to the reader...if you were born with super powers, how would you use them?I admit I am a johnny-come-lately when it comes to comic books. I didn't have the experience of collecting them as a kid so now that I finally found them, I am seeking out the best comics to make up for lost time. RISING STARS: BORN IN FIRE (Vol. 1), a recent discovery recommended by my local comic book guy, certainly ranks amongst the top I've read thus far. (Comic book guy also turned me on to CHEW and suggested further Straczyinski reading such as SQUADRON SUPREME)I love it when comics are released in a graphic novel form such as this. I prefer to read them as books rather than waiting for issue after issue to be released. What can I say? I love the instant gratification of reading an entire story all at once as opposed to the agony of cliffhangers and weeks of nail biting anticipation.I thought the artwork was sweeping, expressive, dream-like at times and appropriately gory.

I could not put it down until I had finished reading it. I highly recommend this series."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"J. Michael Straczynski (J.M.S.) is one of the best writers in Hollywood. But the temptation with every fantasy author is to write a novel a little too similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's amazing Lord of the Rings. In the same way, the temptation with every comic book author is to write a graphic novel a little too similar to Alan Moore's amazing Watchmen. J.M.S. borrows the style and plot of Watchmen a little more than he probably should, especially in the beginning of the story. To J.M.S.'s credit, though, he manages to change the storyline considerably as the story progresses.Rising Stars is an exciting story with incredibly stylized art. It feels like every panel is a hyper extreme snapshot of a real moment in the lives of the characters.If you like mystery-suspense, then Rising Stars is an excellent read. J.M.S. maintains an engaging storyline up until the end. The end does not feel satisfying, though, since the audience has no idea how the events in the story will affect the world. However, Rising Stars is a valuable contribution to the world of Graphic Novels and is worth reading."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"Collecting the first handful of issues from the original comic book series, \\"Rising Stars: Born in Fire\\" satifies on many levels. You get the things you expect in a good superhero saga (colorful characters, colorful costumes, fascinating powers on display); some things you don't see as often in such a saga (shadowy government conspiracy, a genuine murder mystery, varying levels of stability among the superpowered individuals); and, rarest of all in this genre, true thematic complexity (sympathies shift and morph, and shift and morph again). It's really a bang-up piece of work, and (never fear) a very entertaining one. I'm talking both about this first volume and the entire series as a whole, which gets more interesting as things progress. But don't worry, this first volume in itself is very, very good."},{"Title":"Rising Stars, Vol. 1: Born In Fire","review":"This is Rising Stars Vol. 1 Chapters 1-8This is the 1st of a 3 part series.Great graphic novel.

In the last decade, i've only picked up a few graphic novels, all of them the usual suspects (V for Vendetta, Dark Night Returns, Watchmen, Kingdom Come, Sandman, Ronin, etc.). So i think i'm picky. And i really like this. Enough to read it in one sitting and then rush out to buy the three other graphic novels i found by JMS.i'm not a JMS fan. Never saw Babylon 5. i only picked this up because of the recommendations here. i'm really happy i did. Others have described the story so i'll just mention the tone. It's another adult-type comic where the good guys have insecurities and the world at large doesn't worship them. Many of these people with superpowers can't get decent jobs and die as lonley, TV-dinner eating janitors. Some have bad tempers, some are wimps, many are child bullies, a few are primo donnas, all pretty standard human stuff. Think Watchmen. It's the kind of environment (real world) that i know others claim is overdone in comics but i don't think it's done nearly enough.So it breaks with the cliches of most comics in that there aren't clear good guys and bad guys, where human motivation plays a big role and where the public is more scared than thankful. Others here have said the book is cliche, derivative and poorly paced. Maybe i'm just not smart enough to notice, but i thought it was done wonderfully and uniquely. The only really, really horrible reversion to standard comic book style is at the very end of the second volume (Power). And that volume is pretty good.

Becuase it was given to me, I felt a responsiblity to keep reading. This in not an area I am interested in which is a bit part of my review. I would assume that at this point the book would be outdated."},{"Title":"The Life Model of Social Work Practice","review":"This book is the intellectual cornerstone of most generalist model social work education in the United States. In that respect it exemplifies much of what wrong (and there is a great deal wrong) with the generalist model. This is a book that social work educators seem to like. However, when you ask most students or practitioners, the response is less enthusiastic.Where I went to school it was considered heresy to criticize the life model, because it is a \\"major\\" theory that belongs uniquely to social work. That's too bad, because if this is a high point of social work theory, then it speaks poorly for our intellectual base.The life model, like the social work profession, seems organized around being as inclusive as possible in the service unity. This harkens back to the social work profession arising out of the unification of several diverse, often fractious social welfare movements. Inclusiveness is important to social work as a defining value of the profession. But in the attempt to be as inclusive as possible, the life model dilutes itself as a usefull basis for intervention.The life model rests on the (obvious) premise that aspects of the persons biopsychosocial ecology interact; and that intervening in the that ecology may have a salutary effect on the client. What's worse, the theory treats this understanding as if it were some kind of end point, rather than a basic underpinning of understanding human behavior. Understanding that there is an ecology in which to intervene tells you nothing about how to intervene, or how to anticipate the effects of your interventions. What good do we do our trainees to be educating them with model? What good do we do our clients?If social workers are to join our professional cousins in the modern world it needs to move beyond simplistic and obvious theories like the life model. Intellectual inclusiveness does not have to mean being general to the point of irrelevance. The teaching of this theory in social work education dilutes our strength. We live in a time when, more than ever, our society and our clients need us to be thoughtful as well as compassionate. We need to do better than this."},{"Title":"The Life Model of Social Work Practice","review":"This book is the more meatier of the generalist social work class usual suspects. Coming from a clinical psychology background (depth) to a social work one (breadth), the move to this perspective was disorienting. This book was the first one that successfully communicated the value of this approach: communicating the intricacies in totally grasping (which is more than just acknowledging their existence) the multitude of systems and their configurations (possibilities) that can be impinging on the client, and vc. vs., before plunging to a preconceived model that serves the workers anxiety more than the actual client's needs. Social Systems theories must be very broad because the impact of systems have pervasive, and cumulative, effects that can easily be missed if you focus too quickly on the wrong thing. You need a real grasp of the \\"material\\" you are working with, this includes the client and the client in his/her environment (all of what that means- the many world within the client and that are made up by and surround her). That can be overwhelming if you aren't comfortable with all of this. This book is good in that it helps you get comfortable, while being rich enough for the theoretically minded so you don't feel like you are reduced to reading a cookbook, like some of the others."},{"Title":"Faith Hill -- Breathe: Piano/Vocal/Chords","review":"THIS IS ONE OF HER BEST,THIS A MUST.

He larded the book with praise for the monetarist economist Milton Friedman, whose well-known and disastrous impact on Chile's economy was, oddly, not referred to in the book.Thatcher's monetarist fallacy was that the battle against inflation was the overriding economic aim, because low or zero inflation would produce higher growth. But in the real world, other things being equal, low inflation was not the cause of high growth but the effect of low growth, and high inflation was not the cause of low growth but the effect of high growth. Monetarism's battle against inflation was a policy of deflation, forcing unemployment and low wages on the working class.

I have had a long interest in Van Gogh and found this book to be fascinating, an almost voyeuristic look into his short life. I am glad to see that it is available * * and would hope that people now seeing the traveling Van Gogh portraiture exhibit might read it.De Leeuw has compiled letters covering over 25 years of Van Gogh's life, letters that offer the reader an intimate look into the artist's thoughts and emotions. He writes about his friendships, his family, his attempts at love affairs, his religious beliefs and questions, and most importantly, about his art. These letters reveal him as anything but the anti-social person often portrayed in the past, with the ones about his relationship with his brother Theo being particularly touching.Van Gogh was a prolific correspondent and an absolutely wonderful writer.

These letters beautifully capture his soul and spirit and reveal him as the caring, expressive and socially aware person that he was. The combination of strength of character and vulnerability expressed in these letters explain both the intensity and sensitivity of his work."},{"Title":"The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh (Illustrated)","review":"A very fine collection of the letters, with multiple sides of VVG revealed. To read a collection of letters by an artist whose work you know very well is to invite yourself to take a look at him as a person.

I'm glad that Roskill didn't make a selection that focused solely on the more famous and theatrical depressions.I don't agree that this work reveals Van Gogh as a writer. For me, they definitely confirmed his status as a painter. At his best in these letters, he's painting with words.Which doesn't make it a less interesting read.

To further complicate matters, Artifact expert Darya Lang finds her academic turf threatened with the sudden appearance of newcomer Quintus Bloom who tells her he has discovered a new Artifact and also has a theory about the Builders and the purpose of their Artifacts. He thinks they were built by future humans to foster our development.In a huff, Darya Lang sets out to explore Labyrinth and prove Bloom wrong. Hans Rebka, after a lover's quarrel with Lang, has no idea where she went and undertakes the exploration of another newly altered Artifact. Meanwhile, Louis Nenda and Atvar H'sial enter Bloom's employ as he explores the Torvil Anfract, the Artifact discovered in the last book of the series, TRANSCENDCE.The simultaneous exploration of these Artifacts gets a trifle tedious and confusing, but the characters make up for it."},{"Title":"Convergence","review":"If you are a sci-fi-fan you will love this book I had a copy of the Heritage Universe all the books in one.

Foreshadowing his future leanings as a poet, Olson writes &quot;Ishmael&quot; more like a prose poem than stodgy dissertation. Yet, however unique the form, it seems strangely predetermined. For it is only through a poetic nature that it could distill such huge, multilayered concepts into an accessible and short (119 pg.) essay. This reissue--it was first published in 1947--takes the reader through Shakespearean influence on &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; Melville's struggle with faith, and the importance of place--to name only three examples. The future rector of the short-lived, yet highly influential, Black Mountain College in North Carolina, creates an energy out of words bested only by &quot;The Whale&quot; itself. As Olson stated to his colleague, Merton Sealts, Jr., who wrote the new afterword to the essay: &quot;I see that The White Death has descended upon You too.&quot; And it will upon you as well. After reading this incisive, lyrical, and engaging piece, you will want to return to &quot;Moby Dick&quot; before you've closed its pages."},{"Title":"Call Me Ishmael: A Study of Melville","review":"It should come as no surprise that the world's greatest novel would inspire the world's greatest essay of literary criticism. Sadly, Olson's ideas did not appeal to members of the elite Melville Society, and to this day they still consider him a &quot;crank.&quot; A real pity, because Olson will be remembered long after they are forgotten."},{"Title":"Call Me Ishmael: A Study of Melville","review":"Charles Olson selected a snappy title for his book, but his elliptical writing style and the few interesting nuggets of knowledge that he offers up preclude a more enthusiastic recommendation. Another critic of Melville writes that, in Call Me Ishmael, Olson \\"rather enigmatically\\" relates Moby-Dick to the Osiris myth of ancient Egypt (one of the nuggets). Those who find this book more \\"lyrical\\" than elliptical and enigmatic, should read the section on Moby-Dick inStudies in Classic American Literature (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D. H. Lawrence). It, too, avoids the style of \\"stodgy dissertation,\\" but is better written and predates Olson's work by 2 decades. Olson offers evidence from Melville's letters and writings that he initially wrote a more pedestrian whaling book for the mass market, then, inspired by Hawthorne and Shakespeare, transformed it over the course of a year into the poetic epic that we read today. Jean-Paul Sartre suspected this multi-stage development as he reviewed the French translation of Moby-Dick, and this supporting information is important to those interested in the author as well as the work. I found Olson's explanation of the Bulkington character most interesting, as his brief, but pointed, introduction and immediate fade to nothingness in Moby-Dick is itself enigmatic. After reading Call Me Ishmael you may want to move on to the compendium of criticism,Twentieth Century Interpretations of Moby-Dick: A Collection of Critical Essays (A Spectrum Book)(M.T.Gilmore, ed.). Gilmore includes the chapter \\"Captain Ahab and His Fool\\" from Call Me Ishmael (another nugget relating Ahab and Pip to Lear) but offers as well a wide range of other criticism, touching romantic symbolism, 19th century American technological sociology, biblical metaphor, and more."},{"Title":"Call Me Ishmael: A Study of Melville","review":"Or, if you have read and re-read the current bestseller Ahab's Wife, and you are looking for another classic treatment of the Moby Dick story not featured on Oprah Winfrey's daily chat show, you might pick up Olson's famous theoretical exposition of Melville. In 1947, Charles Olson hadn't written much poetry and he was just coming off a failed political career as a minor functionary in Roosevelt's New Deal, but somehow he got his act together with CALL ME ISHMAEL. Nowadays, everyone is in on the Melville revival but in the immediate postwar years Melville had only really been in the canon for twenty years or so, so Olson was working out something new and undone in American literature. His book didn't sell particularly well, it's challenging and high-toned, but it has remained in print continuously for almost 60 years. Let's see if AHAB'S WIFE can say the same!"},{"Title":"100 Most Popular Scientists for Young Adults: Biographical Sketches and Professional Paths (Profiles and Pathways Series)","review":"The authors provide short biographies of scientists from the United States in the twentieth century. Each biography is a few pages. Some of these were a bit dry while others were very inspirational. This could be a good book for H.S. students interested in science."},{"Title":"100 Most Popular Scientists for Young Adults: Biographical Sketches and Professional Paths (Profiles and Pathways Series)","review":"I loved this book. One thing wrong with it though: the title. It should be called 100 Model Modern Scientists for Aspiring Scientists.This book is aimed at young scientists in high school who are looking to be scientists. There are men and women scientist from various countries and times (all in the later Modern Age [1800s and 1900s]) who studies in astronomy, chemistry, electronics, physics, atmospheric science, environmental science, general earth sciences, geology, oceanography, paleontology, anthropology, biology, genetics, and medical science. Some are famous for theories, some for inventions, others for books or TV shows, and still others for discoveries.For each scientist there is a nickname, field of study, career highlights, important contributions, career paths, key dates, advice, and reverences, other books on that person of field of study. There is a picture with about 30% of them. Exactly 500 pages of the text cover exactly 100 scientists.Depending on what you are interested in some people could be rather boring. Many have very interesting life stories...some don't. It does not have a lot of technical or scientific jargon and stays quite simple.

History)","review":"Today we do not think of historians as creative writers as such, but this is an attitude that has only grown up recently. Winston Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his historical writing, but it difficult to see any contemporary historian contending for such an honour. The historian's craft is so much seen now as a technical one, 'mastering the sources' is considered to be the summit of achievement in historical writing. Also, the historican has also to master some sociology, political science, and statistics, besides mere writing. Possibly, there is a lot of good in the modern attitude, but we have probably lost in many places, the art of good writing. Motley, like all his contemporaries except perhaps Parkman or Prescott, is not now considered a historian of the first rank. But, by God, the man could write! If you want the best modern account of the birth of the Netherlands as a modern nation state, read Geoffrey Parker's 'The Dutch Revolt'. However, if you enjoy a tale spun around a real-life hero, William the Silent, and how he led an embattled people to freedom, written in the finest prose, then this book is for you. Incidentally, some modern historians do still value the insights of their predecessors, like Macauley in Britain, but are probably their superior in research methodologies and interpretation. For me, in the art of writing, the likes of Motley, Prescott, Parkman, and Macauley are infinitely better!"},{"Title":"The rise of the Dutch republic ;: A history (Everyman's library. History)","review":"Although first written in 1856 the author applies a spell-binding style to tell the gruesome history of the birth of the Dutch nation from the unrelenting suppression of the religious and political aspirations of a sophisticated and rich people. In Volume I Motley covers the period from Emporer Charles V to the appointment of Count Alva as military overlord of the Netherlands. In Volume II he continues to describe in great detail the circumstances, personages, and intrigues that so painfully come together and nearly destroy the industrial and economic powerhouse in the low countries. He excellently explains the motives and actions of William of Orange, the follies of his noble friends and their destruction, the cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition, and, eventually, the rising of the people against the hated Alva and his mercenary murderers. It is the start of the 80 Year War of which this book covers the first seven bloody years.Since I found this series in my father's book case and started reading I have not been able to put it down. The series take the reader to live the period and understand the human drama and the hope and perseverance that lift a population to found the most powerful nation in the world."},{"Title":"The rise of the Dutch republic ;: A history (Everyman's library. History)","review":"John Lathrop Motley's history of the 40-year Dutch War of Independence (1568-1609)is a major work. The three-volume set called the &quot;Rise of the Dutch Republic&quot; is only part of the story, carrying the reader only up to the date of 1584 when the Constitution of the United Netherlands was implimented.Motley later in 1874 added another four-volume set called &quot;History of the United Netherlands&quot; which brings the reader up to the date of 1609 when most of the fighting in the Netherlands between Spain and the Protestant nobles of the Nehterlands ended. Needless to it is a major commitment for the reader to get the whole story that Motley wants to tell. Indeed Motley could have told more. The official recognition of Dutch Independence did not come until Spain signed the Peace of the Hague in 1648 at the conclusion of the Thirty Years War (1619-1648).Motley's outlook on the events covered in the seven volumes leaves no doubt that his sympathies lie with the Dutch. His bias is heavy handed and approaches propaganda. Still for the reader with the time and desire to learn about the history of the Dutch people the entire set is enlightening."},{"Title":"Nikon F Camera","review":"Books can be time machines, drawing you into the past.The Nikon Trilogy is a series of three books devoted to the Nikon F camera. It covers the period from 1959 to 1973, the years of manufacture of the camera that changed the way pictures were made. Volume 1 deals with the Nikon F in great detail, describing each part of the camera body and the way that the camera evolved over the period of manufacture. The second volume deals with the lenses that were made during this same period for the Nikon F, and the third volume with the accessories that were available for the camera.As I read through the first book, with its listing of the years that variations to the basic camera were introduced, with related serial numbers, I recalled that up on the top shelf of a closet, my original Nikon F, purchased in 1961, was packed away. I stopped reading and pulled down the box from the shelf. There it was, Serial Number 6420249, manufactured, according to the author, Uli Koch, in the summer of 1960. I read through the sections on the frame counter, and the shutter speed indicator and the film rewind, carefully checking each description against my shiny old chrome-plated friend. At last I understood the cryptic marking &quot;EP&quot; on the rewind knob that meant the camera had been produced for sale in the Post Exchange, where I had purchased the camera.When I got to the section on lenses, not only did I find the production data on my 50mm, 28mm and 135mm lenses, but I also found the description of the 85-250mm zoom, the lens that my heart had ached for, but that I could never afford. And there was the 300mm lens that I had bought second hand when a stroke of good fortune in my career brought me a sum of money that I didn't have to carefully budget for the uses of my young family.When I got to the section on the clip-on external selenium exposure meter that I bought for my camera, the one that had broken and never been replaced, I found how difficult it was to remember the layout of the parts from more than 40 years ago, so that I could not recall if it had been a Model 1 or a Model 3. The description of the FTN Photomic finder, that introduced through-the-lens metering, reminded me of the break-through that I had with a difficult boss. Somehow, we talked about our cameras and learned that we both owned F's. He told me how wonderful through-the-lens metering was; I bought the FTN and found new joy in photography; and I found a new friend with whom I could share that joy.Undoubtedly, these books are aimed at serious collectors of a single model of a camera, and they will relish the small details that are contained in these books, including stories about how Nikon developed certain equipment for the Tokyo Olympics and of the battles of Nippon Kogako in Germany that forced the company to market its products in that country with the Nikkor label instead of the Nikon label. One may wonder if the author finds it so incredible that a company in the only country to have had not one but two atomic bombs dropped on it should call a metering system &quot;Photomic&quot;,so that, he suggests, the derivation is from the combination of photo and automatic. One can laugh good naturedly at the sometimes-awkward translation of the text from its original German to English.On the other hand, some can look upon these volumes as a chance to become reacquainted with a friend of more than forty years. When I finished reading the book, I pulled out the old carousels of my first Nikon years, and ran the projector, and wondered what had happened to so many of the people whose images I'd saved on film and in the recesses of my mind. As I read the books I vowed to find batteries for the FTN finder and take my Nikon F out one more time. At the same time, I knew that the day when I would have something to photograph and would forgo the chance of getting the kind of picture that my current cameras can capture so surely and easily would probably never come.And yet, as I looked at what was perhaps the first picture I ever shot with a camera labeled Nikon, I thought of those almost-lost years fondly and appreciated Koch's work."},{"Title":"Nikon F Camera","review":"First, be aware: This book is also sold as one of a box set, The Triology. If you by them separately, even in the same shipment, they cost $40 more, and you pay shipping and handling for three in stead of one!I have read the first chapter of The Camera. I understand that the text was written in German and translated into English, which explains the sometimes awkward language. The introduction describing the historical events leading to the developement of 35mm SLR camera and eventually to the introduction of the Nikon F is in my opinion inaccurate and opinionated and would better be left out since the rest of the book obviously is well researched and thorough, although no sources or references are given.There is put a large amount of work into producing these books and there are lots of interesting pictures and lists of the vast amount of lenses and accessories for the camera."},{"Title":"Nikon F Camera","review":"Uli koch is so accurate in the assesment of all things Nikon this book is invaluable if you shoot Nikon."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This is a book about an archaeologist, Dr. Ben Kazin, who has been looking for a lost city all his life.

So Ben along with his lovely assistant, Sally Benator, and his friend Louren, Venture out to the Bushvelt of South Africa. As the story goes along Ben and Sally find more and more little discoveries that lead to much bigger ones. Along the way Ben Kazin meets new people one of which is a small Bushman named Xhai. He also meets a few Terrorists along the way that threaten his life. In this book I learned lots of new things about Africa, mainly the Bushvelt. The author describes the landscapes of the Bushvelt in amazing ways. He describes many different animals such as the Gemsbok and the Eland. There are also descriptions of the surrounding cities and archaeological points of interest near Ben's lost city. The author also describes cities that still thrive to this day like the country of Johannesburg and the city of Cape Town which are located in South Africa. I would recommend this book to people who like fiction, adventure, danger, and history. I would also recommend this book to experienced readers not little kids. This is a book I know many people will enjoy."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"The first part of this novel takes place during the present. When Dr. Kazan discovers the lost City of the Moon there are many unanswered questions about the past. In the second part of the book the author takes you to the citie's past and the unique civilization that lived there. Wilbur Smith incorporates some of the characters from the present into the ancient past. It is quite an imaginative plot.What fasinated me was that on the T.V.show NOVA there was a documentary about an archaeological discovery of the lost city of Ubar in southern Arabia. Pictures from the space shuttle confirmed the location of this city buried in the sand. It makes you stop and think of how little we know of the ancient past."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"Has SpoliersTake this review with a pinch of salt because I am talking about a reading from 20 years ago. I read about 8 (more than 5 not more than 10) Wilbur Smith books. I was young. They were racy, stereotypical, testosteroned, adventures. After about 8 books, they all seemed the same. But this one sticks in my mind. It was different. It is experimental. It is the only book by Wilbur that I can remember. Some of the viewers complain that it does not have a conclusion. It is open. It is a tragedy. It is even philosophical. The whites may be super intelligent and great long distance runners but they are doomed. And the book goes some way to say why. It reminds me a little of One Hundred Years of Solitude (because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth). It is a Wilbur Smith adventure. But it is the book where I feel he shared and bared his soul more than any other. It is a troubled book. And it sticks with you, with me anyway. It has a sort of honest self loathing, an exploration of the dark side of White civilsation. It is Oedipus in Africa. The Heart of Darkness. I want to read it again."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This is Smith at the peak of his formidable powers.

When he finished with Sunbird,he gave it to me and said, &quot;Now you'll find out why I've been so preoccupied with this book.&quot;After only a few pages, I learned why Sunbird is one of those rare books that leaves your heading spinning.

It is about Carthegenians living in Ancient Africa in a place called The City Of The Moon!"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"A fascinating peek into the mind of a racist historical revisionist. The author's mind, that is, rather than his characters (though his main characters certainly echo his sentiments).I found \\"The Sunbird\\" to be a fairly well-written, moderately entertaining archeological adventure read, along the lines of the \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies but set in South Africa. However, like other reviewers, I had to smile (and eventually frown) at the rather ridiculous overdrawing of the caricatures...er, characters. To sum it up simply, whilst pointing out Smith's hidden agenda -White people - talented, brilliant, rich and beautiful!Blacks (Smith's term) - evil, traitorous, country-stealing terrorists.Having grown up in the deep south, but having lived in New York for the last 20 years, I began feeling a sick sense of Deja Vu within the first 40 pages of Smith's book. The deep, abiding, and often unconscious racial prejudice which permeated much of the south in the 50's and 60's (and still today to a degree) is evident all through this book. And, not only racial prejudice, but prejudices in general towards women and class structure are also in attendance.I love a good yarn, and Wilbur Smith seems certainly seems capable of spinning one. However, whenever I can detect an agenda behind the book driving its story, characters and dialogue, I tend to resist. Especially when the agenda is something as hateful as apartheid. I picked this book up on a whim in a supermarket, not knowing Smith's work or the fact that this book, while being printed in 2002, was written almost 30 years ago. Knowing his worldview and how it appears in his writing, I won't be reading another.Interesting side note - Regarding my earlier comment about \\"deep, abiding, and often unconscious racial prejudice\\" - many of my older friends and relatives still living in the south would probably comment upon reading this book, \\"What racism??\\" They were brought to mind while reading some of the other reviews of this book."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I started, W.

W. Smith takes his time and takes near forever to determine that you are not in London or elsewhere in England but in fact in S. Africa. I did like once you acutaly got to the &quot;historical&quot; viewpoint of the book but the rest was overly predicatable and many avenues never lead anywhere.

Could it be reincarnation? Is that what helped them uncover this city? Whatever the reason, this was a fascinating exploration of an extinct culture and a great read."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"The Sunbird is written by the same author who wrote the highly-acclaimed The Seventh Scroll. And, as is the case with Smith's other novels, the story takes place in Africa. The first half of the novel covers the events in the lives of three people: a brilliant scholar, a wealthy businessman, and a young female understudy. The second half is an ingeniously told flashback through time and what might have been the previous or past lives that these same three have had many centuries ago.There's plenty of adventure, politics, history, and romance in this novel. And, as always with Wilbur Smith, lots of violence. In some ways, Smith reminds me of the American author, Harry Crews. They both love to write about the primitive side of human nature. Plenty of violence, cruelty, greed, and injustice. Smith is different though, in that he is also a writer willing to put great beauty and passionate romance in his novels to balance out the ugly. One cannot read a Wilbur Smith novel and not yearn to visit the African continent.In my opinion, The Sunbird is not quite as good as The Seventh Scroll. However, it is still a great reading experience and definitely better than most adventure novels out there."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"By far my favorite of Wilbur Smith's books. The plot is a bit fanciful; a man who is scorned professionally as an archaeologist and who carries a chip on his hunchbacked shoulder, his beautiful assistant, his wealthy friend and patron who protects him, bankrolls him, steals his girl. The characters are not exactly innovative and fit well within Smith's genre types. However what makes this book worth repeated reading is the device of using two separated times starring the basically the same characterizations and scenes. The picture of a great ancient civilisation, its norms and culture, its history and glory and its ultimate tragedy is painted in bold confident brush strokes on the canvas of Africa. The descriptions are vivid, the imagination bold. One experiences the vignettes in the lives of Huy Ben Amon and Tanith as mush as Benjamin Kazin and Sally Benator. One rejoices as their lives take shape and love blooms, one mourns as they stumble towards the final tragedy. But moving as it is, the book is fatally flawed by Smith's overt use of it as an allegory for the battle fought by the blacks against the whites of Zimbabwe and South Africa. His sympathies with the latter are evident as he mourns the destruction of a system that though evil, is &quot;better than its proposed replacement&quot;. A book to marvel at and enjoy, but beware of his hidden agenda."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I've recently re-read &quot;The Sunbird&quot; after many years, and found it just as terrific a read as ever. Without giving away any plot points, what got me the first time still gets me, the well-executed parallel stories, modern and ancient. The charge of racism voiced by several reviewers is perhaps understandable, but one has to keep in mind that the book was written at a time (the late 1960s) when the kinds of events described in the &quot;modern&quot; section of the story (tribal Africans taking up arms against descendants of white colonists) were common. I didn't find Timothy Mageba a one-dimensional caricature, but a complex and conflicted man who finds it necessary to sacrifice personal loyalties for what he believes is a larger good. Anyway, I don't want to make the book sound like a Poli Sci text, it's a fast, entertaining read, full of intrigue and romance, and eerie enough to make your hair stand up a little at times. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan. &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read. Be sure you read &quot;River God&quot; before you read &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot;. If you like &quot;River God&quot; and &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot; you will also love &quot;The Sunbird&quot;. It is very similar in theme and is its own sequel in the fashion of &quot;River God&quot; and &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot;. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. Now that many of his books are being reprinted, I am finding lots of fellow admirers of Mr. Smith. When you just can't wait for Wilbur to come up with another one, you might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett. It is very similar in style and quality to most of the Courtney series."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This book has so much excitement and adventure packedinto it that in the hands of a lesser author it would have beenexpanded into a trilogy. The vivid writing brings Africa alive:the reader can feel the hot sun and the cool lake waters,smell the dust and grasss, and hear calls of seabirds aswell as thunderous war chants and gunfire. I have probablyread it 20 times and have four separate editions of it, so I am a fan. Please keep in mind that it does have flaws, butyou will look long and far for a more exciting book ... if you ever find one."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"The SunbirdI've read other reviewers who pan this book, calling it unrealistic and saying it promotes white supremacy. I can't disagree more. I am 66 years old & first read this book when it was a Readers Digest chosen book in the mid Seventies for book of the month club. I was in my thirties then and thought it magical and telling of a story that would be written just as the attitudes of the people were in the century the story would have happened. There is nothing racist intended. I have since read it about every three years, buying newer printed versions as it has come to be such a special book in my heart. I have all of Wilbur Smiths books but this is my favorite.The Sunbird suggests an answer to the mystery \\"what happened to the defeated Carthaginians the Romans destroyed? It begins with two modern day archeologists excavating a newly discovered city in central Africa. The two are very dissimilar; one being a rich and gracious eccentric multi-millionaire who is funding the project, and his faithful henchman, a brilliant and very strong man who happens to be a hunchback.The story begins in the modern day digs and as our heroes fall prey to traps that are left for grave robbers we jump back in time to these same two heros who are the two main leaders in a hidden city that was founded by the Carthaginians after they escaped the wrath of Rome. This city is hidden at the end of a river in the center of darkest Africa and tells the magical story - a \\"what if?\\" story that is part fictional history and part ancient legend come to life. It is full of action as it might have happened in that time and the struggles this ancient city went through in trying to survive.The Sunbird lifts your spirit and excites your immagination. This was one of Wilbur Smith's first books and is more fiction than fact, whereas his writings of the past 20 some years have been based soundly on historical fact that is told in fictitious story to make it interesting. Like his current 4 books on ancient Egypt.I strongly recommend it for all ages from the teens to \\"old folk\\" like me!"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I have read this book twice only. My daughter has just reached the age where it would be appropriate for her and, while feeding her hunger for books, I remembered how good this book is. The second time I read it in a single sitting following a party where I didn't drink and I was waiting for everyone else to wake up. They woke, got on with the day and left me there reading. It is that gripping. It's a big book by the way, must be 8 hours or so of continuous reading. I loved the story device of having the same characters inhabit different bodies through the two parallel stories and hated finishing it. So now I'm going to buy another copy and read it again."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"One of the reviewers here claims that 'The Sunbird' is racist in its essence and that W. Smith must have been more careful and write it 'impartially' as the 'Indiana Jones'. I will agree with the first part of this opinion and admit that somewhere I also got annoyed by the implications for the superiority of the 'whites' over the 'blacks'. However, I don't agree with the second part of this view: I prefer Smith writing according to his beliefs and not trying to be 'politically correct', even if that annoys the reader. Further, I believe that this book is so beautifully written and the above issues should only be viewed as secondary. The 'Sunbird' is a magical book that makes you want to read it again and again. Smith's writing is so natural and masterful at the same time that makes the 'Sunbird' an almost classic read. The characters (black and white) are given extremely well, especially Dr. Benjamin Kajin, and the plot always keeps the reader's attention without being predictable. I recommend the 'Sunbird' to everyone- whether you are a Smith fan or not."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I have a 1st edition of this book and have read it more than 10 times since the 70's. I wish I could articulate the impact this book has on me each time I read it - perhaps after the next reading! By the way- the cover on the current reprint, although taken from one of the events in the book, totally misrepresents the story line to any potential reader."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"Edit note: The Kindle version is just appalling. Definitely the worst Kindle book I've seen. At times I couldn't figure out what was meant due to the extensive and frequent errors.====================\\"The Sunbird\\" is imaginative, robustly plotted, and has well-developed characters in exotic locales, with fast-paced action, and an interesting reworking of ancient history make this a terrific read if you can overlook the paternalistic \\"great white man\\" tone of the first half of the novel. African wildlife gets a pretty hard time of it as well what with all the great white hunters taking pot shots at them in the first half and the unlimited slaughter in the second half.The first half of the book is really an elaborate set-up for the second half of the novel which packs an authentic emotive tale of friendship, love, war, and betrayal. The second half is set in an imagined Punic colony which considers itself civilized although it is wantonly cruel. It is a civilization that should not continue, yet the author makes it sympathetic through the focus on close relationships among the protagonists, each of whom mirror the protagonists in the 1972 world of the first half of the book.The setting is somewhere in Botswana in the region of the Zambezi river in Africa of today, (1972 at time of original publication), and also as it might have been between the fall of Catharge, (146 BCE), to somewhere in the mid-5th century. There is a clever mirroring of ancient and modern characters that helps create suspense.The Kindle version seems to have been scanned without benefit of correction. The price is the same as the paperback version (which is actually more expensive than the hardback) but at least the paperback does not contain thousands of typological errors. Often you have to figure out what is meant from context because the errors can be extensive. Apparently not even a basic spell check was run on this text after it was scanned. It is a pity that Amazon does not have some kind of quality control over text that it sells for its Kindle."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This book contains an excellent story based on a very clever idea (the parallel lives). However, this book reads like a cheap romance novel at times, one of the lead characters is extremely handsome and brave and strong and .... Another is an extremely beautiful woman, the other a phyisically deformed genius. Some of the dialogue made me wince - the constant references to the Lo's handsome features, the constant references to doctor Kazin's intelligence.I will definitely not read any other of Wilbur Smith's books!"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I bought the kindle version of this book and couldn't be more disappointed. As a I wandered my way though the typo-littered text I was astounded by the blatant misogynistic attitude of the book. The female characters of the book are constantly described as childish or child-like and must be guided by the greater expertise of the men.I've read many of Wilbur Smith books but I was seriously disappointed by this one. Not only was the editing for the kindle edition exceptionally poor but I am not interested in reading a book that lacks any serious female lead while the two male leads are busy showing off spectacular feats of strength at every turn. The characters are under developed and the plot is unsurprising and boring. I wish I could return the item but unfortunately that option isn't available for kindle books :("},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"The first part of this book is readable not a thriller but good, it has to many pages that doesn't have to do with the story of the lost city, the cave and the treasure but you can read it. The second part of the book, the dream of Benjamin Kazin is just a waste of time, but I have to admit that WS has a lot of imagination.The problem of this book is that doesn't have an end, what happened with the cave? The lost city? The treasure?"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"An interesting premise to begin with. But halfway through the book I started wondering \\"where is he going with this?\\". The material is a bit dated for today's reader. The characters are typical for Wilbur Smith: men are manly and women are damsels in distress.I just felt that if Smith was really trying to draw some kind of parallel between the two worlds, it stayed parallel and never came together. It seemed sometimes that it was a gratuitous adventure in blood, killing and testosterone. It simply did not have any of the political intrigue that I remember from River God (still one of my all time faves) and Warlock."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"Written in a somewhat different formatt from previous Smith novels, but as always well done."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This is a vile book on several levels....P>The characters are completely implausible. They do not possess ordinary human qualities. Instead, they are extraordinary! Just top-flight people! Dr. Ben Kazin speaks 17 languages. He teaches himself ancient Punic in a week, with nothing except a scroll to instruct himself with. He gives a series of lectures at a university. A dozen people attend the first, 600 the last. Why? Because he's just such an incredible guy. Although he is depicted as being a scrawny hunchback, he nearly overpowers half a dozen terrorists single-handedly in hand-to-hand combat.Lauren Sturtevant is also a remarkable guy. Mostly he's jetting about the world, doing deals and making killings. When he isn't doing that, he's usually killing things out in the bush, or scoring with chicks....P>A big problem is that we have to take Smith's word on how great these people are. He will say that one character devastates another with a display of dazzling wit. Rarely, Smith attempts to show us what he means by including the characters' dialog. Invariably, what they say isn't dazzling or witty--just crude and stupid. And the main characters always respond with furious anger, eyes flashing, muscles tensing, etc, whenever anyone disagrees with them. What's with that?Smith believes that the way to make characters memorable is by means of magnitude. Take a trait, and just magnify it. If a little is good, a lot must be really great. An unintended effect of this method, in Smith's hands, is to make all of his main characters insufferably pompous. Smith also is a great believer in drama. The Sunbird is a series of scores of mini-dramas. Most are dead-ends, having little to do with the story--such as it is. An earlier reviewer remarked that the book cover illustration is misleading. He's right. I had to think for a couple minutes before I remembered the bit in the story with the airplanes.The worst part of reading the Sunbird is being inside the head of the narrator--Dr. Ben Kazin. A vain, disgusting, foul man. I cheered when Part One was over. Only then I was in the head of Huy Ben Amon, which may have been worse.The bit about Mandela. The book was written in 1972. Part One is about the \\"discovery\\" of an ancient city. The ANC war against apartheid is a theme. Part II is a flashback to the last days of this supposed ancient kingdom. Smith has the ancient Carthaginians, whom he inaccurately portrays as being white, setting up this huge empire in Southern Africa. They are swept into oblivion by a remorseless, tidal wave of black Africans. Get it? Just like how the '70s must have seemed to hardline Afrikaaners like Smith. In both eras, the blacks are led by another extraordinary human being--except that this one has purplish skin and yellow, smouldering eyes. Smith was definitely cheerleading for apartheid.I loved the book when I read it at 15. It looks pretty horrible to me now."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"Let's first describe the book without passion or judgment. There are two tales, cutely parallel. The first tale is set in the 1960's or 70's. It concerns a South African multilingual super-talented white hunchbacked Anthropologist. This hero, together with his rich (white) friend and patron, explores an archaeological site. The third important character is a black guy, who is talented but alas feels no loyalty to the great country of South Africa. So it's a tale of bonding between two superb white guys and the treachery of a black guy.The second tale is set 2000 years in the past, at which time apparently there was a white empire in southern Africa, whose remnants were being explored as the archaeological site of the first tale. The lead character is the Sunbird who is, ahem, white hunchbacked uber-talented, and the best friend of the king/emperor who is also a great adventurer and hero. And (you guessed it) the third important character is a strong black guy, a bit short of loyalty, who organizes an uprising that destroys the great white empire that surely must have existed in southern Africa.Now I must warn that this review might contain trace amounts of sarcasm, which has been known to be occasionally harmful to straight-thinking minds.This is one great book. I read it when I was a teenager, more that 15 years ago now, but the memory of the wonderful adventures and fundamental truths still burns fresh in my mind. Remember, these were the great days of Apartheid, now sadly lost, but perhaps not for ever.Now, young as I was, I already knew that white people were gods, so the underlying bits of supremacy philosophy did not bother me too much. And, perhaps as Wilbur Smith intended, I was justly disgusted by some black people's refusal to be happy under Apartheid and slavery. And the main white characters are described so well... oh just as white people should be, the men strong and adventurous and always onto new conquests, the women beautiful and marvelous.The only complaint I had with the book was the invention (or is it the truth?) of a white empire in ancient southern Africa. I mean, why bother with this convoluted story of Whites having been in South Africa before? We already know that whites deserve African land (actually, all land) as a divine right, so no justification is needed. But it doesn't hurt of course to be comforted by the safe knowledge that white people were in South Africa already 2000 years ago, and also anywhere else their past presence might be required for the ideological purpose of the day.I hear this book is popular in the American South, you know, that wonderful place you really ought to fearlessly visit especially if you have dark skin, or even better, if you have white skin and a dark-skinned boyfriend. Oh, and I also hear Wilbur Smith didn't stop writing tales after the fall (temporary?) of Apartheid. I wonder what he's writing about now? If I were still a teenager, I'd read and find out, but alas, time passes and I am one no longer."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I love Wilbur Smith's novels, but this one must have been a high-school project that he resurrected for some immediate cashflow. The literary device for the transition from modern to ancient settings was clumsy, and much in both halves was just not plausible. The story had potential, but it was not realized."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I read The Sunbird by Wilbur Smith first when I was 14. Little did I realize the racial overtomes it has! Having read it again, (at 41) I was appalled at the blatant racial bigotry. This book is most likely what any apartheid supporter would love to see be reality. Back when Great Zimbabwe was being said to be built by Whites, Black Africans assumed to have been too ignorant and unintelligent to have built it, scientists were beginning to prove that Black Africans did indeed build Great Zimbabwe. This book, in which a White South African finds a hidden city that is proven to be as big as Great Zimbabwe is and is proven to be built by Whites, is just the sort of fantasy dream many Whites would have wished could have happened.The archaeologist, Ben Kazin, proves &quot;once and for all&quot; that Whites were the builders of the great cities of Africa. The story, finding a hidden and lost city and the fall back into time that came with it, would have been great, had there not been this not-so-hidden agenda of trying to prove that Whites are superior to Blacks. That agenda disgusted me in the extreme and makes reading this book unpalatable for me. If Wilbur Smith had written it as just an Indiana Jones type of story, of finding a hidden city and how the finders dreamed back into time and actually lived the final days, this would have been a great book as well as a great movie. Sadly, for anyone that is reasonably educated on the ancient and recent history of Africa, I would not recommend this book. It would only make you angry. Too bad Wilbur Smith allowed his own prejudices to mar what could have been a really great story!"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I've read several WS books but by the time I got to the second half of the book, I gave up. The story went nowhere.Suggest the Seventh Scroll or Birds of Prey, much better."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"It's a story about a hunchback Archaeologist, his wealthy backer friend, and his pretty assistant and a lost Carthaginian city. It's also an interesting parallel story about the fall of this city. On certain levels it's interesting story with a lot of exciting searching for an Archaeological treasure that I'm sure many Archaeologists would kill for.But it's also quite a sexist and racist story, but then it was written in the 1970's, when this attitude was common, still not right or justified, but prevalent. The attitude that the only way civilization arrived in Africa was because of the benevolent White folk is incredibly annoying and flawed.If you pretend that it's a historical story you can almost forgive the attitudes, however it's an almost, which loses this fairly good story many stars."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"No exaggeration ! I have read absolutely everthing Wibur Smith has written. Sunbird was the first. I loved it from the first.

My second favorite is &quot;Rage of the sea&quot; which I have read so many times I have lost count. Its strong, boisterous, sweeping and very easy to read.

In fairness to Kindle, I received the device several days ago as a holiday gift, and have read only a few books on it. The others were not butchered."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This book is about an Archeologist who discovers the remains of an ancient city in Africa and works to uncover the history of the city and people who lived in it. His dig is funded by his best friend, an incredibly wealthy and cultured man who also has an interest in history and in Africa. The first half of the book is this story and the second is the story of the people in the ancient city, it is done in a way that the characters parallel their contemporary counterparts.This book had some really good parts, what I admire is that Wilbur Smith was able to create such a vivid picture of the ancient civilization. It felt very real rather than romanticized and was very rich in details. While I thought this was good writing, it was also somewhat grotesque to read and not enjoyable to relive the suffering and brutality that the people went through. The story was also an interesting concept and kept a fast pace moving along.I agree that most of the characters were over embellished, their personalities being more grandiose than real. The central characters were described as being a certain way rather than shown through the writing. Also, in the book I was often unclear what their motivation was for what they did, or what the purpose of various scenes in the story were. I agree that the story is strongly bigoted. The archeologist gets to the site and discovers a cave that is well known by local Bushman. The area is beautiful, pristine, and prized by the Bushman as a spiritual refuge. They then find the ruins of the city and proceed to turn the whole area into a big excavation site with generators, a landing strip, security and houses. The archeologists describe having to 'pay off' the government to excavate the site and how they will move the findings to important museums--Which are obviously in Europe. There seems to be little to no respect for the indigenous people of the area. I also felt that the author did little to teach the reader about the history or the people of the area.Overall the book was interesting; but I did not feel I came out of it with something more. It was fairly one dimensional. An amazing book that I would recommend is 'The Mists of Avalon'.The Mists of Avalon"},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"The trick to making this book into a movie would be the casting of Huy Ben-Amon. Danny Devito might possibly play the part, if he practiced with a battle axe for an extended period of time. The real charm of this book is the duality of characters and their parallel existence in Africa's distant past and in the present-day researchers investigating that past. An interesting alternative to the white/black conflict of the book might be the casting of both sides as black. What I would hate to see lost in this novel is the wonderful characterization of Huy Ben-Amon."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"I have read thousands upon thousands of books in my lifetime, but never have I read such a magnificent story as this in all of my 36 years. I first picked up this book at the age of 19, and have read it probably half a dozen more times since then. It is the only book that I have read more than once. Probably geared toward males in general, and not for the weak of heart or stomach. If you don't enjoy this book, you're probably either partially illiterate, lacking honor, courage or some other desirable personality trait. The Croatian reviewer below probably read a bad translation of the book, or has been mentally affected by the recent ethnic conflicts in his country."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This is by far the best Smith novel I have read - comparing it to the likes of &quot; The River God, Seventh Scroll etc.&quot;Right from the word go, Smith's style captivates me.

I'm free to say this as the country he writes about is my own country(Botswana) for those of you who have not read it.This is a must read."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"This book should be purchased with an eye toward Wilbur Smith's strengths as a writer and not as a literary piece. Smith's works are entertaining and adverterous, but little else. His characters are fully developed, but hardly plausible, as well the plots in his book. Think of his writing as a fun trip to an amusement park like Disneyland. The &quot;Pirates of the Caribean&quot; was not intended to be believed, but simply to entertain the imagination. Little more than an afternoon spent escaping reality. So too, this book."},{"Title":"Sunbird","review":"A page turner from the very beginning, another fine book by Wilbur Smith.

The story is of the South and of Vada Love Powell and her son, Apple. Apple springs the news to Vada that he has secretly gotten married to Mary Ann Mele, &quot;an Irish Italian Catholic girl whose mother drives a schoolbus,&quot; news Vada is none too pleased to hear. Set in the 1950's and 1960's, the plot centers around Vada and her friends Marybell Baxter and Enid Symonds, refined ladies of times past, as they come to terms with the changing world around them. The story plays well, and audiences love the humor of the aging &quot;tree-house gang&quot; as they deal with Apple's marriage, his sister-in-law Mary Lou's anthropological photographs of naked New Guinean tribes, and trouble in their beloved Episcopalian Women's Guild. As an actor currently playing Apple Powell onstage, I can strongly recommend this production for its humor, its wit, and its sentimentality."},{"Title":"The book of Mary","review":"In \\"The Book of Mary\\" (translated from the French by Alastair Guinan), Henri Daniel-Rops explores the evidence for and the development of the Catholic Church's dogma regarding the Blessed Virgin Mary. Daniel-Rops begins with a question many Protestants often ask: How did someone who is referenced so few times in scripture become the second most recognizable - and I'll add the second most important - figure in the Bible?The answer, at least in part, is that the very act of her melting into the background is strong testimony of Mary's humility: a \\"lowly Jewish maiden\\", chosen by the Father to wed the Holy Spirit so that she may bear the Son. I ask the Protestant reader of this review to pause for a moment on the ramifications of the preceding line. The Triune God is in love with Mary like nothing else in His creation; full of grace, indeed.Daniel-Rops next explores the appearance of the Blessed Virgin in the Early Church Fathers, and we come across a similar problem as we had in scripture: though established as Theotokos by a consensus of the Fathers, and though Augustine pronounces her preserved from sin (he doesn't specify original or actual), the direct text establishing the Immaculate Conception or the Assumption is not evident.After a discussion of how the apocryphal works of the New Testament may hold some grains of truth about the dogmas of Mary, but are not the source of the dogmas, Daniel-Rops reveals how it was the Tradition of the Catholic Church that discerned most fully the prerogatives of Mary. One of the highlights of this book is in Part 1, \\"The Heart in the Understanding of Dogma\\". Here, the author explains the role of Tradition in the Catholic Church in general and then in particular in the case of the Blessed Virgin: it is not always the Early Fathers, Bishops, or Theologians that have brought to the forefront Church Dogma. He quotes St. Paulinus of Nola, writing at the end of the 4th Century A.D.: \\"take heed of the pulsation of the hearts of the faithful; for it is in those hearts that the Holy Spirit lives!\\"So it is, as well-catechized Catholics know: that Tradition and the teaching Magisterium, as well as Scripture, are all part of the Deposit of Faith. Daniel-Rops makes clear that the Tradition of the dogma of Mary - like the Tradition of the Trinity - is rooted in scripture and does not conflict with it, even if it is not explicit. As Bl Cardinal Newman wrote to Dr. Pusey, \\"I fully grant that devotion towards the Blessed Virgin has increased among Catholics with the progress of centuries: I do not allow the doctrine concerning her has undergone a growth, for I believe it has been in substance one and the same from the beginning.\\"The book is organized along the following topics:Part 1The QuestMary in the GospelsThe Testimony of the TextsThe Most Retiring of CharactersA Lowly Jewish MaidenQuestions without AnswersStrange Answers from the ApocryphaMary in the Early ChurchThe Heart in the Understanding of DogmaMary in OurselvesPart 2 - The Documents that Tell of MaryThe Canonical ScripturesThe Patristic TextsThe Apocryphal TextsI fully recommend this book to Catholics and Protestants alike as a layman's explanation of the development of the Catholic dogma regarding the Blessed Virgin. It's the first book I've read by Daniel-Rops, and I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"Night of the Living Dummy is quite possibly the greatest Goosebumps book ever written, with only The Ghost Next Door in serious competition. Granted, it's not a particularly prestigious title, but Dummy is still fairly effective as a piece of children's \\"horror\\" lit.The book succeeds, first of all, for its quality of writing and atmosphere. Stine does have some bits of the cartoonish prose he would become infamous for (thanks to Troy Steele if nothing else) but on the whole it's a very well-written book by Stine's standards, with convincing dialogue and prose and great pacing. The book has the creepy atmosphere of \\"banal dread\\" which appeared in most of the early Goosebumps books; you feel like you're in a real world setting, and yet that something bad is lurking at the end of the next chapter break. The slow pace, establishing the story, characters and slowly-building events, makes the denouement - Mr. Wood coming to deadly life - all the more effective. The scenes of our protagonists wrestling Mr. Wood in the middle of the night is one of the most disturbing scenes in Goosebumps history. It truly captures the feel of the generally creepy cover (let's forget the hideous thing on the recent Horrorland tie-in release, please - Tim Jacobus is the only Goosebumps artist for me).Stine should also be credited for creating, in Mr. Wood, a truly memorable and disturbing enemy. In sequels Slappy's antics would become repetitive and predictable, and try to compensate for this lack of creepiness by exploring Slappy's background - kind of silly given that he's a ventriloquist dummy. In this book Mr. Wood's purely malicious nature is inexplicable and made all the more creepy for it. He's just an evil character without apology or explanation, and lacking in Slappy's self-awareness - he's a truly menacing and evil antagonist.In all, Night of the Living Dummy is one of RL Stine's best achievements, and shows that however far he has fallen over time, he did have some knack for this kind of story at one point. I can still read this book as a cynical twenty-year-old and be entertained - that in and of itself should say something."},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"The books in the Goosebumps series regularly seem to take the vein of a morality tale (of a twisted sort) where one virtue, evil, personality flaw, or issue is taken up as the focus of the story, and Night of the Living Dummy is no exception. The order of the day here is competition...in this volume we meet twins Lindy and Kris Powell who are constantly competing, arguing, trying out do, out wit, and one-up one another. Their parents are frazzled and fed up with these beautiful twins who seem to frequently cross the line into cruelty and viciousness, and often behaving without sympathy toward one another and others.As we join them, the twins are exploring the house across the way from theirs when Lindy discovers a ventriloquist dummy in the construction dumpster...even better he appears to be in excellent shape. To Kris' horror, Lindy keeps the dummy, which Kris initially distains as stupid, gross, and boring. Shortly after finding him, Lindy manages to gain some skill and when her act becomes popular with their classmates...popular enough to get her some gigs doing birthday parties with her act, Kris decides that she too MUST have a dummy. Her parents initially rebuke her, dummies are expensive and try to get the girls to share which outrages Lindy...she becomes quite cruel toward her sister calling her a copy cat and really wanting this one thing for herself.When their father manages to conveniently stumble upon a second dummy in a second hand shop for a good price, it seems like the problem is solved...but Lindy is still angry at her sister for trying to steal her thunder and begins to pose the dummy so that it appears to be alive, frightening her sister terribly...when the secret is revealed, Kris is crushed...but shortly after the dummy DOES come to life and the twins are left without their parents support (they are just fed up with talk and whining about the dummies to hear a single thing more about them). Will the girls be able to stop Mr. Wood? Will he make them his slaves? You'll have to read to find out...what you get is always different than what you expect with these stories, and Night of the Living Dummy is no exception, it does have a signature \\"got ya\\" moment at the end.Overall, Night of the Living Dummy is well written and the characters are simple but adequately written. The girls are sympathetic in some instances and not in others...there are times in the story when you think they are getting what they deserve for the way they behaved...but in the end, you want them to pull out of it and save themselves from Mr. Wood. At the very end, just when you think it's all going to be ok, boo...an abrupt shock at the end and the story is over, leaving the reader wondering how the girls will get out of their predicament...this one reeks of sequel, which I understand there are several of. I give it five stars, this is much better written than some of the other books I've read in the series and for taking something that's already kind of creepy (the dummy) and making it horrific several times over."},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"R.L.

If you are afraid of toys coming to life, put this book down! This book is about a dummy scaring the pants off everybody in the house! This book is a mystery. This dummy will give you a nightmare. Reader beware: you're in for a scare!You will like this book because it's scary. If you like scary books, read Night of the Living Dummy. This book is in the Goosebumps Series. You will love this book! You won't believe what this dummy does to the house! He's no dummy!I give this book five stars. It was awesome because it has a lot of mysterious things going on. For example, the dummy slaps a person by himself! Also, this book is creepy because the evil dummy makes other dummies evil. Plus, Khris and Lindy put the dummy in a box, lock him up, and throw him in a wishing well. Will he come out or not? Even this dummy hangs the other dummies all over the house. He also tries to flood the house at night! I know for sure you'll like Night of the Living Dummy.

So I am a happy mom! :)"},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"I got into this series back when I was in primary school, and collected both \\"Goosebumps\\" and \\"Babysitter's Club\\" books. \\"Night Of The Living Dummy II\\" was one of the first five I got, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. To tell the truth, I found it a bit of a disappointment that Slappy was not the villain in this book, but I still enjoyed it.The book follows a pair of twins, one of which found a dummy thrown out in a house. She decides to keep it and gets into ventriloquism, dubbing the doll \\"Slappy\\" (\\"Come over here and I'll slap you!\\"). The other twin gets jealous of her sister getting attention, and eventually gets her own dummy, calling it \\"Mr Wood\\". The trend is then set for the other books of this calibre: A sibling or cousin starts playing tricks using a dummy, then after they confess and stop, the dummy begins causing trouble.Mr Wood is very like Slappy, except for his commands. Like Slappy, he attempts to enslave the twins, but while Slappy seems to enjoy getting the kids into trouble and making them seem disturbed, Mr Wood attempts to kill the people close to the twins. This makes him more evil.I think the ending is what makes this book. Mr Wood is crushed, but when the twins go back home, Slappy reaches up to grab one of their arms and says \\"Hey, slave - is that other guy gone? I thought he'd never leave!\\"I recommend this book for younger readers, but I found it a little too short."},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"i loved this book. ever time i read this book it reminds me if the movie called dead silents its about the dummy who comes alive and stats to talk and walk around the town if u love this book get the movie dead silents. this book is awsome for young adults to read. it has so many way to keep you reading and you will never get to leave to book one you read it."},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","review":"This book by far is the best goosebumps ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have read tons of goosebumps but this one is my favorite.

The children were actually in mortal danger and you could feel the fear radiating from the page. Stine's style changes from the first dozen or so later on, i believe , to simplified and somewhat bland, but for the childrens understanding. Later on he gets a bit of style back but the plot and etc of his later books are more cliche and not very stine at all.

Many of the life lessons and messages are obvious, such as the Beatles 'All You Need is Love' and Billy Joel's 'Just the Way You Are.' However, there are some songs analyzed by the authors whose meanings are not quite understood by the songs titles' and requires a deeper, more focsued listening.

However, rather than being humorous, this book is quite serious. It is sort of like reading a secular version of &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; or other religious devotional guide. Each entry has a brief but interesting background on the artist and the song (the reason for two stars rather than one), followed by a reflection and some questions or exercises designed to put into practice the lessons taught by the songs. These reflection and question sections are overly serious and didactic, and it is the contrast between the somewhat &quot;cute&quot; concept behind the book, and the &quot;preachy&quot; tone of the meditations that makes it quite unsatisfying."},{"Title":"All You Need is Love: And 99 Other Life Lessons From Classic Rock Songs","review":"I Never Felt This Way Before, etc. al., October 8, 2006Reviewer: Betty Burks (Knoxville, TN) - See all my reviewsThis is the movie I could not get enough of when it was showing in the Tennessee Theatre and later on t.v.

I choose to give this one star instead of two because of the wasted potential this book could have been. Any amateur could have written such a simple summary of the careers of Billy Joel, Simon & Garfunkel, Eric Clapton, etc. Pete Fornatale is giving us nothing new there.In addition, Fornatale frequently fails to even quotes the lyrics of the songs acurately. His expansion on the song's true meanings are suspect at best. As a disc jockey for many years, he could've provided some interesting insight on what each song-writer was trying to say in his song lyrics. However, Fornatale merely goes off on every possible tangent to illustrate all possible meanings each song could have. This makes the book very painful to read and quite unfocused.On top of all the incessant ramblings, Fornatale's analysis is very questionable. In his analysis of the Rolling Stones, Time Waits For No One, Fornatale misleads the readers thinking that if you blow an opportunity to succede in life, another one will come along only with different players. Whereas that may indeed in happen in life, the song merely gives the message to make the most of all your opportunties because they don't last for you, me, or anyone. The analysis for Presence of The Lord doesn't hit the point as well. Having read a book analyzing Eric Clapton's songs, the meaning behind Presence Of The Lord is that Eric who never was a religious man just wanted to Thank G-d for the little things in life. Mr. Fornatale's lack of research caused him to miss the mark again.The premise of this book was to show that Rock N Roll wasn't just about sex, drugs, and rock n roll. Yet, Fornatale includes the Rolling Stones song Satisfaction in this book. This signature Stones song is clearly written from the point of view of someone who is just looking for sex, drugs, and rock n roll. What about the line,\\"He Can't be a man because he don't smoke the same cigarettes as me\\". Its obvious what kind of Cigarettes he's referring to. The last verse refers to Mick trying to find some girl to score with. Mr. Fornatele, you should be embarrased to include this song as an uplifting wholesome rock n roll song.On top of all that, the format for each brief chapter is oh so redundant. Why couldn't our author merely write a simple analysis without categorizing everything? It all sounds the same anyway.For every good moment in this batch(there are a few most particularly pertaining to Bruce Springsteen) there are about three or four bad moments. Mr. Fornatale, I implore you to research your material before publishing your next book. Glance at this in the book store for a few minutes but don't bring it to the cash register."},{"Title":"Novelas Ejemplares (Spanish Edition)","review":"Length:: 0:32 Mins"},{"Title":"Elephant (Zoo Animals (Heinemann Hardcover))","review":"Intro to Asian and African elephants that compares zoo animals with those in the wild.

I think she made a mature choice because Old Will in his love lyrics is ambigous and misleading.His words are loaded with meanings and accordingly are open to more than one interpretation.Publishing the detailed notes and commentry on the same page looks more practical and helpful, not only for the students but also for the general reader.Nevertheless, Hank Wittemore's version of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, recently published for the first time , emphasizes that the dedicatee of Shakespeare,s Sonnets is Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton and not William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke as the Arden,s editor of the Sonnets suggests in her introduction. Since 400 years the dedicatee,s identity had been masked. A.L. Rowse in 1964 published his version of the Sonnets and held that Shakespeare dedicated his poems to his close friend and patron Earl of Southampton. Now Wriothesley proved what Rowse had cocluded in his literary and historical researching half a century ago.In the next edition of the Arden,s Sonnets I hope Katherine Duncan-Jones sheds more illuminating light on this issue which puzzled many Shakespearians for a very long time.Abdulsattar JawadDuke University"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"I read these sonnets two a day over the summer, and I wish there were more than 154 of them so I could keep going into the fall. I think I'll pick up &quot;The Tempest&quot; next.The poetry in this volume is beautiful, equisite and full of passion. What makes Shakespeare worth reading is the way he lets the world into his lines. His metaphors appeal deliciously to the senses, like a beam of sunlight through a high window in the afternoon, or the smell of a new cut lawn in the spring. Shakespeare's writing is immortal, not because a conspiracy of teachers got together and decided it should be, but because it is full of life, and nothing that is full of life can really ever die.If you're not used to reading Elizabthean English or are put off by the thought of Shakespeare, this is a good place to start. This edition helpfully &quot;translates&quot; each sonnet into modern English on a facing page along with definitions for the more troubling words. Even with the help, I still don't think Shakespeare is all that easy to read. But anything you do in this world that makes you feel more passionate about life is a pretty good thing. If you give Shakespeare some of your time, he's bound to pay you back with plenty of interest."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"I recently used the Arden edition of the Sonnets in a graduate level course on Renaissance literature. It's useful, too, to have Helen Vendler's \\"Art of the Sonnet,\\" as well as the Penguin edition (fewer notes than the Arden). Quite simply, the Arden excels in the scholarly apparatus. Also, for a concise, readable supplement, include Greenblatt's \\"Will in the World\\" (the chapter on the sonnets). But for a close study of the sonnets, if you need a single edition, Arden is terrific."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Ms. Duncan-Jones' Introduction is an extraordinary example of scholarship. To say that the Sonnets have been controversial throughout the time since their publication is a mild understatement. Ms. Duncan-Jones casts a brilliant and unwavering spotlight on these controversies and resolves them.Any serious student of Shakespeare must read this Introduction.If there is a failing in the book, it is in the actual footnotes to the Sonnets themselves. But in the context of Booth's footnotes, for example, this failing is insignificant. Anyone who wants a line-by-line exegesis of the Sonnets has many resources available.Go get this book and read the Introduction!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Arden's third series illuminates the continually-shifting priorities of the moment as well as the Shakespearean texts themselves. Katherine Duncan-Jones devotes less space to such arcane matters as the practices of the Jacobean printing house and relatively more to what we now consider to be all-important: the sonnets, their meaning and literary significance. She considers that although some sonnets were obviously written before Meres's first mention of them in 1598 ('sugred Sonnets among his private friends') most were the products of the mature, Jacobean Shakespeare - hence their often knotty complexity and their relatively bitter, 'salty' tone. It is an unconventional view, like many others in this radically different edition.By any account, this is an erudite, thoroughly researched and thoroughly readable edition with sonnet-by-sonnet annotations that don't assume undue expertise. Unlike previous Arden editions, therefore, this third series issue is ideal for readers wanting an in-depth and accessible analysis of poems that have long had the reputation of being difficult ('laboured perplexities', in the words of the C18 Shakespeare scholar, George Steevens).Like the sonnets themselves, Duncan-Jones is often highly ingenious. Certain sonnets she considers numerologically significant. She detects a 'strongly misogynistic bias' throughout the sequence. Even those sonnets addressed to a female (ie 127-54) arouse her suspicions that the speaker has a male audience in mind as he exhibits a strong distaste for the female form generally and for 'the negative connotations of menstruation' in particular. These suspicions are strengthened on realising that the total number of these 'Dark Lady' sonnets is 28 - one for each day of the lunar cycle. (Duncan-Jones is the first to draw our attention to this detail.) Other numerical correspondences are more literary. The great central sequence (18-126) comprises 108 sonnets, thereby matching Sidney's collection. Sonnet 12, meanwhile, alludes to the number of hours in a day; 60 to hour/'our minutes'; 70 (threescore and ten) is followed by the sonnet which begins 'No longer mourn for me when I am dead'; 144 is concerned with the 'gross'-ness of his evil angel, and so on. Whether or not such decoding has unearthed Shakespeare's original intentions, there is no doubt that the sonnets were written for a highly sophisticated literary culture that, unlike ours, 'knew the rules' governing cryptic conceits.But if the sonnets themselves aren't sufficiently full of puzzles, here's another: in her Preface, Duncan-Jones claims to have 'avoided' John Kerrigan's 1986 Penguin edition, although 'excellent in its subtlety and scholarship', for fear of over-reliance. Yet apart from both agreeing that 'A Lover's Complaint' is an integral part of the overall scheme (sonnets-complaint, following Samuel Daniel's model, Delia) their rival editions seem poles apart. He (JK) guards against using the sonnets to speculate about Shakespeare the man and is dismissive of such fantasies and 'crackpot theories'. She (KD-J) considers the sequence's title, 'Shakespeare's Sonnets', of paramount importance, and one, moreover, that invites, and even positively insists upon, autobiographical inference. She in turn is dismissive of editors and critics who avoid confronting the poems' homoeroticism by speaking, for example, of the cult of 'comradely affection in literature' (Kerrigan). Her verdict on such thoughts: 'Sidney Lee lives!' (Lee being a critic who, immediately after Oscar Wilde's imprisonment, sought to conceal the Sonnets' potentially explosive homoeroticism. For respectable Victorians, the Sonnets were overspiced.) So much for excellence, subtle scholarship and potential over-reliance.Combative, therefore, as well as eloquent, this edition doesn't so much fence-sit as hurdle them full-on. Whether you agree with Duncan-Jones's stance or not, there's no denying that her case is vigorously pursued and her evidence presented with skill. Admirably, her edition preserves the arrangement of the 1609 Quarto together with much of its spelling and punctuation on the grounds that excessive modernising of spelling results in blurring potential double meanings. And punctuation? Her edition is the first modern one to restore the empty parentheses at the end of the six-couplet 'Sonnet' 126. The two pairs of brackets, she believes, represent the graves awaiting the bodies of poet and 'lovely Boy'.Definitely not the last words on the Sonnets. But some of the more fascinating, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"This edition of Shakespear's sonnets is all you need to read and understand the great Bard.A very nice feature is the paraphrasing of the sonnets in contemporary English and a translation into ordinary language of the more difficult words.The edition is a paperback small enough to be carried around to read during one's leisure."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"The secondary source material found in the appendices, the fantastic footnotes, the capacioius introductions, the big clear typeface, the textual editing decisions, all make the Ardens the best single-volume Shakespeares by a long shot. The rest pale by comparison.The only drawback, god forgive this y-chromosomed curmudgeon, that I can see in this particular Arden is that the editor, Katherine Duncan-Jones, often tends to lean a bit too far to the left, indulging into too much gender politic-ing.Duncan-Jones also spends a quite a bit of time arguing in a rather extended manner for composition dates that are self-consciously 'provocative' and seem to be much too speculative for an introduction.One could match this with Booth's version, which by comparison seems perhaps a touch more shallow and hidebound-- but more solid, and get a nice complimentary set of typefaces and editorial views that would balance out nicely, I would suspect."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"To speak in Shakespeare's language, one must understand the playwright and poet developing and honing his precise skills all the while writing strict, disciplined 14-line sonnets. How does one infuse a sonnet with a lip (the 14th line) with love, passion, intimacy, tenderness, and dramatic flair. Does one invent romantic drama out of thin air? I think not. You experience the kiss or touch, and you write about it. Yes, you observe couples kissing or holding each other, and create emotive poetry.Where does one start when writing highly romantic sonnets? A sonneteer starts with his or a sonneteress with her Prologue, the title to their sonnet: the dove flutters her wings with delicate motion. Yes, unsubtle passion may find her way into Act Two. The sonneteer now becomes the playwright, and accepts the challenge; although the lady in waiting may be writing her Mirrored Sonnet in the feminine to his masculine words. This is all done in a genteel manner.To wit, their crescendo must rise immediately from Line 1 to 4 (Act I), then rise with power from Lines 5 to 10 (Act II), then rise within the ascending mode to a denouement from Lines 11 to 15 (Act III). One writes to the sacred crescendo, decrescendo, diminuendo, denouement and climactic points (two mini-climaxes ending Lines 4 and 10; a major climax or lip ending Line 14) or one does not write a exquisite romantic sonnet (I shudder at the thought).Does anyone enjoy a flat or linear sonnet? Of course not. The emotion, beauty, balance, artistic parallelisms and patterns (1-2, 1-2-3, and 1-2-3 & 4, based on Italian musical theory) must adhere to the refined crescendo line, weaving in and out of commas (1/4-stops), semi-colons (hard 1/2-stops), colons (soft 1/2-stops), ellipses (middle break or ending break; a pause in intricate passionate wording), dashes (rise in pitch & speech), and the period (full stop).Rhythmical writing has now come into play with rhymed patterns that either elevate the sonnet, equal the passion & grandeur of it, or downplay it through missed rhythms or patterns. The transcendent qualities of pure romance can be missed in Lines 7 to 9; indirectness at play may require directness in words to achieve good power.The silken weave of any superb romantic sonnet is in the blush, the purr, the hush, the murmur, the genteel aside, the flurry of dove feathers when so much subtle intimacy has played out so well under the covers. O' Passion, spend more time with me in Lines 9 to 12. I will not leave you in the rain. This poetic voice, like a lover's echo, resonates in the best of Shakespeare's romantic sonnets.Shakespeare speaks directly to the intended lover; he voices his depth of feeling and emotion in words that poetically work in the sonnet 3-act structure - that quell the storm by the end of Act III (Line 14). All is accomplished by that denouement line; all urgency, hastened speech, the romantic pitch of waves flows like silk into those final words; as if a 3-act play, reduced down to miniature size, has completed its kiss upon the brow or lips of the intended.It is pure romance; its refinement levels are off the charts. I bow in humility to the master playwright, poet, and sonneteer, William Shakespeare and his artistic work."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"William Shakespeare is best known as a playwright. When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"This CD collection is an absolute joy.

My copy (which originally belonged to my father) dates from 1931 and its story was originally published in six parts in the \\"Blue Book Magazine\\" from May to September 1930. It is wonderful to see these books reissued, as they are the progenitors of many, if not all of the heroic fantasy serials that take up so much room on modern bookshelves. Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB) was the first and also (in my opinion) the best writer of multi-volume fantasies.'Fighting Man' is the seventh book in ERB's Mars series and differs from most volumes in the series in that John Carter, gentleman of Virginia and Warlord of Barsoom (Mars) is only a peripheral figure.The adventure is narrated in the first person by Hadron of Hastor, a warrior in the service of John Carter. Hadron's family is rich in honor but not in material possessions and when he falls in love with the wealthy Sanoma Tora, she snubs him. For months, the soldierly Hadron haunts the palace of Tor Hatan, Sanoma Tora's father, but his hope of winning her are vanishingly small until she is abducted one night by a mysterious flier.The strange ship is armed with a weapon that disintegrates the metal of a pursuing flier, and the Warlord realizes that there is now a new weapon of mass destruction let loose upon the dying seas of Barsoom (it's hard not to adopt ERB's style after reading one of his books).Hadron is promised Sanoma Tora's hand if he can rescue her. The Warlord dispatches the doughty warrior in search of his love, and asks him to keep an eye peeled for the new metal-disintegrator weapon.Since this story was originally written to be serialized, there is a cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter. Hadron's flier is shot down by the terrible green warriors of Barsoom. He escapes and is trapped in a deserted tower by a man-eating white ape. He escapes, rescues a slave named Tavia from the green men and the two of them take to the air in Tavia's flier.Unfortunately, they are forced to land in the demesne of a very paranoid tyrant. While Hadron is confined in the tyrant's Pit, he learns the secret of the invisible metal-disintegrating ray from a fellow prisoner.Hadron, now under a sentence of death must escape to save both Sanoma Tora and all of Helium (John Carter's Barsoomian kingdom).Our hero battles his way across the dead seas of Barsoom, evading or slaughtering cruel tyrants, mad scientists, formidably-tusked green warriors, etc. until the final reaches of chapter seventeen when he resolves all of the plot lines and finds his own true love (not who you might think).'Fighting Man' has all of the color and breathless dash of its predecessors in ERB's Mars chronicles. It's okay to start your adventure on Barsoom with 'Fighting Man,' although I would strongly recommend beginning at the first volume, \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" 'Fighting Man' can stand alone because ERB includes a long forward in which he describes the flora, fauna, principal races, and wars of Barsoom."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"Sanoma Tora, beautiful daughter of a rich and powerful leader on Barsoom has been kidnapped!

This particular book was first published in installments around 1930, as was the custom with pulp fiction at that time. The series was more or less reintroduced during the early 1960s (that is when I started reading them) and has been around ever since. For a work to last that long indeed says something. I have to agree with the reviewer (Mr. Wallace) in that this is one of the better works of the series. Each page if filled with wonderful improbable action and the villians are endless. While John Carter is indeed a part of the story, the main character is one of his top warriors, Hadron of Hastor. Plenty of Damsel in Distress stuff here, and all good clean fun. If you have never read the series, suggest you do. If you have \\"out grown\\" the series, suggest revert back to the little boy or girl lurking deep within you and let him or her out. You won't be sorry. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs went all out with this &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; series! There's never a dull moment, with non-stop fight scenes and a lot of romance (every book has at least one beautiful &quot;damsel in distress&quot; who needs rescuing). This particular book was one of my favorites, as John Carter goes under-cover to defeat the assassins guild in Zodanga. The characters are many, and they're a colorful bunch (my favorite: Rapas the Ulsio, and enjoyably repulsive character who befriends Carter while at the same time trying unsuccessfully to kill him!) This book is sci-fi wild-west action at its best, with gorgeous women, evil mad scientists, brave heroes, and sword-fighting galore! A fun book!"},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"The seventh book in the Martian series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, \\"A Fighting Man of Mars\\" is communicated to the author via the Gridley Wave (there is something rather quaint about the old convention of having a prologue purporting that what follows is true). Unlike the Tarzan series where ERB put his hero a series of similar adventures involving one lost civilization in the African interior after another, the Martian series offers up a series of heroes who have to rescue the woman they love. The titular character for this endeavor is Tan Handron, a Padwar of Helium who is in love with Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor Haten, the Umak commander. Tan Handron is descended from a princess of Gatho, which pleases Tor Haten, who is only a minor noble, but Sanoma spurns the young padwar's love because he is poor. Tul Axtar, Jeddak of Jahar, is also interested in her hand, but before anything can be arranged, Sanoma is abducted by a mysterious flier and the chase is on.\\"A Fighting Man of Mars\\" was originally published in six-parts in \\"Blue Book Magazine\\" during 1930 and appears to be rather different from ERB's earlier Martian stories in that for one the damsel in distress is not a Barsoomian princess. As Tan Handron pursues the woman he wants across Barsoom he encounters some of ERB's better villains (basically a new one for each installment in the series). As Handron deals with green men and white apes, spiders, mad scientists, and cannibals, he picks up a companion and uncovers a plot that puts all of Barsoom in danger and sets up the big climax.This is one of ERB's better books, arguably in the Top 10 of his pulp fiction adventures mainly because of all the fantastic creatures, futuristic weapons, and deadly dangers he crams into its pages. With Tan Handron ERB has a hero who is more plagued by doubt that we usually find and I also appreciate that in the end our hero goes for a real relationship rather than some idealized notion of love from afar. &quot;A Fighting Man of Mars&quot; shows that ERB was a master of the serialized (&quot;to be continued...&quot;) adventures."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"A Fighting Man of Mars tells the story of Tan Hadron, a soldier of Helium who takes on the vicious Tul Axtar, a cowardly but power-mad Jeddak who has assembled the largest army Barsoom has ever seen. Caught between them is the beautiful but pretentious Sonoma Tora. Hadron finds a better companion in the brave and daring Tavia, an escaped slave girl who will do whatever it takes to avoid going back to the life she once knew.One of the great things about this book is the fact that Burroughs believes strongly in character growth. But he also pioneered the strong female character in the adventure story format. There are always damsels in distress, but as the Barsoom series progresses the women become more active and determinate, equals or near-equals with the men. What is most astonishing is that Burroughs achieves this compelling parity without destroying the social fabric to which he introduced the reader in the earlier Barsoom novels.All Barsoom hangs in the balance as Tul Axtar's plan for world conquest nears completion. And Axtar must act quickly as it requires immense resources to feed so many hungry warriors.

Lost princesses practically darken the dead sea floors with their numbers.And everywhere he goes, Hadron meets men like himself: bold, chivalrous, scantily clad, willing to fight to the death at the drop of a plot mechanism, and utterly clueless about womankind and their own feelings toward same.

It contains his usual mix of detail and suspence.He is good at pulling you into the places he goes."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"\\"A Fighting Man of Mars\\" is book 7 of 11 John Carter novels that Edgar Rice Burroughs gave to the world. It first appeared serially in \\"The Blue Book Magazine\\" from April-September 1930, and, at almost 250 pages, is the longest of all the Carter novels. As in the previous three books in the series, Carter himself only makes a few token appearances, the action mantle this time falling on a distant relation of his, Tan Hadron. As Carter did for Dejah Thoris in books 1-3, and Carthoris did for Thuvia in book 4, and Gahan did for Tara in book 5, Hadron in book 7 goes on a quest to save a woman who has initially spurned him. This IS a big book in the Carter series, as I have said, and Burroughs throws in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to entertain the reader. Whereas previous books generally featured two or three enemy nations and their leaders, this book has a full six: the dead city of Xanator, with its fierce green warriors; the city of Tjanath, with its despotic ruler Haj Osis; the volcanic realm of Ghasta, with its bestial ruler Ghron; the castle of Jhama, home of the mad scientist Phor Tak; the province of U-Gor, with its cannibal inhabitants; and last but certainly not least, the nation of Jahar, led by the power-crazy Tul Axtar. Instead of one woman that needs saving, and one romantic subplot, this book offers up a full three. The book also lays claim to being the most sci-fi oriented of the lot so far, what with the use of metal-, wood- and flesh-disintegrating weapons, invisibility paint, guided ground-to-air torpedoes and so on. Throw in a scene with a crazed white ape on top of a tower, a humongous killer albino lizard, poison spiders, mucho swordplay, and the mother of all air battles at the book's end and you've got quite a hefty load of fantastic entertainment in your hands. Burroughs certainly gives the reader value for [money] in this one, no doubt. The novel moves breathlessly along from one set piece to the next, never pausing for breath. There are even nice touches of humor to be had; for example, the fact that the scientist, Jason Gridley, at the novel's opening, is from TARZANa, California, of all places! Much as I enjoyed the book, however, I did have some problems with it; numerous problems, actually....By now, any reader of this series will be resigned to the unwelcome intrusion of what I like to call I&I;: inconsistencies and implausibilities. Like what inconsistencies? In one scene, Burroughs tells us that the distance from Jhama to Jahar is 4,000 haads; a little later on, this distance is said to be 2,500 haads. Things like this can drive an alert reader to distraction! In another scene, it is said that Phor Tak had invented the paint that renders the metal-disintegrating ray useless; but previously in the book, it was stated that that paint was a product of one of his assistants, AFTER Phor Tak had gone into exile! Hadron and his buddy, Nur An, are forced to swim through some underground rapids in one scene, and yet in previous books it had been established that Barsoomians don't, as a rule, know how to swim, due to the dearth of water on their planet! In another scene, Hadron is led to the green warriors' encampment by the loud sounds of their squealing thoats (beasts of burden); so why is he so worried when they start squealing as he makes off with one of them? As far as implausibilities: Hadron and Nur An's balloon escape from Ghasta is extremely hard to swallow. Even harder to buy is the fact that this balloon drifts across the planet and coincidentally lands them right on the roof of the person that they are looking for! As in book 3, it is extremely hard for me to believe that a man can climb up or down the side of a tower at night by grasping onto slight protuberances. It is never explained to the reader how Hadron's invisible ship floated away in Tjanath, and that ship's miraculous reappearance in U-Gor is just totally unlikely in the extreme. Also never explained is how Tul Axtar manages to track down Phor Tak at the book's conclusion; this one really had me scratching my head! The \\"surprise\\" regarding Tavia at the book's end is so very obvious that only the most obtuse of readers will not see it coming; it is so obvious that I wonder if Burroughs really meant it to be a surprise at all.Despite all this grousing, I do NOT want to give the impression that I didn't enjoy this book. It fully deserves the four stars that I give it, if only for its great show of imagination and superb pace. Oh yes...there is one other thing that I loved. In one portion of the book, it is said that it is the boast of John Carter--leader of Mars' most powerful army--that he will never fire the first [time] in a war, even though--as in this book--he is faced with a power-mad thug who has accumulated weapons of mass destruction. I have to wonder what Dubya would make of this!"},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"There are many parallels between A FIGHTING MAN OF MARS and STAR WARS. Actually, not just this book, but the whole series is chock-full of them.Seeing as most of the other reviewers have already covered the plot, this review will point out some of the scenes in the book that bear slight, or even great resemblances to events in the STAR WARS movies.1) An integral part of the plot has to do with a disintegrating-ray gun. Compare this to the laser of the Death Star that vaporizes planets.2) There is a flier/spaceship that is invisible. Compare this to the cloaking device referenced in some of the Star Wars movies.3) In the chapter \\"Cornered\\" there is a scene where the main character, Hadron of Hastor, fights a great white ape and cuts its wrist off with the sword. Compare this to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK where Luke cuts off the arm of the white Wampa after escaping the cave on Hoth.4) In the chapter \\"Sentenced to Die\\" there is a scene where two of the characters enter the chamber of a reclining female captive. This is somewhat similar to Han and Luke entering Princess Leia's chamber in STAR WARS.5) In the chapter \\"The Death\\", upon the opening of a door, a once-trusted friend has apparently betrayed her friends as they find themselves staring into a room of warriors. Compare this to Lando's betrayal of Han and Leia to Darth Vader in the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.6) In the same chapter, a sword lodged in the mouth of a lizard aids the victory of the victims. Compare this to the Rancor-pit in RETURN OF THE JEDI, where Luke lodges the bone in the Rancor's mouth.Then of course there are the more obvious precursors to STAR WARS: The Jeds and Jeddaks being the Jedi and the banths being the banthas. Also many of the descriptions of the fliers and flying craft of Barsoom make it easy to visualize Jabba's pleasure barge-type vehicles and Star Destroyers.Even without the parallels to STAR WARS, this is still a great book to read. Although I rate it at a 4 it's probably closer to a 4.25. Each chapter is full of adventure and leaves you ready to dive into the next. There is a great motto in \\"We Still Live!\\" that is used throughout. Finally, all the loose ends and side-plots get neatly tied up at the conclusion of the story.With the exception of a few cases of Deus Ex Machina, there is very little to not recommend this book, and although it is part of a series, it can easily be read as a stand-alone."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"Nowadays, one sees the combination of action flicks, for the guys, and chick flicks, for the chicas, as for example in the movie Pearl Harbor, with Ben Affleck. Yet ERB did it many years ago, in this book. This is a really great story. Why do people read or listen to stories, anyway? Because they identify with the characters. Walking in Tan Hadron's skin is just fascinating, and a lot of fun. It's a great story- he loves a woman, she is kidnapped, he goes to find her, in his adventures rescues a woman who helps him seek the first woman, the first woman proves to not be worth much, he ends up with the second woman, Tavia. I read this in high school. To me, it may be the best of the ERB Mars series. It is so very well crafted, with ecological warnings appropriate today. ERB wrote with Victorian concepts of honor, and duty, which aren't so common any more- the recent Marvel Superheroes movie shows Captain America quarrelling with a very self-centered Iron Man, showing the older America contrasted with today. This is a superbly crafted tale. I read it again, from time to time."},{"Title":"A Fighting Man of Mars","review":"This Kindle Book appears to be a total copyright infringement on the Estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs.

This &quot;great work&quot; as C.S. Lewis described The Golden Key, tells of a boy and a girl, and their mysterious journey. J.R.R. Tolkien said &quot;The magical, the fairy story . . . may be made a vehicle of Mystery. This at least is what George MacDonald attempted, achieving stories of power and beauty when he succeeded, as in The Golden Key.&quot; I heartily agree as did my children!"},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"While The Golden Key may not be my all-time favorite book, it certainly has a strong connection to the book that I treasure most of all (well, second to the Bible). You see, George MacDonald, author of The Golden Key, was in fact the mentor of Lewis Carroll, who wrote my favorite non-Biblical book, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. That's a very powerful and indeed shocking connection if you ask me. But you can kind of see it if you look closely. I mean, the kids in the Golden Key grow both old and young. Alice in Wonderland grows big and small. Kinda similar there.Yet, I did not know about the relationship between the two books until AFTER I had finished The Golden Key and decided to do some research on its origin. I simply read The Golden Key like I would any other book, and developed some commentary on the work as a whole that I would now like to communicate:First, the book is very short. I finished it in two days. And because its so short, events move incredibly fast to make room for heavy amounts of whimsical feeling and fantastical description.But again I have to go back to the Alice thing. I noticed how SO many sentences in the story turned the reader upside down and made him say, \\"huh?\\" It was as if the Fairy World did everything it could to stay all out of whack. Whether it was to make speech that could be heard without ears, or to make the oldest people in the world look like little kids, the topsy-turvy nature of everything couldn't help but instill an amazing sense of awe. Truly, The Golden Key opens eyes to such incredible abstract possibilities of the imagination, and perhaps even life itself.The out of whack sense of awe, while wonderful in this book, developed into full maturity in the Alice books. While The Golden Key merely mentions things that make no sense, the Alice books actually attempt to explain the senselessness of senseless things.I hope I will always have a special place in my heart for MacDonald's prototype of Alice in Wonderland. Oh, if we only knew how much the imagination behind The Golden Key has really changed the world. I think we would all be very surprised."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"A perfect fairy tale, lovely and deeply moving, containing more within its few short pages than most novels could ever hope to achieve.

The first time I read it, (and now I honestly cannot figure out why) I didn't care for it. But I kept hearing more and more wonderful things about it. So, I read it again, and it enveloped me. Recently, I read it for a third time. And loved it still more.To describe the plot of this story would do it no justice. Reading this little story is much more like wrapping up in a warm, thick blanket on a cold and rainy night. It is filled with wonder, suspense, beauty, and innocence.I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"Since the story \\"The Golden Key\\" can be found in several collections of MacDonald's fairy tales, this book's main strength lies in Maurice Sendak's illustrations. These black and white drawings by the creator of \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" add a touch of whimsey to this rather obscure short story by the Victorian novelist/pastor/poet. Like all of MacDonald's fantasies, this adventure about a boy and a girl who are looking for the land where the shadows fall can be read and enjoyed on multiple levels."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"A boy finds a golden key at the base of a rainbow in Fairyland; a girl flees home to join him on a journey in search of the key's lock. A dreamlike, numinous fairytale, The Golden Key is delicate, brief, and bold. It reminds me best of Neil Gaiman's remarkable poem \\"Instructions,\\" despite the gap of years and style that separate the two works: both are boldy fantastic, freeform to the point of forgoing plot but never direction, short but evocative. It reminds me also of Catherynne M. Valente's The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making, despite a similar disparity: both are a strange, vast journey; both urge a wholehearted embrace of the fantastic, not because it's without complication, but because it's remarkable--but, as in \\"Instructions,\\" this message of inspiration never grows didactic. But really, what The Golden Key is is the best that this sort of fairy tale can be.The Golden Key is deceptively short, nearly a short story; it's short enough to read twice, and its rambling, looping journey benefits from a second look. MacDonald's voice makes for brevity in more than page count, his language light and slightly distant, nodding at the repetition key to classic fairy tales without overindulging, skimming over long journeys but casting a sharp eye on remarkable sights, and the effect is eminently consumable and almost effervescent. The brevity also keeps the drifting plot and dream logic in check, so where a longer story may grow repetitive even in its slew of wonders, The Golden Key dances from nighttime rainbows to a land of layered shadows to underground caverns with streams of molten metal and each one is a pure, crystalline miracle. The Golden Key is dreamlike, fantastical, utterly convincing; consumable, deceptive, quiet; numinous, allegorical, inspirational. I have a certain bias towards the stories it reminds me of, largely because I encountered them first, but I'm glad to have stumbled upon this one; it is the best I hope for, in a story like this: something that makes me see a world of magic, and want to grasp it with both hands. Of course I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my 20-year-old daughter. It was one of her favorite books as a child and she frequently checked it out of our local library until it disappeared from the shelf there, never to be seen again. She was very excited when she saw that she had her own copy and she took the book back to college with her after Christmas break. Although I haven't actually read the book myself, I can tell you that my daughter thinks it is great!"},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"A couple of shortish pieces by the great 19th Century Scottish clergyman and writer George MacDonald were illustrated by Maurice Sendak in the 1960s, and they are now available in attractive paperback editions from Sunburst. One is a very light-hearted story called _The Light Princess_, and the other is a mystical and lovely fairy tale called _The Golden Key_._The Golden Key_ is the story of two children, a boy and a girl, who live (not together) on the border of Fairyland. The boy has been told that at the end of the rainbow he can find a golden key -- it is not to be sold, and no one knows what door it may open, but it will surely lead somewhere wonderful. One day he sees a rainbow, and decides to follow it into Fairyland, where it seems the end of it might be -- and there he finds the golden key. Meantime, the girl, much mistreated, wanders into the forest of Fairyland, following a strange owl-like flying fish. Soon she meets a beautiful, ageless, woman, and she learns that she and the boy must journey together, looking for the keyhole into which the golden key will fit.Their journey is long (though the story is short), and quite wonderful. They meet some strange and wise old men, and encounter many beautiful and curious sights. At last, of course, they find the doorway with keyhole. The ending is unexpected and quite moving and beautiful.It is tempting to try to analyze this story -- is it an allegory of marriage? or the story of a joint journey to salvation? Perhaps, though, as W. H. Auden suggests in his afterword, it is best to simply let yourself be absorbed by the story, to enjoy its lovely and haunting images. This book is listed as for ages 4-8, which is absurd -- it will satisfy all ages, and if anything the target audience is definitely older children than 8. MacDonald, a key influence on C. S. Lewis, was one of the greatest of all children's fantasists -- try his _Princess and Curdie_ books, or especially his fabulous novel _At the Back of the North Wind_. (He also wrote such fine adult fantasies as _Lilith_.) The Sendak illustrations are fine and quirky as well."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"It is a pity that George MacDonald is usually thought of as a writer of children's stories. The Golden Key is a fairy tale but there are few children indeed who will truly appreciate the symbolism and mystery of scenes like the journey through the valley of shadows.

I didn't understand any of the symbolism at the time, but I still liked it. I don't understand all of it even now, but the more I read (especially of C.S. Lewis, who admired MacDonald's work), the more interesting the book becomes. I like the way the shadow-lands idea seen here gets more fleshed out in C.S. Lewis' Narnia book The Last Battle, and both are probably derived from the cave allegory in Plato.Some people will probably be turned off by the allegorical aspect. I think of it as an interesting little puzzle."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"There aren't many fairy tales that catch my fancy, but &quot;The Golden Key&quot; is pure ambrosia for the mind. It's a complete tale with adventure, tragedy, imagination, and above all; morals! The illustrations by Sendak are a perfect compliment to MacDonald's story. My children were captivated by this book as much as I. This story is just as enriching as the Narnia stories by C.S. lewis.

The images, story and characters are simply gorgeous. I'm sure each time I read it, I will discover more of the allegorical symbolism, but I could care less about &quot;figuring it all out&quot;.

C.S. Lewis believed it represented \\"the talent for loving\\", and having read the book numerous times, especially to nephews and nieces, I agree. Without giving away too much, notice the differences between Mossy's and Tangle's journey after their separation (physical death), especially how they saw the Old Man of the Sea. One might need to have read more of MacDonald's works (especially Unspoken Sermons) to get at his view of how love affects our ability to \\"see\\". His \\"At the Back of the North Wind\\" contains another wonderful example when North Wind explains to Diamond why she had to appear as a dreadful wolf to an old woman."},{"Title":"the golden key","review":"This book is like a drink of the freshest, clearest water on the brightest, bluest spring day you can imagine.

But it can also be helpful for them, during the search and reunion process, to have a window into the experience of their birth parents, to understand that very often, they did not want to relinquish their child, but were forced to do so by circumstance, or other people in their lives.This book beautifully describes the birth mother's experience, in ways I found most helpful and enlightening. It is a real God send; thank you, Jane Guttman for having the courage to share your inner most secrets in these pages, thereby helping other families to heal."},{"Title":"The Gift Wrapped in Sorrow: A Mother's Quest for Healing","review":"I don't recommend this book for anyone in the adoption triad.

Whenever I want to buy something I try to get some objective opinions about the product beforehand. Thus when I decided to write reviews of the books I read and post them on the Amazon website, I chose to write in such a fashion so that I would help potential buyers of the book make up their minds--rather than writing a review based solely on my perception of the merits of the book.There is a delightful scene in the movie version of Tom Jones where food is eaten and abused in abundance. With food as a metaphor, I would describe Henry Fielding's classical comic novel by that name as desert. It is very tasty and enjoyable, but hardly proper nutrition for the intellect. By this I mean that the novel does not provide the kind of intellectual stimulation and growth that one finds in the greatest works--Don Quixote, Wuthering Heights, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Crime and Punishment, the list is quite long. These are the truly great works of literature that everyone should read. By contrast, Tom Jones is a fun book, but lacking in the kind of insights that make for a great (5 star) book. Forced to choose, I give it 4 stars, but could just as easily give it 3.Certainly there are insights into human nature in the novel, but do you really need to be told that human beings can be crude, selfish, money hungry, rapacious and sometimes even kind and generous?? And do you need to read 700 plus pages to find this out? The plot is simple and obvious. A kindly country squire, Thomas Allworthy, finds a baby in his bed and decides to raise it himself. The boy, named Tom Jones, is a handsome devil but a decent person. Predictably, he falls in love with the highborn daughter of a neighboring squire, Mr. Western. Sophia returns his love, but circumstances, mainly related to the differing status of the two young people, prevent their marriage. Tom is run off for a seemingly transgression and has a series of comical and tragic adventures involving a host of characters ensues and everything works out in the end.One difficulty in reading the book is the numerous obscure literary references. Granted there are footnotes in the back of the book (400 plus!), but it is irritating to have to keep flipping pages to understand what is being said or happening. Some of this, such as having Mr. Partridge spout Latin every few pages, is unnecessary. Fielding divides the novel into 18 \\"books\\" and begins each one with a chapter in which he discourses on something or other unrelated to the story. One is tempted to say, \\"Shut up Henry and just tell the story!\\" Fielding also intrudes into the story itself quite often to speak directly to the reader, a style I find to be more irritating than helpful. There is also a lot of British history thrown in that does not really contribute much to the main story, as well as a lot of short interludes (Tom and the gypsies, Tom and the highwayman, Tom and the Man of the Hill, etc.) that do not really add much to the story although they do reveal something about English life at that time. The latter part of the book descends into a kind of Desperate Housewives mentality with Lady Balaston, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, Miss Western, and even another love interest for Jones, Anabella Hunt, vying for attention with a similar contingent of males. Also much of the humor is visual (the bluster of Squire Western, the antics of Partridge), rather than a result of the interplay among the characters, thus making the film far funnier than the book. In the end the book is just too long.Still, Tom Jones is enjoyable reading if you have the time for it, but it is not, in my view, a must read great work of literature."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"\\"Now, in reality, the world have paid too great a compliment to critics, and have imagined them men of much greater profundity than they really are. From this complacence, the critics have been emboldened to assume a dictatorial power, and have so far succeeded, that they are now become the masters, and have the assurance to give laws to those authors from whose predecessors they originally received them.\\"The critic, rightly considered, is no more than the clerk, whose office it is to transcribe the rules and laws laid down by those great judges whose vast strength of genius hath placed them in the light of legislators, in the several sciences over which they presided. This office was all which the critics of old aspired to; nor did they ever dare to advance a sentence, without supporting it by the authority of the judge from whence it was borrowed.\\"But in process of time, and in ages of ignorance, the clerk began to invade the power and assume the dignity of his master. The laws of writing were no longer founded on the practice of the author, but on the dictates of the critic. The clerk became the legislator, and those very peremptorily gave laws whose business it was, at first, only to transcribe them.\\"Hence arose an obvious, and perhaps an unavoidable error; for these critics being men of shallow capacities, very easily mistook mere form for substance. They acted as a judge would, who should adhere to the lifeless letter of law, and reject the spirit. Little circumstances, which were perhaps accidental in a great author, were by these critics considered to constitute his chief merit, and transmitted as essentials to be observed by all his successors. To these encroachments, time and ignorance, the two great supporters of imposture, gave authority; and thus many rules for good writing have been established, which have not the least foundation in truth or nature; and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and restrain genius, in the same manner as it would have restrained the dancing-master, had the many excellent treatises on that art laid down as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains.\\"H. Fielding, _T.J._"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Heralded as a classic, this eighteenth-century British novel has a Dickensian feel to it in parts. I found it to be very entertaining and a thorough novel.Tom Jones, our protagonist, was the son of common parents. He is adopted by Mr. Allworthy, a venerable gentleman, who raises him alongside Mr. Blifil, Allworthy's nephew. Blifil does not like Tom and constantly schemes to get him in trouble. Tom is a good boy, and eventually falls in love with Sophia Western, the daughter of Allworthy's neighbor, Squire Western.What follows is a delightful tale with a host of characters. Though, as I said before, there are Dickensian elements in the novel (with character names such as Allworthy and Thwackum), Fielding's book has some notable differences. Dickens has a very descriptive narrative style, filled with images and references to the physical items within the story. Fielding, on the other hand, is more apt to discuss aspects which are only tangentially related to the story-sometimes he ignores the story altogether.The novel also seems to sway in its genre--at times it is a romance, at times a novel about class (most English novels are about class), and occasionally it reads like an epic philosophical allegory. Though long, Tom Jones is filled with entertaining twists and turns.Any fan of a Dickens book will enjoy Tom Jones--if you tire at long novels, however, this one may not be for you. I particularly enjoyed the varying chapter titles, which were often comic, self-deprecating, and overly descriptive."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Tom Jones was probably the best novel I have ever had the opportunity to read, the very memory of certain incidents in the novel can still make me laugh. Henry Fielding was an absolute genius with an acute grasp of the nature of man and a subtle wit.

Obviously, this is one of the world's great books--I particularly enjoy the essays the begin each section. One word of caution--buy a well-constructed edition, there are simply too many pages for a cheaply made version to stand up even to a single reading. At this point, I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to have to purchase a better edition for my book shelf, and I'm throwing away the old pages as I go."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Fielding had the gift of being satirical, funny and thought-provoking all at the same time. He was not a big fan of the existing monarchy and polished his gift for wit to expose the folly of the many notables in his day by writing for a London Paper. Anyway the story is about a baby who is mysteriously left at the doorstep of a rich and socially favored bachelor named Squire Allworthy. He takes the child in and raises him as his own son, much to the chagrin of Allworthy's nephew who feels his inheritance is threatened by the child. The story is about the childs fall from the graces of Allworthy (with a lot of help from his nephew) and the childs' later redemption. Throughout though Fielding constantly keeps the tone perfectly balanced between sorrow and satire. We as the reader are always being rewarded by Fielding with a nugget of insight on human nature and its many flaws in the funniest ways. One of the best books I've ever read. Throughly modern as well."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"&quot;Tom Jones&quot; is Fielding's daringly funny novel about the life of one Tom Jones.

After devouring Fielding's rambling and intricately plotted story as a teen, I was never again daunted by huge pre-20th Century novels with teeny print. This book opened the door for me to enjoy Austen, Dickens, Trollope, etc. I've reread it recently, cackling at every page, and it has remained my favorite novel.The story is divided into three parts: the country, the road to London and the city itself. Along the way we meet so many memorable people, each with his/her own little set of intrigues--some of which overlap, of course. It is amazing to me how Fielding managed his characters' comings and goings so as to make it perfectly plausible that no one character has all the pieces of the puzzle of Tom's parentage or of Blifl's treachery.Henry Fielding is a great \`host' and companion. He has a truly hilarious writer's voice, alternating different literary tones to describe characters and events for maximum comic effect. He shamelessly digresses about whatever subject he feels like. (He is considerate enough to put these fabulous musings in well-marked chapters and gives the reader permission to just skip them. My very favorite: the one about extending the metaphor of the clich&eacute; \`all the world's a stage'.)Favorite Quote from Tom Jones: \\"It is as possible for a man to know something without having been at school, as it is to have been at school and to know nothing.\\"Can I give it SIX stars?"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"It was so hard finally putting this book down.The friends you make!Tom, Sophia, Allworthy, even Western himself.But most of all, Henry Fielding.The humor, the humanity!What an author and what a man.

And the plot is intricate.You may benefit from book notes; I did, especiallyduring the second half.If you love Tom Jones, check out Thackeray'sVanity Fair. And Guerney's translation of Gogol'sDead Souls.While you're at it, grab The Brothers Karamazovand go crazy."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This was the first book I read in this literary period and genre, and was also the cause of my love affair with 18th century british satire. Not only is Fielding worth reading, but his essays, books, novels and plays are fantastic insights into Fielding's political impressions of the age. Do not stop with this book...read as much Fielding as you can get your hands on. I would also recommend Tobias Smollet and Daniel Defoe's lesser known stuffs. If you seek emotional balance, turn to Samuel Richardson's stuff and then go back to Fielding again. The Pamela/Shamela dynamic is a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Tackling 'Tom Jones' took a ton of time! Yet, I'm forced to admit, I really didn't like it all that much, though I found it sort of quaint and charming. Sure, I love the warm blooded, noble spirited Tom and Allworthy and Sophia; understood the oafish, but decent bumpkin Western and loathed the sneaking Bilfil. However, the book's predictable boy gets girl and reinstated etc happy ending rang false to me, being entirely too predictable. From the get go, I knew that Tom would get the gorgeous Sophia, and, somehow, end up rich; I only wished he'd done it on his own rather than through the mawkish trick Fielding plays of having him inherit wealth. Nor was Bilfil getting his just deserts a suprise. All these things, the reader had a feeling would happen. The only question was how. I will never question Fielding's mastery of plotting, but, since we all knew how it would shake out in the end, what was the point? One can sense in Fielding the overly sentimental English novel which blossomed with Dickens, which is an art form which doesn't, unfortuneatly, appeal to me. Only after Conrad, I feel, does the English novel take on the weight it deserves. My other problem with the work was its sheer wordiness... Though in this, I must admit, I'm sort of spoiled by a love for Hemmingway's precision, though not his attitudes. All in all, I enjoyed &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, but found it not unlike those charming Hollywood films of the thirties and forties, filled with good feelings and happy endings, but lacking a certain depth that scrupulous realism can lend a work."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"To be fair, Tom Jones himself is not much of a character. He loves the fair Sophia with a passion wider than the sky; but his darned hormones keep getting in the way.

Original punctuation is retained, as is the Fielding's italicizing of all character names all the time -- not to mention capitalizing every common noun, as was the German-inspired fashion at the time of publication. Antiquated spellings are also intact. This gets very distracting.I'm glad this is out there, but I'm surprised Penguin did this. It makes the book much harder to read: couldn't they have left such a scholarly edition for some university press somewhere?"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This book is so well written it was a shame I could not finish its almost 900 pages. I simply found the tale too silly, too uninteresting to continue. It seemed just to be the rather mindless adventures of the hero, Tom Jones, as he fights over women, fights with soldiers and his friends ... with everyone. I need something a bit more serious and profound. I even watched the overly long film as I read, and even found the film to be inane. If you like light-hearted nonsense with lots of characters coming and going, then you might enjoy this.

Because I've been having an off day today. To cheer myself up I went to the local library. Well, they had nothing. Just the kind of books you find at yard sales. But I spot what appears to be a diamond in the rough. The history of Tom Jones. Now your's truly has been a fan of Tom Jones from the very begin. And since it's been awhile, I thought I'd read this book to see just what Tom Jones life was like. Now after reading this book for some time I realize this book is not about Tom Jones at all! It's just some author's brilliant scheme to make people buy his book. Imagine if I wrote a book and called it, \\"Paul McCartney, a biography or the Life and Times of John Lennon when the books had nothing to do with either of these people.

I imagine some might be put off by the length and by its designation as a classic (something which Mark Twain said was frequently praised and rarely read). Tom Jones does not deserve to be ignored since it is a riotous rollercoster of a book filled with comic vignettes and blows against the self-satisfied and pompous. It is a book that not only is instructional, but is considerate enough to give the reader a good time while doing so.Though frequently termed an immoral book, Tom Jones holds up rather well in the early 21st century. Even Fielding's comic characters seem to have a dimension often lacking in 18th and 19th century novels. Fielding is a genius."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"&quot;Tom Jones&quot; is a comedy of errors as the hero and heroine journey through lusty and violent 18th-century England. Fielding's sharp wit and no-holds-barred views on human nature more than make up for the extragavant use of coincidences in the plot.In the novel, Fielding takes the convention of &quot;talking to the reader&quot; to absurd and hilarious heights. The novel defends itself against all sorts of charges from &quot;critics,&quot; most memorably, that the work lacks symmetry (the chapters are of uneven length).P.S. Pay attention to the characters' names."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I positively dreaded having to read this book for a class and I can't relate how relieved I was to find it enjoyable! Once you get past the idea of the sheer girth of the book, you begin to realize what a humorous writer Henry Fielding was.The story is about Tom Jones, a hero. What's fabulous about Tom is that he is a \\"base-born\\" orphan and it is this alone that is the cause of all of his troubles. Throughout the nine hundred pages of the novel, Tom is chasing after his true love, Sophia Western, and getting nowhere fast. The world itself seems to be keeping them apart. Every time he finds a way, an obstacle is thrown across his path.In many ways the novel reminds me of something Dickens would have written if his sense of humor had been just a bit more intense.It's true, there are parts, usually in the beginnings of the chapters where the author goes off about things seemingly unrelated, but you will quickly develop an eye for this and learn what can feasibly \\"be skipped.\\"The story travels through all kinds of Tom's crazy adventures and believe it or not, a major mystery is revealed at the end that is sure to surprise even the biggest stick in the mud.Not only was the story entertaining but, upon finishing it, you are likely to feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment as it is one of the longest novels written in the English language!It truly is a book you take hold of in the winter months, or any time when you have large chunks of time to spend in doors.Every one who reads this review should at least attempt it! It is an affordable world classic, and it is not every day that you talk to someone who can claim they read it."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"It's nearly impossible to review a book that is just so incredibly good. The quickest way I can describe it is: This is simply the best novel I have ever read. And that's after four years of being an English major as an undergraduate, plus ten years of reading novel after novel after novel after that.This book is the bridge between early novels like DeFoe's Robinson Crusoe, and what the novel becomes in the hands of Dickens. It also shows flashes of influence from people like Swift and Pope (whom Fielding mimics in a couple of passages). The novel has something for everyone: for example, if you want humor, it's here in spades--in both broad form (the rantings of Squire Western and his sister arguing with each other) and subtle form (chapter headings like \\"The Reader's Head Brought Into Danger by a Description\\", or the ironic description of the plain-looking Bridget Allworthy: \\"she was so far from regretting want of beauty that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called one, without contempt.\\" If you want characters that have real imperfections and aren't just good or bad \\"types\\", you won't find more interesting ones than here. If you want to see what English novels looked like before the Victorians made them all \\"moral\\", you need look no further than this one, which was blamed for causing a series of earthquakes at the time of its publication because of its \\"lewdness\\" (not that it's seriously lewd, but it's hard to imagine a Dickens hero who ever believes, with good reason, that he has fathered a child out of wedlock, and who ends up for a while the \\"kept man\\" of a \\"fashionable woman.\\" And if you want to be a writer and not just a reader of novels, Fielding's book contains quite a bit of advice on that, particularly in the introductory chapters of each sub-\\"book.\\"I despise Samuel Taylor Coleridge on most occasions, but he was right about one thing: he described Tom Jones as having, along with Oedipus Rex, the most perfectly constructed plot of any book. I couldn't agree more. So knock the dust off this classic and read it. It may be long, but you'll be wishing it were longer once you finish it.Incidentally, there's one odd feature of the \\"Everyman\\" edition of this book. For some reason, it doesn't include headings to each book, describing the time period covered by that part of the novel. I have seen these headings in a number of other editions, so I'm not quite sure what is up with this."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling (the full title) is Fielding's second novel, a masterpiece of eighteen separate books expounding upon the profligate, the chaste, the reverent, and the two-faced. The tome may be considered a \\"bildungsroman,\\" as the novel follows the entire life of Tom Jones, from before he was born, to his ultimate reformation.I was introduced to this book in a Georgian Literature class during my senior year in college. As this edition runs nearly 900 pages in length, I never did quite complete it. In fact, I managed to achieve 370 pages or so in the brief time we had, but the story has spun around in my head for the several years since. I finally managed to find the time to start from the beginning and dedicate myself to this thing.Unfortunately, I don't have my notes with me, for they would have surely helped with the \\"inside\\" references that pervade this book. Henry Fielding's commentary juxtaposes ridiculous plights consisting of more than twenty-three fully-fledged characters (and dozens of side-characters) within a framework of politics and affairs (and in the distant background, the War of the Austrian Succession). Fortunately for us sagacious readers (with only so much patience), Fielding does not drown us in vapid details preferring, instead, to keep the story moving swiftly. Of course, \\"swift\\" in any 18th century novel, is fairly subjective, but Fielding does, at one point, suggest to the reader that he or she may skip the dull moments.While I certainly would not give away the ending, Book XVIII is filled with some of the most quickly occurring twists, explosive revelations, and an impressive resolution. One may feel the preceding seventeen books were lethargic and blunt in retrospect; Fielding, however, manages to fill the tale with (mis)adventures, soldiers, thieves, sexual trysts that would shock even today's readers, an intricate interweaving of social and class issues, and, my favorite bits: ghost stories! One of the highlights of the entire novel, in fact, is Partridge's running commentary during the production of \\"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.\\"I did not perceive that secure feeling of emotional pertinence with Tom Jones as I did with Alexander Dumas's adventure novels (which are obviously of a different caliber). Still, I felt it was necessary to read this romantic comedy and absorb the tale for what it is: a rich study of the immature and presumptuous acts of youth, the ignorance of adulthood (believe it!), the power of virtue and integrity, and the importance of familial significance."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I loved the movie on A&amp;E, and I can't wait to read the book!"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Tom Jones is an excellent book, and although it is very long, it continues to entertain the reader with action throughout. The characters Fielding produces are wonderful, especially our hero, Tom Jones, and his sidekick. You find yourself rooting for poor Tom during his escapades, even though he has some self-induced moral trip-ups. You know he will eventually get his girl, but the reader is totally left in the dark as to how it will finally happen. The last part of the book unravels itself in a very entertaining manner as Tom goes from the lowest of the low to being on top of the world. I would definitely recommned this book to anybody who has an interest in classic literature."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"First off, this is a review of the audio book version of Tom Jones. The unabridged audio book was narrated by Kenneth Danziger. The reader did an excellent job of using a different voice for each major character. I find this to be very useful and it makes it easier for me to envision the different speakers, especially when they sound like what I would imagine them to sound like. This version is very good and is highly recommended.I had some preconceptions about this novel that made me a bit wary to read it, but I ended up really liking it. I had thought that it would glorify sexual immorality, but it turned out not to be the case. The story was told in a very entertaining fashion and the main character was very likable despite his flaws. Many other characters also had this dichotomy of good and bad, but that tends to follow real life. The principle of forgiveness is illustrated in this book extremely well. We can all learn from this.I highly recommend this book, especially for those interested in one of the earliest and most influential English novels ever written. It is still fresh even today. It would probably merit a PG or PG13 by today's standards. It was considered quite racy when it first came out, though it does adhere to the moral code of the time quite well when considering consequences of immoral actions."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"My question is, how is one to encounter an early novel like \\"Tom Jones\\"? When Fielding wrote it, there wasn't much in the way of standards for prose fiction of its kind; in fact, one of the fun things about this piece is watching Fielding make up the rules as he goes along. But does this mean that when you're reading \\"Tom Jones\\" and you come across an authorial interruption or a scene that doesn't add anything to the plot, or anything else that would be a flaw in a modern piece, you scold Fielding for it? Back then, no one ever said that novels shouldn't include such things - no one had had time to say much about novels in English at all, since people hadn't been writing them for very long. On the other hand, such things do trouble the modern reader, so you have to say something, don't you?All right, then, here's one of the problems with \\"Tom Jones\\" - although the narrator keeps referring to it as a \\"history\\" and declares repeatedly that he's simply reporting the facts, he makes it plain at the same time that it's a work of fiction. Each \\"book\\" starts off with a chapter of introductory philosophy of some type, on subjects like what a critic should say about a book like this and what he should not say, and even the purpose of prefaces like the one you're reading, all of which takes you right out of the story of Tom and his adventures. If a student turned in something like this in a creative writing class, it would come back with red ink all over it.Which only goes to show how ridiculous it is to impose rules on fiction, or on anything creative. They usually work, but they're there to make things readable, not to be obeyed. As it turns out, there are dozens or maybe hundreds of novels published in the last forty years that do exactly what \\"Tom Jones\\" does. Critics call this technique \\"metafiction\\" and praise to the skies. The only thing Henry Fielding did wrong was to produce metafiction, along with some of his contemporaries, about two hundred years early.In all fairness, part of the reason \\"Tom Jones\\" has survived for this long is that most critics and most readers are not so foolish as to blame the novel for premature metafictionality. On the contrary, as I said, that's part of what makes the book so much fun. It's also a pretty good story even without all the authorial side-comments. The title character first comes on the scene as an illegitimate infant in the bed of a country squire named Allworthy. He grows up into a splendid, though often headstrong and hasty, young man, but a fair number of his neighbors spurn him because of the circumstances of his birth. Various enemies conspire to place him in a bad light with his adoptive father, Squire Allworthy, and although he's head-over-heels in love with his neighbor's daughter Sophie, he must leave his home and seek his destiny in the wide world. Sophie, too, who is head-over-heels in love with young Mr. Jones, also leaves home in haste to avoid a disastrous match that her father insists upon. How many people think Tom and Sophie will meet up on the road? Okay, put your hands down.Now, part of the reason \\"Tom Jones\\" remains popular is that the author himself emerges from his fiction as a very likeable man, whether he was that likeable in real life or not - I don't know, myself. Regardless of Fielding's personal manner, he set up a story in which a group of characters of genuine virtue find themselves in deep and profound conflict with a group of characters who pretend to genuine virtue. Squire Allworthy himself, late in the story, labels these two sorts of character flaws \\"imprudence\\" and \\"villainy\\", and it's pretty clear which side Fielding supports. And we all like to think of our flaws as being sort of accidental to our basic good nature, like Tom's, so it's nice that our narrator here can see beyond polished surfaces to the genuine virtue or evil underneath.That's especially nice when you see how frequently Tom and his allies run afoul of people who lie, or at any rate distort the truth, to make themselves look good by comparison. Indeed, Tom never gets into trouble except for one of two reasons - either someone reveals something about Tom to someone who shouldn't know it, or someone misrepresents Tom's actions to someone who should know better. At one point, for instance, Squire Allworthy recovers from a serious illness, and Tom is so delighted he gets terrifically drunk and has a big fight with a prudish member of the household, but when this is reported to the squire, said prude only mentions the drunkenness, not the reason. Unlike Tom, who always gives everyone else's sins the benefit of the doubt, this prude always twists everything to his own advantage while maintaining the appearance of sober piety. He's so good at this that for quite a while, everyone thinks he's the hero. Grumble grumble. It's enough to make you keep reading just to see if this jerk gets what's coming to him.In short, as Fielding himself says in a few different places, \\"Tom Jones\\" is a far more effective sermon than the author's contemporaries might have heard in a month of Sundays, partly because the narrator sees into the hearts of his characters without regard for the surface, and partly because he preaches to you while telling a good story. That's a pretty good description of the sort of God we'd all like to believe in, actually. And Fielding isn't God, but it sounds like he learned some good lessons from divine nature.Benshlomo says, Literary games have been around a lot longer than you thought, thank goodness."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Tom Jones is a great book by one of the greatest of English prose stylists, but to enjoy it to the max you should read the Wesleyan University Press edition of this as well as of Fielding's other novels.

Rollicking sexy fun but you know what - Fielding had a sense of irony, and it is this which elevates the book from pap to perhaps one of the finest and more importantly most ENJOYABLE and indeed intelligent novels written this century. Long? Yes, but youre getting more pages for your pennies - thank you very much."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This book defies nineteenth-and-twentieth-century notions of verisimilitude. His ironic and amusing protestations to the contrary, the author takes great liberties, and this circumstance is perfectly consonant with his manifest aesthetic and the literary ideals of his time. These ideals are different from but not inferior to the ideals of a later age. Unless one skips all the many interpolated essays in which the author imposes himself upon the work, one will understand that it is anything but sentimental. It spares no target its caustic humor--but if one skips these essays one doesn't read the book: they are integral to it (as the author's eighteenth-century aesthetic dictates it should be).Also recommended (for virginalists too): PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I first picked up Tom Jones in college. I only got a few hundred pages in when I lost interest and put the book down. A few months ago, however, I found a cheap copy at a used-book store and decided to try my luck again. This time, my experience was markedly different: I was hooked within a few pages. Fielding writes in a very engaging manner; it feels like one is listening to a close friend relate a personal story rather than reading a 250-year-old book. The characters are robust: The &uuml;ber-benevolent Squire Allworthy, the absolutely knuckleheaded Squire Western, the heroic, noble Tom Jones--who has got to be one of the unluckiest men ever in fiction-dom--and the lovely Sophia, who must suffer under her father's irrational love. The plot is superlative: Throughout the course of the book, I found myself thinking about the characters (and actually being concerned for their welfare!) in between reading sessions. I had to know what happened to them, and how everything was going to work out happily in the end. (Indeed, with about 40 pages left, I was starting to get very worried.) The love, sex, betrayal, and plain-old human nature of the plot is such that if one updated the scenery, it might be a book written to describe present-day events. Fielding complements his fine character creations with a sharp wit that is apparent on almost every page. I laughed out loud quite a few times throughout the book, and I got the distinct feeling that the author was winking at me almost non-stop. I can imagine that Mr. Fielding would be a riot in a pub with a few drinks under his belt!In an era whose modus operandi is instant gratification, it can require extra discipline to make it through this lengthy work that at times uses some unfamiliar language. Nevertheless, reading Tom Jones is completely worth the effort, as you will enjoy a master storyteller at his best."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I recently saw the lively 1960s movie \\"Tom Jones\\" and was moved to read an imposing book. I was not disappointed. I took my sweet time reading this delicious novel. I agree with nearly all the good comments that have already been made here, and will add just a few more. I most enjoyed getting a flavor of life in mid-eighteenth century England not warped through the lens of a historian or historical fiction. These were interesting times! I've been attending a few contemporary Handel operas; this book was a nice complement. The classics (language, history, etc.) were over-arching during this baroque era, and moderation and rationality are the virtues to nurture. Fielding appreciates this, and weaves a fine comic story into a novel at a time when few novels existed. He was working without a net, and pulled it off with panache."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. The plot follows the ups and downs of Tom's fortunes as he travels the English countryside. While this in itself is entertaining and very well crafted, what sets this book apart is the wit, humor, and observations of the narrator.We get to meet a rich cast of characters, from all of the social strata of 18th century England. The protagonist, Tom Jones, is a generous, empathetic soul with a heart of gold. His main flaw is his...love of women. His naivet&eacute; gets him into trouble on occasion. Most of the characters in this book, whether they hurt or help Tom, do so from selfish motives.This book, with its intricate plot, is full of wit, humor, and humanity. My only real criticism, and it's a small one, is the heavy reliance on coincidence."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This book or novel or whatever you may deem fit to call it has so many points in its favour that it's difficult to know where to begin. I think a rundown of a few of the myriad of characters that delight me personally might do for starters:Tom Jones - A young fellow with many \\"imperfections\\" if so they may be called, but a robust fellow with a \\"good heart.\\" Prudence and what is commonly called virtue are not his strong suit - But may I remind the reader that virtue comes from the Latin word for \\"manliness\\"- Tom is certainly possessed of the word's etymological origins, if not of its modern usage (particularly in amorous matters)--And a good thing too, or we should have no story here to delight us!Squire Western- Another rambunctious character, who, for me, typifies all that is Eighteenth Century England. Every time he appeared in this book, whether it was to comment on wenching, wine, or riding to hounds a smirk would immediately cross my face followed invariably by chuckling by the end of the chapter.Henry Fielding - The author plays as much a part of the book as any of the characters with many prologues and prefaces and etc. For these, and for much of the rest of the book, I might add, the reader who has not had four years of Latin inculcated into him at an English boarding school would do well to buy the Oxford edition, which fully explains all the learned quotes - Also, as one who was thus inculcated but is inclined to laziness, the Oxford edition's notes prove extremely helpful also. Fielding also gives us a lively picture of the literary life of his time, which the Oxford footnotes do a deft job of explaining- In short, buy the Oxford edition.This review can not be comprehensive. There are simply too many characters to even make a go at encompassing them all. I'm merely describing some of the, to me, more delightful ones.The book as a whole is simply a joy to read, in its comic descriptions of all who will deign to admit that they are human, and of some priggish sorts who will not so deign. I can put it no better than Fielding Himself at the beginning of Book XV:\\"There are a set of religious, or rather moral writers, who teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness, and vice to misery, in this world. A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have but one objection, namely, that is not true.\\"In short, this is a delightful ramble of a book which, while entertaining the reader not too attached to Sunday School, sheds light on how unvirtuous the virtuous can be, and how kind and good-natured the roguish can be as well as giving us as good a history lesson on the state of affairs in Eighteenth century England (with attention given to the Jacobite Rebellion etc.) as many a \\"proper\\" history does.Who, I ask myself, would not delight in this book? ---Well...for the priggish, there's always Jane Austen."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"When Henry Fielding published TOM JONES in 1749, just one year after Samuel Richardson did with CLARISSA, there was a literary and vituperative collision of the only two writers of English novels. Richardson's heroine lived in an uneasy stasis of romance and tragedy, one in which the attention of the reader was directed to specified personalities, clear if egregious motives, and numbed reactions that were none the less horrifying in their numbness. Richardson, then, placed Clarissa in an unjust world that allowed her to grow in a manner that transcended her endured injustices. The world of Henry Fielding, by contrast, was one of benevolence., one in which evil and foolish characters were allowed to thrive but at no point in TOM JONES was the reader in any doubt that by the end of the hero's epic journey that he would regain a sense of social equilibrium. Fielding, then, placed Tom Jones in a just world that allowed him to wallow in his own sexual excesses but would not permit him to stay there very long. The very qualities that annoyed Richardson so much about Fielding's basically optimistic view of society are the ones that have made certain that both Clarissa and Tom Jones are much read today, even if for quite different reasons.As many readers have noted the action of TOM JONES is divided into three parts: the first tells of the major characters--the Allworthys, the Westerns, the birth of Tom, and the linked events that caused Sophia to flee from an unwelcome marriage to the scoundrel Blifil. The second tells of the interlocking flights and pursuits among Sophia, Tom, Mrs. Fitzgerald, Mrs. Waters, and Mrs. Honor. The third details the deux ex machina travails in London that clear up all difficulties in a manner that strains credibility. Each of these three encapsulates specific traits that permeate the book. In the first of the three, Fielding uses deliberate misunderstanding between Squire Allworthy and Tom, between Allworthy and Sophia, and between Allworthy and Blifil to create purposeful ignorance that heightens the satire between what one person knows and what the other does not. In the second, Fielding shows that Tom's numerous falls from grace show him to be not much worse than your typical young man who sees no big harm in engaging in illicit encounters with women who are only too glad to have them. Readers might shake their heads at these lapses, but their essential sympathies were not permitted to waver. Fielding further did not allow readers to forget that the focus of the book was not on Tom's dalliances but on his eventual uncovering of his rightful place in society. By the third section, Fielding uses an admittedly too pat a way of ensuring that Tom's noble birth be acknowledged, but despite that Fielding first hints in the first two sections and then finalizes in the third the underlying ideology that English class structure and unity are paramount. When Tom and Sophia are ultimately reunited in marriage, Fielding assures his readers that one need not upset the stratified social order of 18th century England to ensure a fairy tale ending. The fact that readers now respond as well as readers then suggests that Fielding's belief that society needs a stable and long standing cohesive order has not changed much in three hundred years. Samuel Richardson might object, but readers can find a place for their two widely divergent views and enjoy both."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"And it's funny too. This novel is as good a representation of human life as it actually was in England in the mid eighteenth century. The story is a long one, but it is a wonderfully crafted novel that reads fairly quickly. There is a lot of humour and warmth. It can be justly stated that Fielding seems to live through this novel of his, his greatest achievement! Fielding's characters are wonderfully written, and through them we see Fielding's own ambivalent feelings about human nature. He saw two kinds of people - good and bad. Good people are inherently good, but they can be unwise at times and make bad decisions as his hero Tom Jones does. Bad people are inherently bad, and he sees no good in them. That is why he has made his villain Bilfil so evil. Bilfil has no redeeming characteristics at all. The book covers Tom's life on a country estate, his trip to London, his time in London, and then his trip back to Somersetshire, and all the many adventures that he has along the way.

Adventure? Sophisticated 18th century humor? A handsome and rambunctious protagonist? I'm In!This is the lengthy, (maybe a bit too drawn out) history of Fielding's hero, Tom Jones. Found as an infant in the bed of Mr. Allworthy, the wealthy and pious widower who adopts him and raises him as his own.The enormously Kind Allworthy raises the foundling (orphan) child as his own, much to the chagrin of his super class conscious community, where he is given all the privileges of upper class society (sans the inheritance. In 18th century England, it is illegal for foundlings to be heirs). Fielding's Hero has a heart of gold; he is gallant, chivalrous, with boyish good looks to match-- the only problem is Tom can't seem to keep himself out of trouble. Especially with the ladies. He carries on scandalous affairs--endearingly. He can't seem to control his libido but Fielding never paints his intentions as dishonorable. By no means is he innocent; Jones is just a nice guy who finds himself in hilarious situations with women because he is irresistable...and HORNY.Through the cunning of Allworthy's nephew Blifil, and his own folly, he gets turned out of doors by Mr. Allworthy, just as his beloved Sophia, (the girl next door) is betrothed to his sneaky cousin.Sophia runs away to London rather than be forced to marry Blifil, while Tom himself encounters some uproarious adventures in his path to London, where he and Sophia's trails meet and he endeavors to win her back. There in London he even discovers his true parentage, and the evil Blifil gets recognized for the conniving sneak he is.In the end, all is well. It takes Fielding 1000 pages to do so as he pokes fun at 18th century English morals,introduces us to interesting characters, puts Tom in crazy situations, and explores the true meaning of what it is to be \\"good.\\""},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This book is a satire on human relations and failings. It is especially aimed at the landed gentry of England in the eighteenth century, those of title and fortune, servants, and trades people&#8212;especially innkeepers. The novel is broken into eighteen books and those into many short chapters, the first of which is an essay on the writer&#8217;s profession. The reading of the novel can be improved by skipping the eighteen first chapters, which have nothing to do with the story. Their only purpose seems, to this reader, to be that Fielding found a sneaky way to get his essays published by inserting them into the novel.The story itself is wrapped around two themes, those of forced marriages and the treatment of children born out of wedlock. It is mostly a fast paced romp that really hits its pace in the last 200 pages. At that point I laughed as hard as I have in some time as certain devices unfolded. If I have a complaint (other than the first chapters) it is that an awful lot of women seemed to be able to walk around through an entire pregnancy without being noticed, while others are noticed immediately.I didn't like the way Tom was inclined to give away his last pence to others in need when he had no prospects of gaining more himself, but upon reflection, it seems to me that he could have realistically have gained this propensity from his benefactor, who was also big hearted. I found it interesting that Fielding didn't seem to find it necessary to punish the Squire Western for his misdeeds and selfish disposition, and that Blifil was able to reestablish himself after his downfall. It shows Fielding to have an interesting mixture of the romantic and cynical side of things."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I'm enjoying the book and am about 2/3 thru it. I think it is a bit easier to follow the story line after seeing the ol' Tom Jones flick."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This was great, really LONG but great. When I ordered this I had no idea just how long a book Tom Jones was. I enjoyed the story even though I would probably have enjoyed an abridged version as well. The narrator did a fantastic job. I'm glad I ordered it. Some day I may even listen to it again!"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This is the only edition (B000QTD10Q) I've found that comes with a complete TOC, albeit misplaced and hard to find."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Henry Fielding is certainly one of my favorite novelists; he is also one of the first English novelists that really matter. Dickens admired him as much as Chesterton. His style and his wit are both remarkable: I need only pick up a chapter of this tale and I'm at once helplessly thrown to the world of Tommy Jones and the hilariously real characters that bounce all around him. This is a tale about good and wicked characters; but mostly wicked characters.Read TOM JONES if you are interested in befriending the author. If, however, you have a critical agenda, I suggest you not bother Henry Fielding. For your sake, don't. He'll never let you hear the end of it."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"and he was a foundling. This is the most wonderful novel in English, in my humble opinion. It is a totally delightful romp through 18th Cetury England and a true classic of literature. The other Tom Jones, the Welsh one, does not hold a candle to our dear Tom who adored the charming Sophia and goes on a journey of self discovery."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"The lusty, baudy, soap opera about an orphan and his many rises and falls along the pathway back to his true heritage is a pleasant exception to the many boring old books out there that bear the label \\"literary classic\\"."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Undoubtedly, this is Fielding's master work. Few other novels can stand comparison to the wit and wild humour of Tom Jones, and the touching misadventures of its characters. Epoch making in its time, none of its charm and worth has faded. You will be hard put to find another novel quite like it. It displays much of the risque writing typical of the 18th century novel, though not to the level of, say, Defoe (and certainly not de Sade!). It is a hillarious romp, which also holds a mirror to some of the attitudes and foibles of 18th century Britain.The Wordsworth Classics edition is inexpensive and perfectly serviceable - an excellent choice if you just want to be able to read the novel and aren't looking for a library edition."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"However, do not buy the Penguin edition, buy the Oxford World's Classics one. Usually Penguin is the best, and I hate to say anything negative about them, but as others have stated, they for some reason have theirs written as Fielding wrote with all nouns capitalized (like the German language). If you are not used to this (and who is?) it takes quite a while to get used to! The Oxford World's Classics edition not only does not do this, but also has some helpful maps to show Tom's wanderings. Well, whichever edition you choose you will enjoy this amazing book!"},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"It says a great deal for \\"Tom Jones\\" that after more than 200 years, it's still as fresh and alive as it was when Henry Fielding wrote it. Tom is a foundling who turns up in good Squire Allworthy's bed on the night he is born; he's given the surname of Jones because the household believes that his mother is Jenny Jones, a local lady of somewhat easy virtue. Squire Allworthy, out of pity for the foundling, raises him as his own son, along with his loathsome nephew Blifil, but it looks like Tom and his supposed mother have more than a little in common. To put it bluntly, Tom is no better than he should be. He's wild, rowdy, a womanizer, perpetually in some kind of trouble; but his heart is in the right place even if he thinks with the wrong head most of the time. He's kind, decent, affectionate, generous to a fault, everything his sneaky, tattle-tale, obnoxious cousin isn't. He's also in love with his neighbor Squire Western's daughter Sophia, who is very much in love with him; but Western has decided that Sophia is to marry not Tom but Blifil, and Sophia can't stand the creep. So when Tom is turned out of Allworthy's house on a trumped-up charge of aiding and abetting a criminal, Sophia runs away from her father's house to avoid being forced into marrying Blifil, and they both make their separate ways to London, where the book's action culminates.Fielding crafted his novel almost perfectly; of the 18 chapters in the book, the first third take place on Squire Allworthy's and Squire Western's country estates, the second third on the road to London, and the third in London itself. In the exact middle of the book is the hilarious adventure at the inn at Upton, where all the characters, unknown to each other, briefly converge. When the characters all come together in London, Tom finds out his real parentage, Blifil gets what he deserves, and the story, like all good stories, ends happily ever after.The most common criticism leveled at Fielding and \\"Tom Jones\\" when it was first published was that it was crass, low-down and didn't set the high moral tone expected of writers of his time. Fielding pulled no punches in writing this book. One of his most delicious characters is the hard-drinking, ham-fisted Squire Western, who has all the finesse of a bull in a china closet and calls it as he sees it (his description of Lady Bellaston is dead-on); and in Jenny Jones, he presents a lady of ill-repute in so sympathetic and likeable a way that she appeals to us much more than if she had been a prim and proper female. But Fielding knows what moral and immoral really are; Tom Jones, for all his faults, is truly good, just as Blifil, for all his pious moralizing, is truly evil. What's most refreshing about \\"Tom Jones\\" is that Fielding has presented us with characters that are truly believable; we see them in three dimensions, warts and all. \\"Tom Jones\\" brings us 18th century England as it was; raw, vibrant, bursting with life and energy. It's a book for its own time, our time, and all time."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"It was about time I read &quot;Tom Jones.&quot; Fielding's 1749 novel gives us a panoramic view of 18th century British life. Its titular hero journeys among the low- and high-born trying to find his way in a world in which he occupies a precarious position. Fielding uses the sprawl of 800 pages to explore a multitude of social, political, and literary issues, gluing them together with an exquisitely outlandish, fully embodied sense of humour.The action of the novel begins with a view of the Allworthy family, a landed gentleman, Thomas Allworthy and his sister, Bridget. Into this family is dropped an orphan, a foundling - a child, if you will, of questionable parentage. This child, Tom Jones, is raised alongside Bridget's child, Blifil, as relative equals. Both are tutored by two ideologues, the philosopher Square and the theologian Thwackum. Jones is a precocious, free-spirited youngster, spoiled by Allworthy while Blifil, the heir apparent to the estate, becomes the favourite pupil and spoiled accordingly by his mother. As the two youths age, Tom develops a fondness for the neighbour's daughter, Sophia Western.Tom's sexual development begins to get him in trouble, as it tends to throughout the novel, and as a result of one such incident, coupled with the goading jealousy of Blifil, Tom is driven out of the Allworthy home, left to seek his fortunes in the world. Meeting his supposed father, Partridge, on the road, the two begin a quixotic ramble across England. Sophia, meanwhile, pressured into marrying Blifil, runs away from home, beginning her own voyage of discovery.&quot;Tom Jones&quot; begins with the narrator likening literature to a meal, in which the paying customer comes expecting to be entertained and satisfied. All 18 books of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; start out with such authorial intrusions, each cluing us into the writer's craft, his interactions with his public, and various other topics. This voice is actually sustained throughout the novel, providing a supposedly impartial centre of moral value judgments - each of which seems to tend toward enforce Fielding's project of a realistic, and yet, didactic portrayal of a world full of flawed characters.Some of the issues the novel deals most extensively with are modes of exchange, anxieties over female agency, and the power of rumour and reputation. Exchange and the ways in which value is figured include a wide range of goods - money, bodies, food, and stories - and are integral to the story. The treatment of women is a great concern in &quot;Tom Jones&quot;: from Partridge's perpetual fear of witchcraft to the raging arguments between Squire Western and his sister over how Sophia should be treated, to general concerns about sexuality and virtue. A novel that can be in turns hilarious, disturbing, and provoking, &quot;Tom Jones&quot; is never dull. Despite its size, the pace of the novel is extremely fast and lively. So, get thee to a superstore and obtain thyself a copy of this excellent and highly entertaining novel."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I first picked up Tom Jones because to put it bluntly I am a bibliophile and it was a cheap book. However, I was suprised at how engaging and hilarious the story was despite the claims on the back cover, which are often far off. To tell the truth I did not expect to make it through this extremely lengthy tome, I only wanted to satisfy my curiousity.Although I am a fan of Jane Austen I was shocked by the freshness and wit that Fielding's writing still retains. Every book in the novel begins with an essay by the author. Do not skip these, they are one of the best features of the book. My favorite is the essay before the ninth book which explains the purpose of these introductory chapters. What a riot!The story of big hearted and big appetited Tom Jones and his adventures and misadventures is one long satirical gem. Fielding's interpretation of morals, piousness, love, and high society is still as hilarious and relevant as it was in the 18th century. For anyone who appreciates wit and history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Gentle satire about human nature and morality in the form of the history of a foundling raised in the home of a country squire, who is exiled from the home through a misunderstanding, and eventually reunited through a series of comic coincidences.Fielding provides a convincing argument as to the relative importance of chastity and piety as virtues by offering one character (Jones) who possesses every Christian virtue except chastity and piety, against another (Blifil) who has virtually no real virtue except chastity and piety.The moral lesson alone would not make this the greatest novel of all time. Fielding's relaxed, dry, humorous, and affectionate style is the main attraction. Do not try to rush through this book. Be grateful for the time you spend reading it, and go slowly."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I was first drawn towards \\"Tom Jones\\" when I heard about the controversy that surrounded its publication. \\"Proper\\" Englishmen were naturally ruffled by Fielding's dead on satirical depictions of the English upper class and by his disregard for their accepted code of ethics, and declared the book to be insulting and evil. Since all of my favorite movies and books had legions of people seething when they were first released, I figured \\"Tom Jones\\" belonged in my collection.Apart from being amusingly raunchy for its time, it is also tremendously well-written and absorbing, drawing the reader into its richly detailed English countryside setting and its vibrant characters. The plot moves gradually, but never tediously, because to Fielding minor escapades and subplots are as important as the larger picture, and often factor unexpectantly in the central plot. Thus the book is very lively and animated despite its length, moving through a massive cast of characters, and a number of amusing charicatures and grotesques. Fielding is not above slapstick and lowbrow humor; he will follow up an eloquent exchange of witticisms with an absurd mudfight. If the reader can't learn to laugh with Fielding the book may become tiresome. The frequency of unlikely coincidences in particular seemed to be a test of the reader's patience, but I came to realize that Fielding intended it as a parody of his contemporaries. He is ruthlessly critical of his own literature and that of others.The book is interesting historically, both as a detailed panorama of 18th century England and as a prototype of the great comic epics of Dickens and Thackeray. Its comic technique was revolutionary, and it is a classic belongs in every serious library."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"I am tempted to say that just as Marlowe paved the way for Shakespeare, Fielding paved the way for Dickens. I do not have one single complaint about this book. The images are wonderfully portrayed. The main character Tom has many dimensions. He is a rogue, a bumbler, and a womanizer. But at the same time he is heroic, brave, and honorable. Mr. Allworthy is memorable as the virtuous guardian of Tom. Sophia is memorable as a woman with a mind of her own. One of the greatest things about this book is that even though it is over 800 pages long, it is NEVER boring. We are either in suspense, feeling pity, feeling sorrow, or trying to control our laughter. This was the 3rd book I read in History of the Novel. While I did not like the first 2 at all, I REALLY liked this one. It is interesting that Charles Dickens mentions this book in his &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850). If you like this book, you MUST see the movie where Albert Finney plays Tom."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"This is a classic piece of literature and very entertaining. I was very surprised to find that it had a one star score on Amazon until I read the only review for it, which accused Fielding of writing this as a fake history of the singer Tom Jones. To anyone in doubt, this book was first published on February 28, 1749. Yes, 1749. Tom Jones the singer was born in 1940. So..."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Journey with a guy with much testosterone, but a HUGE heart. I was not looking forward to reading this book for my 18th Century British novel class, but upon starting to read I found it to be a pleasurable story. This piqaresque novel has a humor that I have seldom encountered in other narratives. What is ironic is that Fielding wrote this piece during one of the most traumatic periods of his life. His wife just passed away, his daughter was dying, and he was inflicted with the gout. One would never think it from the clever way the book is written. The point of view gives us an in so that we feel as if we ourselves have roles in the storyline. Rooting all the way for Tom despite his flaws, we find out more about human nature along the way. A good read, light a candle and sit down with some wine like they would've and enjoy this classic comical delight."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Readers will probably be amazed at how modern this book is in a variety of ways. Virtually every sentence is dripping with hilarious irony, and the hypocrisy of various ostensibly pious, upright citizens is pointed out everywhere possible. It's a remarkably kind-hearted book, though, for a work of satire. What makes the experience of reading this odd is the mix of this modernity with the denseness of the writing style. Sprawling sentences abound and there's far more (often hilarious) commentary on action than actual action, though there is definitely no dearth of plot. I found myself spending a lot of time figuring out what the heck a long, convoluted sentence was trying to say quite often. But that said, once I figured it out, I was usually laughing hysterically. All that adds up to a curious creature - a rollicking, yet somewhat slow read. Fascinating and tons of fun."},{"Title":"The History of Tom Jones","review":"Tom Jones is a sophisticated, beautifully written novel about a fondling who ends up becoming a dashing lover. Do not miss the stunning essays which open each section. They count among the finest and most thoughtfully written prose in the English language. A book to be read at a leisurely pace on a summer holiday."},{"Title":"Fire-Starter","review":"All things considered \\"The Dead Zone\\" probably remains my favorite Stephen King novel, although the epic sweep of \\"The Stand\\" is impressive, but \\"Fire-Starter\\" has my favorite ending of any of his works. I can still pick up my copy, turn to the last two sections, and get a lump in my throat. I am not sure why this is the case, although I acknowledge that as a rule King novels do not have what would qualify as \\"happy endings.\\" At the other end of the spectrum from this one would be the ending of \\"Pet Sematary,\\" where the whole nightmare is about to begin again. In \\"Danse Macabre,\\" his dissertation on horror, King writes of the tension between Dionysian darkness and Apollonian sunlight and I have no problems with seeing the end of \\"Fire-Starter\\" as representing the sunny side of the equation.The \\"Fire-Starter\\" of the title is young Charlie McGee. In 1969 her parents, Andy McGee and Vicky Tomlinson, participated in a drug experiment run by a secret government agency known as The Shop. A year later they marry and two years later they had a little girl who could set her teddy bear on fire just by looking at it. As the novel opens Charlie is eight and her parents have taught her to control her pyrokineses, but The Shop knows about her and wants to study her as an \\"ultimate weapon.\\" So Shop agents are set out to hunt down Charlie and her father, chasing them from the streets of New York to a farm in Vermont.On the one hand King plays into one of the commonplaces of contemporary fiction, the secret government organization that will do anything to anybody to get what it wants, that I happen to detest. I have to admit that if you give me a choice between seeing the government as corrupt or as incompetent, I choose the later and I am sick of the idea that the way to defend America is to forget what being an American is all about. But counterbalancing this is the relationship between Andy and his daughter. Her parents have instilled in Charlie the idea of controlling her power and not hurting anybody, but circumstances are forcing the young girl to go against her conditioning. There is a scene early on in the book, when the McGee have made it to the Manders farm and The Shop agents catch up with them. Andy tells her daughter that she can stop them and she asks the question that serves as the title of this review, the other point in this book that always brings tears to my eyes. At the heart of this novel there is a real little girl.This is by no means a perfect Stephen King novel. The entire set up works well enough without the whole John Rainbird subplot, which I find to be just too much of a wildcard and just because we know in the end the little girl is going to turn the tables on The Shop does not take away the pleasure of reading how she gets to do it. Besides, Irv Manders is one of my favorite minor characters in a King novel and the whole idea of a young girl coming into her own under extraordinary circumstances is quite captivating. Add to that the ending and \\"Fire-Starter\\" remains a favorite and one of the Stephen King novels I continue to pull down from the high shelf of the big bookcase so I can read my favorite parts again. I also thing the film version is one of the better adaptations of one of his novels (qualified to those that have the author's name before the title and not the really good ones like \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" which do not)."},{"Title":"Fire-Starter","review":"Firestarter is a fairly early King novel, the sixth in what would become a long line. It's a quick read, as it's not very long, but I think it's a strong entry in King's body of work. The book is the third and final novel of King's government corruption phase, following The Stand and The Dead Zone, two books that prominently featured government propaganda, secrecy, and incompetence. In this one, the focus is on Charlie McGee, a child with pyrokinetic powers acquired through an experiment by a secret government agency known as The Shop. There's an obvious parallel to Carrie; the main character is a girl with powerful supernatural abilities under unbearable pressure, facing the moral dilemma of using her power for her own ends, but unable to control the circumstances forcing her hand. However, while the underpinnings of the two books are similar, the plots are completely different. Carrie was a naive teen suffering from alienation, while Charlie is an eight-year-old on the run forced to grow up far too early. The story is heart-wrenching as it reveals the details surrounding the absence of Charlie's mother, the young girl's sad manipulation by government agent John Rainbird, and her doomed relationship with her father. Written early enough to retain the urgent, bold voice of King's older books, Firestarter is gripping and intense. It's an unforgettable story.If you get this edition, the movie paperback, you might be disappointed by the lack of photos. Every Stephen King movie tie-in up until this one, as far as I know, had eight pages of movie photos inside the book in addition to the new cover. Plus, the next two after Firestarter, Cujo and Christine, both have the eight pages of photos. I'm not sure why they were skipped with this book, but I'm guessing that at some point, the sales of the movie tie-ins didn't amount to enough to justify printing the extra pages. Still, I miss the black-and-white stills common to many paperbacks from the 70's and early 80's. Despite this change, the book still offers a great color photo of Drew Barrymore as Charlie on the cover, and is an interesting copy to have on your bookshelf if you're a collector or someone just looking for a good Stephen King book to read."},{"Title":"Nate the Great and the Missing Key, Nate the Great Goes Undercover, Nate the Great and the Mushy Valentine, Nate the Great Goes Down in the Dumps (Nate the Great)","review":"I thought that the book, Nate the Great and The Mushy Valentine was a pretty good book to read.

I do not know how it looks. Since Kindle is not in color, I am not sure if the full effect could be received via that mode of reading. Secondly, I have seen at least 10 different editions of this particular Potter story, some as complete separate books and some included in various anthologies. It would be difficult to say which is best. It should also be noted that the product description on this page states that this story is for \\"Babies through Pre-School.

The trout does not care for the taste of the frog's mackintosh and immediately spits him out...lucky Jeremy!Our little hero goes on to lose his fishing rod, basket and one of his galoshes. (This is where I start identifying with Jeremy). Defeated, the brown frog goes home and is joined my his old friends, the lizard Sir Isaac Newton and Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise where they have dinner, not on minnows, but on roasted grasshoppers with lady-bird sauce...which Beatrix Potter deems \\"nasty.\\"All in all this is truly a delightful tale. It is interesting to note that this was written and illustrated the year after her beloved fianc&eacute;, Norman Warne passed away. Ms. Potter took special care with her drawings and it has always been felt that this work was in remembrance of her great lost love. Potter was good; both artistically and as a writer. Her figures of frogs were perhaps some of her best work (I have seen sketch work that was accomplished by her and it is absolutely amazing.) and it most certainly shows up in this fine little book. She drew numerous black and white sketches throughout her life of frogs and would quite often include those small drawings on her correspondence.All in all, in my opinion, this is one of Beatrix Potter's best works. Find a good copy and give yourself a treat. Your kids will love this one.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher (Classics for Beginning Readers, Reader's Digest Young Families)","review":"I was given this book when I was ten, and it is now a favorite of my three year old.

It is not so well known today because many are more interested in the fluff of the Holy Spirit and not the substance! Clear away all the froth and read this rich book. I have many volumes in my library, but this volume is a choice one. Samuel Chadwick was known as a \\"Man of one book\\" (see Dunning's biography of Chadwick). He studied until 2am, woke up at 6am having a cold bath and continued seeking the Lord. Such was his lifestyle, and it is such devotion to the Lord that brings about rich delicacies for the Church to partake of.Here is a quote from the book to give you an idea of it's contents.In a powerful plea for the life of prayer, E.M. Bounds says: \\"God's plan is to make much of the man, far more of him than of anything else. Men are God's method. The Church is looking for better methods; God is looking for better men.\\" He has staked His kingdom on men. He has trusted His gospel to men. He has given His Spirit to men. The Church is on the stretch for new methods, new plans, new buildings, new organizations, but \\"the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards Him.\\" The Holy Ghost does not come upon methods, but upon men. He does not anoint machinery, but men. He does not work through organizations, but through men. He does not dwell in buildings, but in men. He indwells the body of Christ, directs its activities, distributes its forces, empowers its members."},{"Title":"The way to Pentecost","review":"Dr. Samuel Chadwick's books are all classics! If you enjoy the writing of A.W. Tozer, Stephen Hill, or Leonard Ravenhill then you will greatly enjoy the man who literally started the fire in their hearts, the late Samuel Chadwick. Dr. Chadwick was the President of the old Methodist college in Leeds, England. His writing is not typical Methodist of our day with their liberal views but he writes with the heart and fire of John Wesley.This short book was based on a series of articles that Dr. Chadwick wrote at Leeds College on the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Identifying himself with the Pentecostal Methodists of the late 19th century, Chadwick's theology is reflected in this book on the Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Chadwick is not charismatic or modern Pentecostal in his thought but believes the Baptism of the Spirit brings power for service (R.A. Torrey, D.L. Moody) and is evident through prayer and holiness.While you might not agree with Chadwick's second work theology, the passion this man had for Jesus is clear. You will read this book and you will be hungry to pray."},{"Title":"The way to Pentecost","review":"This short little book is a good meditation on the power of God in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The book reminds me a bit of A.W. Tozer's \\"Knowledge of the Holy\\" which is very devotional in nature. Some of the book is a bit repetitive as this is simply a collection of articles that Chadwick wrote. Thus, chapter after chapter does not build on previous insight from other chapters, and one is not taken as deep as you might go in other books. Still though, there are some absolutely profound chapters in this book.In addition to this book, one would do well to read Leonard Ravenhill's \\"Why Revival Tarries,\\" and Jim Cymbala's \\"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire,\\" \\"Fresh Fiath,\\" and \\"Fresh Power\\" trio."},{"Title":"The way to Pentecost","review":"A great primer on the baptism of the Holy Spirit. For such a short book, the insights are thought-provoking and incites greater thirst for the experience of God's presence and power manifested in the believer's life. In describing the decline of the spritual life of the Church, you would think he is describing this present generation, but this book was first published in England in 1932! For the young believer, it is a good book to start one on the path of what it is to be on fire for God; for the older believer whose thrist has yet to be quenched, it is a good reminder of what he has left behind for other avenues of what seems to be spiritual power."},{"Title":"Alternative Medicine: What Works: A Comprehensive, Easy-to-Read Review of the Scientific Evidence, Pro and Con","review":"As a Family Physician I needed good information about the alternative medicine literature.

This time, the subject in question is the infamous giant monitor _Megalania prisca_. Throughout this 7 chapter book, author, and esteemed vertebrate paleontologist, Ralph Molnar, does his best to describe all that we know about this amazing animal.Molnar takes the story of _Megalania_ and does what any good scientist does. He reduces it into many different parts. The introduction gives a brief rundown of what to expect from the book, along with a quick blurb on some scientific naming conventions. This part is helpful to the lay reader, but if one is already familiar with this information, then one should take Dr. Molnar's advice and: \\"skip ahead to the next chapter.\\"Chapters one and two describe the global climate of the Pleistocene, and the climate of Pleistocene Australia. Both chapters come off a little dry. Though the information garnered from the chapters, is welcomed (though not really new to any geo student), they come off sounding a little too much like a textbook. It should be noted that chapter two also focuses on the paleoflora and fauna in Australia. This information is particularly interesting, as Molnar gives mention of many animal groups that receive little, to no, time in the spotlight (in particular, the club tailed meiolaniid turtles, and the diverse mekosuchines)._Megalania_, itself, really doesn't make an appearance until chapter 3. This is where things really start to pick up. Molnar begins by delving into the history of the animal, starting with the initial discovery, and the confusion brought about by the erroneous association of certain bones, with certain animals. This chapter features many pictures of the actual _Megalania_ bones. One will be surprised to note how much of the actual material is tiny, often heavily eroded stuff. There is not even 1/3rd of a complete skeleton known for this animal. It's impressive that we know as much as we do about it, given such poor material.This brings up a hidden theme seen throughout the book. While Australia's megafauna was unique and interesting. None of the taxa found there, are represented by very good material. Molnar gives specific mention to the poor quality of fossils seen in Australia, and the reasons why this is so.Chapter 4 deals with _Megalania_ in the context of other varanids. It includes a rundown of varanid phylogeny, and their evolutionary history. It then compares _Megalania_ to modern varanids, to see where the animal fits. Finally, it ends with a question of the validity of _Megalania_ as a genus. That this is still a fairly controversial question today, it comes as no surprise that no real answer is arrived at in the book either.Chapter 5 is one of the most interesting, and informative chapters in the entire book. It deals with _Megalania_ the animal. Molnar does his best to dispel the misconceptions on the actual size of _Megalania_. He mentions that, since no complete skeleton has ever been found, no one is sure of the exact proportions of the animal. This is important, as the maximum length of _Megalania_ varies by as much as 1.5 meters (~ 5ft) depending on which monitor the animal is based off of. Weight estimates for the animal, were also given. Molnar does a fine job of showing all the problems associated with trying to come up with the weight of an extinct animal. Especially one known from such poor remains. From there Molnar talks on hunting, feeding, reproduction and so forth. He even goes into the physiology of living monitors, and explains how it would allow for _Megalania_ to be either an ambush hunter, or a short range pursuit hunter.Chapter 6 delves into the environmental scenarios that gave rise to _Megalania_. Molnar talks about the unique environments of Australia, and how it might have been the main factor behind the evolution of this large varanid. He also dispels misconceptions about the size of the mammalian predators living there, at the time. Molnar then goes on to talk of the evolution of large lizards in general. Throughout this piece, one is quick to notice that large lizards all appeared in isolated areas. This gives off the false impression that lizards can only grow to large size, in the absence of any competitors. Molnar notices this as well, but points out, towards the end of the chapter, that _Varanus silvalensis_ and even fossil Komodo dragons, are prime examples that suggest otherwise.Chapter 7 ends the book with a summary of all that was learned throughout the previous chapters. Molnar points out that while \\"our understanding of this creature is at a rudimentary level...research on Megalania still continues.\\" At this point, Molnar floods the reader with lots of tidbits of new information on _Megalania_. Sadly, this is right about the time when the book ends. As such, readers are left wanting more. One can only hope that the new information found on this amazing lizard, will warrant another book devoted to its Natural History. If not that, then perhaps, at least, a new edition."},{"Title":"Dragons in the Dust: The Paleobiology of the Giant Monitor Lizard Megalania","review":"I was very eagerly anticipating this book when its publication was announced. For one thing, Australia's giant prehistoric monitor lizard, Megalania prisca, had nearly reached the modern Komodo Dragon in the broad zoological community's recognition database. Second, Megalania is well-known from many good fossil remains and several sites across Australia, providing more physical links to this extinct species than to many others of similar age. Third, Australia is home to about half the known living species of monitors, so light shed on species only recently vanished (in geological terms barely an eye-blink) could illuminate facts important to understanding contemporary species. And finally, I am a herpetologist who has spent over 40 years studying monitor lizards from several perspectives.The book provided an interesting canvass upon which Dr Molnar paints a detailed panorama of an Australia just a few thousand years in the past, of the geography, wildlife, and climate. Into this world he introduces early Aboriginal man and, inevitably, encounters--not what one might call friendly--between humans and Megalania. In the end, the reader comes away feeling that considerable information about Megalania is well supported by fossil evidence, and that there may be little else a palaeoherpetologist might add to the narrative.However, the book displays an unfortunately common and often overlooked feature of revitalising prehistoric creatures, namely that palaeontological expertise does not equate to broader zoological expertise even when studying ancestors of a still extant group of organisms. There is a lot more to putting flesh and life on old bones to model a probably realistic model of an extinct species than can be accomplished primarily, if not exclusively, by knowledge of osteology (bones). Living organisms have soft anatomy--organs such as heart, lungs, skin, and nerves--that at very best make extremely poor fossil remains. To better bring Megalania back to life on the pages of a book an author who is primarily a palaeontologist would need considerable expertise in neontology (the study of contemporary species) or a co-author so trained. It also would be very useful for the author of a book dedicated to a single species to have a better knowledge of the family or genus group to which that species belongs. Megalania is a lizard in the family Varanidae, extremely closely related to living monitors/goannas. In fact, herpetologists who study monitors have largely agreed that \\"Megalania\\" should not be placed in it its own genus (Megalania), but rather in the genus Varanus with several other fossil and all living monitor species. Molnar is not a herpetologist, but, according to his brief biography from Wikipedia, \\"...a paleontologist who had been Curator of Mammals at the Queensland Museum...\\". Even though he is, then, a mammalogist, many of his papers and contributions to books have been about dinosaurs and other early Mesozoic fossil vertebrates.Does that matter? Don't zoologists, especially vertebrate palaeontologists, often cross phyla in their work? To the former question the answer is \\"yes\\", because expertise does not translate from one discipline to another even between very closely related groups. In the 21st century, especially, I contend that we in the zoological professions are no longer even \\"herpetologists\\" or \\"mammalogists\\"; rather, our fields have become so information heavy that we are now almost of necessity specialists. One's expertise might be in the area of sea turtles or monitor lizards, but few of us can reasonably claim to be as authoritative in all Orders as we might be in a few families. And while a herpetologist might be well able to work with fossils of an extant group and make detailed and possibly accurate insights, a palaeontologist familiar with fossils is not equally able to look forward tom extrapolate in detail with a living group without additional neontological training.So my complaints are for the connoisseur of lizard biology, those for whom small details reveal considerably more than face value gleaned by non-specialist readers. Thus, the extrapolation of so many putative Megalania traits from knowledge of Komodo Dragons is a limited view that does not take into account many patterns seen across a broad array of monitors. For example, excepting largely light-bodied arboreal species, there is a correlation between the length of an adult monitor and its tail length. Generally, the larger the monitor, the proportionally shorter the tail. Tail length is intricately linked to activity patterns, foraging mode, and defense against predators. Megalania would not have been merely a bigger Komodo Dragon, but a very different kind of animal. This possibility is not mentioned in the book. On a smaller note, but very grating (remember that I've spent most of my life working with monitor lizards) is the artist's depiction of Megalania with a distinct vertebral row of enlarged scales. In fact, no known member of the entire family Varanidae, nor its sister groups (Lanthanotidae and Helodermatidae), nor their combined sister group (Diploglossa + Varanoidea = Anguimorpha) has any such crest. Lack of crests, frills, and other unusual scale features as seen in Iguanians, for example, is a characteristic of the entire Anguimorpha, so an artist's depiction of a lone species that becomes the exception suggests a lack of rigour that, to me, mars the volume.The layman will find a good, useful, and generally informative read. The professional will want to note the places where palaeontological evidence is passed as neontological speculation."},{"Title":"Destroying Our Private Cities, Building Our Spiritual Life","review":"Is your church full of strife?

Facius maintains that the Church has been called by God to send ethnic Jews back to their homeland in Israel. He argues on that getting the Jews back over there will get Jesus to come back even quicker. He asserts that there are two peoples that God has made a covenant with the Jews who are the chosen ones and the Church who are the called out ones. He calls the migration to the homeland the second Exodus.The problems with the book and with his arguments are that he fails to take into account New Testament's version. Let us first look at Jesus version of things and then Paul's. Jesus saw himself as representative of Israel. Matthew says as much when he quotes Hosea 11:1 saying \\"Out of Egypt I have called my son.\\" This passage was talking about Israel, but Matthew has applied it to Jesus. Jesus takes on the role of Israel. He is not restoring Israel, but reconstituting. Jesus is baptized in the Jordan and goes through the waters as Israel. Jesus then goes into the wilderness and is tempted forty days and nights of the devil. The children of Israel were in the wilderness forty years, but that is because they failed temptation and Jesus did not and so Jesus is the beloved son who the Father has chosen. He warns the old Israel not to take up arms and go against Rome, but to love their enemies and pray for them that despitefully use them. Jesus dies the death that awaited Israel if she did not turn from her military policies against Rome. He took all the wrath of God on himself for Israel and the world. Jesus calls the twelve and tells them that they will judge the twelve tribes of Israel. He tells them to repent or give up on your way of being Israel (as N T Wright has pointed out) and come and trust in my way of being Israel.Now, let us look at what Paul has to say on the subject. Facius says two peoples of God exist in the world today, but Paul believed in one new man. Anybody can read the book of Ephesians and tell that a new humanity has been created in Christ and to be in Christ is to be in this one new man. In Galatians 3:29 Paul said, \\"If you are in Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.\\" In order to be Abraham's seed you have to be in Christ and there is not another way for this stated in the New Testament. What about the literal promise of land? In Romans 4:13 Paul says that Abraham's seed is heir to the world and not just some arid land on the Mediterranean.Peter says of the Church that she is a \\"chosen people, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation.\\" How is it then that Facius can maintain that the Church is not the chosen people.I do not recommend this book even for someone wanting to look at the theology of a Christian Zionist. It is poorly argued and is just plain bad theology that misses the New Testament's meaning of the people of God and worse the person of Jesus. Johannes Facius writes in a pleasant tone, not with arrogance like John Hagee, but fails to convince on many if any of his arguments."},{"Title":"Experimental Cognitive Psychology And Its Applications (Decade of Behavior)","review":"Experimental Cognitive Psychology And Its Applications edited by Alice F. Healy (Decade of Behavior: American Psychological Association, APA) The study of cognition has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. This topic is fundamental both to the science of psychology and to its applications to real-world problems. Yet there has traditionally been a huge gap between basic research and practice in this area. Experimental Cognitive Psychology and Its Applications aims to bridge this gap by bringing together a group of distinguished experimental psychologists who show how their findings can be applied in daily life.Chapters cover key areas of cognitive psychological research including learning, memory, information processing, discourse, and knowledge representation. The contributors show how basic research in these areas can be applied to mathematical problem solving, task requirements during training, cross-cultural investigations of intelligence, the investigation of recall, and the improvement in educational methods.This volume honors three distinguished faculty members from the University of Colorado at Boulder who have recently retired from teaching at the university: Lyle Boume, Walter Kintsch, and Thomas Landauer. Throughout their careers, these pioneers have done basic research on a wide range of topics in experimental cognitive psychology and have made important contributions to our practical understanding. This book will appeal to experimental psychologists; practitioners involved in training, education, and testing; and students and researchers interested in the core issues of human cognition.The primary purpose of this volume is to bring together contributions by some of the most significant contemporary experimental psychologists working in cognition, including the areas of learning, memory, information processing, discourse, and knowledge representation. They share their perspectives and their recent research findings so that these ideas and results can be integrated for use by practitioners in the field, including those in training, education, and testing. Such integration should also be of value to students and other researchers concerned with the core issues of human cognition.A secondary purpose of this volume is to serve as a triple Festschrift in honor of three distinguished faculty members from the University of Colorado (CU) who are recently retired from teaching at the university: Lyle Bourne, Walter Kintsch, and Thomas Landauer. All three of these individuals through-out their careers have done basic research on a wide range of topics in experimental cognitive psychology. In recent years all three have made important contributions to the understanding of learning, memory, information processing, discourse, and knowledge representation, and findings from these studies have direct practical implications for training, education, and testing. In the case of Lyle Bourne, his research has most recently focused on the long-term retention and transfer of knowledge and skills with applications concerning military and industrial training. In the case of Walter Kintsch, his most recent research has been largely on text comprehension with applications concerning the teaching of reading and writing. Finally, in the case of Thomas Landauer, his recent research has been on the representation of knowledge, with applications concerning educational testing.The primary chapter authors are all eminent contemporary experimental psychologists and theorists in the core areas within cognitive psychology. Each of them has his or her own program of empirical research that, like those of the honorees, has had a significant practical impact on everyday life. Thus, the contributors present summaries of their basic research programs with a focus on the applications of their findings.The study of cognition has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. This topic is fundamental both to the science of psychology and to its applications to real-world problems. However, there has traditionally been a huge gap between the basic research findings in this area and practice in the field. There, thus, remains a crucial need to bridge from the laboratory to the real world. This volume brings together individuals who not only have a distinguished record as experimental psychologists but also have tried to show how their findings can be applied in the field."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"Excellent for learning how to write treatment plans, as well as for generating more alternatives for interventions. Working with the client to select the most important goals and most compelling interventions helps the client to take a more active approach to the tasks, and increases hope. The intro section teaches how to write a treatment plan, very good for grad students. I don't bill insurance, so instead of DSM-IV diagnosis as the sixth element, I write evaluation benchmarks. Another reviewer feared a cookbooky approach that reduces the human element in counseling/therapy. I disagree; developing and writing a treatment plan with a client helps to clarify what he/she really wants, instructs the client on the therapeutic process, and keeps in mind the desired outcomes. It keeps things moving forward. The transparency of the process keeps the counselor/therapist from being a mysterious expert figure, and empowers the client; some counselors/therapists may not like that, though. Those of us who work in time-limited settings can't afford months of wandering through a mysterious fog. Planning and goal-setting in therapy is part of the human process, not separate from it."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"Psychotherapists often complain about the high cost of doing business with managed care companies--but the real plea behind the complaint is that we want to spend more time with clients and less time with paperwork. This book creates a framework for doing just that. The experienced, competent clinician who finds him- or herself strangely inarticulate when faced with a blank OTR will find a helpful link between theory, technique, and individual needs that will help in carifying goals, determining specific interventions, and measuring success. When I use it with clients, I find the therapeutic alliance is strengthened, problems and obstacles are clarified, and underlying issues often surface in unexpected ways. A great find for busy clinicians."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"This 4th edition of the Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner has been revised to include Evidence Based Treatment (EBT) Objectives and Interventions. The latest research evidence has been integrated into the content of most of the chapters. Those Objectives and Interventions that go beyond \\"Best Practice\\" to being based on replicable reseach results are highlighted with an EBT symbol. Now the reader can be assured that all the latest research has been reviewed and suggestions for treatment based on successful results are noted in those chapters where research evidence exists. Where there is not sufficient research evidence available for a presenting problem, best practice interventions continue to be suggested. As federal funding sources as well as some other third party payers are beginning to insist on treatment based on research evidence, this Planner offers just such Interventions.Please be reminded that all of our psychotherapy suggestions assume a compassionate relationship of empathy that is crucial for effective treatment. Good psychotherapists realize the critical importance of a therapeutic relationship while delivering research informed treatment."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"With the busy and pressured pace of many clinicians in treating clients, along with the increased demands of insurance companies and managed care organizations, the clinician has a need for easy access to effective treatment planning options. The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (2nd ed) provides the necessary assistance for the psychotherapist in developing an effective behaviorally based treatment plan to expediently reduce client behavior symptomatology.Every chapter begins with definitions of clinical problems for which a client may be seeking treatment. This is followed by a list of possible long term goals for addressing the client's behavior. The planner then delineates specific measurable behaviors necessary for problem resolution with numerous therapeutic interventions for assisting the clients in achieving both short and long term objectives. Each chapter discusses a particular client complaint or the reason for entering treatment. The authors include 39 adult behaviorally based problems - a comprehensive list in the treatment of adults - including such problems as depression, anger management, low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, intimate relationship conflicts, and grief and loss issues. Diagnostic suggestions are given at the end of each chapter to aid the clinician with possible DSM IV diagnosis for the behaviorally based problem.This treatment planner, in a user-friendly workbook format, will be a definite asset for clinicians in the development of timely, specific, client-based treatment planning. If you have not seen this planner (as well as the many others in this author's treatment planning series), be sure to do so. It will contribute significantly to your efficiency in providing care for your clients."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"If you are in the Human Service field. This book is a must. It has helped me so much. I've had this book for over 7 years and if you are learning to write service plans, you will need to get this book and the others as well. Believe me, get this book. It is worth the price and beneficial as well."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"While I very much agree with the need for treatment planning, I am concerned by this book that therapy is reduced to a checklist, mechanical approach. Relationship and relational variables are underrepresented. Or course, MCO's require this more specified approach, but books (and series) such as the &quot;Complete&quot; Treatment Planner reduce our professional work to an easier-than-it-really-is perspective, and as a result, devalue professional experience as well as client/patient contibutions and collaborations in psychotherapy. While I appreciate the author's attempts to simplify a rather complex undertaking, is is disturbing to see psychotherapy presented almost like auto mechanics. I understand that Jonqsma and Peterson fill a need but the format and construction of this book leave me wondering about the human side of the psychotherapy endeavor."},{"Title":"The Complete Adult Psychotherapy Treatment Planner (Practice Planners)","review":"Excellent aid for student interns with a variety of patients.

The book then goes into the illegal activities that are the bread and butter money makers for these organizations.From there the author dedicates a chapter to every type of group covering, The American Mafia, Sicilian Mafia, Drug Cartels, Yakuza, Triads, and Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs. Also listed were groups that I never heard of or did not know much about like Sacra Corona, and Camorra.The book has very good pictures and graphics. If you want to know about any of the groups in great detail, this is not the book for you. Just a good review of all organized crime in the world, and an excellent brief history on these organizations."},{"Title":"Organized Crime: AN INSIDE GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY","review":"Excellent collection of information about organized crime throughout the world dating back to the 1800s. Along with the general text of the book which is arranged by region and semi chronologically, the books is also filled with snapshot bios of individuals and groups, graphic photos, and some maps to illustrate crime groups. Great beginning to end read but also good for a coffee table book. Well cross referenced within each topic as well.I think the book is good literature to better understand the impact and magnitude of organised crime in U.S. and the world history, as well as its adaptations to social, wartime, and industrial/economic changes.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Organized Crime: AN INSIDE GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY","review":"For a coffee table-type book of less than 200 pages, this does provide a pretty good overview of the history, structure, and operations of major organized crime groups throughout the world and also offers a wonderful photo collection. Documentation is sparse, a few common legends are recirculated, and the sidebar on the Tommygun contains some inaccuracies but it's still a much better book than I expected."},{"Title":"Organized Crime: AN INSIDE GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY","review":"I didn't know anything about organized crime for the most part. A great overview. The book best discusses the definition of organized crime, the methods and tactics, and goes into great detail about the America Mafia more than any other group. The book also does a good job of covering the Sicilain Mafia. All the other groups he covers very briefly (2-5 pages each) but does a good job of explaining who they are, where they came from, and what they are doing. Great graphics, but I could have lived without seeing the 3-5 topless women in the book. But by far the pictures do speak a thousand words when talking about all the different people. I got what I needed form the book. It's pretty good."},{"Title":"Organized Crime: AN INSIDE GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY","review":"When Albert Anastasia sat in the barber's chair and then gets shot by his mob opponents, it touched off decades of gang infighting.

If you are a comic-art fan, you probably have heard of Brian Apthorp. But if your a fan of incredibley well written books, I bet you have never heard of this special. It came out to promote the last Batman movie, and was just a marketing gimmik. It turned out to be an extemely human comic book, though. This graphic novel shows the reason why the villianess Poisen Ivy acts upon her love for plants, and it's more simple than you think. Poisen Ivy and Batman seem very alike, and really just want to preserve life. After haveing her private island firebombed, Ivy snaps, and goes looking for who did it. Batman must find her, and finds out that Ivy doesn't want to commit crimes, she just wants to be left alone. But when people don't respect the earth, she doesn't respect people. Truley a powerful book. Recommended to everyone from the casual reader to the biggest fan. At only five dollars, it's a steal."},{"Title":"Batman: Poison Ivy","review":"This year has started with me on a Poison Ivy kick. It began in December when I came across the graphic novel Joker/Mask, in which she has a juicy supporting role. Fortunately, my local comics shop has been having a sale which allowed me to pick up back issues of her appearances. Thanks to positive Amazon reviews, I even splurged on the pricier Harley and Ivy, a collection of her comedic adventures with would-be Joker girlfriend Harley Quinn. Poison Ivy is a fascinating character. She can be a cold sociopath or a caring friend. She is a super villain, yet a dedicated environmentalist who will sometimes do the right thing. Her powers allow her to make men her slaves, but she can be a lonely romantic yearning for either Batman or Harley Quinn to return her affections. This short graphic novel is a rather good primer on the many sides of Poison Ivy. It starts with Ivy on a Caribbean island where her powers over plants are transforming it into her personal paradise. Unfortunately, arms merchants decide to test a new incendiary agent on the island, destroying her work and from this point, Ivy is possessed of all the fury of a woman wronged. Her first target is the scientist who invented the fiery chemical. It is a classic example of her skill in seduction followed by destruction. But Ivy wants to take out everyone involved in robbing her of her home. Meanwhile, Batman has been independently investigating the arms dealers and wonders why and how Poison Ivy is involved. There is the contrast in their motivations when they meet. Batman seeks justice, Ivy wants vengeance and unlike Batman, she has no issues with a body count. However, when Ivy finally catches up to the person at the top of the pyramid, instead of killing, she finds an even better way to resolve matters. Batman: Poison Ivy has a good story and art (I particularly liked the haunting final silhouetted view of her and writer John Francis Moore thoughtfully provides a short recap of her origin). If what you seek is a sampling of the character, this book is a first rate choice. If you are interested in Poison Ivy's funnier side, the above-mentioned Joker/Mask and Harley and Ivy are both wonderful."},{"Title":"Batman: Poison Ivy","review":"One of the best books ever published focusing on Poison Ivy (aka Pamela Eisley), one of the greatest characters in the Batman corner of the DC Universe. Ivy has never been really evil like The Joker or Mr. Zsasz, not even close, but she was at one point a villain, albeit a sympathetic one. This is one of the comics that captures her right at the period of her evolution when she was changing into something more - not a superhero: she'll never be part of The Justice League or anything, nor would she have any interest in it - but she can't be classed as just one of the 'bad guys' anymore. This book shows her passion for her causes and her compassion - for the plant kingdom, for her plant-animal hybrids, even for humanity, as we see in the first few pages with the interaction between Ivy and the young Nicarauguan girl.Although, ironically, as she becomes less of a villain and more of a crusader herself, this puts her more and more into conflict with human society than she ever was as a 'costumed criminal' robbing Gotham's wealthy elite. She despises the corporate 'slash-and-burn' mentality and the world governments that condone it. She is particularly protective of plants, who seems to feel are sentient and communicate with her. Now, does this make her crazy? Or is she right, or is the truth somewhere in between? I don't think DC's ever definitively said, and hopefully it never will. Some questions are better left to interpretation and ponderings. But one certainly knows where she's coming from.For double irony, as she's becoming less of a villain but more into conflict with human society as a whole, she's also becoming more of a benefactor of and champion of humanity itself. There's the aforementioned scene with the Nicarauguan girl (which I won't elaborate on to avoid any spoilers); see also her role in the year-long \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" saga - most of which is available in the trade paperbacks here on Amazon, I believe - and her related appearances in \\"Detective Comics\\" #s 751 and 752, just for starters.I don't mean to ignore Batman, who's depicted great in here, as he generally is, but Batman gets a chance to shine in hundreds and hundreds of issues of various titles; it's okay that here he's not even a co-star but a supporting player to Ivy. This is Ivy's spotlight all the way through, and is the story of the actions she takes after the violence-free tropical utopia she's created from dust is annihilated by some of the poorer examples of the human race."},{"Title":"Gehlen: Spy of the Century","review":"I remain ambivalent both about Reinhard Gehlen as a man and as a spy.As a man, I believe as the Russians did then (and still believe now), that he was basically a \\"Nazi war criminal\\" and should have been brought to the bar of justice at Nuremburg along with the others of Hitler's inner circle. That he escaped justice by hiding Hitler's intelligence files in the ground above Bavaria long enough to cut an unholy deal with the CIA, and because he offered his own self-denial of being a Nazi, is not in my view enough to have saved him from the gallows.Because, whether he was a card carrying Nazi or not, this book gives us a sufficient summary of his actions as the architect of some of Hitler's most inhumane schemes in the Eastern region (of which he was head of intelligence) and which resulted in the death of many thousands of innocents in violation of the Geneva Accords. These actions alone override and belie any shrewd survival tactics and self-declared denials he may have made after the fact. In any case denials about being a card carrying Nazi were common in the aftermath of the war and thus is hardly sufficient to offset the damage he did as a Nazi bureaucrat in charge of the intelligence of the entire Eastern region. Gehlen was one upon whom Hitler repeatedly relied and one who was in excellent standing with Hitler throughout the war at least until the very end.Likewise, this book remains unconvincing in its details about Gehlen's exploits as a spy, either for the American side after the war, or for the Germans during it. I am thus equally ambivalent about Gehlen's exploits as a spy. While it is true that he proved himself to have been more than just a competent negotiator in cutting the deal of the century by successfully getting the newly formed CIA to allow him to ensconce himself inside their belly as \\"the new Eastern bloc bureau,\\" where he again proved his competence on our behalf, this is not exactly the prototype of the kind of exploits that we have come to associate with successful spying? And while it is difficult not to argue that Gehlen was both a shrewd negotiator and had a proven track record as a competent technocrat for both the U.S. and for Hitler, this does not qualify him to be put in the same class as the derringdo spies of our era like Allen Dulles, or Wildbill Donovan. Arguably, his exploits on our behalf simply reflects the level of our desperation for useful intelligence on Russia after the war. He filled that gap admirably but that does not make him the spy of the century.And while the details of this book, which is wonderful WW-II history (with a detailed view from the German side), leaves us with a more accurate description of Gehlen as a shrewd survivor and a smart negotiator who just happened to also be in the right place at the right time, it also allows us to see him at his height as a diminutive (he was 5'4\\") little Hitler sycophant, and bureaucratic hustler and schemer extraordinaire, one without a discernable soul beyond being bent on his own survival at all cost. Unlike others, who tried to kill Hitler, Gehlen endured Hitler's insults and abuse and remained loyal to him until the very end.Based on the deal he cut with the CIA alone maybe he could be called the \\"negotiator and survivor of the century,\\" but not the spy of the century.

Mary's husband, the King of France is dead and she finds herself in great danger. The new King of France wants her for his mistress, and her brother wants her married to the Spanish heir. However, Mary has a mind of her own and knows who she wants to marry and dares all to make it happen.This a true love story in which Mary showed herself a woman of courage and perservence and was prepared to sacrifice everything she had to marry the man she truly loved.Once again, this author shows a fine understanding of the Renaissance courts of Europe and England. She successfully displays the danger, formality and the risks of living under an absolute monarch. It was refreshing to read a novel on this lady who has had so little in general written about her over years. The blurb attached to this book said that the author did not agree with changing the facts of history to make a more &quot;dramatic&quot; story in her historical novels and this is easily seen in this well written book as all the major events in here are well chronicled in the &quot;serious&quot; history books.The first book in this two part novel is ROSE OF ENGLAND."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"If you are a Baby Boomer, as I am, you will find books about knowing yourself endlessly fascinating.

This book is really help you understand yourself."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Although the introductory chapter of this book started out promisingly enough, I've read half of the book and given up because I was so disappointed with it.The book's introduction explains that it is based upon the DSV-IV - which is a manual which outlines 14 different types of personality disorders. This book sees each of those 14 personality disorders as extreme versions of 14 normal and healthy personalities.Unfortunately when you read the personality portraits of each of the 14 supposedly normal and healthy personalities, you'll come to the conclusion that none of these personalities are normal or healthy at all. The book describes personalities which demonstrate behaviours which clearly would impede a person's ability to either hold down a job or form HEALTHY human relationships. All of the personality portraits describe people with problems of self-importance, selfishness and a lack of integrity in terms of their character - i.e. they just act the way they do, even if the way they act is hypocritical because they expect others to obey rules that they themselves blatantly ignore.The advice and tips on dealing with each personality type amounts to walking on eggshells: i.e. \\"This is what makes this person react negatively, they cannot be anything different, therefore give them what they want or just avoid broaching that particular topic with them.\\"When I completed the personality self-portrait questionnaire and read the descriptions of the personalities that I supposedly had within me, I was horrified and outraged to think that the authors of the book (a) thought that I was like that and (b) that this was a normal and healthy representation of a person's personality!If you are looking for books to read on self-improvement, I recommend books that emphasis self-awareness and understanding other people. Stephen Covey's book \\"The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People\\" is an excellent book that promotes self-awareness and how to develop leadership skills by developing a good character and leading by example.In terms of understanding how people think, I recommend David Keirsey's book \\"Please Understand Me II\\". It's a revised edition of original \\"Please Understand Me\\" and explains 16 different personality types which are very different, often conflict, but are all healthy. You'll laugh when you read the descriptions of each personality type, because it will remind you either of yourself or someone you know.As for this book, the \\"New Personality Self-Portrait\\", I would advise you avoid unless you're a psychology student who wants to learn more about people with personality disorders and how that extremeness manifests itself."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"At first this book looked very good indeed. Scientifically proven facts on psychology by clever authors. A new and updated test based on the newest knowlegde from all parts of America. I read about 80 pages and got really disappointed. Why? Because psychiatrists focus on stating a diagnosis, not giving practical advise. However, they do try to give you some idea, but these ones are thinner than the paper it has been printed on. Therefore I don't think that you will get any help from this book, which has more than 400 pages of nonsense. For specific problems, read specific books.

Not so with this book.Instead of focusing on ONE dominant personality style (such as Meiers-Briggs 'ENTP'), the Self-Portrait graphs your personality traits, which provides a way to visualize the way your personality works. Instead of being shoved into one of twenty personality types, you can see the different categories that are more dominant in your personality. This way, you are shown a more accurate portrayal of yourself, and the results are more individualized than a test which gives you ONE category that explains your WHOLE SELF.Useful in each chapter: &quot;tips&quot; for living with persons in each category, &quot;tips&quot; for making the most of your personality style, and warning signs for each style's potential personality disorder (as detailed by the DSM-IV).I was very happy with the questions in the test, with the descriptions of the personality types, and the way the book doesn't just lump you into one category. Also, I appreciated the Personality Disorder section in each category (simply as a matter of interest, if nothing else).The only thing I missed in the book was the treatment of spirituality/religion (only slightly touched upon in ONE personality category).Overall, I now understand my personality much more fully!"},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"WOW!

You will find out why you behaved the ways you did and why your life has turned out the way it has. You will find out how to get the best out of your particular set of personality traits. You will find out how to best deal with other people of different personalities. I found out why my parents were unnurturing - it's because that's just how the workaholic types are. This book describes 13 different personality styles which everyone has to varying degrees. This book shows you how they affect things like your work and love life. It shows you how to best cope with and minimize your weaknesses. This book enabled me to accept who I am and make the best of it. This book answered so many questions that have been a vexing mystery to me all my life. I think there are a few therapists here poo-pooing this book because it is very helpful and THEY are NOT! They're jealous! Truth is that most therapists and psychiatrists are incompetent and just waste your time. Many people like me know that from bitter experience.

This one however highlights the importance of your overall personality - your dominant personality style (also known as type), your leading styles, even the styles you are low on play an important role. I guess it is more so diagnosis than self-help, although it does give a good number of tips.

I've taken a lot of the self-diagnostic tests and found that on the whole, many of them seem to be generic and applicable to anyone; they're safe and not overly complex; forgettable. Many of these tests also seem to have scores that range from High (extreme) to Mid (normal) to Low (extreme) and you almost suspect that very few people would ever, ever score at the extreme ends of the scale and then of course the 'normal' range is so very comfortably normal, that you also suspect 98% of the population safely falls into that category.Then there are the tests that have so much jargon that you're lost before page 15, the book is set to the side and collects dust on the shelf. A year later you pick it up again and realize why it's on the shelf.The Personality Self Portrait is nothing like that. It is not so overly complex that you lose interest halfway through the book. The analyses are written for the average person, not clinical professionals but with humor and insight. It is concise yet in depth. Your results are literally charted on a graph that shows exactly what your dominant characteristics are in order of strength which makes this book uncommonly discernable and user-friendly. In addition, I found one very interesting, unique area: The Best Match for Your Personality. In other words, the kind of person you get along with best. And although it sounds perhaps sterotypical, I found that many of my closest friends actually did fall into my 'best match' categories. (I know! I made them take the test!) The one trait that seems to outshine them all, however, is the Conscientous trait. It seems to be the only A-lister of the group, matching up to all the others just fine while the other traits all have 'special needs' when it comes to matches. (Hmmmm. I wonder if the authors are dominantly Conscientous? Probably.)Take everything with a grain of salt but do try this book. It's exceptional. You'll find yourself among this crowd of traits and gain some insight into why you are the way you are.

The theory seems to be that the personality disorders are simply exaggerations of one small aspect of our overall personality. The &quot;styles&quot; are combined to create a profile of your overall personality.Although I question the scientific validity of this theory, I found the book fascinating. The book is filled with anecdotal stories about fictional(?) characters that superbly illustrate the major characteristics of each style.I found that my profile (Leisurely, Sensitive, Idiosyncratic, Devoted) WAS very descriptive of my own self-image and that I could easily envision people I know fitting into all of the other styles mentioned.I suspect that serious research would factor down these thirteen styles into something similar to the so-called &quot;five factor model&quot;.

The book was well-written enough to be enjoyed as a novel, but on subsequent readings I was able to identify the character traits I've struggled with, and those of friends and lovers. Implicit in the book is the possibility of positive change than can come through awareness. This is a perfect gift book, and a subtle one for someone you care about whose consciousness you would like to raise."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Especially if you're a Sensitive. This book (along with the previous edition) has helped me tremendously. It has given me more confidence in dealing with people, important for a shy Sensitive. It has helped me with personal relationships, especially my marriage and friendships. It has even helped me deal with my disfunctional family. It has helped me to understand why people behave the way they do. They're not doing it on purpose to drive me nuts! It has also helped me understand myself and my own needs. I am not so hard on myself because I don't compare myself with people with other personality types."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I've read lots of these types of books and always find them interesting and useful to a degree. I found this one much more valuable for a few reasons.The best part is that you get a &quot;score&quot; on each of about 15 traits instead of 4 or 8. I also believe the concept that personality traits are the moderate forms of what can become personality disorders. Since so much research has gone into the disorders, it makes sense that they are a good set of measuring tools.I've leant the book to many people who have almost all found it very valuable. The sections on my strong types read like a biography, and the hints for overcoming limitations in life and relationships were specific and helpful.Pick it up and learn something about yourself and others."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"very nice delivery. brand new book that i ordered and paid for. it comes w/the good packaging. happy about it."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"This is a great book to read if you want to learn more about yourself or the people around you. It also works well for a group therapy setting. Each chapter describes a personality type, what the strengths and weaknesses are of that type, how to use that type to your advantage, and how, if taken to the extreme, each type can become a personality disorder."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I love this assessment and the information it reveals.

I recommend it to anyone who likes psychology and learning about other personality types!!!"},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I got a lot out of this book. I took the quiz and rated myself. But more helpful is that I read the different types and found the ones that might relate to some of the people I work with. Learning about these different types helps me accept certain people's personalities as valid, though different from mine, and helps me realize they are ok the way they are. And helps me choose more effective ways to deal with their characteristics that I can't relate to."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, and I learned a great deal from it. It is useful, even fun, to use this book to gain a better understanding of yourself. If, on the other hand, you are trying to figure out what makes other tick, dealing with fourteen different personality traits is a bit overwhelming. If you're seeking to have a better understanding of those around you, I would recommend David Keisey's &quot;Please Understand Me,&quot; which is based on Jung and the Myers-Briggs Temperament Indicator. Don't get me wrong, this book may increase your awareness and understanding of other peoples' quirks, but I feel you can get just as clear a picture much more easily with the MBTI."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I think this is the greatest book ever written. This book turned my view of psychiatry around 180 degrees. Before I read this book I have very dim view of self-help books in general, and psychiatry in particular. This book not only helped me understand my own personality, but that of everyone else I have ever met. I saw my all my friends, my partner, my co-workers, my employer, my clients all described to a \\"t.\\" It is really hard to believe just how accurate this book is at telling you things about people you know that you never really knew about them. Many people will not like this book because they will see themselves in it described only too well. Many people with personality disorders refuse to admit there is anything wrong them. This will be the best money you ever spent, and you will forever see the world differently. The book is based the DSM-IV which is the bible of psychiatry. And the author of this book is one of the authors of the DSM-IV. The theory is every personality disorder is an extreme of one of 13 personality types that we all have. Some personality types are more head oriented, others are more emotional and heart oriented. Do you know anyone who is a self-righteous, highly judgmental of others, perfectionistic, believes there is only one right way to do anything, who is impossible because they are so ridgid and inflexible, who is pre-occupied with law and order, who is always making lists, who rigidly blindly follows every little rule and regulation, who is perfectionistic, who has difficulty making decisions, who is ritualistic, who knows exactly where everything is on their desk, and knows if something has been moved? This type of person is a \\"pack rat.\\" They will not throw out old underware or old socks with holes. Well, I few people like this. Their wives and girlfriends tell me about the old clothes with stains or holes they will not throw out."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Oldham and Morris's book takes its basic typology of personalities from various psychiatric disorders outlined in the DSM-IV, the manual of psycholgoical disorders that guides the psychiatric profession. From this typology flows a book that tends to locate human personalities in terms of their disorders, in terms of the extremes. Psychiatrists, unlike psychologists, take a medical aproach to human personality, where disorder is diagnosed along a disease model. This may be useful for those individuals who do exhibit extreme personalties that are indeed disordered; but what about the rest of us?In reading my &quot;personality portrait&quot; I saw a more disordered version of myself. Some of the observations were interesting, but more often than not, it would then go on to emphasize the most extreme behaviors.This leads to my primary objection. This disease model of personality (indeed personhood) is one that leaves very little room for self improvement. Under Oldham and Morris's framework, we are nothing but potential personality disorders, which can be carefully mitigated (in 7 easy steps, since this is pop-psychology after all!). Why not identifiy personalities in terms of potential creativity, potential kindness to others, or potential spiritual attunement?While psychatrists may be skilled at dispensing treatment (usually pharmacological) to those who suffer most greatly from who they are and their associated chemical brian states, this same expertise transposed onto all people results in a model of personality that is of limited value."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Best book of its kind. The reviews on the book's cover are accurate descriptions of the books content."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I am not a psychologist, only someone who is continually searching for new understanding. I took the test and while reading the results, had the erie feeling that these people had been studying me for years. They nailed me down so well that they could have created me themselves. The result? I came to understand myself better.

Best personality evaluation I've seen. Based on solid science, not pop psycho-babble. Some career advice, but should be expanded"},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"This is a VERY informative book, and the test was relatively easy, albeit a little lengthy. The only downfall is that if you're not cautious, you can almost take the assessments to read like a horoscope and take them to be what defines you fully rather than partially. While I can see that there are strong tendencies in the attributes described, they can make one overly suspicious of the negative characteristics if you are not careful. However, it is an accurate depiction according to the tests, the results are pretty accurate (my husband and I both did the tests). It doesn't take into account someone who is disciplined and moral who decides to make better choices beyond there human/animalistic tendancies...ie, those who choose to submit themselves to their belief systems, like Christianity with a renewed mind. Each chapter delves further in study than most other books like it in that it introduces research on the corresponding personality disorders."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Others have described what the book is about, so I won't repeat it. I thought the test was fun, and I liked that it gave a score on each trait. I also liked the activities and exercises to go with each chapter so you can work to address any growth areas where a particular personality trait is causing difficulties in your life. These tasks were easy to do and useful.The thing that makes me leery of giving the book five stars is that I am not sold on the whole DSM model, as it is a medical model that labels people. If you can get past that, the book is great."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"There are some things that can't be believed until they are experienced. I don't think I exaggerate when I say that next to the Bible, this may be the most important book ever written. I didn't believe in psychology or in self-help books, but this book is absolutely outstanding!!!!! It is not pop psychology. It is nonjudgmental and non-threatening. EVERYONE needs to read it. This book will make you believe that psychology finally has something intelligent to say.Whatever you do don't lend this book out. It was lent to me, I lent it to a friend, who lent it to their spouse, who lent it to a relative, who lent it to an in-law, who lent to . . . at this point I lost track. I finally bought my own copy, but I still owe a copy to the person who lent it to me."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"This book has had the greatest impact on my life. I did not expect to really learn anything about myself as I am rather self-aware, but not only did I learn about myself, this book gave me the greatest gift - the gift of Freedom. Suddenly, I realized that I am not like everyone else and that is perfectly ok. As soon as I stopped fighting who I am to be like &quot;all the other kids&quot; I experienced a profound freedom that enables me daily to see the world in a new rich, invigorating way.

Books should be that way too.

Armed with it, you have a precise understanding of who you are and why you do the things you do. By now you may be asking,\\"OK, fine so what can I do with this knowledge?\\"In the words of the author:\\"This material, combined with the practical exercises, may be sufficient for you to make some adjustments in your personality system or at least to smooth some of your rough edges.\\" This is invaluable, especially in overcoming negative traits and improving the quality of your enjoyment of your life.You only get one shot on this earth; you may as well enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"Excellent reference guide.

The second section presents characteristics in the disorder/unhealthy range.

If you want to know the modus operandi of a particular person...as well as how to make the best of your own strengths and weaknesses, this book is a must have. Oldham and Morris write a terrific book like no other delving into the intricacies and peccadilloes on why one person takes one particular action while another may do something completely different---and its not by chance. Each of us is formed by our childhood experiences, genetics, opportunities, trials and tribulations into a personality blueprint that will never be changed. For example, don't try to ask a Dramatic person to do the job of a Idiosyncratic...they won't be able to complete the job. Moreover, if you have a Mercurial personality style, don't get involved with Self-Confident person...you may wind up Dead! Why does one person have a personality style versus another? Read the book! Oldham and Morris have mapped out the Personality Pachinko machine that will tell you where the ball is going and what to expect. In addition, Oldham and Morris delve into the 13 personality disorders that correspond to each personality style---(and get this)----everyone of us is capable of falling into. Its a fascinating look at yourself and the ones that you love (and don't love) and how to make the best of that relationship. BEWARE: you may discover that you are not compatible with your present mate...or find out that you have a disorder yourself. Never-the-less...the more you know about YOURSELF...the better equipped you will be to navigate through the many trials and pitfalls that life will inevitably hand you.

My novels are character driven and this book gives behaviors and reactions of different personality styles. Some styles were obvious but some were surprising in that traits I thought of as faults were actually ingrained personality styles which leads me to the conclusion that we are born with who we are.

I was newly married and found out that I was a Sensitive and my partner was a Vigilant. I was a good match for her, she was a so-so match for me. Well, at the time, I saw our cup as mostly full. And so it was for a few years. But in the later half of my 20 year marriage, I saw clear signs that my partner was becoming paranoid. I had to plant screens of bushes and vines so that the neighbors couldn't see into our yard. Then we had to move out to 5 acres in the country for more privacy. In addition, she began to suspect my extended family of \\"talking behind her back and saying bad things\\". As far as I could tell, this was totally unfounded. For years she tried to systematically alienate me from my loving family. Sometimes forcing me to choose, them or her. Finally, she lost all trust in me, a most devoted, sensitive husband. When things really began to fall apart, she really cranked up the criticism and negativity... and we went for marriage counseling. After two years, she was unable to forgive or forget or resolve anything. After our separation and divorce, I happened to re-read Personality Self-Portrait. I even found our score sheets from 20 years earlier. Boy, did it ever hit home; reading the descriptions of myself and my ex (now in the Paranoid extreme). UNBELIEVABLE. Freaking UNBELIEVABLE. The words on the pages were so accurate. Summarized my 20 year marriage to a \\"T\\". I do have 3 great kids since we were both so family oriented. At least I am thankful for that!Two takeaways:1) If you are single and dating, READ THIS NOW. Learn what personality type is a good match for you, and find the right person!!!2) Professional marriage counselors should give the personality test in this book to all their clients. All parties would greatly benefit by the basic insights of this book. And if one of the parties is an extreme personality... cut your losses now."},{"Title":"The personality self-portrait : why you think, work, love, and act the way you do","review":"I received my product in a timely time frame.

In fact it will help those who believe in the ethic of \\"Love your neighbor\\" and \\"love your enemy\\" to actually live these commandments. I have always known that I am made up of contradictory, even conflicting personalities.

Boy, was I let down.The idea of the book is great. Instead of finding the Indians, the early explorers find &quot;sims&quot;...a shorter way of saying Neanderthal caveman. The book goes through several short stories with very likeable characters and intriguing plot lines.However, the plot goes from the 1600s to the 1800s at a good pace and then all of a sudden jumps to 1988 and then that's the end. I feel that Turtledove only had to write x amount of words for the publisher and that's exactly where he stopped.What about all the years between the 1800s and 1988?Why not explore future years past 1988? I realize that would have been predicting for the author, but that is the fun of science fiction.The ending of the book did not wrap anything up...the sims go to either medical research or reservations. And?!? Then what?!? Turtledove could have easily turned this into a 400-500 page epic novel and connected many loose ends while stabbing at greater philosophical, political, religious and social issues.Overall, a let down at the end after a promising start."},{"Title":"A Different Flesh","review":"I was intrigued with the premise of the book long before I located a copy. Reading it, I was disappointed to find that there wasn't much more to it than that. It's written as a series of vignettes, starting with early American colonists encountering the Sims, and continuing forward through time to the present day, with Sims being used as medical test-subjects. I liked that approach at first, but now I'm wondering if a novel would have worked better. None of the characters are very well fleshed out (excuse the pun), and the alternate-reality world of the sims seems disappointingly similar to our own. I'd love to see a different writer work from the same starting point - the results could be fascinating."},{"Title":"A Different Flesh","review":"Having read many Harry Turtledove books I found this one to be a different style than many of his other books. While alternate history, it is not focused as much on characters through a time continuum. It is a series of short stories where America is still inhabited by creatures that are no longer in our world - Homo Ergaster, sabre tooth tigers, mastadons, etc. There are hints of other differences but generally works on the behavior, social interaction, historical, and ethical considerations of these creatures (many on Homo Ergaster) and the world as it develops. Particular stories about slavery, animal testing, and the industrial revolution cause you to think about our relationship with the world. This book appeals to many genres - cryptozoology, science fiction, alternative history, and historical fiction. A very fun read."},{"Title":"A Different Flesh","review":"I am a Turtledove fan and bought this book to replace an old soft cover copy.

During the many months on the trail she befriends a family who helps watch out for her, and she befriends the wagon train scout who is a strong and handsome man named Cort Trevor. Even though he told her he did not want her to join the wagon train beacuse she had no male companion, he was nevertheless infatuated with her. They develop a strong bond during the months together. He is constantly watching out for her and putting his life on the line for her. Even when she is kidnapped by Indians, he scours the hills to find her. This book has a strong plot and well developed characters. Amy is a strong and intelligent heroine. And you cannot help but love Cort. He is strong and handsome, confident in what he does.

The Door's aficionado looking for a book about Jim Morrison will need to look elsewhere.This amusing and very readable book has A LOT in common with the Riverworld Saga by Philip Jose Farmer which began with the Sci-Fi novel: &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; , written sveral decades ago. Or early Vonnegut (especially Slaughter House 5).Don't expect deep ruminations of cosmic signifigance. This is a book filled with sarcastic wit, a complex plot, a sense of humor. It isn't about Morrison, or Doc Holiday or Aimee Semple McPherson. (However ASMcP's doppleganger &quot;Semple&quot; is one of the more amusing characters I have encountered in American fiction in the last 20 years.If you were able to read &quot;The Hitchhiker's guide to The Universe&quot;, or any Vonnegaut novel, you may enjoy this novel. The humor is certainly a notch above watching re-runs of Seinfeld.It is a light-weight novel.. a great summer read. You'll score no points with the literati, but it worth reading.

Let's face it,if you want biography and retospective,Danny Sugarman said it all.This story is about Jim's,and many others, purported afterlife,where anything goes...except trying to attain Godhood-the only no-no in Farren's cunningly crafted cosmology...or is it cosmogony?In Mick's topsy- turvey creation,hedonistic excess seems to be the order of the day.You are allowed to punish yourself,if you so desire,but what for?You're already dead! My fondest wish is,when I die,I can end up in a game of five-card stud with Doc Holliday,Lucifer,and Mick Farren! Mick has yet to write a stinker.I have never met one of his books I didn't love,and I've read them ALL! Hunt them down,you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison's Adventures in the Afterlife","review":"Confucius say: Do Not Judge Book By Cover...and by extention,do not choose book by title! Anyone picking up this book hoping for yet another tired Doors retrospective will,like Mr. Price,be sadly disappointed! However,if,like myself,you can joyfully suspend your disbelief for this wonderfully decadent,psychedelic thrill ride(not thriller!),you are in for the time of your afterlife! Mick has reached deep into his considerable experience of late 20th century weirdness and trash culture to produce one of the strangest trips I have ever taken without drugs...or at least a car! The ONLY Doors reference that needs to be applied to this book is that the archetypal Jim Morrison REALLY manages to &quot;break on through...to the other side&quot;!

No, this is just good, clean fantasy, a romp through the Afterlife, with Sex, Drugs, and a Rock 'n' Roll attitude.

Her imagination bursts forth with the logic of childhood (the yellow-green duck needs shoes, so that he can leave home). However, her creativity is not rewarded by her teacher, and she must restart her story several times. The characters she draws as a part of her story-writing attempts then take on a life of their own, continuing on in their own adventure. In the end, she finds a way to please her teacher's desire for realism without giving up her own creativity. Primary teachers will understand that there is a place for realism in education, but children and parents will rejoice in the heroine's ability to maintain her confidence in her imagination while meeting the requirements of the assignment. The text is written at a first/second grade reading level and the illustrations appear to be kid drawn, lending to the appeal of this story. Primary students will be able to relate to this story and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"My Duck","review":"This is a delightful book. The drawings are charming; the story engaging.

His sources are impeccably presented and must be of great value to military students of the war in that theatre. Being given permission to attach this work to the definitive overall history by Charles Oman is sufficient acceptance in itself to guarantee its place on the shelves of the most august military libraries, however, it must be said that a similar work coming from the &quot;enemy&quot; of the time, &quot;Listes des officers tues et blesses pendant les Guerres de l'Empire&quot; by M Martinien, was in continuous use by Sir Charles throughout his own mammoth compilation, and , although often remarked upon by that author as being &quot;invaluable&quot; was never elevated beyond that rather minor appellation. That criticism apart this work has such a wealth of hitherto &quot;hard to find&quot; information, so easily made accessible, that it would be churlish to deny the author his laurels.

Olivia is a heroine out of her time struggling to battle the inevitable censure brought on by the fact that she is managing one of the most successful breweries in London which her late husband has left her. In her two years of full mourning she has decided to read every scrap of literature relating the management and the making of beer. She tackles the task head on, becoming so successful at it that spoiled and unscrupulous, peer of the realm Lord Pryce decides that he wants her brewery and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Hence a lovely villain.When Lady Olivia is attacked by thugs hired by Pryce, Will Coffin strides in out of the fog to save the day. Full with a bushy mustache, six shooter, as long duster and more Western expressions that will put a grin on your face (such as \\"Fog's so thick that not even a mule in a mineshaft could see!\\"). The typical Western Cowboy who Lady Olivia hires to help manage her brewery. There are enough hot electrical sparks between them to light a fire - they are very sexually attracted to each other - as he is constantly saying whatever is on his mind - mostly to do with Lady Olivia's appearance, her beauty or her lips. She is taken aback by his candor and easy going, honest manner. All hell brakes loose when she brings him to her house and they encounter the tremendous censure from society when a high class lady is fraternizing with the lower classes.This book is marvelous. An amazing story of how Olivia's love for Will transforms her and how they will stop at nothing to be together and love each other - no matter the dictates of society. An amazing debut from Zo Archer - the book was exquisite, well written observing the Victorian elements of the era and fun and sexy to boot. The character development is wonderful and you will delight in reading Olivia's and Will's story. I can't wait for Zo's next book."},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"Zoe Archer's debut novel is a refreshing and delightful read. Lady Olivia Xavier, the beautiful heroine, will not disappoint romance readers. She is a strong, independent businesswoman who frowns and struggles with the dictates of Victorian society and forms her own path. Underneath, she longs for romance and adventure, reading dime store cowboy novels in her spare time. Will Coffin, a \\"real\\" American cowboy, arrives in England to try and locate his lost family. He is a strong, sexy male who is attracted to and admires Olivia. He comes to her rescue to save her brewery, but also gives her the romance she has longed for. The romance is fun and sexy; definitely an 8 to 10 on the sensual scale. Zoe Archer really pulls off the blend of the Wild West American & the Society English Lady. There is suspense and many fun scenes. Unlike some romances, you do not walk away thinking any of these characters are flighty. I really enjoyed this story and look forward to future books by Zoe Archer."},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"This book changed my view of romance novels. It was funny, intelligent, and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I'm ordering Zoe Archer's 2nd book because I liked this one so much."},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"In 1883 London, Colorado cowboy Will Coffin intercedes and rescues Lady Olivia Xavier from assault of three punks. She thinks the hunk who saved her from Lord Pryce's hired thugs could have been the front cover model of the western dime novels she loves to read.Lady Olivia hires Will to help her save the brewery that she inherited from her late husband her unscrupulous rival Lord Pryce will do anything to either destroy or preferably steal her firm. Meanwhile Will has come to England to find his family here. He has no plans to socialize with people he does not understand nor is able to communicate with yet somehow he and Lady X who speaks a foreign language that sort of sounds like English, communicate through their hearts. Though the lady and the cowboy are in love, their respective social classes are more than just oceans apart.This is a terrific Victorian romance that focuses on cultural differences between a tea toting English aristocrat and a cow poking American cowboy. The story line emphasizes the Grand Canyonesque gaps that the loving pair must surmount if they want a permanent relationship a concept both desire and fear. Humor via stereotyping presumptions add to the fun as Olivia cannot understand how he can be gentle instead of a rough hooligan like in the dime novels while Will struggles with how his English rose can be understanding and kind instead of haughty as he assumed all aristocratic ladies pretend a loftiness that make dudes like him feel like sewage. Fans will enjoy Zoe Archer's superb historical driven by two obviously in love characters that live light years apart in lifestyles.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"Olivia Xavier has been widowed for five years. In his will, her husband left her the brewery, Greywell, which Olivia is determined to run herself. As a lady in 1883, it's extremely unconventional for her to be working, and running a brewery is shocking. Olivia doesn't care. She has her dreams and fantasies, and they all center around the stories she reads in dime novels about cowboys and the untamed America.Will Coffin is a cowboy from Colorado. He's in England looking for his family with no real clue where to start his search. Like any self respecting cowboy, he brought his boots, hat, guns, and saddle with him across the ocean. He has no idea when he rescues her from some thugs that all his skills would be needed to save Lady X's life and brewery.Olivia is standing outside the brewery waiting for her coach to arrive when she's accosted by several men who'd been sent to intimidate her into selling her brewery. While she's fending them off, a real live cowboy comes out of nowhere and rescues her with a bit of muscle and good ol' western brawling. Once the ruffians are gone, Olivia thanks Will and offers him a reward for his help. Will feels that he only did what any man worth his salt should do and therefore is extremely offended by her offer. He does tell her the general area where he's staying and she later tracks him down. Fortunately for him, she finds him right as the owner of the establishment is requesting him to leave and refuses to let him into his room to gather his possessions. With Olivia backing him up and looking down her aristocratic nose, the owner finally backs down and allows Will to retrieve his things. Olivia offers Will a room in her home for the night. While they talk, Will tells her about his parents' death and the miner who had found and raised him. He also explains to her exactly why he is in England. Olivia is in dire need of help with the so-called gentleman who's trying to force her to sell her brewery. Will needs help finding his folk. Can the two of them work out a plan that ensures that they both find their dreams . . . even if their dreams are more than they ever imagined.I've read many books with cowboys and ladies but this is the first one I've ever read where the cowboy goes to England and I have to tell you I love it! Will doesn't put on fancy airs for anybody. He speaks with a decidedly American twang, and isn't afraid to fight when the need arises. Olivia is also bold, her fear of being ousted from society keeps her from displaying the full force of her nerve, though you do get peeks of it here and there. She's intelligent and determined, just as I'd expect a business woman to be. However, there's also a wistfulness that comes out when she's with Will. Together, they're a power to be reckoned with as they set out to shock and titillate the upper-crust of English society. Zoe Archer's LADY X'S COWBOY is both humorous and exciting from beginning to end. Definitely a book I'd recommend reading if you enjoy cowboy stories.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"She was an independent widow frustrated by the rules of London society. He was a cowboy from Colorado seeking his past and contemplating his future. The differences between them were limitless, but their passion was undeniable.Lady Olivia Xavier has been a widow for over two years when this story begins and she is successfully running the brewery her husband left her after his death. One night on the streets of London, Olivia is attacked and then rescued by none other than American cowboy Will Coffin. Will is basically a drifter in London, looking for any clues about his past. He is desperately seeking the identity of his birth parents, who died when he was younger. But seeing the beautiful Lady X has distracted him from his original quest.Olivia is fascinated by Will from the first moment she meets him. The man is a real-life cowboy - straight out of the pages of the dime novels she loves to read about cowboys and Indians. She knows society would never accept any association between the two of them, but Olivia can't help the attraction she feels towards this stranger in a Stetson.Olivia also realizes Will is a man with nothing to lose. So she asks if he would help protect her brewery from the mischievous Lord Percy. Percy wishes to buy her brewery, but Olivia has refused every attempt. Olivia is worried Percy's attempts to scare her into selling are becoming more serious and dangerous with each passing day. Will, never one to abandon a woman in distress, quickly rushes to her side as her protector.Lady X's Cowboy is nothing but surprises. It is a fun ride from the first page to the last. If I'm going to pick a historical romance to read, Regency and Westerns are probably two of my favorites, but put the two together? Well, that sounds like an interesting challenge for any author...one that Archer is more than capable of pulling off.From chapter one, Archer had created a world that I knew I would enjoy immensely. It was charming, funny and just beautiful storytelling. I was completely blow away by the quality of her writing. She would have a strong western accent from one character and quickly switch to the heroine's dialogue of formal English. Let's just say I was impressed. The characters were so strongly different right from the start I found it hard to believe that one person wrote them. And they were absolutely delightful to read about. Lady X was a truly fierce, independent woman way ahead of her time. The way she would 'spit' in the face of society was fascinating. She walked a fine line...keeping herself in good graces with those around her, but never too careful as to follow society's rule to the point where it made her unhappy.Will was even more charming. Everyone tried to perceive him as the dumb American cowboy, but he was anything but. His dialogue was colorful and his manners were adorable. You could not have asked for a better hero. He was the muscle to protect her during the day...and he was the intellectual and sensual individual to keep her company at night. The only question was: Could they overcome their differences and society's disapproval to live happily ever after?Lisa @ Once Upon A Chapter"},{"Title":"Lady X's Cowboy (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"A friend of mine loaned me this book and I must say that at first I was a little skeptical.

The hired thug Maddox was a hoot, reading Western dime novels to figure out how to fight Will and Pryce the stereotypical aristocrat that always get someone else to do their dirty work was a slimy character. SPOILER: I was glad the author did not have Will coming from a wealthy family and that Olivia got her title because her husband was a successful business man. The love scenes though not many were placed just right within the story, the author allowed Will & Olivia to develop their attraction to each other and made the reader as anxious for the deed to be done as the H/h.

Finally it ends with the celebration of the full statue being built and how it is enjoyed still today. In the back of the book there are great resources to be used in the classroom; such as a table of important dates, names of all who contributed to the statue, the actual dimensions of the statue and different restorations that have been made to the statue throughout the years.Betsy and Giulio's Maestro The Story of the Statue of Liberty follows some of the National Council for the Social Studies Standards or NCSS. These standards are, helping learners to analyze and evaluate the influence of various forms of citizen action on public policy. This standard pertains to the book because by reading the book students understand how the actions of the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty affected our history and still influence us today. Another NCSS standard this book benefits is enable learners to develop historical understanding through the avenues of social, political, economic, and cultural history."},{"Title":"The Story of the Statue of Liberty","review":"This book is a great for a history lesson on how the USA acquired the statue of liberty.

Well this one isn't, and if one keeps a few concepts in mind, is almost as good as anything one can find on the subject of close-ups of insects.After a brief introduction, the author promptly launches into a discussion of the equipment that one needs to take insect close-ups. Luckily, TTL flash, one of the boons of modern technology, was already on the scene, so the equipment discussion, whether of macro lenses, close-up diopters or tripods, is still applicable. The only thing that has changed is the availability of digital media. As long as one remembers that digital photographers have the ability to change the ISO speed of the media with each shot, and that exposure may be easily checked with histograms and \\"blinkies\\" there is no cause for concern here.Although the author's excellent pictures are used throughout the book, the second section is a portfolio of the author's insect and spider pictures, where he describes the circumstances surrounding the taking of each picture in detail.In the third part of the book the author discusses what he calls \\"Photographics\\", that is, the techniques to be applied for the use of the equipment which he previously discussed. He dwells on exposure and tonality and talks about the differing requirements for using three types of light: natural light, fill flash and total flash.Finally West talks about finding subjects, including the ethics involved in photographing insects.The author's words are simple, clear and concise and if you follow his instructions you should be able to take good pictures of insects. I have only a few quibbles.I believe that his discussion of total flash photography could have emphasized the importance of making sure that the flash was far stronger than any ambient light to prevent blurred images. Thus, even though all of the pictures in the book of the author taking photographs in the field show his flash on a mount that places the flash as far forward as the front of the camera lens, he did not make it clear that this was to help overcome the ambient light or tell you in the text that this position was desirable. Similarly he could have suggested that using a low ISO with flash also helps to reach this same objective.I was also disappointed that there was no significant discussion of taking pictures of flying insects, since this is far more difficult than taking pictures of stationary insects, and yields far more exciting pictures.John Shaw, in his \\"Nature Photography Field Guide\\" covers the same ground as this book, although with less emphasis on insects and more instruction on other aspects of outdoor photography. If you really want to see terrific insect macrophotography, see John Brackenbury's \\"Close Up\\". There's not much instruction there, but lots of inspiration.West's book is a fine guide for insect macrophotography, with excellent pictures to serve as an example."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Insects & Spiders (How To Photograph Series)","review":"More than a great photografer, Larry West is also a great writer, directing its language to the ammateur public but not being superficial and boring to the professional readers. Almost all the informations are illustred with one or more of his great pictures.

However, the direction of the articles fell like scattered shot. This was not planned exploration into the interaction of fear and environment for which I had hoped. Perhaps that was not the point of this work, but that was what I wanted as a layman.The gender and literary perspectives complemented the expected architects well. I did not expect the personal accounts and they added energy and freshness into the work. The photo-essay annoyed me more than enlightened me. In short, there was something for everyone, but not a whole lot for anyone in particular.None of the articles explicitly built on each other. The full value of the many perspectives was not used. One article was spent defining different types of defensive spaces and then the definitions fell by the wayside.Besides the loose nature of the work, I felt that sociology and economy were excluded. Numbers have powerful stories to tell (anyone who need convincing, see Edward Tufte) and their voices were not heard in this multi-disciplinary collection.This is worthwhile reading, but not a must have."},{"Title":"Architecture of Fear","review":"Architecture of Fear provides fascinating insights into the effects of the structures that surround us in our everyday lives.

This novel focuses heavily on Spock (great portrayal!) and McCoy (annoying!) for known characters, and introduces a really interesting character -- Ensign Eric Stiles. Stiles is assigned to evacuate Spock and friends from a planet in turmoil, but Stiles gets captured during the otherwise successful mission. Imprisonment for four years has a definitive effect on Stiles and he establishes a strong bond with a fellow prisoner, Zevon. Fast forward several years and the biological terrorist has attacked the Romulans. The Romulans can't save themselves...perhaps the Federation can help?WHAT I LIKED:Great story, and Stiles is a fantastic character. Definitely the best addition to the series so far, not surprising given Carey's strong ties to the Starfleet universe!WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:My complaints (for the previous two books) related to characterizations are not as relevant here. Riker and Picard's involvement are minimal and Crusher and Data are okay with only one problematic scene for Data's portrayal.THE BOTTOM LINE:Of the first three, this is by far the best. 4.00 lilypads out of 5.00Other Information:- Source: Library- Original date of review: 2001, updated 2011- Format reviewed: Softcover- Series: Star Trek ./ ST: TNG (#53) / Double Helix (#03)- Tags: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Fiction, Prose, Sci-Fi, ST:TNG, Star Trek"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"After getting a little bored with the specs of yet another horrid virus, I was quite pleased with this book in the series when it concerntrated it's attention elsewhere.

The editing of the book also was not the best and makes me wonder if the author actually knows what &quot;leer&quot; means. The fact that the book is actually distinctly breathtaking promises great things with better editing and a bit more thought to the plot consistency.

Spock, here portrayed as an older ambassador, is filled with wit, depth, kindness, and above all, humor. In fact, all of the scenes and dialogues are truly thoughtful and intelligently conceived. The story is finely plotted and timed. However, the ending is too abrupt. Over all this is an excellent story with excellent characters."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I enjoyed learning about the character Eric Stiles, and the chemistry between Spock and McCoy was very well portrayed. Though I am not a super-Next Generation Fan, I do like the characters Dr. Crusher and Data, and I think the scene in the Romulan fortress was great. However, I did not particularly care for the way the author ended the book.

You'll get it more if you do."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I have been reading Star Trek novels ever since they have been turning them out and this is definitely one of the best. It ranks right up there with &quot;Spock's World&quot;, &quot;Imzadi&quot;, and &quot;Q-Squared&quot;. They banter with Spock and McCoy couldn't be better.

We get 100 pages of Stiles before anything happens. The book is very forced, especially the capture of Stiles. The continuity with the other Double Helix books is all messed up. Diane Carey shouldn't be allowed to write any non-TOS books. It scares me to think that she will be writing three of the books in next summer's New Earth series. And they're letting her create her own series like Peter David's New Frontier!"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"So far, the series has been pretty good and since this is Diane Carey I was very interested in this book. But, it was a big disappointment. It started out perfectly, with a &quot;Star Wars&quot; style action sequence that is well described and written. The story developes pretty good from that moment, up to the point when we enter the &quot;present&quot; time. From that moment on, it all falls apart. The next action sequence is one long barrage of orders, and, not being a sailor, I didn't understand at all what the heck was going on. But that's just minor. My two biggest complaints are these: 1. The plague is just a background story that is hardly discussed and is solved so quickly that I wonder why the book has such a small print. 2. The characters start off great but towards the end become pure cardboard. Spock really isn't that secretive, and McCoy isn't that senile. It's a fine novel, but yeah, it's not that good... &quot;Ship of the Line&quot; was way better."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It's a return, in many ways, to much of Carey's old Trek lore in which we get new characters to know and love and see them interacting with the familiar characters that we know and love from the Trek universe. Her characterizations of everyone are well done and she really gives Eric Stiles an interesting story that's a pleasure to read. Hopefully, we'll see more of him in the future. Another point I liked is that fact that the nature and severity of the virus is increasing over the novels. I only hope the series continues to get better from here on out..."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"Although Red Zone is basically about the mystery virus, again mutated by the unseen evil presence, attacking the Romulan royal family, and the efforts of Drs. McCoy &amp; Crusher to fight it, the novel primarily concerns Ens. Eric Stiles, whose grandfather served aboard the Enterprise with Kirk, Spock, &amp; McCoy. When what appeared to be the routine evacuation of Ambassador Spock and his staff goes awry, Stiles sacrifices himself to let everyone else escape. He is captured and shares a prison with Zevon, a Romulan scientist who is responsible for a deadly phenomenon which continually savages the planet and its people (and led to their xenophobia). Eric is rescued by McCoy four years later after working with Zevon to try to save the planet. Ten years after that he is the captain of a Starfleet repair ship and becomes involved in the fight against the virus. His metamorphosis from callow ensign to mature Starfleet officer is the basis for this excellent book. I would love to read about him in another of Diane Carey's books.

Zevon, however, has changed. . . ."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I read all six of the Double Helix books before reviewing this, and I still believe this is one of the worst yet! Basically Spock and Eric Stiles are the only character introduced in the first part. Now really, if you're going to write a book, at least include three or four characters. Plus, I found Eric Stiles annoying. I think Diane either rushed or didn't bother to actuallt contemplate about what she was writing. The content of this book almost makes it sound as though she was rushing through what could have been a great novel.If only Diane had enhanced the content and dialogue a little, it would have made a great book three, but instead, the content is sloppy, the plot is jumbled and at times hard to follow, the climax was a little sudden and forced, and the karate wife was a little much for me at the end. The ending was rushed. Diane Carey should have put a little more effort into this one!"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I read all 6 stories before putting up my comments.This story brings back memories of the famous three, Kirk, Spock and McCoy, only too bad Kirk was still not around. The protrayal of Spock especially McCoy was the way I remembered him. Most nostalgic as I like the character of Dr McCoy very much. It was also of a story of an ensign who tries too hard to please and the sacrifices made and this ensign finally grew up to become a responsible person."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"Mark Twain once described Richard Wagner's music as being \\"better than it sounds.\\" This sentiment sums up my feelings of Diane Carey's Trek novels.When one picks up a Star Trek novel by Diane Carey, one may be assured of two comforting elements: 1) Captain Kirk (and, by association, the rest of the TOS crew) will be treated by other characters as the bravest, strongest, noblest, handsomest, simply the ginchiest anyone has ever seen; and 2) Ms. Carey's knowledge and experience of nautical and naval traditions will be lathered over the story at every opportunity in a manner almost of reminiscent of Irving Wallace, who would do extensive research of his subject and then have a character simply mouth paragraph after paragraph of expository paraphrasing, almost completely divorced from the context of the plot. Ms. Carey's last two efforts evince these traits exceptionally well. In \\"Ship Of The Line,\\" she has Captain Morgan Bateson speak in nineteenth-century sailing lingo, while in \\"Red Sector,\\" her protagonist has a case of hero-worship on Spock that borders on the homoerotic.Ms. Carey's latest effort, \\"Wagon Train To The Stars,\\" is classic Carey. Both the above elements are present in full force. A supporting character -- the captain of a privateer vessel in the aforementioned \\"wagon train,\\" early on rebels against taking orders from Kirk, saying \\"there's only one man in a hundred thousand worth following\\" (or words to that effect). Then, after several amazingly heroic, courageous and daring feats, the privateer places himself fully at Kirk's disposal, repeating his earlier statement.... She has to show the reader just how heroic, how wonderful the TOS characters are. I can't imagine her Kirk with the humor shown in \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" or \\"How Much For Just The Planet?\\", the self-doubt of \\"Balance Of Terror\\" and \\"Obsession,\\" or the fallability of \\"Operation -- Annihiliate!\\" and \\"Errand Of Mercy.\\"I'll continue to read the New Earth books. Once again, Carey (this time with John Ordover) have concocted a brilliant plot, and so far it's a pretty good story. It's just that her actual words never quite live up to the story's promise."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"And I already want to die from boredom. First off, this series seems to be a bit bland. The plot stops just as it's getting interesting in the first two books. But THIS one is the worst yet! I bought the series to read about the plague, not about some &quot;Lightcudder&quot; (read the book, you'll find out) and his feelings. However, the plague seems to be curiously missing throughout most of the book, making me wonder whether John Ordover and Michael Jan Friedman read this book. Eric Stiles seems to be the main character. Also, Spock and McCoy seem to be missing from a lot of the book thus far, making me wonder why they and not Stiles are on the cover. There was a whole extraneous scene in the book about a repair on a ship. I'm about two inches from dropping the book and picking up the fourth one. I really only bought the series for the &quot;New Frontier&quot; bit. After this one, I think I'll never buy a Diane Carey book.

Love them books.Rondall Banks"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"The Star Trek: Double Helix series is about a mysterious villain who is releasing biological agents across the Alpha Quadrant. This time he has targeted the Romulan royal family, and is up to Dr. McCoy and Ambassador Spock to find the cure before the Romulan Star Empire collapses into chaos and a potential devastating border war with the Federation.That's what the book is supposed to be about. Forget all of that. The Romulans, the plague, Ambassador Spock and Dr. McCoy are all on the sidelines. The real story is about two young people. One is a Starfleet officer who desperately wants to live up to the legacy of his ancestors who served with Captain Kirk and fought in the Romulan Wars. The other, Zevon, is a Romulan prince and scientist, wracked with the guilt that a simple experiment he created led to the destabilization of an entire world. Both spent four years together as POWs in Red Sector, an area of space sealed off from the rest of the galaxy because of its political instability and hostility to aliens. Stiles eventually gained his freedom, but Zevon remained. Now years later, it is up to Stiles to rescue his friend and return him to Romulus, for his untainted blood is the last great hope for a cure.If this all sounds complicated, it is. Diane Carey is a wonderful veteran Trek writer, but the plot jumps all over the damn place. She tries to do too many things in too little space. You've got the plague, the conspiracy behind it, the Romulans and all of their political intrigue, one last adventure for Spock and McCoy, Eric Stiles' maturation from a young ensign to a hero and officer in his own right, and Zevon's fight to bring peace and stability back to the planet his experiment had ruined.Nitpicks: 1) This is supposed to be a medical thriller but it's not. 2) The mastermind villain becomes so mysterious he's almost like a cartoon character. 3) Red Sector is such an artificial plot device. I just can't believe the Federation, Romulans, and everybody else would seal off an area of space just because of some anti-alien hostility on a primitive world. 4) For various reasons, it makes much more sense to have Dr. McCoy treating the Romulan royals than Dr. Crusher, who starts acting just like him in her bedside manner. 5) The Top Gun stuff gave me a headache.Despite all of this, the book is still fun to read. Why? Because the characterization is excellent. Ambassador Spock and Dr. McCoy don't appear often, and rarely together, but when they do they shine. You really do feel like you're seeing legends at work. Even more impressive is the creation of a strong character such as Eric Stiles completely out of scratch. His transformation from a young inexperienced ensign to a hero worthy of Kirk makes up more than enough for all of the book's many flaws."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"The another book for Double Helix, this book doesn't even mention the virus that's plaguing the series until at least half way through. This book focuses more on the career of Kevin Stiles, grandson of Lieutinent Stiles from the Original Series (Balance of Terror). Also in this story, is the ongoing relationship of Spock and McCoy."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"This book is a journey of one man. At the beginning of the novel he is but an ensign in charge of extracting Ambassador Spock from a world in political turmoil, and it does not go the way he intends. The first part of the book is about his life after that mission goes awry, and how he grows up from a young, unsure-of-himself officer to a hardened man. The second part of the book sees him take on a new challenge that is intertwined with the Double Helix plot, of which this book is part 3 of 6.With guest appearances by Spock, McCoy, Dr. Crusher and other characters in the NCC-1701-D crew compliment, this book centers on the journey of this young man from adolescene to adulthood, and I was gripped from beginning to end by the inner turmoil and outer emotions that the main character, Eric Stiles, is expertly described to undergo by Diane Carey. Ms. Carey's expertise in naval technical details shines in this book, as also seen in her hardback novel, _Ship of the Line_, about the first mission of the Enterprise NCC-1707-E, starring Captaion \\"Frazier\\" (Kelsey Grammar from Cheers' TNG character) and the NCC-1701-D crew after the movie Star Trek Generations. Both that book and this one have the characters on board vessels not normally seen in Star Trek TV episodes, for example border cutters (like the Coast Guard) and CSTs -- Combat Supply Tenders, one of which plays a major role in both book 3's plot and the ongoing double helix plot in this novel.I highly recommend the Double Helix series--at least the first three books which I have read so far. They are entertaining, bring in characters from other eras and Star Trek series, and the underlying virus plot is also a great mystery.If you're just looking for the further adventures of 130-something year old Bones McCoy, and his green blooded pal Spock, this is a great book. She depicts those characters true to their form from TV and the expanded universe of their appearances in various novels since then. Bravo to Diane Carey! Now I'm on to Book 4...."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"Red Sector is a fantastic book. It's very refreshing having a book that concentrates almost primarily on a non main character in John Eric Stiles. The character is extremely well thought out and written.

Hopefully the next three in the Double Helix series will be as good as this one and the other two.

Here the sub-plot becomes the main plot; the story of Eric Stiles is more interesting than yet another medical &quot;thriller&quot; when we've already seen the plague fought twice. However, as another reviewer points out, some of the substitutes Carey uses for &quot;He/she said&quot; are bizarre. And everybody leers -- Dr. Crusher leers! Somebody should have edited this one. It's a shame when a well-thought-out plot is side-tracked for the reader by distractions in the writing."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"Diane Carey *does it* for me. She spins a great tale, a sidebar to the Double Helix plotline - but, wait a minute, no, it's not a sidebar at all.Much character development in the form of a young ensign who starts out determined to do everything by the book and then ends up learning that &quot;by the book&quot; might not get you very far.Great interaction between our old favorites, Spock and McCoy, and some mighty fine Crusher moments, as well. (Her scene with Data and the Romulan guards is priceless.)Meantime, the plot thickens, the virus twists again, we've already learned there's a &quot;bad guy,&quot; and we're all hating like heck that he keeps getting away!"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I was looking forward to this book, but it ended up being an utter disappointment. The virus storyline that should've been the main plot was reglated to subplot status, which made me question the point of even doing this book as a &quot;Double Helix&quot; book. Heck, the virus isn't even mentioned until page 122! And when it was mentioned, it was done in a very offhandish way.It seemed to me that the author was more interested in telling her story about the commander (Eric Stiles) than she was about the supposed purpose of the book, and that just seemed utterly disrespectful to me. That story should've been saved for another novel, and the main focus should've been on the research to discover a cure.I found the ending to be way too pat for my tastes. I've never been a fan of &quot;surprise endings&quot; in which we are dumped a pile of information that we didn't previously know and the author goes &quot;ha! gotcha!&quot; as if that's supposed to make us feel like dupes for not figuring out the mystery (even though there's no way to figure out the solution given just the clues in the book). This happened with the &quot;surprise&quot; revelation that Zevon had a child, and this child is the last &quot;uncontaimed&quot; Romulan royal family member.There were also some plain-out weird word choices in this novel. I can't remember any other book where I've paused so much after reading a certain word or phrase. Using the word &quot;edited&quot; in a dialogue tag, and Dr. Beverly Crusher remarking that perhaps she would change her career to being a professional wrestler (when I'm fairly sure no such thing exists in the ST future) were just two of the many examples that caught my eyes.All in all, a very disappointing story, one that I wouldn't recommend at all. Perhaps the worst Star Trek story I've ever read."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoyed the way all the events in the books melded together. How friendship and courage and decency became the glue that cemented the whole of the story. To me, as a 25 yr Star Trek fan that is the appeal of the series and the Star Trek characters. The character of Stiles was a refreshing one. He seemed within the emotional reach of the reader and his self-discovery and self-realization lead the story along, while providing a wonderful avenue for bringing the more familiar characters of Spock and Dr. McCoy and Dr. Crusher into the tale. Diane Carey has done her usual job of making the details and science of the Starfleet ships and crew seem very believable, also. I am not overly concerned with technology and sometimes feel bogged down with details in some of the books,but Carey makes me want to read about the workings of a StarFleet ship and makes it an interesting part of the story. The medical aspects of the whole Double Helix series has been interesting to me and prompted my initial interest in the series. I think they are a keeper and I can't wait to read the next three!"},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"This is a pretty fair to middling Star Trek story, much better than usual for Diane Carey in the she MOSTLY resists the temptation to get overly cute with the language (except for her pathological inablility to use the phrase \\"he said\\", and her tendancy to really reach sometimes to avoid it.) This allows her to concentrate on character, plot, and pacing, which are usually her strong suits as a writer. None of the three are as good in this book as she has sometimes been, but none are bad, either. If there's a flaw to this book other than just not quite measuring up to her usual standards (if one discounts her usual silly games with the language) it's that the backstory is rapidly getting old; this is really not a plot that can hold up over six books. It was getting a bit stale in the second of the series, and is truly starting to smell by this point. Fortunately, Carey doesn't emphasise the medical aspects as heavily as they were emphasised in the first two books, which helped. Also, some fans might consider it a flaw that the book is listed as being a \\"Next Generation\\" title, but has barely a few cameo appearances by the Next Generation characters: a bit of Bev Crusher, a chapter in which Picard, Riker, Data and Worf get a couple of lines apiece, and that's it. The main characters in the book are a young ensign named Stiles, and Ambassador Spock, which makes it somewhat dubious as a \\"Next Generation\\" story."},{"Title":"Red Sector (Star Trek The Next Generation: Double Helix, Book 3)","review":"This is one of the better books in the series of the Double Helix. The book was full of Action, Romance, Evil, Royalty and great characters. There was plenty of action involving phaser duels between characters and between ships. It was like many of the other books in the series. The book had a good guy and a corrupt power holder. A catastrophic event happens and The Federation comes to the rescue once again but this time there is Romulans. There are characters from two of the most powerful species, The Federation and The Romulans. There is a great meaning behind the book. It shows that two people who come from different places can hold on two each other in times of need and that maybe there is a chance of peace in the galaxy. I would recommend this book to who ever is interested in a good Science Fiction book and whoever likes Star trek."},{"Title":"Lew Wallace Boy Writer","review":"Published in 1961 by The Bobbs-Merrill Company, IncIntended for upper elementary students.Thirty-five years ago books like Lew Wallace: Boy Writer filled my library's book shelves in Hope, Indiana and I went through them like a hot knife through butter. I am sure they are a big reason why I enjoy history so much today. I remember enthusiastically reading about the adventures of young Daniel Boone, Abraham Lincoln and even about Martha Washington and other \\"yucky\\" girls as I worked my way down the shelf.I have next to my computer a 1961 hardback copy of Lew Wallace: Boy Writer, part of the Childhood of Famous Americans series. I note this only because Patria Press out of Indianapolis is re-publishing the series, which is a good thing in my mind.As suggested by the series title Lew Wallace: Boy Writer focuses on the childhood of future the Civil War general, territorial governor of New Mexico (during the days of Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War) and author of Ben-Hur: A Tale of Christ. It features young Lew Wallace who hates school but loves to read and explore. His father was the sixth governor of Indiana. Young Lew Wallace had access to the state's library and quickly fell in love with books.The details of Wallace's adult life are not left out or just glossed over as an afterthought, but the main focus is on Wallace's childhood.

Let's be fair: cadogan (or everyman) makes great books, including about the QGA. But this entire &quot;easy guide&quot; series is a little misguided. The back cover says: &quot;just enough detail and explanation to play an opening with confidence&quot;. Not true. The book starts with typical QGA positions. I went trough them: they have practically nothing in common. Each chapter starts with some other positions, then the author gets to the &quot;theory&quot;, which is absolutely not exhaustive.

The prose is crisp and clear, and the lines have an engaging rhythm. The poet pays close attention to the sounds he uses, and they mesh well, with many close rhymes at the end of the 3 line stanzas, and intriguing internal rhymes as well. It is both a very sensual and dramatic work, yet at the same time possess a kind of puritanism and serious spirit in the voice of the narrator, the head of the Donner party. There are some seriosu questions aksed about the nature of the pioneer's interpretation of the American spirit( democracy, sens of American land) and broaches broader topics like the relationship that the 19th century expansion had with he natives and the environment. Ultimately, the answers to these questions meant life and death for the Donner party, and are still of great importance to our consideration fo our own lifestyles and goals today. I foudn it to be an intriguing and honest look intoa subject that quite often invites sensationalism, as well as being a solid piece of poetry that doesn't suffer the open sentimentality or suffocating politics that afflcit amny works about American history. At its best its iron wheels ring with the same clear tones as the brozne shields of the iliad, for the most part it sings with the prairie winds heard in the works of whitman, willa cather, larry mcmurtry and william carlos williams."},{"Title":"The Donner Party","review":"I got \\"The Donner Party\\" as a birthday present in 1972.

Lee, Sherwood Foresters, attached Royal Flying Corps (Wings of war)","review":"This is a work that deserves to be re-printed. It is accessible by the layman, and its aerial combat sequences are clearly written. The author has a pleasing writing style, and he does not fall into the self-worship that sometimes afflicts the writing of combat fliers. Lee effectively communicates the gallantry and the hopelessness of aerial combat without a parchute.One of the most fascinating parts of the book is Lee's exploration of the irrational, purely negligent, decision not to equip pilots with parachutes. Parachutes were available prior to the war and were used by balloon-observors throughout the struggle and German aviators in the last year. Due to simple, murderous bureacratic inattention, pilots went to their deaths who could have been saved by a bundle of silk.Finally, Lee's work is the only one I know of that takes up the ground attack role of aircraft in the First World War. This is often thought to be a development of the Second World War, but Lee provides details of the tactics and missions flown by his unit in this vital role."},{"Title":"No parachute: A fighter pilot in World War I : letters written in 1917 by Lieutenant A.S.G.

Later we learn how stressful it was to be tasked with with ground attacks in a Camel. The reader also learns about all the little things in a pilot's life, like shooting frogs in a pond and partying like there was no tomorrow. And burying your squadron mates with frightening regularity.This book is simply written, and makes no pretext of being a significant historical work.

Lee, Sherwood Foresters, attached Royal Flying Corps (Wings of war)","review":"Anthony Gould Lee was a young pilot with the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. These letters were written to his wife from his Fighter Squadron in France. The airmen of the First World War were the first to give battle in this new frontier. They engaged in single combat like the knights of medieval times. Airplanes were first used for reconnaissance, like aerial cavalry. Then the enemy began to shoot them down. Next began the individual combat between airplanes in 1916 and 1917. By 1918 large disciplined formations clashed in vast dog-fights. They were regarded as knights, but most came from social levels other than the nobility of Europe. Most were young, and had a high wastage rate (p.xvii). The majority did their job without the glory of becoming an ace. This book contains the modified letters he sent home from the front. They tell of his experiences, but this will not interest the general public.Appendix A discusses the Failure of the High Command. They designed a standard government aeroplane for aerial reconnaissance which was totally unsuitable for offense or defense (p.213). Britain lacked a flourishing aircraft industry, like in France or Germany. Creating a monopoly leads to a loss in quality (p.214). The Admiralty did not make this mistake, so the Royal Navy supplied their surplus to the Royal Flying Corps. The survivors of this debacle prevented this from re-occurring in WW II.Appendix B discusses the Strategy of the Offensive and its distant patrols. This caused extra losses and wear and tear on pilots and planes by continuous patrols along the whole British front (p.217). The Germans concentrated superior numbers as it suited them, and caused heavy British air losses (p.218). Sending obsolescent machines deep into enemy territory was as irrational as Haig's adherence to attrition or the Admiralty's resistance to escorted convoys. This was not repeated in WW II.Appendix C discusses the lack of parachutes for airmen. Two explanations were given (no official documentation exists). The claim that no reliable parachutes existed in 1917-1918 was not true (p.219). The other claim that pilots would give up without a fight was contradicted by daily action in France. The effect of having a parachute was to encourage an extra effort, as shown in WW II (p.223). The disavowal of parachutes came from senior officers who had no flying experience! A decision was made in September 1918 to order parachutes, but the war ended before they could be used (p.225). Time purged the decision makers by WW II."},{"Title":"No parachute: A fighter pilot in World War I : letters written in 1917 by Lieutenant A.S.G. Lee, Sherwood Foresters, attached Royal Flying Corps (Wings of war)","review":"Very well written and thoughtful book. It presents a interesting picture of the average life of a pilot in WW I on the front lines. What I find especially interesting is Gould retired as an Air Vice Marshal and was a chief instructor for the RAF. As a result he peppers the original letters he wrote as a young pilot with insights and commentary from his later life including material from the RAF archives. This is the best book I have read on this subject for discussing why events occured as they did in the air war rather than just hyping the \\"glamor\\" of being a fighter pilot in that brief era."},{"Title":"No parachute: A fighter pilot in World War I : letters written in 1917 by Lieutenant A.S.G. Lee, Sherwood Foresters, attached Royal Flying Corps (Wings of war)","review":"Other reviewers have discussed the contents of this book well. I agree that it is fascinating and very unpretentious.From a historical viewpoint, it is especially useful because although it came out in 1968, the author based it on his letters to his wife during the war, and a few diary entries. In the 1960s he then went back and added classified information explaining locations and minor technical issues. This makes it more reliable than many similar books written decades after the fact.There were two notable aspects that other reviewers don't mention. First, he was very frank with his wife, but he left some of the most horrible events and thoughts for his diary - both of which he includes. Second, he and his fellow pilots were especially afraid of burning. Hence the book's title. He wrote his wife that he carried an \\"automatic\\" (probably revolver) per regulations in case he landed in enemy territory, but he confides to his diary that he, and everyone else, intended to use it to shoot themselves if their aircraft caught on fire. Several times he narrowly escaped this fate.Unfortunately, the book says almost nothing about his training, although his unusually long training period clearly played a big role in surviving the war."},{"Title":"No parachute: A fighter pilot in World War I : letters written in 1917 by Lieutenant A.S.G.

I would rate it as a story as high as even the best of his Hornblower series; if one considers its literary qualities it is arguably his best book. The story of a single action in the Mediterranean fought by a single British light cruiser, it captures the intricacies of organization and teamwork that make a fighting ship. Above all, Forester makes clear, the business of naval warfare is that of flesh-and-blood men; from the lowliest seaman to the captain of the ship, all have a vital role to play--any one of them can be a hero."},{"Title":"The ship","review":"Cecil Scott Forester is best known as the creator of Horatio Hornblower, but before writing the \\"Hornblower\\" novels about Nelson's navy he wrote many other books, from \\"Death to the French\\" to \\"The Peacemaker.\\"This little gem, \\"The Ship\\" describes the action seen by the crew of a light cruiser in the course of an afternoon's fighting as they struggle against overwhelming odds to get a vital convoy through to Malta during World War II.Each chapter starts with a few words from the captain's official report of the battle and then describes what this meant from the viewpoint of the human beings involved, from the captain himself down to the most junior seaman. The contrast between the dry, understated language of the official document and the suffering and heroism of the real events can be very powerful. And the amount of detail packed into the book about life on a 1940's warship is amazing.When you read a tale of a heroic battle against impossible odds you tend to assume that the author has made up the story, but in this case you would be wrong. There was a historical battles when a squadron of of British light cruisers escorting a convoy to Malta was attacked by a much heavier force and fought back in much the same way and with the same result as in this book. (If you're interested, look up the story of the second battle of Sirte.)Some readers may find \\"The Ship\\" a little jingoistic. On the other hand, the real men and women who stood up to the nazis and their allies sometimes had to display heroism as great as in this book. C.S. Forester thought they had something to be proud of, and so do I.Forester wrote several novels/short story collections featuring World War II at sea: the others were \\"The Good Shepherd\\", about an American commanding the escort of an atlantic convoy, \\"The Man in the Yellow Raft\\" set on a US destroyer in the Pacific, and \\"Gold from Crete,\\" most of the stories in which are set on a Royal Navy destroyer. All the others are good, but \\"The Ship\\" is brilliant.In my opinion there are four classic novels of World War II at sea: \\"H.M.S. Ulysses\\" by Alastair MacLean, \\"The Cruel Sea\\" by Nicholas Montsarrat, \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" by Herman Wouk, and \\"The Ship\\" by C.S. Forester. I believe that \\"The Ship\\" is the best of the four."},{"Title":"The ship","review":"If you're used to Forester's more character driven novels, specifically the Hornblower series as opposed to books like 'The Gun' you may be a bit put off by this. You need to realize that the people are not the characters here, the Ship itself is.This is the story of a British supply convoy to Malta during WW2 which is attacked by an Italian force of far superior strength. The convoy must get through, but the Italians have two battleships, several destroyers, and various other ships while the British fighting force consists of only six destroyers and some light cruisers (and all the supply vessels as an albatross around their necks). A light cruiser or destroyer is merely an annoying little dog to a battleship, so strategy is called for.The central character of this book is the light cruiser Artemis of Her Majesty's Royal Navy. It has a complement of several hundred, but the conceit here is that Forester treats them as cells or organs in the body of the ship. A typical chapter will involve a focus on some function on the ship (the Captain, the navigator, the chief engineer, all the way down to sailors doing tedious and seemingly trivial but necessary work). You'll be given the back story of the life of the man who performs that task and a fairly detailed summary of the job involved - Forester actually spent time on a naval ship doing research for this.Now you are either going to find it fascinating to see how all these men of varied backgrounds and talents mesh together into a coherent organism or it's going to drive you crazy when Forester takes a several page diversion into the life of a Torpedo Gunner's Mate in the thick of a heated naval battle. At one point when the Artemis is in dire peril he even takes half a dozen pages on how a shell is made and the path it takes to reach a gun. The entire book takes place over the course of only a few hours, but the the back story and detail stretch it out substantially. I appreciated the approach, but be warned not to get too attached to the people - the very point of the book is that they're all important, but bit players. You may never see them again or they may die horribly. You can't expect substantial character growth as in the Hornblower novels, though there's one character who achieves some; the Captain's secretary is the only man in here who's really 'human'.Also, as you might expect from a book written during WW2 it's a bit effusive about how well trained and brave all the British soldiers are, but the British /were/ extraordinarily brave during WW2 and in the spirit of the book I'm willing to believe that everyone on the Artemis did their job perfectly, even though Forester's books usually allow mens' foibles more severe consequences. Just let yourself sink into the book and you'll be turning the last page before you know it."},{"Title":"The ship","review":"Hard to give this one enough stars, especially when you read the backstory of this. Forester really, seriously, knew his business, and had been writing the Hornblower series for many years when this one appeared. While \\"The Ship,\\" meaning the vessel he was writing about was fictional, Forester had been given virtually full access to an absolutley real Brit Light Cruiser that was really involved in (this) action and really engaged in the give and take of a real naval battle. Extremely well written, and I'm not about to give any spoilers. Really, you don't know how this one will turn out, who lives and who dies, until almost the last page. The one thing I would HIGHLY recommend, once you're done with this 1943 (actually during the Second World War) is to head for Wikipedia and find out how, in real life, \\"The Ship\\" really turned out."},{"Title":"The ship","review":"Being a Forester fan he once again shows what made the Royal Navy the force that Italian Navy could not stop in getting control of the Mediterranean during World War II and the efforts the British were prepaired to go to in supplying the garrison and people of Malta. It implies that as a result of battles like this the Germans had to pull air power from the Russian front and try to do what the Italian Navy could not do and that was bring about Malta's surrender. It also shows what a well handled small task force can do when confronted by a much stronger one. While the title of the book is \\"The Ship\\" it is really about the men who served her, from the Captain on down. The book was very enjoyable as have been all of the Forester books I have read. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"The ship","review":"This has to be one of the finest Novels of naval warfare. The book describes one action during WWII on board a RN Light cruiser in the Mediterranean -escorting a convoy to Malta. The action is fast paced and relentless, during the narrative Forrester takes us on a breath taking tour of the ship, meeting the individuals who man the positions, and gaining a brief glimpse of their stories and their sacrifices - how their role big or small fitted into the larger mechanism of the fighting ship. It gives a flavor of what it must have been like and why the RN triumphed against greater odds.

Its all about one day in battle on a Navy ship, many fine descriptions of the personnel and quirks, how the Italian and British command officers thought and planned, and a day in the life of an average British Navy seaman. The only book by Forester I had read was The African Queen, another book I highly recommend and much better than the movie. The Ship was based on a real British Navy ship.

Just one example: No where else I've ever read includes an authentic, authoritative description of the technical detail involved in Royal Navy gunnery accuracy, as told in Forester's account in \\"The Ship\\" of the workings of the transmitting station aboard his cruiser. An absolute must read for any student of the Royal Navy in WW2, but even as a casual read it is highly entertaining!"},{"Title":"The ship","review":"The detail, character portrayals and action are all well-written and absorbing. But I have a question. The author makes a big issue of the Royal Navy's need to protect Malta from the Italian Navy, especially when it comes to protecting the convoys it escorts bringing vital supplies to the beleagured island.The Italians make a major effort to destroy the British escorts so they can then take on and dispatch the merchantmen at their leisure. But why wait until a well-protected convoy is about to put into harbor?

The story is about a little girl who believed that monsters existed. Her parents and friends didn't believe her. One day she discovered her librarian was a monster. She told her parents and they still didn't believe her. She coaxed her friend into coming to the libary and watchig the monster. Her friend was adored by her parents and the girl, Lucy managed to convince her parents her libarian was a monster. Her parents invited the libarian over and Lucy was surprised as her folks sat down and ate the libarian! Horror does not suit everyone However and for some boys and girls can cause nightmares and fears of under the bed etc. Those fears are not a lasting-a- day fear they are fears that last for years until someone soothes them and convinces them the non-existency of monsters. I had that experience too. I'm not outgoing and do not like horror stories. I had a nightmare I was trapped and a monster was chasing me. I shall remember that for a long time.

Then she sees something she can hardly believe, before her eyes Mr. Mortman begins a strange transformation, eats lives flies and scares her half to death. She runs home to tell her family...but Lucy has always had the unfortunate habit of telling tall tales about monsters and frightening her brother, so they don't believe her. What's Lucy to do?

Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" books aren't scary, just kind of creepy. There aren't graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem. Just some ghosts, werewolves, or potions. The main character is alive in the end, and the final chapter resolves everything.**Keep in mind, R.L. Stine has other books that aren't in the \\"Goosebumps\\" series that tend to be a little harsher when it comes to hauntings and plot.

While the portrayal of the Hollywood film industry could not be more farfetched and inaccurate, the three stories are humorous and entertaining, and make good mysteries.The Four of Hearts is a zany sequel to The Devil to Pay. Ellery finally meets his employer, the young Jacques Butcher, colloquially known as Boy Wonder, executive vice-president of production at Magna Studios. Unfortunately, as Ellery begins his work on his first screen play, an elaborate publicity stunt for the new production is derailed by a double murder. As Ellery begins his investigation, he finds himself crossing swords again with Inspector Glucke of the Los Angeles Police Department. And perhaps what is most unexpected, Ellery himself becomes enamored with a popular, strikingly beautiful, Hollywood gossip columnist.Despite the hilarious caricature of movie stars, producers, screen writers, and gossip columnists, the murder mystery itself is still quite good and the puzzle will challenge even the astute reader. Ellery's deductions are impressive.The Four of Hearts has been reissued by HarperCollins. Sometimes an early Pocket Book edition can be found. Another possibility is a 2000 publication by Four Walls Eight Windows of the three Ellery Queen stories that take place in Hollywood under the title The Hollywood Murders."},{"Title":"The Four of Hearts","review":"Yep, I felt like an idiot when I finished this one because I should've spotted the clue early in the book that gave away the identity of the murderer. Yet I give Queen credit for having slipped in the crucial information in such a way that I have it no importance and didn't remember it when it came time to name the culprit.This is one more of the somewhat satirical Hollywood mysteries and while not an accurate picture, it is highly amusing and challenging to me as to trying to equate the Hollywood characters with real life Hollywood people of the era."},{"Title":"The Four of Hearts","review":"I add to the first reviewer that the 1938 hardcover I have(since about 1957) was published by Grosset & Dunlap , New York \\"By arrangement with Frederick A.

L)","review":"This is a rather short novel about three different entities dealing with their retiring years. One of the entities is the director of a provencial Japanese weather station who is the local expert on a dormant volcano. Another is an apostate Catholic Priest who senses that his life ceased its' meaning when he ceased his calling. The last entity is the volcano itself. Although we don't sense a personality to the volcano, it is a metaphor to the other two; is there life left in it or has it spent all it had already.There is a good deal of reflection by the two human characters about their lives. The director discovers that his obsession with the volcano cost him the love of his family. The apostate priest is \\"tolerated\\" in his declining years. He is obsessed with proving his theory that Japanese culture is incompatable with Christianity. He bases this on his theory that Japanese do not sense guilt as Western cultures do. Thus Christ's death on the cross loses its' meaning.We read on in hopes for an epiphany of sorts that would allow the two men to resurrect their lives. In the end we are left only wondering about the future of one of the entities."},{"Title":"Volcano: A novel (Tut books. L)","review":"This book centers around four main characters and their relationship to a supposedly inactive volcano named Akadake. The volcano takes on a personality of its own, and it seems that it is a picture of a sin and evil. Father Sato, one of the characters in the book, says that \\"We can think of Akadake as a symbol of the thing that we call sin.\\" (168) Even though people in the story may not realize it, or may not want to realize it, the volcano is actually active. In the same way, even though a person may not realize it, or may not want to realize it, the human heart is corrupt.Jinpei Suda, who just retired from the Weather Bureau, is an expert on Akadake. He has been convinced that it is no longer active based on previous studies and his own work during his career. He has built up a reputation in his field based on Akadake. However, shortly after his retirement his life goes into a tailspin- his health, his family, and perhaps even his long-held theories on Akadake are about to go out the window. Just as Suda's life is revealed for what it really is, the volcano gives signs that it is not inactive.Durand is a bitter and cynical excommunicated priest who is convinced that the people of Japan cannot understand the concept of sin and redemption. He is also convinced that Akadake will erupt and destroy a retreat that Father Sato is building on the volcano. He spends time living in a hospital room due to poor health (Suda ends up in the room next to Durand).City Councilman Aiba seeks Suda's expertise on the volcano because he wants to build a lavish hotel on it. He wants assurance that Akadake is indeed no longer active so he can go on with his business.Father Sato is a Catholic priest who has a dream to build a retreat on Akadake. He wants to continue on with his projects and says that Akadake \\"has changed to an utterly peaceful mountain.\\" (168) He visits the excommunicated priest Durand in the hospital once in a while because he feels that he has to, but in reality he doesn't want to be bothered with people like Durand.Volcano isn't the most enjoyable book that Endo has written. There are no endearing characters in it. It is not unusual for Endo's novels to be a little dark and this is definitely one of them. Endo is an excellent writer, however. He did his research on volcanoes for this one; it is said that he even had himself lowered by helicopter into one."},{"Title":"Volcano: A novel (Tut books. L)","review":"Volcano was originally published in 1959, and is set the town of Kagoshima on Kyushu Island, which is situated at the edge of a dormant volcano, Akadak&eacute;. Suda Kun has just retired after a long career as the Section Chief of the Surveillance Section of the regional Weather Bureau. He was called the \\"Akadak&eacute; Demon\\", as he claimed to know more about the volcano than anyone else on the island, despite his lack of a formal education. He wishes to publish a book about his research in order to cement his reputation, and agrees to help Aiba, a local city councilman, in a profit making scheme in exchange for financial support of his book.Father Sato is the popular leader of a small but growing Catholic church in town, who has replaced Father Durand, a Frenchman who was removed for committing apostasy. Durand, embittered by his fall, receives frequent visits by Sato, but he belittles his former assistant and his plans to build a sanctuary for his followers on the side of the volcano.Suda and Durand are felled by serious illness, and are faced with their own mortality. At the same time Akadak&eacute; is showing signs of renewed life after decades of dormancy, which threaten the plans of Aiba and Father Sato. Suda, who has proclaimed that the volcano is permanently dormant, chooses to ignore clues which indicate that it is becoming active. Durand actively tries to undermine Sato's position and the faith of the people he formerly ministered to. Both men face their own mortality and guilt about their past behavior, while the smoking volcano towers over them ominously, as if in judgment of them.Volcano is a superbly written and dark yet hopeful novel, whose two main characters experience torment and guilt in the face of imminent death. Suda's lack of compassion toward his wife and sons and Durand's lack of belief in the faith of his parishioners lead directly to the fall of each man, as the volcano serves as a metaphor for both good and evil, and as a symbol of the unchanging power of Nature and God."},{"Title":"Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood","review":"Being a huge fan of classic Hollywood, I snapped this book up and devoured it quickly, thoroughly enjoying all the juicy bits and behind the scene information. Once I got over the initial excitement of so much gossip all at once, I took a closer look, and found that in many, many instances, Higham gets the most basic information completely wrong. Information that is laughably easy to verify. For example:1. Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg's daughter is named Katherine, not Barbara. She was born in 1935, not 1936.2. Ted Healy died from injuries suffered in a bar brawl, kidney failure, and alcoholism, not from a heart attack brought on by Mayer. He was 41, not 45, when he died.3. Jean Harlow never had an affair with her stepfather, Marino Bello; in fact, she hated him. And she didn't encourage her friends and colleagues to invest in his &quot;gold mines,&quot; either.4. John Gilbert didn't die of a heart attack. He was given a sedative by his nurse, had an adverse reaction, and choked to death while unattended.And so on...In addition, Higham is very partial to some stars and absolutely hates others; these attitudes come across in Mayer's biography so strongly that they are often distracting from the story itself. Garbo is a monster of selfishness. Crawford is a bed-hopping tramp. Shearer is a terrible snob. Some of which may be true, but I'm sure these people had their good sides, too, but you won't find such balance here.At first glance, there is quite a bit of fascinating, never-before-known &quot;information&quot; in this book. After realizing how little the author checks his facts, though, I have to wonder if any of these incredible tales are true, or even close to true."},{"Title":"Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood","review":"In his prologue, Higham tells us that much of the information he discloses has been drawn from hitherto sealed government files. Its more believable that he had long conversations with Howard Strickling, since Strickling was head of MGM's publicity department during the reign of Louis B Mayer, and the one responsible for the covering up of the secret lives of the stars. I guess the fun about gossip is in the discovery of the sordid details. Perhaps it's then only fair that I drop some of the names mentioned and let you discover the particulars. There's actually not a lot that was previously unknown to me. There's the death of Jean Harlow's husband Paul Bern, and then later the death of Harlow herself. The day of the lamentable shortage of knockworst in the commissary when no jockstraps could be worn under tights. The not too surprising inclination of Garbo's mentor Mauritz Stiller. Garbo's repeated no-shows for marriage to John Gilbert, and Mayer's dislike of Gilbert stemming from behaviour long before Garbo came into the scene. Why Garbo never bore a child. The fate of the footage of extras being drowned in Ben-Hur. The men killed by both Clark Gable and John Huston. Lee Tracy's forced retirement. How George Cukor nearly lost the job of directing Camille, as well. The supplier of drugs to Judy Garland. And Leni Riefenstahl's attempts to join MGM. The scandals seem to dissipate once we hit World War 2, or is that Higham's focus is more on Mayer's infidelities, and eventually his clashes with Nicholas Schenck and Dore Schary? Higham also presents a filmic history of the studio and it's output. I wish he'd only given us more dirt, because I get the impression that these scandals are just the tip of the iceberg."},{"Title":"Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood","review":"Louis B Mayer looms larger that few others over the Golden Age of Hollywood, though he is little understood as his own man. He battled with John Gilbert. He was fond of Katharine Hepburn. He drove Judy Garland to what eventually would become her ruin, and then tried to save her when it was too late. Mayer certainly could be cruel, vindictive, petty, lecherous, and tyrannical, but at the same time he was hopelessly sentimental, emotional, prudish, family-oriented, unlucky in love, and had conflicted relationships with his equally strong-minded daughters. As a businessman, he ruled like a father. No smut, No tawdriness. Family fare. That was his motto. He tried, often unsuccessfully, to live it himself. And much less successfully to do so for his staff. MGM employees were his children and he covered up their exploits from homosexuality (illegal at the time and even more of a career killer than it is now), to assaults, to allegedly even murder. Mayer was successful. He was a showman and a purveyor of glamour. He wanted the best and hired the best. Though he was himself deeply right wing he hired David Ogden Stewart, Dalton Trumbo, George Cukor, Katharine Hepburn, all big-time liberals. He was smart enough to let artists do what they did best as long as it was clean.Higham likes to paint Mayer in Shakespearean terms being battled over like King Lear by his daughters. Neither Edie not Irene come off particularly well here. Mayer is a strict Victorian father and the girls are stubborn and willful, and ultimately very much like him. Irene, the more intellectual and grounded of the two defects from husband David O Selznick and become a successful Broadway producer to the delight and surprise of LB who never wanted his daughters to have careers in the first place. Even he can be wrong, though he never admits it. Overall, the girls seem montrously selfish, egged on by Dad's egotism. His later permanent rift with Edie over her husband's professional and political allegiances, haunts LB's later years as he becomes increasingly bitter and consumed by his anger over being ousted from MGM and his overwhelming fear of death. LB's wife of 40 years, Margaret Shenberg Mayer, seems like a cypher here. Her sudden mental collapse is rather nebulously explained by a combination of Mayer's infidelities, her hysterectomy, and her daughters leaving home. She certainly wasn't in the same intellectual league with LB, but her departure seems very sudden. There also the rest of the Mayers including LB's sociopathic brother Rudolph, his sons-in-law (David O and Bill Goetz), grandsons (Jeff and Danny Selznick), and his beloved mother, the spectre that haunted his entire life.The biography does tend to the salacious side including charging Clark Gable with manslaughter and positing that Mayer paid $400,000 to cover up a similar act of manslaughter by John Huston. In current terms $400,000 would be around $5-6 million and it seems unlikely considering Huston was not yet an important player in the Thirties. Many MGM stars come off particularly badly such as Greta Garbo, Luise Rainer, and Joan Crawford. Much of the early part of the book is scandal after scandal in exhausting succession. On the other hand, there are a lot of surprises. LB and Ad Schulberg came out of left field for me (consider LB wanted Budd Schulberg booted out of the country for writing \\"What Makes Sammy Run?\\"). His proposition to her seems particularly funny describing him as \\"an overweight Romeo to her plain-faced Juliet\\" as he announces that they'll be \\"King Louis and Queen Adeline and rule Hollywood together\\". It's almost too funny to be true. LB's romances seem particularly pathetic. Dr. Jessie Marmorsten, when asked if she ever went to bed with him pounded her fist on the table and proclaimed: \\"Have you ever seen a picture of him?!\\" though she admitted that he did manage to steal a kiss on her foot when she wasn't paying attention. Besides Mrs. Schulberg and Dr. Marmorsten there were Ann Miller, Jean Howard, and Ginny Simms all of whom turned down both his marriage proposals (and sizeable cash incentives).Overall, LB comes across as a showman and a visionary. Like Henry Ford and Coco Chanel, he conceived of MGM as a company which produced a consistant, quality product. He simply would not let the talent get in the way. He was tough and frugal. He came from nothing and ended up at the top of the heap of the second largest industry in America, after the automobile industry. And he kept on fighting right until the end. His death seems particularly harrowing because there is a sense that he hasn't really finished. Even though he's 75, there's enough fight in him to sustain 10 men half his age. It was a love of showmanship and a profound sentimentality that sustained this essentially conservative, unsophisticated man in a tawdry, glamourous business for several decades. Mayer is Hollywood. He came there when it was dirt roads and left when it was the single greatest cultural force in American life. What Mayer and men like him created continues to have profounf importance on how we are entertained today, nearly a hundred years later"},{"Title":"Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood","review":"There's a lot that's been written about Louis B. Mayer and his reign over MGM during Hollywood's studio system heyday because a lot happened, and because it's hard to know what really happened. This was a time when public persona was everything and much was swept under the carpet of public standing. While I had to wonder, from time to time, where the author got his information, I thought this was a pretty good read. By the end, I thought, \\"Well, that was one version.\\" If you're keen to learn as much as you can about Hollywood's bygone era, I would say include this book, but don't make it your only one about Mayer, MGM, or the studio system."},{"Title":"Merchant of Dreams: Louis B.

Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I also have some questions/concerns about Higham's accuracy. I've read at least 5 other books about Thalberg, Shearer & MGM, & several things here are new to me including allegations that the Thalberg Shearer marriage was shaky (I've always read the exact opposite previously), & that Thalberg had a tendency to scream at people when he was angry (I've previously read that his persona tended to be quite mild mannered). I'd be very interested to hear other Mayer/Thalberg/Shearer biographer's opinion of this book's accuracy. I also question the allegations that Walt Disney was a Nazi sympathizer amongst others. My 2 star rating is with the assumption that the book is factually inaccurate.To me it pretty much reads as one scandal after another..... there may be SOME truth in that!"},{"Title":"Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians 1848-1849","review":"We can see through Kossuth's eyes how the Revolution progressed. If you thought you knew the backgrounds of the Hungarian revolution, read this. It is a must for anyone who wants to understand this crucial phase of Hungarian history.The book itself is nicely written, yet sometimes a bit slow, so given the fact that the word concise has nothing to do with it, you'll need some time."},{"Title":"Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians 1848-1849","review":"This is a useful account of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-1849. This is not a biographic account but rather a narrative of the revolution using its most prominent figure, Louis (Lajos) Kossuth, as the focal point of the story. Deak opens with the background of the revolution, a description of the relatively primitive state of the Hungarian state and the political tensions within the Hapsburg empire. Kossuth was a product of the lower nobility, an unusually numerous group in Hungary, and one that had considerable prominence at the local level but not in the greater politics of the empire. Liberal and nationalist ideas became increasingly common among the lower nobility, leading to agitation for a Hungarian dominated constitutional monarchy for Hungary proper with considerable expansion of civil liberties, abolition of surviving feudal features, a larger role for the Hungarian state in the Empire, and economic liberalization. The great majority of Hungarians, however, were peasants, and fear of rural unrest was a persistent concern of the nobility of Hungary. In the decades leading up to the revolution, the Hapsburgs had made some reformist concessions, but these usually consisted of extending the role of Hungarian in administration, boosting the role of the Hungarian nobility but without any substantial political concessions that would have reduced political unrest in Hungary.The outbreak of revolutionary activity all over Europe dramatically weakened the Hapsburg state, providing an opportunity for the Hungarian liberals and more radical members to use existing constitutional structures to revolutionize Hungary and the relationship with the Hapsburgs. The revolution was initially very successful, essentially guaranteeing the lesser nobility considerable political power in Hungary, abolishing many feudal features, elevating the role of Hungary in the Empire, and beginning economic liberalization. As with other revolutions, the Hungarian revolutionaries become somewhat intoxicated with success and over-reached. They attempted to dictate policies towards other parts of the empire to the Hapsburgs, were plagued by dissension, and perhaps most damaging, pursued a policy of defacto imperialism towards non-Hungarian minorities within Hungary. Historic Hungary contained parts of what are now Slovakia, Serbia, Romania, and contained substantial numbers of ethnic Germans.Many of the ethnic minorities revolted, the Hapsburgs gradually recovered their equilibrium, and the internal dissension of the revolutionaries impaired the effectiveness of the Hungarian army. Despite the significant obstacles, the Hungarian revolutionaries did manage to constitute an effective state and defeated some Hapsburg forces. Eventually, the Hapsburg forces conquered and crushed the revolution. Some of the reforms introduced by the revolution, however, persisted. After a period of reaction, the Hapsburgs and the Hungarians eventually compromised and by the end the 1860s, the Dual Monarchy structure, which embodied many of the goals of the revolution, became the basic structure of the Empire."},{"Title":"Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians 1848-1849","review":"A solid introduction for the English-speaking world to revolution of 1848-1849 in Hungary and to its charismatic leader Kossuth, written by a well-received Columbia University historian.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians 1848-1849","review":"The book is an objective overview of what led to, happened during, and followed the revolution. It is very interesting to see in print a summary of events which are not always the same as the picture Hungarian folklore paints of Kossuth, who led them to and through the revolution.This book would be a good book for young Hungarians to read, not just the legends which praise Kossuth.The first of its kind, and unfortunately one of the only of its kind."},{"Title":"Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians 1848-1849","review":"When I saw the title, I expected to be in for a treat. Louis Kossuth was a very interesting personality, and there really is scant information in English available. Istvan Deak missed a golden opportunity to do justice to this towering figure instead offering a jargon-filled, bone dry account of the revolution with little offered in the way of background information or context. This is not a book for the layman, while the specialist will find little new covered in the book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The reviews of this book resemble a reverse bell curve, with most readers really liking it or really disliking it. I'm in the middle. It was fast paced, interesting, and easy to read. It entertained, which is what I wanted from this \\"thriller.\\" The author nicely portrayed the buildup of distrust. On the other hand, I definitely had to suspend my disbelief, starting with the first secret being revealed, and continuing on throughout the book. More drawbacks include the idea that this group of men were still living together like boys. This was a stretch, and as an investigative team they seemed like a blend of amateur secret agents suffering from a giant dose of juvenile, comic book bravado. The representation of Ober was too thin to support the plot twist involving his character. But it was pretty good and about what I expected.

Meltzer's writing can sometimes read like a ninth grade (as I am one myself), but his plots are brilliant.The Tenth Justice is one of my first true loves in legal thrillers. Although I did not review it until now, I picked it up in Portugal this summer and wasted a day in Portugal reading this book four 8 hours BECAUSE I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. This book is a work of art and is equivalent to The Client and The Firm.The same, however, cannot be said for Dead Even. . ."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This is the second Meltzer novel I read in two weeks - I preferred 'The Millionaires' which has a better structure and some genuinely sympathetic characters. The problem I have with the Tenth Justice is the annoying 'hero' - Ben Addison. He is smug, self satisfied, unethical, arrogant, and is a pretty good example of why most people dislike lawyers. We are expected to sympathise with him while he gives the US Marshalls (admitted one was a 'baddie')plenty of lip yet they are merely investigating HIS dishonesty....His threatening the Marshalls with a harrasment writ was hilarious! Typical preppy big mouth thinking he rules the world - an odious little character. They would have crushed him in reality. Addison harps on about how smart and wonderful and clever he is and by the second half of the novel I found myself rooting for Rick - the villain - which is not a good sign. Aside for the unpalatable Ben and his equally conceited friends the plot is fast paced and I enjoyed the set-up and execution. I dont care if Meltzer took liberties with the realities of the Supreme Court - the story worked for me and held my attention. The one last problem I would mention is that we almost never see Justice Mason Hollis which given the setting is a bit weak. Enjoyable but damaged entertainment."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I'm only half way through. Somebody please tell me this guy can write a story using something other than dialog to tell it. And mindless, sophomoric dialog at that.

Nothing but innane chatter."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Pretty good book, many people say this young boy could be the next John Grisham, they may be right. Te story was incredible, going into the world of the Supreme Court and the clerks that work behind the scenes to make things happen. Fascinating story, just that little slip of the tongue, and Ben Addison's life changes irrevocably. The characters were real, the only real objection I have is the way they treated each other.

Just who can you trust seems to be the theme, along with dog eat dog. I found the inner workings of the Supreme Court to be interesting.

A self respecting author would have rounded up all copies of the final draft and burned them.

Descriptions of unfolding action are as bad as you can possibly imagine. Upon finishing I tossed it in the trash instead of adding it to my library.Then I found the answer to my question: the only conceivable reason a publisher touched this dreck. The author was a speechwriter for Bill Clinton. (Now we know why the speeches are overlong, boring and smell of barely disguised incompetence.) Now we know.Oh. One more thing.

Nancy Drew comparisons are apt for the first half, although the second half, which focuses on paranoia, threats, two beatings, disintegrating friendships, and a suicide, is really not the sort of thing that would have happened to Nancy. Occasional lines are rather puerile: &quot;Dang, I thought it was a big ol' game of Parcheezi,&quot; said Ben. This novel is worth a look if you can get it second-hand or mass-market paperback, if for only the novelty of dorm life combined with blackmail. I really question whether the author has a future writing this kind of thing in an ongoing way, though, and I imagine the publishers lost money on the book given its unbelievably expensive in-your-face promotional push. I'm definitely not springing for another hardback from Meltzer any time soon."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Personally, I found the characters very weak, and whiny. The concept of 4 childhood friends living together in their mid 20's is hard enough to believe, but the childish way they treated and responded to one another was too much to swallow.

Furthermore, and I don't know if this is good or bad, my boyfriend liked it. He has very specific reading taste: has to hook you quickly and can't be bogged down in a lot of detail.

But at this point, I have to confess that I'm gratified that I didn't lay down any money for this tome. It seems like Meltzer was striving a bit too hard to strike a &quot;too hip for the room&quot; Gen-X wiseass pose.I would strongly recommend that Meltzer (if he has not already done so) read Don Winslow's _The Death and Life of Bobby Z_. The dialogue practically dances off the page. The one-liners are bristling with bad attitude, but they feel fluid and relaxed. Meltzer's prose, on the other hand, smacks of &quot;first-time author trying a bit too hard to be clever&quot; syndrome.Believe me, as a life-long voracious reader and devotee of the legal thriller, I welcome every shining new talent that the literary agents can get their hands on. Here's hoping that Meltzer can make a much better impression the second time around.Denise Pryor"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Many fanatics of legal thrillers, when they think of the genre per se, often consider plots involving everything from big-time lawyers defending scumbag clients to government officials falling into deadly conspiracies. Nevertheless, plots including those are not the case for Brad Meltzer's The Tenth Justice.In Meltzer's fire-crackling debut, enter Ben Addison, a young Yale Law grad working for one of the Supreme Court's most highly respected justices. The story begins with him starting his internship at the Court. Seeing his bright future ahead of him, little then does Ben know that it's about to get in for the worse.Trouble begins when he reveals the outcome of an upcoming Court decision to Rick Fagen, a claimed-to-be former Court clerk who Ben later discovers to be really nothing but a dirty, rotten con artist. With the decision in the palm of his hands, as well as Ben's brightly golden future held hostage, Rick makes millions by simply making a large investment on it. Therefore, Ben is left sweating big time, fearing that Rick will strike again.Refusing to take any chances, fearing that he'll lose his job, Ben asks for the help of his co-clerk, Lisa, and his housemates: Nathan, who works for the State Department; Ober, who's an assistant to a leading U.S. senator; and Eric, who works as a reporter for a Washington daily newspaper. Together, they offer Ben coveted insiders' access in attempt to stop Rick dead in his tracks. But no matter how hard they try, they nevertheless realize that Rick is always one step ahead of them. The question is how.Before Ben's housemates and Lisa could even catch Rick in one scene, he bribes Ben by offering him $3 million in exchange for info on yet another Court decision.And by how Rick's watching his every move, Ben knows for a fact that someone is working for him as his assistant. Outraged, Ben stops at nothing in finding out who's working for Rick and why. In fact, he suspects that person to be either Lisa or one of his housemates. With accusations of who's Rick's assistant flying left and right, Ben, Lisa, and his housemates are in a battle of fierce deceptions that could ultimately destroy their friendships among each other. And their lives, including their careers are at stake.By the time the reader finishes The Tenth Justice, he or she will be asking them-selves a few questions: Where does loyalty end? Where does greed begin? And how much can you really trust your friends?The Tenth Justice is a spectacular story with suspenseful twists and turns that really keeps the reader guessing from scene to scene.As for his writing style, Meltzer cleverly writes this book as a fast read, with so many events occurring in just a short number of pages. He indeed, unlike Grisham, avoids the usual clich&eacute;d plots that many other legal authors write, everything from the ordinary courtroom dramas to those typical White House scandals.The book, nevertheless, has one major flaw. When the story approaches the end, plans as to how Rick was going to be caught, including the person working as Rick's as-sistant had been thrown out in the blue, therefore complicating the ending and leaving it with one hole after another.The Tenth Justice is highly recommendable as Brad Meltzer at his very best.

You'll love this book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"What happens when a Supreme Court law clerk, Ben Addision, unwittingly shares one of the courts' opinions with a supposed peer before that opinion is published? And what happens when Ben finds out that his &quot;peer&quot; was not what he seemed? Further, what happens when the opinion shared could have astronomical financial implication?Those who stand to benefit will do anything, including balckmail and murder, to ensure nondisclosure and their financial future.THE TENTH JUSTICE gives spine-tingling thrills as Ben, along with his friends and cohorts, walks an uneven line between ethics and a desire to survive.The writing style of this author reminds the reader of John Grisham. It has an outstanding beginning and middle, but the ending could have be stronger. Nonetheless, it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I picked this book off my bookshelf after not finding the latest Clancy novel. After only a few pages, I was hooked and couldn't put it down.The dialogue was especially funny to me, a 29-year-old male. I loved Ober's crazy ideas (especially his Mexican restaurant name, Tequila Mockingbird) along with Ben and Lisa's mock bickering.Meltzer keeps you guessing and, at one point, my list of suspects was up to about six or seven. He played the whole story out extremely well. Even when you find out who Rick's inside source is, you didn't know the truth.I've read some of the other reviews and will say that everyone's entitled to their opinion. But, personally, I don't think it deserves all of the pans that it's getting. Meltzer's first attempt into the legal thriller genre exceeded my expectations and will get me to read his other novels.If you like crisp, funny dialogue between young 20-somethings, I strongly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was in a book finding rut for a while. I couldn't find a book that captured me like this one did in a long time. Excellent read. I liked the characters alot."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I enjoyed this fast moving thriller. The protagonist was a sympathetic character. The plot was almost plausible. I look forward to future novels by this author."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I thought this was another great book by mr. meltzer.The story takes place in washington d.c. with a group of 4 room mates who have just about been life long friends or at least since early in elementary school with the focus on ben addison a top notch graduate from yale law school who has gotten one of the most prestiges jobs of being a co-clerk for a supreme court justice.Everything seems to be going fine for ben and lisa marie,ben's co-clerk and possible love interest with the sexual tension that seems to start right away between them until ben receives a phone call from supposed former clerk of justice hollis who helps both co-clerks deal with new job problems and seems to develop a friendship until what seems like a innocent conversation and slip by ben of a supreme court decision leads to a successful financial gamble.This leads many to think that there is a leak in the supreme court.So the story goes and takes off this had many twist to it and just when you thought you had it figured out it changes follow along as ben lisa and his roommates try to get this guy and ultimately test the friendships.This another book that i think would make a good moive"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was so (happily) surprised when I read this book! I'd never read Meltzer before, and he only had 2 books out, I read them both! I waited and waited for more...finally there is. I think he is catching on. The books are great."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"My opinion of this book changed dramatically as it went on. In the early chapters, I really enjoyed the character development; the bantering conversation was on the mark and quite funny.An example: (while setting up a &quot;sting&quot;, the young main characters are trying to come up with an emergency phrase to allow Ben - who is wearing a wire while the others monitor - to signal he needs help) from page 167 paperback:----------------&quot;How about 'travesty of justice'?&quot; Nathan asked.&quot;What about 'electric cheese'?&quot; Ober said.&quot;How the hell can I work that in?&quot; Ben asked. &quot;Please don't kill me, and can I please have some electric cheese?&quot;&quot;'Crimes against humanity,'&quot; Nathan said.&quot;'Devil dogs,'&quot; Ober said.&quot;How about if I just scream, 'Help me unimaginative roommates! Help me!'&quot; Ben said.----------------Four childhood friends and one trusted co-worker watch their lives turn 180 degrees when Ben makes one seemingly innocent mistake. What bothered me as the story continued was how quickly their supposedly strong relationships dissolved. Although the characters are all young and naive, they have a lifelong bond that certainly had to have been stretched prior to this incident. While the chaos they come to endure is life-threatening, some more understanding might have been warranted.I enjoyed the insight into the US Supreme Court system. Mr. Meltzer has an insider's track on our judicial system, but keeps it in layman's terms. Considering this was his first novel, I think he has a great future as an author. Although I'm only giving 3 stars, I would read his next book!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I bought this in an airport to read on the plane -- please don't compare it to Grisham. The dialogue is worse than running your fingernails down a blackboard. The plot is silly as well as unbelievable. The characters seem written to make you dislike them intensely. The cover illustration is nice though, and there were occassional passages where the reading was not painful."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I thought &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; was a SUPERB book. If I can read a book for 4 straight ours on a Saturday Night then its worthy of praise. This book is great because Ben didn't know who to trust."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Brad Meltzer has written a solid, suspenseful, page turner that was well worth my time. While I had some problems with the plot development he did a great job of keeping me guessing. There were several excellent twists and the ending did not disappoint. Ben's sexual relationship with Lisa was predictable and their banter was at times corny and embarrassing. The relationship should have been kept strictly professional because the sex angle did nothing to enhance the plot. I knew the second they met that they would become more than just friends. I loved the relationships between the roommates. Meltzer had be guessing who was betraying Ben right up until the end.Overall and excellent first book! I look forward to reading more of Meltzer's work in the future."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Because of the title, I was expecting the 10th Justice to be Ben or another clerk who wrongly steered the Court for personal gain. The title was sooooo of the mark. This book is so far from a &quot;legal thriller&quot; that it's mind blowing. But it is a pretty good thriller...if you can endure the book until the end.I spend the first 3/4 of the book wondering why on earth Ben was chasing this guy. Why couldn't he just let it go?! I was screaming at him to just leave it alone!! How would anyone ever figure it out anyway? As far as &quot;the four friends&quot;, none of them were loyal to anyone else, except Ober. They were all pretty selfish and self serving. And I must admit, the characters were too far undeveloped. And where was this Justice all the time? And when exactly did Lisa and Ben work?The last couple chapters of the book do make it all worth it in the end, though. I couldn't wait to figure out how all the pieces fit together...but a lot of it was still mirky."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I love legal thriller novels and thought this book was one of the best I've read lately. I read the whole book in just a few days during my busy life. It reads easily and you are so engrossed in the story that you just can't put it down. I am now ordering Brad Meltzer's second novel. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice was the first law based crime book that I read which was not written by John Grisham. I was not expecting much and I got so much more. Once I had picked the book up I could not put it down. I absolutely LOVED it!!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"When I first started reading The Tenth Justice, I thought it was going to be good, especially from what I read of the summary of the novel, but I did not expect it to be so addicting. I'd read some of Meltzer's other work, and I thought no other of his books were going to be better than the Inner Circle, but The Tenth Justice was just as excellent, if not better than the Inner Circle. I recommend this novel to anyone who loves thrillers, the government, and conspiracies!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I just started reading Brad Meltzer's books a month ago and now I am on my fifth book of his. After I finish each book I tell myself that the next one won't be as good and to my surprise they keep getting better and better! I love the Washington D.C. life that each book depicts. This one is my favorite Meltzer book to date! It is set in the Supreme Court. The Inner Circle is set at the National Archives; First Council is at the White House; The Zero Game is on Capitol Hill and now this book. The suspense, twists and turns are spectacular and it kept me guessing right up until the end. I love the interaction between the characters as well. I don't think you will be disappointed reading this one!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"One of the best books I've read in a long, long time. From the first page to the last, the constant suspense kept the pages turning. I was insatiable. I rushed out and bought everything I could find by Brad Meltzer."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I've tried to read this book three times, and I've only managed to get to page 110 before falling asleep. I've even tried skipping the paragraphs not essential to the plot. No dice. There should be a yellow warning label on the spine, &quot;MAY INDUCE COMA.&quot; The plot lends itself to great suspense, but the author just couldn't set the hook, even after the first quarter of the story. Face it, Brad. John Grisham and Nelson DeMille, you're not. But thank you for playing"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"What an incredible waste of time. This could havebeen a good story but sigh, the story lacked a writer."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Rarely have I read a book that contained dialogue this trite or characters this shallow. While I credit the author for devising an ingenious storyline, I simply could not get past the tedious dialogue or, as one of my predecessors noted, a sheer overabundance of meaningless &quot;he said&quot;s and &quot;she asked&quot;s. While I can blame the author's editor for the latter error, the first lies squarely with the author. These characters, particularly the protagonist's friends, spend their lives speaking a dialect that is too clever by half, and, after the first sixty pages, simply becomes annoying. Ultimately--weak ending aside--the prepossessing, two-dimensional characters who litter this book make this first effort a disappointment. (Note to the publisher: the description of our hero's &quot;accidental&quot; slip which causes his problems is a bit misleading, since a casual reading of that entire scene speaks loudly to the contrary."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"One might forgive the puerile, wholly implausible plot, if the book gave an accurate description of the life of a Supreme Court law clerk. Nothing of the sort. The number of inaccuracies and implausibilities is staggering. This guy has no clue what it's like to clerk for the big court, or about Washington life in general. For example, he thinks the State Department investigates death threats on Senators. This is a painful read for anyone with half a brain."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I'm starting to get the impression that Mr Meltzer's books (I've read two so far) are full of unmarried, 20-something males who haven't matured, as evidenced by their sophomoric, and annoying banter. Even so, this book is far better than &quot;The Millionaires&quot; in that it has an engaging, and imaginative plot. Our hero, a young court clerk, is trapped after inadvertantly disclosing a Supreme Court verdict to an insider who stood to get financial gain. Afterwards, he is subject to blackmail, and sinks lower and lower, looking desparately for a way out of his quagmire. He thinks he can outsmart the bad guy, only to find out it gets worse the more he tries. About 2/3rds of the way through the book, I was dissappointed to discover which one of his circle of friends betrayed him (thought it would be held out to the end), but this was only the beginning of a series of stunning plot twists. Read past the juvenile dialog, and enjoy this thriller."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"As it was the only book I took with me on vacation, I had no choice but to keep reading long after I normally would have tossed this aside. Horrible character development, bad plot turns, dull ending. Was this book for real? Who published this? Who edited this? I want my money back."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Reading this book I felt like it was &quot;Friends meets the Supreme Court&quot;. I lacked any pity for the hero. I felt like he should hve been fired!! The hero had no sense of ethics. That is a bad quality in a Supreme Court clerk. Fire him!! For the first 3/4's of the book I did not see one smart decision by any of the characters.The writing style was not bad. Author needs to work on plot line and concentrate more on editing. If he keeps at it, he might make a good author some day."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I just finished this book and felt it could have been better. The premise was interesting - what happens when you say the wrong thing to the wrong person - but the dialogue, the plot development, and the ending were dissappointing. Grisham is much better at this type of book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"EXCELLENT BOOK. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. SURPRISE ENDING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I believe that beneath Meltzer's puerile debut as a slapstick comedy/thriller author, there is real potential. The plot and characters are sophomoric, although there are some clever one-liners. I frequently felt that I was watching a play where one actor, using the same dialogue, played all the roles. Even the nemesis, Rick, enacts a very similar being as do our heroes. Eliminate a few sexual overtones and the profanity, and this book could be a Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys mystery. However, with several sessions of good writing tutelage and gained expertise, Meltzer might just make it.The book's ending almost justifies the means. The author does know how to attain an acceptable resolution to the story."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was intrigued by the premise of this book, but the flaws just cannot be masked.While writing a \\"regular guy and his buddies fight the insidious and powerful villains\\" book, Meltzer fails to let the reader connect with the main characters. Not for lack of effort though, as there is more than a little melodrama and an unecessary pull on the reader's heart-strings in an effort to make all the machinations seem somehow meaningful.Ultimately, the problem for this book is the main character's buddies themselves, who each have a particular talent, and oddly, each of them has a moment to come through with a deus ex machina resolution to a problem. This stretches the credulity of the tale beyond the point of pleasure.After reading this, I took the plunge on another Meltzer book, The Zero Game, which I found a great read. The Tenth Justice is definitely not recommended."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"About the only thing plausible in this book is the sense of place. The setting is Washington, DC, where I live, and most of the locations in the book are places the author has obviously been to or researched. The dialogue, however, is implausible, as is the behavior of the characters. These characters are supposed to be smart people, but they all talk, think, and act like kids. Though funny at times, the incessant junior-high-like insults and banter was mostly annoying. And it is just impossible to believe that people would make the decisions that the characters in this book make. For a better thriller involving lawyers, spying, and a young rookie getting caught up in a conspiracy, try Grisham's The Firm. If you want a realistic legal thriller, try something by Fairstein."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The character development is amazing! in a simple paperback bestsller kind of book like this? well in my opinion, it's true. the plot is also very good but the characters and how real they were to me is what made me realize how good of an author brad meltzer was. i read this book so fast because i couldnt wait to find out what happened but i was so sad when it was over and had to wait for his next book to come out. read it!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am someone who rarely reads fiction because if I'm not intrigued in the first few pages, then I'll never finish the book. I finished The Tenth justice within a week. People who overanalyze everything are missing out on the fun in life. This book is exciting, entertaining and fun. If the rest of these critics would just appreciate that without worrying about tone and character development, they'd enjoy reading a lot more. This is not junior hight composition class -- it's supposed to be fun -- and this book really is!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The dialogue was trite, the characters were shallow and one dimensional. The premise of the book seemed interesting but a writer of Meltzer's inexperience couldn't carry it off. Reading used to be the last refuge for those of us who are not interested in Melrose Place, 90210, or Party of Five. Save your money. If you really want to check this book out . . . check is out at the library and save the $7.00. Or better yet, I'll mail you my copy. It certainly won't be joining the shelves of my library."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Finished the Tenth Justice and must say that I'm amazed this was ever published. Sophmoric dialogue, plot, storyline, and tone added up to a book that never even comes close to working. Save your money and your time and read something, anything, else. This is a real poor piece of writing and time. Hype, hype, and more hype.."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was tempted to give this book 5 stars for its utter awfulness. About midway through the book, I realized the only reason I wanted to finish was in the slim chance that every single character should die a horrible death. It takes a pure type of talent to write a book this bad -- this is the &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; of awfulness."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am so glad I waited for the paperback version of this book. The dialogue was juvenile and I hardly cared for any of the characters. The only redeeming quality of the book is the plot. I don't think anyone had a better premise than Meltzer, but it's apparent in this book that he needs more writing experience (especially the dialogue) or maybe it's too much TV (Melrose Place watcher, I'd bet). I will give Mr. Meltzer one more read when his next book comes out..."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The way I see it, the author is probably a roommate of someone with decision making power at the publishing house. If my high school son wrote this, I might be impressed that he could put together the plotline. But, I'd tell him his dialog was too juvenile, he sounded like a ten year old. I did like the concept of the story, but I spent most of the read irritated thinking another author or even I could have done a better job."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer's writing is immature and the story is badly constructed. If this is how the Gen-X generation speak and behave, I fear for the future. Too bad, because I was intrigued by the Supreme Court plot line. I should have waited for the movie."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"While Meltzer's writting clearly improved with &quot;The Millionaires,&quot; the storytelling here is at its best."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I haven't read a \\"John Grisham\\" type novel in years. They bore me to tears, and become incredibly repetative. This book, sort of \\"The Firm-ish\\", got me intrigued. I couldn't put it down simply because I needed to find out how the villian was getting his information. I loved the character of Lisa, and found myself laughing out loud at times.On the downer side, I hated what they did with Ober, the way all the friends ended up, and that Ben lost his job. The LEAST they could have done was have the Justice support him (the one he was clerking for).Oh well...it's a good read! Even if you don't like it, it's short so you can read it pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Each year I awaited the arrival of my favorite author, Grisham's, newest book. No other author entertained me more...until now. Okay, all the old standards you read in reviews needs to be here; \`a page turner', \`I couldn't put it down', etc.I enjoyed the characters, the plot, the dialogues, and everything in between. Often in good writing there will be a part where you just can't put the book down. No phone call, conversation, or fire can pull you away from the book. With The Tenth Justice I found myself struggling to find a place where I felt good about putting the book aside and getting on with my life! It was really very good. I finished it last night and went to the library, sorry Amazon, and picked up his second book, Dead Even first thing today!On the negative side...at the end I found the wrap-up a little too secretive. I won't give anything away but the ending just seemed too much out of nowhere. Sure it could have happened that way but, I don't know, maybe a few more hints through-out the book where you could look back and say, \`Oh, now I know why so and so did x' would have made it a little better. However, that being said, I still highly recommend the book. The ending does in no way come off as bad, just that I felt it could be a little better.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer's fairly improbable but highly entertaining novel about the blackmail of a Supreme Court clerk leaves one with the feeling of having just watched a surprisingly satisfying movie. The light dialogue is quick, as is the action, among characters who are developed just enough to be interesting. The unsuspecting reader is engaged to the very end with an ample share of plot twists. All in all, this reader will not be surprised in the least to learn of a film script in development. (In fact, this reader may have some casting suggestions...) I found this book to be an excellent diversion."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The temptation by many of my fellow readers is to compare every book in this genre to Grisham. Why? Meltzer has his own style. Why should he be another Grisham. I found this book interesting. It reads like a movie plot and I think it would make a fine motion picture. This is Meltzer's first book. I think he has a promising future."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"If you completely suspend your disbelief before you read &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; you'll have a most enjoyable read. Many of the situations are preposterous and are impossible to see happening. But those are merely elements in fiction...and this is truly fiction.I understand the review that called this a great beach read. What a perfect description. The pages fly by as the protagonist and his associates get into one impossible situation after another. Trust starts to dissolve among the tight ban of friends as they try to trap the villain. This internal drama is just as dicey as the good versus bad battle, as the friends suspect there is a traitor amongst them.Some interesting characters in the D.C. setting. This is nothing short of a fun read. If you go in treating this a &quot;lite read&quot; you'll have big fun, and it will not take much time.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I love Metzler's writing and have studied both his books, but The Tenth Justice one in particular, to learn dialog; I think he is a master at writing dialog. The characters are well-defined and the story is a page turner. I enjoyed his second book, Dead Even as well and was actually doing a search this evening looking to see when his next book would be released."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer frustrates me as an author. This is the 3rd book I've read and each one is plagued by the same problem: the most inane dialogue imaginable. Maybe I'm not hip or urban, definetly not cool, but no one I know talks with exclamation points at the end of every sentence! No one has a dialogue structure that follows the same rigid guideline everytime-- banal joking, someone getting upset, someone bringing out the exclamation points, and someone storming off! Every book of his I read has the most unnatural dialogue! Perhaps this is his curse!Another problem that plagues his stories is that he can't create a sympathetic character. It's a marvel that anyone helps out our hero in this story, much less risks their lives, because by about page 30 he'll grind on your nerves and you'll hope someone puts duct tape over his mouth.Why is this frustrating? If he just a bad author with no redeemable qualities, I wouldn't be frustrated. But, I genuinely think he has potential. Underneath all the convulted dialogue-- which I swear reads a little worse than any Saved By the Bell episode--, the predictable(or inexcusable) plot twists-- lye stories that in the hands of a more skilled author might actually be quite entertaining. There's no high art here, but the story itself-- the premise of the novel-- is fairly decent.****MINOR SPOILERS*****Unlike other readers, I wasn't trapped on an island with no other book to read, or given it as a gift that created a sense of guilt. I hung on because I wanted to see who was betraying our hero. Sadly, it's never exactly clear. He hints and fusses at it, but to actually name someone would be too much to ask. In the end I guess it's everyone and no one.****END SPOILERS*****With a great dialogue coach and an editor with a ton of time on their hands, Meltzer could easily rise to 3 star territory. I think his stories are solid enough, unfortunately his writing isn't."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"To all who have read, and to all perspective readers of \\"The Tenth Justice\\", I encourage you to lighten up. \\"The Tenth Justice\\" speeds along at a great pace, with fine plot bends and plenty of guessing. But the real beauty of this novel shines through in it's ability to mock the way we choose to live. Comical, suspenseful, not so far-fatched--I loved it! If you read the book and see the humor, (the human comedy), please write about it. MORE PEOPLE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I have read a few of Meltzer's masterpieces and I have to say Meltzer is fast becoming one of my favourite authors. In the Tenth Justice Ben Addison has just been appointed a US Supreme Court clerk, a path that will take him to the top of his chosen career. He is more than happy with his co-clerk Lisa but his first challenge, a death penalty case while his appointed judge is away, quickly shatters his happiness. If he doesn't get this right his dreams may come to a sudden halt. Luckily for him a former clerk Rick, who knows what a hard man the judge is to work for rings up to see if he can offer any advice to the new appointees. Ben happily meets up with Rick, getting advice for all sorts of things, becomes friends and innocently divulges a crucial decision. Suddenly Rick disappears, the court marshals know there was leak and Ben's flat mate Eric a budding journalist publishes the fact there was a leak but leaves Ben's name out of it. Much to Ben's flatmates Nathan and Ober's disgust Ben demands his life long friend Eric out of the flat. Ben now not only has to deal with a flat and lifelong friendships in turmoil but Marshalls who know he is guilty and are just looking for that small bit of proof. Ben must find and expose Rick to get out of these situations but Rick is a villain who has planned this well in advance and he has his own plans for Ben.This is easily as great as Meltzer's other masterpieces The Zero Game and First Council. His books The Millionaires and Dead Even although not masterpieces are also great and satisfying reads. Read them all!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Encore! Encore!

My buddy in London sent me &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; and I owe him big time. Incredible dialouge framed around a group of 20-somethings that are smart, innovative and hilarious. I felt like I was reading a transcription of my friends and I sitting around busting on each other. The plot was gripping and the cliff hangers were unexpected yet believable (something you don't often find in a legal thriller).

I actually liked Meltzer's book better than most of the Grisham I've read, with the exception of &quot;The Partner.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Tenth Justice,&quot; from start to finish. I haven't been able to say that about a book in a long time. I read it in one sitting, which is a good indicator of how fast-faced and engrossing it is. Some have criticized its lack of technical realism, but technical realism is not really why I picked the book up in the first place. I read thrillers for entertainment, and this one delivers. I loved the pop culture references, the witty banter between the friends, and the twisting plot. Ben was a great combination of likable and egocentric. His friends were interesting characters, as was his co-clerk, Lisa. I thought Meltzer did an excellent job with dialogue, because it sounded like I was actually eavesdropping on a group of twenty-something young professionals sitting around chatting. I also liked the premise. Although I'm sure the story will become a movie, I didn't feel like it was written exactly like every other action flick coming soon to a multiplex near you. My husband loved it because of Meltzer's obscure pop culture/comic/graphic novel references.

And with most of the work he's done, I see an average rating of 3 stars. But I like the guy, I'm just going to say that. And being a bestseller, others like him as well. Does this make him the greatest author of all time? Nah, but it does mean he's turned some heads. I've read a couple of his works and enjoyed both. So when I saw his debut was in paperback, I had to give it a shot. And while there was a healthy dose of liberalism here, he made up for it. At least to a point.This is one of those where it starts with 4 friends, all living in the same apartment. But for Ben Addison, he's been given his golden opportunity, to be a clerk for the Supreme Court. And with a sexy co-clerk, things could never darken a day, could they? Well, if you run your mouth to the wrong person, you could be screwed...just ask Ben Addison! And he turns to his friends for help. And when the odds are stacked against you, you better watch your back, even your friends might turn in a heartbeat. But Ben trusts Lisa, and maybe if she's in on this and on his side, who knows what the outcome will be.Backstabbers are all a part of life. We all deal with them. Sometimes betrayal can come from the people you thought you could trust the most. In the end, maybe one person is worth it, and he gets to go the bed with the right female. So you can take the side of the critics who claim this is suited for YA fiction. Or you can read it for yourself and find out why it stood out to be a bestseller. And in saying that, Brad Meltzer made sure that he dealt the right blow at the right time. Because while it may not be perfect, it points a poisoned arrow at the heart of integrity. In the end, nobody is a big winner, some people walk away, some people end it rather early. And if you look for a diamond in the rough, you'll keep digging.Just remember this, it starts with four friends...does that really mean much in today's world? YOU figure that one out."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice is an interesting little morality play set at the Supreme Court. What do you do if you accidentally leak information about a supreme court case and someone uses that inside information to make a fortune? What do you do if they come back and threaten to expose your slip-up unless you provide more information?In my opinion. Meltzer's character does the wrong thing but that is what makes the story so interesting.Meltzer's dialogue works so well with Thomas Gibson's performance that it sounds as if they were in the room copying down the natural flow of the characters' conversations as they were spoken. Truly, they were very fun to listen to."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I've read all of Brad Meltzer's books and this was my favorite. I would stick him in with Baldacci and Grisham as far as style, but his niche is DC politics. I raced through this book and looked forward to every sitting. This is set in the Supreme Court with two interns who find themselves manipulated into getting a ruling that favors... the bad guys. An outstanding read. I look forward to BM's next effort."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book grabs you from the very first page...I loved all of the characters...the storyline was very original and gave good insight into behind the scenes in the Supreme Court...Brad should definitely give up his day job and keep on cranking them out...this one will definitely get Grisham back on his toes....what an amazing 1st book....I can't wait for the next one...hope he keeps these characters as they were fully developed and would like to see them again in another bestseller!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"How many times does ben say &quot;My career will be ruined&quot; in the first 50 pages? I quit counting. The premise of this book is very interesting and provides some good (and I assume realistic) insight into the life of a clerk for the Supremes but the book is overly long, the writing juvenile, and the characters ridiculously unlikeable (and stupid). I wish a better author would have taken on the premise"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Not since &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; have I been faced with so many characters of unredeeming value. The dialogue is simply juvenile and the plot is so ridiculous that I found myself laughing in places where I'm sure the author was trying to create suspense.Mr. Meltzer should read a few Elmore Leonard books to see how a top-notch writer forms dialogue between his characters. Beware of any book that People magazine recommends!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The story of Ben and his friends and their efforts to escape Rick is engaging and fast moving. The book made me wish I was younger and could go to work in Washington in one of the exciting jobs that Rick and his friends hold. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next. Very much an easy reader, in part because there are no paragraphs that are longer than five or six lines. I could have done without the descriptions of the clothing the characters wore (eg &quot;he slipped into his chocolate brown Henley&quot;). Also, it strains credibility to think that anyone, even a 24-year old newly-minted law grad, wouldn't have more common sense (as well as a sense of legal ethics) as to tell a stranger about pending Supreme Court decisions and to then tell everyone he knows about his misstep"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was very dissapointed as I read the book. The plot is very convoluted since it hinges on a mistake made by Ben Addison - the clerk, who gives out a Supreme Court decision by mistake. Instead of admitting his error, we are taken on a wild goose chase with Ben trying to cover up his actions"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book was greatly puzzling. The plot is dynamite. A supreme court clerk is being blackmailed into leaking decisions before they are announced. The blackmailer is beyond clever and the plot serious and suspenseful. The main characters, Ben, his roommates and Lisa spend the greater part of the book using snappy dialogue, a very bouncy bunch, totally inappropriate This does NOT fit the serious plot. At the end of the book, some of the characters get very whiney. Personally, I think the Nancy Drew mysteries of my childhood were more mature than The Tenth Justice. I felt like the characters and dialogue belonged to one book and the plot to another. Fortunately, Mr. Meltzer is young, talented and this was his first book. I look forward to better writing in future books"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"By page 30 I knew things weren't going to get any better. I wonder how it earned a review at all by Washington Post Book World. It's a real Junior High School BOOK OF THE MONTH. Guess I'll have to go back to the shelves."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I read Meltzer's First Counsel last year. It was good. The same cannot be said for The Tenth Justice. I found it disappointing and finished it only because I paid $$$ for it from a bargain bin.The story was predictable and unrealistic.I clerked for an appellate court judge. The first day you're on the job you are indoctrinated with the rule that everything is secret - - - what you see, what you hear, what you know. This rule looms over your throughout your clerkship. Therefore, from my perspective, Meltzer took an unrealistic route in setting up the plot. No real clerk would have ever done what the clerk in The Tenth Justice did. Also, after the breach in confidentiality took place, why did the clerk's friends become so involved in helping him? The clerk clearly was in the wrong and should have turned himself in immediately. I just didn't buy it.Regarding the ending, it was just too simple and neat. How the main character ended up in the position he did stretches the bounds of incredulity.Finally, I want to know: (1) how, in the midst of all the intrigue and plotting that went on, did the clerks have any time or focus to put into their jobs; and (2) where was the justice the clerks worked for - - - most appellate judges I know work day and night - - - this one apparently never was in the office and had little or no contact with his clerks."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Supreme Court clerk is blackmailed. Potentially good story about 20-somethings starting out in DC.Negatives: (1) The hero is a whiny, self-centered dope. (2) The dialogue is painfully amateurish at times. Lost count of the dozens of times, &quot;This is my life we're talking about,&quot; or &quot;Let's just drop it, OK?&quot; appeared. (3) If this is the cream of America's intellectual crop...yikes!Positives: (1) Ober and Lisa characters were well drawn and fun. (2) Author has promise; only 26 when he wrote it."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I found The Tenth Justice to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time. The story seemed to drag on forever at a slow, plodding pace. The lead character is supposed to be brilliant - a clerk on the supreme court - but he's too stupid to figure out that his home might be bugged? Give me a break. At the end, there are lots of questions left unanswered, which just left me frustrated but glad the book was finally over. I would NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Since starting law school, and continuing into being a clerk for a state supreme court, novels have become the occupation of the last ten minutes of my night, after I've become exhausted enough to stop what I was doing and drag my corpus to bed and before my eyelids slam down mid-sentence. The Tenth Justice, however, caused me to neglect friends and loved ones during my scarce 'free' time until it was finished, within two days. This book certainly scores as a page-turner.The Tenth Justice's other claim to worthiness is its premise. First, it exposes the tremendous degree of influence judicial clerks, most fresh from law school, have over the written, precedential product of the high courts. Second, the book examines how easily someone could lulled into a false sense of security by feeling 'behind the scenes' and out of the public eye. That the primary work of opinion writing is done by clerks, with experienced judges acting mainly as watchful editors and mentors, is true of some chambers. The naive sense of invisibility and harmlessness one sometimes feels as a clerk is also not far off. That the protagonist clerks write U.S. Supreme Court opinions that sail by their Justice with hardly a changed word and that a clerk might give away the outcome of a major case at a first meeting are both sheer hyperbole. They are not so far out of the question, however, as to be beyond suspending my disbelief.On the other hand, the quality of the writing probably says more about why Meltzer is writing page-turners, not being a clerk or a practicing lawyer himself. The clerks, alone in their office, frequently launch into tedious diatribes about the most basic elements of legal process; they constantly play the &quot;designated idiot&quot; where one character asks a stupid question solely so that the other can explain something to the reader. This is truly implausible coming from characters we presume to be the smartest that American legal academia can produce. The dialogue between friends is sophomoric, and the non-lawyer supporting cast collectively have an absurd, almost Bond-ian gadget portfolio. In addition, the book delivers no insight into the Supreme Court; not once does is the reader privy to a conversation with a Justice and the clerks apparently see their boss little more. I cannot imagine this book was the product of much research into the actual workings of the Court. Beyond the clever initial premise, I found the The Tenth Justice to be a mediocre but voraciously digested and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I admit it. I only finished this stupid novel because it was a gift from someone who knows I love police procedurals and legal thrillers. It seemed disrespectful to the giver and to the author for me to walk to the trash can and fling this book into the rotting leftovers of last night's enchiladas and rice when I was only on the 100th page. I also kept thinking, \\"This is a long book. It absolutely has got to get better!\\" Boy was I dumb. It didn't.This is a most definitely NOT a \\"legal thriller.\\" You will find no plaintiffs or defendents, no prosecuting or defense attorneys, no testimony or cross examinations, witnesses, juries or even any courtroom scenes. And you will definitely find absolutely NO thrills. It's not about the law. It's about five 20-somethings behaving badly. Its premise suggests that Ben, the supposedly brilliant protaganist (a Supreme Court clerk. Legal ... get it?) believes that he can fix an extremely stupid ethical lapse with still more ethical lapses. And his friends all go along with it. If they can just manage all this unethical behavior properly, they'll get away with it which will, of course, make it all OK!The characters are drawn with almost no depth and then they get shallower. I defy anyone to care one whit about whiny, self-centered Ben by page 200. I just wanted to slap him silly, fire his sorry butt, throw the book in with the enchiladas and go watch a rerun of \\"Law And Order.\\"The editing stopped completely on about the 200th page. The thing just goes on and on and on while these five childish, self-absorbed and morally challenged \\"adults\\" have endless repetitive conversations in which they are being oh-so-witty, or they are screaming at one another. You can always tell when they are upset too, because the author gives us LOTS OF CAPITALIZATION TO SHOW THEY ARE ANGRY OR UPSET. Email-speak, no doubt.There are moments when the writing rises above repetitive and uninspired, but not many. Just about the time I thought the story couldn't get any dumber, the author threw in some stupid \\"plot twist\\" which, I am sure, was intended to make this a page-turner. All the plot twists did, however, is show complete disrespect for the readers. Consider yourself warned: Really Bad Book"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"My fascination with legal novels over the years led meto trying Brad Meltzer's &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot;.This is the stuff of &quot;Best Sellers&quot;? After sloggingthrough several chapters of the prattle ofself-aggrandizing juveniles who are supposedly thebrilliant clerks of Supreme Court justices and otherbrainy yuppie-types I said to myself &quot;Surely thisgets better.&quot; Wrong. How many times can we read&quot;Don't you trust me?&quot; ...or &quot;That was stupid of me.&quot;?I can only hope that this effort was written asMeltzer's spoof of the legal novel genre that hasgained such great popularity. If so, he has done sowith success."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"&quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; is a very good first book. The pros: Meltzer weaves an interesting and reasonably believable plot from an inspired premise. His characterisation and dialogue are very good, and he has a fantastic sense of humour. Some of the exchanges and one-liners will make you laugh out loud. Most importantly -- he knows what he's writing about, and this comes through clearly.The cons: There are a few major twists and turns that stretch credulity (unfortunately, they can't be mentioned without spoiling the book). In parts, the editing has been scrappy: some of the dialogue gets repetitious and bits could have been cut. If you are a legal insider, you'd know that the first rule of being a Justice's clerk makes parts of the book's premise a little unlikely -- but Meltzer knows enough real-life law to work around this. And the hero tends to be a little too super-human -- a flaw Meltzer shares with Grisham.However, these criticisms are more snipey than structural. All in all, the book is an excellent first effort and is well worth reading. It's much better than Grisham's recent offerings."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I enjoy a good legal thriller, and I'm a former judicial law clerk (for the US Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court), so when I heard there was a new legal thriller coming out with a Supreme Court judicial clerk as the protagonist, I was intrigued. I bought the book the first week it hit the shelves.I cannot possibly over-state my disappointment with this book. To begin with, the writing style is atrocious. Meltzer doesn't even begin to grasp such concepts as mood, setting, or character development. His prose consists of relentless dialogue, for pages on end, with little or no descriptive narration. There's a reason no-one else writes like this -- it really grates on the reader's nerves.I have to give Meltzer credit for coming up with an interesting plot. It kept me reading to the end, even though the turgid dialogue nearly made me give up on several occasions. But even here, The Tenth Justice lacked the realism and detail that makes a great legal drama. I had hoped the book would provide an interesting inside look at the Supreme Court. But there is no authenticity to be found here. It's almost as if Meltzer didn't do any research at all, simply making up the background details as he went along. Based on my experiences as a judicial clerk, Meltzer's description of life in a Supreme Court Justice's chambers seems absolutely preposterous. My friends who have clerked in the Court of Appeals and on the Supreme Court share this opinion. Meltzer shouldn't have taken on a topic like this without doing some serious research."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Echoing many remarks below, POOR, REALLY POOR, PITIFUL DIALOGUE. Where is the editor-type, anyway?'Da boys are meeting to review law school yearbooks to look for the villain's picture (because they have a hunch he went to law school, and a further hunch, because he's &quot;really smart,&quot; that he went to one of the top five law schools), when their pizza arrives. According to Meltzer, 'da boys &quot;turned their attention to the pizza.&quot; I laughed so hard I almost spat up mine.If getting a book out is this easy, maybe I should start over, go to law school again, and write a novel rather than take the bar. Yeah, that's the ticket.I found myself finishing this book only because I felt guilty about wasting 25 bucks on it.Want real legal suspense? Read _A Civil Action_ by Jonathan Harr. Now that's a page-turner that you'll WANT to read all the way through."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book was given to me as a gift by a friend who had taken quite a bit of time to select &quot;the perfect read&quot;. Thus, I felt somewhat obligated to finish the book. If it were not for that, I would have put it down after the first 30 pages. The plot seemed contrived and implausible. The characters were not very well developed, with the sole exception of the protagonist (whom I found to be naive, selfish, spoiled and self-destructively impulsive). The dialogue was at times witty, at other times downright annoying. I was especially bothered by the repeated use throughout the book, by almost all the characters, of the comeback: &quot;Funny!&quot; or &quot;You're so funny!&quot; or &quot;That's not funny!&quot; However, in all fairness to the author, while I fault him for a lack of craft, I have to compliment him on his clear and crisp use of the English language."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"If Ben Addison is representative of Supreme Court clerks, our legal system is in deep trouble. I'm not referring to the slip of the tongue in revealing a court decision, which, after all, is the key to the story and not an implausible one for a new employee. Rather, the immature way he and his adolescent-mentality friends try to deal with the situation does not square with the intelligence and savvy one expects from a top notch law student (the only types who get to work on the Court).Meltzer's character development and dialogue are no deeper than that of the sitcom &quot;Friends,&quot; where perhaps he got his inspiration. The characters are shallow, dim bulbs. Moreover, Meltzer is totally clueless about the State Department's role which does not include investigations of threats to US citizens. Hello, Mr. Meltzer, the State Department is involved in FOREIGN POLICY! At least, he knows the Supreme Court has something to do with the law.But the plot does have its moments, hence the two stars. The fictional court decisions are interesting. Too bad they aren't well developed. And why doesn't the Justice for whom Ben and Lisa work not make an appearance early on? He might have lent some gravitas to a book that makes a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode an intellectual challenge by comparison."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I wanted to like this book for two reasons. First, I am a fan of the legal thriller genre and have been ever since I first read &quot;The Firm&quot; by John Grisham. Second, I am interested in the law, especially in the inner workings of the Supreme Court. &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; let me down on both counts. The plot is both inconsistent and nonsensical, especially as to how it relates to the Supreme Court. The supporting characters are paper thin and the main character is unsympathetic. The author wants us to believe they are the best and the brightest, but for the most part, they all act like a bunch of self-centered ninnies. I agree with the other reviews that say it borders on misogynist the way the author writes the female clerk. It was a chore to even finish the book, and I did not come away with either the satisfaction of a good thriller or any further insight into what it is like to be a Supreme Court Clerk. With such a promising premise, this book could have been a lot more. I can only hope that maybe someone else will write a satisfactory thriller about Supreme Court clerks."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book was bad to say the least. You have a supreme court law clerk who is supposed to be amongst the brightest minds in the nation falling for a trick that a ten year old would see through. The dialogue of this book is tedious and mechanical.Every step of the book I knew or had a hunch for what was going to happen next. At no time did I ever feel any kind of intrigue or suspense. Maybe it was because I could not care less what happened to any of the characters.Basic plot: Moron law clerk gets tricked into revealing a pending supreme court decision. He gets black mailed by the same guy into having to reveal even more decisions. The clerk assembles the Mickey Mouse club and tries to catch the master criminal before he has to reveal another decision.I have really limited resources to books right now.

I kept reading for a while, thinking it would get better, but no.... Utterly improbable plot and poor, stereotypical characters. Not even as good as Grisham's books (as opposed to the movies based on them, which aren't bad), and that says a lot."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I had great expectations of this author and this book. Unfortunately, it read like a Hardy boy novel. The plot, development of characters and the overall premise that the character's who are supposedly brilliant could be so gulible is a laugh.

If properly supported with character development, mood, setting, etc., I can see how the rest of the book could have been fun. Lacking these elements, however, the subsequent twists and turns sounded kind of like the bad movie that the characters often mocked. In all fairness, though, this is a first novel from a young writer. I'll give his next effort a try before I close the book on Brad Meltzer."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"One of the few books I have not finished. I struggled through the first few chapters and found the plot and characters purely unbelievable. In general, the book is very poorly written, and blessed with a simply stupid plot. A major problem is with the dialog...people do not talk as he writes, and there is far too much dialog to keep a reader on track. Hard to believe the author is a college graduate. The author should stick to lawyering and give up writing. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Imagine yourself in the following unfortunate predicament: you're stuck in the middle seat of a crowded airplane, in between two sweaty men of substantial girth, your flight starts doing one of those circling affairs three thousand feet from the airport due to bad weather, and the flight attendant announces that landing will not occur at any time in the foreseeable future. Then, perhaps, this would be a good book to pull out of your briefcase to read. Otherwise, be prepared to hit your head on the wall in absolute rage for having wasted a few hours of your life on a pretty poor piece of writing.Brad Meltzer's first book is a &quot;thriller&quot; that occasionally borders on being interesting. However, his execution - particularly the dialogue - leaves much to be desired. The strained and unrealistic dialogue not only reeks of &quot;fraternal antics&quot; (in the author's own words), but I can find no other way to characterize the discourse than to simply say ! ! that it sounds phony. Perhaps that is how boys converse in that self-contained universe (which I am not privy to) called a college fraternity? Not in the real world, though, as far as I know.The Tenth Justice is the story of Ben Addison, Yale Law School graduate and the new clerk in the chambers of Supreme Court Justice Mason Hollis, and the incredible mess he gets himself into with a con man Rick Fagen. When Addison finally realizes his blunder, he sets out on a grand chase of the ever-illusive Fagen, with the help of his co-clerk, Lisa, and his three roommates, who work at a Senator's office, the State Department, and a major Washington newspaper. These five brilliant young minds with &quot;inside the beltway&quot; elite status put their bright futures and, eventually, their lives, on the line for this search. The result of this cat-and-mouse chase is highly predictable - after all, the Tenth Justice is now being made into a Hollywood movie, coming soon to a thea! ! ter near you. In fact, weren't movie rights to the book s! old even before it was completed? Even to the untrained eye, it seems obvious that Meltzer wrote the story to Hollywood specifications.The Tenth Justice is not totally devoid of redeeming qualities, though. As I mentioned earlier, the story has its moments, and Meltzer (fortunately) takes you through it as though he were driving full speed down the Autobahn. If nothing, it can provide a few hours of mindless entertainment, a last resort if you are in an absolute bind, i.e., stuck in the middle seat in between two sweaty men . . . .By the way, I think it would be a pretty serious violation of the Truth-in-Advertising laws to call the Tenth Justice a &quot;legal thriller.&quot; There is very little about the law in this book, except perhaps some information about the process by which Supreme Court hands down decisions. And even that doesn't seem quite accurate. Thriller? Well maybe. But legal it's certainly not.Then again that's probably for the better."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Did I make a mistake and pick up a book from the juvenile section?How many sentences in the book do you think started with the phrase &quot;The three friends went&quot; or something equally simple.I finished this book only because I hate spending money on one and then not finishing.I gave the book to one of my Malaysian friends who speak English as a second language figuring they would have no trouble at all following the simple plot and dialogue."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Poorly developed, childish, churlish protagonist, a one-dimensional villain, and deus ex machina solutions to the plot twists. Probably of interest to attorneys inside the beltway for its amattering of superficial supreme court lore; hard to imagine its interest to others.

Except for the suicide, which generated honest sadness, these guys spent more time with &quot;tears welling up&quot;, &quot;breaking into sobs&quot;, and hugging and consoling than I care to read in one book.

Meltzer provided me with just the right mix of fantasy, friends and the law."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"What could have been an interesting story about corruption at the Supreme Court is marred from the outset by the characters' endless whining. These four guys are pathetic.Everything else in the book suffers from the dialogue, and the book is dialogue-heavy. 'Nuff said.The other BIG problem I have with the story is that although the hero beds his female co-clerk, it (1) takes him forever to do so, (2) he never does it with her again. None of the roommates have a sex life either. Unless, as I suspect, it is among themselves, which would explain the whining you'll find on every page.If you enjoy homosexual dialogue, this book's for you. If not, save the money."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I found the tenth justice to be the book I was hoping for with every Grisham(and never got).

Although it purports to be a mystery, there is little or no suspense, perhaps because the characters are so shallow it's hard to care whether they live or die. I can only assume Mr. Meltzer thought it would directly to the screen-large or small-since there is no narrative or character development. Good premise; disappointing implementation."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Supreme Court clerk gets conned into revealing a decision before it is announced.Gets revenge. Gets those involved arrested.The plot and especially the drama at the arrest is a bit of a streach.

I enjoyed all of them. This one is the best so far, in my opinion. Meltzer can really have one reading all night to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book really has the feel of being a young person working in D.C.: group houses, long hours, and Armand's Pizza on Capitol Hill with its all you can eat pizza buffet.No, it's not high art, but it'll keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Ben Addison has just graduated from Yale Law School and has landed the enviable position as a clerk for U. S. Supreme Court Justice Hollis. He becomes good friends with his co-clerk, Lisa. Ben shares an apartment with his three best friends from high school - Nathan, Eric and Ober.Shortly after taking the job, Ben is tricked into revealing a Supreme Court decision before it's announced. The person who tricked Ben makes a fortune in the stock market since he had prior knowledge on the ruling. Worried about his job, Ben vows to fight back and enlists the aid of Lisa and his roommates. The bad guy always seems to be one step ahead, though, so Ben isn't sure who to trust.Ben finally decides that he has no choice except to turn himself in and cooperate with the U. S. Marshals office, but it seems like he can't trust them either. The book comes to an exciting climax when all the parties involved come together.I listened to the audio version of The Tenth Justice by Brad Meltzer. It was read by Scott Brick and his narration had a noir feeling to it. I found it a little distracting at first but, after a little while, I didn't notice it anymore. I enjoyed the book and found myself prolonging chores or walks so that I could listen to more of it. The audio version is approximately 14 hours long."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Ben Addison is a new Supreme Court clerk - but his accidental slip places his position in jeopardy. It's up to co-workers and housemates to help with their insider access to Washington politics - and soon Ben finds all their careers - and their lives - are on the line. Scott Brick's rendition is gripping and lends excitement and high drama to an audio listen perfect for libraries strong in political thrillers."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book was a great read. The story starts off with a Supreme court clerk accidentally leaking the outcome of a pending case and going about redeeming himself. While this may be a little implausible, the story was good, captivating and the author kept my interest through every page of the book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"NOT bad, not heavy, but good quick reading. I like some of the insight into the court and the banter between roomates was great."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"THE TENTH JUSTICE is advertised as a legal thriller in the spirit of John Grisham or Scott Turow. But the truth is, it's not really much of a thriller at all.I would say at least eighty percent of this book consists of humorous banter between five twenty-somethings. Meltzer's pretty good at writing witty dialogue, and much of this novel reads like the screenplay for a Gen-X sitcom. But that's ultimately no substitute for good plotting and realistic characterization, and I think this novel falls short on both of these points. The plot is kind of flimsy, and much of the jokey dialogue does little to advance the story. It's also pretty clear that Meltzer's knowledge of the Supreme Court is superficial at best.It doesn't help that the main character of THE TENTH JUSTICE is ultimately quite privileged, self-absorbed and unlikeable as a person. Most of the book involves him trying to avoid responsibility for a serious mistake he makes at the beginning of the story. He's not much of a hero, and the ending of the novel left a sour taste in my mouth as a result. Still, I will admit that some of the plot twists toward the end are very effective.THE TENTH JUSTICE was readable enough to finish, but I wouldn't recommend this novel to a reader interested in a serious thriller with strong characterization. But if you're looking for a easy-to-read suspense novel with loads of sophomoric humor, this may be worth a try. This is ultimately more Lisa Scottoline than Scott Turow."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Then he fell into a trap of overthinking. The book does do a good job of grabbing the reader and keeping them in the book, but then you get to the last 100-150 pages and the Author just falls apart by really reaching and grasping for straws to find a solution.This is my first reading of Brad Meltzer and it was not a good beginning. Lets hope it gets better with his other books."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I heard so much about this book, I was pumped to read it. Instead of my normal thrift store book run, I went to get this from an actual book store!The story is good. But 3/4 of the way through, when the tone changes, I felt like I was reading a different book altogether. I don't know if this was an editors call to make such a drastic change to the ending, or Brad Meltzers plan.Aside from being totally outrageous as to practicality (it reminded me of John Grisham's Runaway Jury), it was a good story, though.Not as good as Meltzer's other books, but not awful."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The idea that a Supreme Court Clerk would be so careless with his responsibility is ridiculous. To add insult to injury the author continues to permit these careless mistakes to continue throughout the book. At times, the characters show signs of brillance and then turn right around and sabotage themselves. I forced myself to finish the book hoping it would get better. It never did."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I never read legal thrillers until I actually completed my JD ... since I've had some time on my hands (waiting for my bar results), I've decided as a lark to read a few in the genre. I must say that The Tenth Justice is one of the better books in the field I've encountered.As many of the other reviewers have noted, the plausibility level of the book is low. It's not so much that the broad plot consists of an unlikely scenario - a SC clerk gets tricked into divulging court secrets - but the \\"twists\\" occurring in the final 1/3 of the book tend to throw the entire book into shaky territory.Nevertheless, there were passages in the book that made me laugh out loud. I can't honestly remember having such an entertaining read ... at least since stumbling upon Christopher Moore. The relationship between the protagonist and his roommates and fellow clerk are wonderfully developed (especially in the first half of the book), with some very believable (and hilarious) dialog. While the setting seems more college dorm than Washington DC up-and-comers, it is still accessible and enjoyable.Too bad the book falls apart a bit at the end ... overlooking this, however, the book is a fun read."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book reads as if it was written by a first-year law student--which it was. He has no clue about how the Supreme Court works, how the US Government works or how to write. The plot is totally implausible and the dialogue is silly. A total waste of time and money. Will appeal only to the truly clueless. Give it a big miss."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Save your time and your money; not even worth the 50 cents.The plot is random and the dialogue is painful. The development of the main character seems to consist solely of him brooding every 5 pages. I can't imagine why the characters in the book risk their live's and their career's to help him. And I surely cannot believe that his \\"hot\\" co-clerk decided to share a night of no-strings passion with him. I was rooting for the villain..."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"On the whole, this was a great first novel. The characters were well defined, the suspense was gripping and I found the premise quite believable. But...did anyone else notice, as I did, how often Ben (the central character) AND other characters used the phrase, &quot;I don't want to hear it&quot;?While such phrasing might typify a certain characters idiomatic phrasing...and therefore be somewhat acceptable, this remark was used so often, by so many, that it started getting on my nerves! It reminds me of having a conversation with anyone who continually peppers their sentences with &quot;like&quot;. It like...gets me crazy, you know?Aside from this one complaint, though, I will continue to read Brad Meltzer. He's a pretty darn good yarn spinner, and knows his legal stuff!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I'm not often inclined towards legal thrillers, and set out to read the Tenth Justice with a fair amount of skepticism. My skepticism was only half justified. Despite the implausability which most reviewers are quick to point out, most of the plot is exciting and relatively well executed. despite what many other readers have said, I grew really attached to the characters and their - I quote - &quot;pointless banter.&quot; They all seem a likable bunch, especially the (somewhat moronic) Ober. I was appaled at the pointless despach of my favourite character two thirds of the way through the book, and at that point, I started to distinctly dislike mr Brad Meltzer.At that point, the plot took a rapid turn for the worse, and I found the ending infuriatingly unsatisfactory. It seems that our hero Ben ends up with a pretty crappy life - his friends all hate him (oh, except the one who commited suicide..) he lost his job and his credibility, he got shot in the shoulder..... sorry to wreck the plot, but these things must be told. Oh, he gets his girl though. Well break out the champagne.I left this book feeling infuriated with the ending. I wasn't asking for a happily ever after, just a small glimmer of hope. Ah well, no more legal thrillers for me."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book is tightly written and features believable 20-something characters engrossed in a plot with interesting twists and turns. The dialogue hits the mark every time. I have given/lend/recommended this book to over 20 people and everyone has loved it. At this bargain price, you can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book had three problems: the plot, the characters, and the writing. The plotting of this novel was really bad. The reason people are saying &quot;I read it in one night&quot; is not because it's so exciting, but because it's written at about a 7th grade level. There is no reason for us to care about this character, and nothing much is at stake. Only that he might lose his job--but it's unclear how finding Rick will help him with that. He DID what he's accused of; the &quot;struggle&quot; between Ben and Rick is really forced and strained. And the &quot;comaraderie&quot; between the rommmates was painful. Their reactions were completely unrealistic. Ben had one tone: sarcastic. They were constantly having these conversations that would start as teasing and end &quot;serious&quot; yet it was never clear what had been said that was different than the 20 things said before. We know it's more serious because the other person is now angry. This book SHOULD have been about the inner workings of the Supreme Court--yet here it is just Ben's Job. It's only real use is so they can complain about being busy. At the end something truly horrific happens that they all forget about within a couple weeks. This book was severely amateurish. It had no right being published. I've read some real pulp in my time but rarely have I read an author with so little fundamental ability. I'm telling you, bad television is even written better than this."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice was probably a good book for a first author, but when comparing it to First Counsel, Metzer's third book, it fails to compare. I had hoped Tenth Justice would provide as much as an inside look at the Supreme Court as First Counsel did of the White House, but it doesn't come close. The Tenth Justice revolves around Ben Addison and his fellow supreme court clerk Lisa and Ben's three friends.None of the action occurs with the supreme court and we only get to hear Ben and friends talk about it, we never get a feel for the court. That said, this book has other problems. Metzer fills his book with dialogue that I guess is supposed to be witty and provide characterization. It does neither well because all of the dialogue blends together.The plot is decent and there are a few surprises and twists, but nothing is too surprising. Metzer is a decent author, but if your looking for a legal thriller, this isn't it. The law is the setting but the story is the characters and how they get out of a jam. I definitely recommend The First Counsel over this book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer has a fan in me. I'll say that. I enjoyed the Millionaires a good deal. This one? Not so much. True, it was first novel, but the last 1/4 of the book is a mess. Most of the story is interesting and the friendship angle is interesting. The dialogue is funny and often true to life (of young adults). The Supreme Court stuff is nice and interesting. Even the set-up and red herrings are interesting. I read most the book in one day to find out what would happen in the end. The book barrels out of control in the end and seems to include everything possible, even when it borders on the absurd. You can see it as a 2 star hollywood film--indeed, Meltzer even thanks Dick Clark (??) films in the acknowledgements. Also contained in that section we see that many of the names in the book are those of friends--nice touch. Basically, you can see the beginnings of Meltzer's strengths as a writer, but back in '97 he still had aways to go. Read something else by him first."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"[...]This book is the antithesis of a masterpiece. It is pure bubble-gum, Hardy Boys, average to below-average writing. Meltzer has a bad habit of acknowledging many experts at the beginning of his novels, thereby giving the impression that his books are authoritative, behind-the-scenes, fact-filled gems. In reality, his dialogue is laughable, there are little or no facts throughout, and suspension of disbelief gets harder and harder as one progresses through the novel.This might be acceptable if the writing wasn't so amateurish across the board. Rapidly switching POV's, characters exchanging inane, expository dialogue, and screenplay-type prose with little or no description make for painful reading.The Library Journal said it best, that it would keep YA (Young Adult) audiences entertained. That's terrific. But please, please don't market it to the rest of us, the readers who loved the Hardy Boys but gave them up when we were 14.[...]"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This is what a good book's about! Some of the criticisms are out of place. First, most readers do not have a legal background and the book doesn't need to necessarily give insight into the conversation between and clerk and justice. Secondly, the sophomoric conversation is what made the relationship between the roommates so believable to me.When I read through the inside flap at the library, making a quick decision to check this book out, I wasn't sure if the basic plot between roommates would be enough to hold this together. Meltzer did a masterful job at bringing these characters to life. It would have been easier to add much more complexity to this plot, but what made me read the book in one day was this relationship these four guys had after moving into their careers. All of us know that these relationships reach a climax and then go south real fast after graduating from school. The conversations these guys have together is very real to me. Because someone is extremely bright doesn't mean that when with close buddies they always have to be verbally astute. That is not the way real life happens. The character Ben could be writing a legal brief for a supreme court justice, get on the Metro to go home, and want to hang with his buddies and slam a brew. The conversational tone shifts from formal to very informal... \\"What up broski?\\" \\"Hey man, chill out\\" This communicated the tight bond these guys have. When we are around those close to us, we can let our guard down, and that is very refreshing!This is a great book and Meltzer wrote in a style that was not too technical, unlike Joseph Finder. I didn't want all the details Finder can go into...although I like this, I can't usually hammer one of his books out in a day...I need a rest. With Meltzer, it was just enough details. I loved this book! I know it's a good read when I have a strong picture of the characters only after a few pages."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Sigh! Brad Meltzer is apparently one of the hottest young things to happen to the tired genre of the legal thriller. If this, his first novel, is anything to go by there is some serious hyping going on. Even as summertime beach reading this novel doesn't make it. Cardboard cutout characters bumble their way through a papier-mache plot. It is nothing more than a lightweight attempt at writing a novel with one eye on the filmrights, ala John Grisham. Indeed, if this were a telemovie (a cinema film would be unthinkable surely) it would definitely be on at 4:30am on a Tuesday morning on the Fox network.One star for effort and another for it getting published."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Being an attorney myself, I picked up this book with eager anticipation. I wish now that I had been a little less impulsive. I finished the book just 4 days ago, and have already forgotten &quot;who dunnit&quot;, and really don't care. I do remember that the ending was predictable. However, the most annoying aspect was the gratuitous dialogue....this book was very wordy for no apparent point. I did think that the characters had some potential, but about mid-book it became painfully apparent that the author was not interested in any true development. I believe that I will stick to Jack Higgins."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"An awkwardly written, obvious, Generation X take on a thriller. The author appears to be a frustrated TV writer, law degree not withstanding, who has overdosed on all the buddy sitcoms. The book simply doesn't read true, which probably means that Meltzer will be the next John Grisham."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"this book was obviously an attempt by the publisher to turn a quick buck on the heels of other legal thrillers. It is absolutely terrible. The story is implausible, formulaic, and you never care one itty-bitty bit about any of the characters. The fact that it was on a best-seller list really speaks volumes about how trade paperback readers get mediocrity thrown at them. AWFUL! if you want a good book about the Supreme Court, read the Bretheren by Woodward."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I read the back cover and thought it sounded great. What a disappointment! The dialog made the characters appear as junior high students rather than young adults striving for success in Washington, D.C. The plot dragged along at an agonizing pace. Except for a few brief scenes, I found his effort to be lacking."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am student who will be attending law school this next year, so I try to keep up on any new books I find related to the subject of law. This book was just BAD. The writing was dull, the characters lacked development, and the details were overdone. I kept turning page after page, hoping it would get better, but didn't have any luck. I was relieved to finish it. Even my boring accounting textbooks are better reading material."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This is a prime example of a big publishing house paying huge dollars for less than amateur effort. The fact that Mr. Meltzer was a Supreme Court clerk held the promise that his book would be a best-seller. I wonder if the publisher has learned anything? In all fairness, it isn't Mr. Meltzer's fault that the book is so bad--this is a clear case of a publisher neglecting to edit the author (severely). Some advice for anyone who wants to write: &quot;So-and-so said, taking another bite of her hamburger.&quot; &quot;Lying on the bed, he&quot; &quot;Twisting in the sheets,he&quot; &quot;Wearing jeans and a crew neck sweater, he was thrilled&quot; &quot;Going to the kitchen,&quot; &quot;So-and-so said, sitting at his desk&quot; Every paragraph in this book has one, two, and sometimes four of these weak sentences. Not only does this make for weak prose that cause readers to cringe, but it trivialized the narrative and characterization to the point of disgust. Very poor prose and childish dialogue, throughout. Unbelievable, as well. Characters unlikeable. Could have been a good plot, but, due to poor writing, fell far short of being even mediocre."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Although the idea of using a naive legal scholar for financial gain has been recycled time and time again, the underlying plot has promise. Unfortunately, this legal scholar turned author forgot, or never learned, how to write convincing dialog. In the end, merely an unsatisfactory glimpse into the marbled walls and wooden chambers of the highest court. Grisham has nothing to fear from this effort."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I'm only half way through. Somebody please tell me this guy can write a story using something other than dialog to tell it. And mindless, sophomoric dialog at that. Right now I'd settle for lines like &quot;Slowly she turned....&quot;, or even &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot;. Obviously, from the 100 plus reviews listed here, you either love it or hate. So far I hate it. Nothing but innane chatter."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I read this book because I loved &quot;Dead Even&quot; by this author and was looking forward to something as suspenseful. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, I was very disappointed by &quot;The Tenth Justice.&quot; This was mostly because the characters were not believable and sounded like they came out of a bad children's book. Unless you are easily entertained, I would steer clear of this one."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"If you hoping for another Grisham, you will not find it here. People's, review is more than misleading. The author a first year law student when he wrote the book was incapable of writing with the experience of a John Grisham. Characters are weak. They come across as adolescents playing at grown up jobs. Author's understanding of the law and how it works seems to be derived from reading Grishman's books and watching network television.This book is a definite pass."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book could have been much better. It grew more disappointing with every page I read. The characters are all idiots and the dialogue between them is absurd and completely unrealistic. There were also technical problems with the book that made it very hard to believe.I read some reviews on here that said this book was great.

Still, I end up with the girl, and I get my dream job as a federal prosecutor where common sense and brains are--apparently--not required."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"An excellent legal thriller in my opinion; from the witty characters to the extensive plot, Brad Meltzer does it all.Who can Ben trust? Will he risk his career as a Supreme Court Clerk (i.e. the \\"Tenth Justices\\") in order to catch a criminal? Or will he sacrifice his relationship with his childhood friends/apartment mates instead? Read on to find out!What I most liked about the book was the plot which revolved mainly around the intricate workings of our Supreme Court Justice system. Of course, being a fiction novel, such information must be taken with a grain of salt. Yet, one does get an \\"overall feel\\" if you will for life inside our Justice system. I also firmly enjoyed the character \\"Lisa\\", who certainly possesses all the qualities I would look for in an ideal girl. She is hot!My only complaint was the ending. It was too abrupt, and left you hanging a bit...but that is all I will say - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"(Kindle Edition) As a fan of Brad Meltzer's History Channel series \\"Decoded,\\" I decided it was time I read one of his novels. I picked at random, not realizing until after I ordered that \\"The Tenth Justice\\" was the author's first book, written in the late 1990's. First novels are an iffy thing -- some are absolutely brilliant and others...well, let's just say that \\"The Tenth Justice\\" is one of the others.The premise of the novel immediately drew me in -- new Supreme Court law clerk, Ben Addison, violates his oath by telling a virtual stranger the outcome of a controversial case involving major corporations a few days prior to the announcement by the justices. The stranger, \\"Rick Fagan,\\" has befriended Ben by telling him he is a former clerk of the same justice Ben is working for -- Fagan knows many details that make his story plausable and he plays on Ben's natural insecurities in his new environment. Ofcourse, Rick Fagan is not whom he pretends to be, and Ben's reveal results in the principals in the case buying huge numbers of shares of the stocks of both companies prior to the announcement the following Monday. A leak inside the court is immediately suspected. Ben is desperate to keep his job, and knowing that he would be fired immediately if he went to the judge for whom he clerks, he hopes to ride out the situation. Ben, his three childhood friends who now share a house in D.C., and Lisa Marie Schulman, his fellow law clerk, then go on the proverbial rollercoaster ride of action and suspense, which is generally entertaining with some reservations.The problem is...well, there is just so much darned talking, and talking, and talking, particularly among the roomies, that the action frequently stalls. There are long passages where little happens to move the plot forward, as Meltzer seemingly was attempting to make each of Ben's friends into unique individuals: Ober, the group clown, was the only real success in my opinion. There was also endless banter, mainly of a sexual nature, between Ben and Lisa, both within and outside the office. Also problematic are the ethical violations that Ben has his friends commit in an effort to protect his behind and uncover the identity of Fagan -- Ober's writing a death threat against the senator for whom he works, under \\"Fagan's\\" name, is the most extreme. In addition, Meltzer's Ben never shouts or hisses his frustration -- he screams, even in public places. When we finally reach the surpise ending, it is scared in my opinon by an \\"endless\\" Epilogue that consists of a conversation between Ben and Lisa where they attempt to set the boundaries of their romantic relationship. It is my experience that Epilogues are generally short and to the point, unless something pertinent to the plot is going to be revealed as a shocker at the last moment.I am interested in finding out if Meltzer's writing improves in his later works. If I discover that it does, I may be tempted to read further, but if more recent books contain the same issues that bog down \\"The Tenth Justice,\\" I will probably stick to \\"Decoded.\\"I found no major errors in the Kindle edition and appreciate that the cover of the book was included, not just the title page."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am an attorney and working on writing a novel. I have never been published and I am still in the beginning stages. Having said that, i figured that since Meltzer was published right out of law school, I'd check him out. I must say, I hope his follow up work gets better. These characters, particularly the main character Ben, are supposed to be really smart but are actually really stupid. Reading this I continued to say out loud, \\"really\\"? I don't know if Meltzer grew up with any bit of street smarts, but his characters definitely don't have any. I was not surprised at any time while reading this book and found it a bit predictable. It also tended to drone on as I was waiting for something to happen.I will give meltzer another chance, but I will pick one of his better books, if there is one."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Maui H.S.Once again Brad Meltzer has proved to be the master of mystery in my choice of mystery authors. The book did start out rather dull to me. I thought to myself what a whiney stupid egotistical selfish guy. It was a hero sculpted by Meltzer to really lead you into the book. The roommates were stupid, but since I am woman, I thought most male roommates are that stupid together. It was still part of Meltzer's unique writing and the real base of the characters was the harsh reality of life and leaving the boyhood foolishness. As in all the Meltzer books I have read, someone does die. This death was a real heartbreaker. I couldn't stop sobbing. The character was so real to me, I miss him. Through half the book you didn't know who done it. Then Meltzer reveals suddenly the name. I had to check to see that I wasn't hallucinating and I was only half way into the book. From that moment on Meltzer keeps you gripping the story so tight your mind is about to break in two. I couldn't put the story down. It was a good thing I had the day off from work or I would have been a basket case. If anyone had interupted me as I clung to every word until the end, I would have probably bitten their head off, or not answered the phone. It starts out slow and stupid, but baby what a ride."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"While I read a great deal, I have never bothered writing a review before. This book was so bad, I decided to try to warn others. It is one of the most boring reads ever. The characters are uninteresting, the premise is unlikely, and the dialog is tedious and juvenile. I can't imagine 20 something \\"overachievers\\" acting like they do in this book. I found nothing worthwhile. I bought it, so I finished it, constantly hoping that it would become interesting. I remained disappointed. This was the second Meltzer I have read, and he is now off my list. Neither was sufficiently interesting to keep my attention."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I had not burned through a book since the first time I read the Firm. I do liken Meltzer in many ways to Grisham, right down to the unbelievable and disappointing ending. I would rate the first 80% of the book a 5 star rating, but the last 20% lowers my overall marks.The great build up left the author no place to go. LIke many people I try to figure out the conspiracy (who's in on it and who's out) and project the outcome---I've been surprised many times and by many authors, but the only surprise this time was the total destructive ending. Whereas this type of ending worked fine in the Lords of Discipline (Pat Conroy), it utlimately fails in the Tenth Justice.Worth reading? On a plane or beach yes--otherwise there are better thrillers out there.Will I read more of him? Sure--I gave Grisham a second shot and A Time to Kill is still his best (if not most wordy work)."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I enjoyed the book from cover to cover.

It brings into focus the fact that we have some very young and inexperienced people working in Wasington D.C. in important and high positions which can get things very messed up for this country because of their immaturity and lack of experience. As a former clerk of an appellate court, I could relate some stories that would be equally entertaining yet scary. It showed accurately some of the operations of the Court and the narrative was stated in the true manner in which young people communicate with each other. Most successful up and comers have had a friend which needed special attention and the Holden Caufield of this story added a funny demension. I enjoyed this concoction of personalities who were struggling to make it in a very cold and impersonal city ."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was reluctant to read this at first due to negative reviews but I was glad I gave it a shot. The best part was that it had plenty of funny dialogue between the four roommates and the co-clerk. The ending was a bit lacking but still, for young folks trying to avoid the pretentious typical legal thriller, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"As a 22 year-old pre-law student, John Grisham's novels are entertaining and informative, but I can't relate to any of his characters. It was such a relief to finally read a &quot;legal thriller&quot; with characters I could picture having coffee with. Although the ending was a little weak (it should have ended 100 pages earlier), Meltzer made an excellent debut."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"&quot;People, 5/19/97 : Meltzer has earned the right to belly up to the bar in the company of John Grisham, Scott Turow and David Baldacci...&quot; I'm sorry, but Meltzer has bellied up to the bar and blown them all out of the water. This was a great summer book to read on vacation - you won't put it down! The plot just keeps twisting and turning and making you want to keep turning the pages. I was sure I knew who Ben could trust on pages 166, then around 235, then around 267, then around 345, etc."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Brad Meltzer's first attempt at a legal thriller was impressive, but he's got a way to go yet. The story keeps you interested, but the characters are one dimentional and mostly hard to take. Four childhood friends living together way into their 20's? I don't think so. The Protagonist, Ben Addision, is engaging, but his &quot;holier than thou&quot; mentality gets to you after a while. His nemisis, Rick, is never really explored or explained. To me, he seemed omnipotent. My bottom line: Keeps you reading, worth the time, but wait for the paperback version."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"In the current climate of American fiction, there is rarely a new voice that will reach a wide group of people--and in that climate it becomes strikingly clear when something stands out. Brad Meltzer is an innovative writer, and surprisingly, very young. In this book, The Tenth Justice, he adds a whole new dimension to the legal thriller. We can debate all we want about negative individual subjective reactions to this book, but all those naysayers are just jealous. The truth is, many have responded to it. I really think it's a rare, special book and an author we'll be seeing a lot more of"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"While the plot of this book shows some promise, the infantile way that the young characters interact is annoying. These 20 somethings seem more concerned about the reaction of their high school buddies and their mothers than the direction of their lives. I've asked a younger friend to read this book to see if people really have relationships like the ones depicted in this book"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"A thrilling Grisham-esque summer novel - NO DOUBT Meltzer has talent and wit - He will be around a long time. I'm already picturing John Cusack in the lead role. A DEFINITTE READ! We can't wait for the book tour so we can meet our newest favorite author"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was fortunate to pick up the novel without any advance hype, so I didn't have to suffer from elevated expectations like so many of the other reviewers apparently did. I enjoyed the novel for what it is, summer fluff. I read it in a weekend sitting on the patio with a few microbrews, and &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; is perfect for that purpose. Brad Metzler has the talent, I believe, to write novels much more engrossing, and I look forward to reading his next works.While reading the novel I felt like I was reading a novel-soon-to-be-screenplay, which is the same reaction I got when I used to read Grisham. Characters were sketched but not fully developed, and the characters speak the way we wish we could, instantly coming up with perfect retorts instead of thinking up the lines sometime later in the day. Rick was also a less-than-satisfying villain, although he showed great promise at the beginning when he knew every move Ben made even before Ben made it. By the end of the novel, Rick is only a suit with a gun, not a devious criminal mastermind, and his defeat didn't satisfy.The suspense in the novel comes from Ben's lack of trust in his friends, but I have to admit that I got tired of Ben timing his statements to his friends such that we just avoid learning which of his friends has betrayed him. In thrillers the reader should never notice that he's being manipulated, and I felt that way several times.So, you may ask, why did I enjoy the novel? It's simple. Metzler gave himself a great plot and he followed the proper summer-fluff conventions in the proper order and with excellent pacing. I think that Metzler has a deeper novel in his future, and I hope that he resists the temptation to Grishamize his output."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer has crafted an intriguing plotline in this, his first novel. However, his utter lack of any writing ability whatsoever makes this novel simply unbearable at times. The dialogue is ridiculous. I have never -- and I mean NEVER -- read a novel where the dialogue and characters were so unbelievable. The plotline could have made for a great novel, but the idiocy of the main characters ensures that the book goes nowhere. While reading, numerous times I was amazed at how little common sense any of the characters had. I mean, Ben screws up by telling something he shouldn't have, and then he goes and tells everyone about it??? Give me a break. Don't embarrass Grisham and Turow by comparing them to Brad Meltzer. At least not yet. We will see what comes of his future novels, once he learns to write"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I found The Tenth Justice to be wildly entertaining and extremely fast-paced.While the characters were not very well- developed, for once I didn't care! I took it with me to the beach and found that I couldn't put it down. A great summer book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Brad Meltzer creates a sure-to-be bestseller in his writing debut. THE TENTH JUSTICE is a legal mystery about Ben Addison, an overly-concientious Colombia Law Grad fresh out of college. His career immediately blossoms when he gets a job for a well-respected justice at the Supreme Court. One day he gets a call from a man who claims to be a former clerk.Ben decides to meet him for lunch and a few tips, but when Ben inadvertantly leaks out top-secret court information, he becomes the one doing the tipping. When Ben finds out the man claiming to be a former Court clerk isn't, and that the info he leaked changed the outcome of a company merge, he realizes that his entire career may be in jeopardy. If you hate legal mystery novels, READ THIS ANYWAY. While not everyone will completely enjoy the book, you will at least find some points of interest in it"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Anyone who has been, is or will be a legal clerk must read this book. The security and confidentiality that is necessary to this position cannot be compromised! This book gives a fascinating account of a &quot;What if...&quot; situation. The author certainly has come up with an ingenious plot and a great cast of characters. I do not know how he managed to write this during law school, but he definitely deserves kudos for accomplishing this and a J.D. simultaneously. I look forward to reading more of Meltzer's future works"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"You will be laughing out loud immediately! Meltzer wastes no time in getting you knee deep in the plot. Every situation spirals towards ultimate confusion. The dizzing suspense will propel you to read faster and faster - pages flying wildly. You test your skills of character analysis of who can and cannot be trusted. Can you be trusted? Then this reading frenzy stops. You're breathless from having solved the mystery. Now what do you do? Nothing exciting has caught your eye, and you cannot get the first line out of your head. So back to page one for another laugh"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I loved this book! It was one of the best legal thrillers I have read in years. The characters are well rounded and likeable. READ IT"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The storyline is somewhat intriguing,but the characters are shallow and not realistic. In fact, the author depicts how stick figures might converse. The dialogue was contrived and boring; the characters are not likable; the lead character is the ultimate egocentric loser. Wait for this one on the $4.99 bargain table"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am not going to wax poetic on Meltzer's work. I will just tell you that I got home tonight at midnight, picked up this book and started reading. It is currently 5:45, and I just finished...and I do nott regret staying up; in fact, I felt I had no choice. I cannot wait to start on the next...five stars."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Well, I have heard everything on these posts. &quot;This book( )!&quot; to &quot;This is definitely the best book of theseason! buy it for everyone you know! &quot; I thought it was in between those two extremes. The character dialogue was witty, and sometimes i laughed out loud at the buddy-buddy convos of first-met Lisa and Ober. You never expect that what starts as a minor slip-up will end up pitting friends against eachother, and soon you too will begin to wonder, &quot;who in this book can we trust?&quot; I got it on sale, so if you think my opinion counts to you, i would buy it too. its a good read, and you will get through it fast. END"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I live in Northern Virginia, so anybody who lives in DC is amazed by DC authors. They read about the characters going to Union Station and go, \\"Oh! Oh! Oh my God!!! I've been there!\\" So about 5 people recommended this book. This book is a mess. I was shocked that so many of my friends have really low standards when it comes to reading. I was hoping that I would learn a lot about the Supreme Court, but I didn't learn anything. This novel (to use the term loosely) is way too long. As other reviewers have said, the dialogue is amateur, just smart aleck comments back and forth. It's got the ol' wacky roommate with the wacky name who says wacky things and does wacky things. It's got the antagonist with the surveillance manpower of the NSA, who in James Bond Villain style, explains every action and motivation before trying to off the main character, Ben. The love story is cold. The most romance occurred between Ben and his roommates, and they're supposed to be straight, but they talk gay, live in Dupont Circle, and cook for each other, I\`ll let you do the math. Plot twists are not honest to the story and the climax shoots blanks. The book is predictable. Also, Meltzer needs to take his picture off the book. Sometimes my imagination replaces the main character with the picture of the author and while the main character is supposed to be tough and good looking, all I could picture is a very ugly, balding, Jewish man named Meltzer. Ughhhh. NO MORE D.C. AUTHORS!!!!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This was the first fictional book that I had ever finished in my entire life. I was always bored by fiction books in the past, but Brad Meltzer made this book come alive. I found my heart racing throughout the book, just like an Oscar winning suspense movie! I just could not put it down. As I read along I would completely get lost in time and before I knew it I would have read 100 pages. This is more than a book, it is an experience!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I actually came across this book because I was dating a guy at the time who had a friend who had an advanced copy - they knew I liked to read and sugested the book. I am now an avid Brad Meltzer fan - I go to his book signings when he is in my area and rush out to get his new releases on the day they come out. I have read all of his books and the first is still the best as far as I am concerned.Plot twists and turns around every corner. This is also a book I buy and give to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I think this book is a good thriller that is worth to read if you like this kind of books. It has good characters development, funny dialogs, mistery, etc. Still I wouldn't put the author next to John Grisham as many reviewers suggest. The plot doesn't always seem totally plausible. As some reviewers mentioned I couldn't figure out why the main hero needed to pursue the bad guy even after the bad guy left him alone (I hope I didn't spoil anything here). Also, I cannot say that this action and adventure packed novel (I am not saying that this is necessarily bad). But if you put such such considerations aside the book has very likable characters and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I couldn't put it down. The Tenth Justice had a great plot and interesting characters. The conversations between Ben (the main character)and his roommates were hilarious! All of the characters were hip and fun. I would suggest this book to anyone with a good sense of humor and a love for legal thrillers."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I couldn't put this book down!!Meltzer does a great job of keeping you in supense until the end, and even then he throws in a twist. I love the characters that he comes up with, they're all so real. I feel like I know them first hand. The only bad part of the book was when it was over!I can't wait to read all of his next books!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I was a little disappointed after reading some of the reviews. Although this book is not Shakespeare, it is a good read. The characters are developed with enough remaining untold to encourage you to read the next page. I believe he has taken an overworked subject of late and added enough of a twist to make this book fun. There is enough reality to make it believable and enough twist to make it entertaining.I would recommend this book if you enjoy the likes of John Grisham and David Baldacci."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book is a great thriller in its own right. The characters are very believable. The plot has so many twists and turns I felt like I was on a roller coaster. Move over John Grisham, there is another author with the same caliber as you."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"It has sadly become a rare occurence for me to be sufficiently absorbed to read a novel in one sitting. in the case of Brad Meltzer's &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot;, however, I made an exception. Whilst the plot ran out of steam somewhat towards the end, ones overriding impression was that the author has managed to write a story which was not only entertaining, but also managed to include the kind of credible dialogue that is too often missing from this genre of novel. I look forward to sampling his next offering and would reccomend this book as perfect holiday reading."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book is a great legal thriller! It combies not only legal action but it transends past all of the world into the mind, getting different emotions to come out when people are faced with challenges! This author has shown great strength in this book, and I hope we will be seeing more of him. Between undercover FBI agents to Supreme Court clecks to friends and love this book has it all! I challenge any one to read this book and not like it! -a@r*n C0lter"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This was definatly one of the best books I ever read! A must for everyone. The audio cassette version is also excellent. A worth while investment. I lent it to a friend just recently and they shared my opinion. You can't go wrong with this one. Blockbuster movie potential for sure!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I bought this last week from Amazon after reading other reviews. Now I can't wait to read Dead Even. Loved the characters, especially the relationship between Ben &amp; Lisa. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I love thrillers, mysteries. This book fulfilled that lust in me. However, too many passages consisted of the same scene, namely, the roommates telling each other to shut up. Was it only me, or did all the guys seem awfully gay? The living situation of the roommates seemed a bit too cozy as evidenced in their banter with one another. Liked Lisa. I could see that gal in NEWSRADIO play her in the movie version. And Ben? Thomas Gibson."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I am someone who rarely reads fiction because if I'm not intrigued in the first few pages, then I'll never finish the book. I finished The Tenth Justice within a week. People who overanalyze everything are missing out on the fun in life. This book is exciting, entertaining and fun. If the rest of these critics would just appreciate that without worrying about tone and character development, they'd enjoy reading a lot more. This is not junior high composition class -- it's supposed to be fun -- and this book really is!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Not even knowing what this book was about, I purchased it hoping for the best. What I got was absolutely beyond what I expected. The book was fabulous.Being in my mid-twenties, I could relate to these characters - their thought processes, they way in which they spoke to and dealt with one another, their hopes, anxieties, defeats, and victories. All of this was because of great character development - one one page you loved and cheered for Ben, on the next page you questioned his motivations and thought he was a little immature. It was like dealing with real people - you have to take, and always get, the good with the bad.Another selling point of this book is that, although it is a legal thriller, you don't feel intimidated or frustrated trying to decipher the legal jargon. Brad Meltzer wrote this book in a style that goes easy on the layman - probably to the chagrin of pure legal types - by not getting wrapped up in the legal details. If he had taken a more technical approach I think it would have detracted from the plot.And speaking of plot. The knives were flying from everywhere - no one could turn his/her back on the other. The twists were great and all integral to the final result. A plot element introduced 20 pages prior will suddenly become vitally important to what's going on now. The sensation of suddenly realizing where and how things tie in is great and this book offers plenty of opportunities for this to happen.Overall, this is one of the best books I've read all year and earning that distinction is no small feat. You won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Probably one of the best books I have read in a long time.Probably the longest book I've read at one time as well! But the book makes up for its longness. I had to finish it! It was so good that I finished it from chapter 11 all the way to the end. Chapter 17 will really get you..."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was funny, tragic, exciting. A good novel. No, this isn't a great work of fiction that will withstand the test of time. But, who cares? I wasn't looking for Tolstoy. Have fun. Enjoy the book. Don't be so serious guys!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Never mind the negative reviews this book's been given. If you don't take it too seriously (hey..it's FICTION), Meltzer has written a legal thriller that's fast-paced, hip, funny, yet oddly touching.He has created a storyline exciting enough to keep you awake at night, and seems to harbour a genuine affection for his smart-mouthed, neurotic characters. Ben &amp; Co may not always have the most intelligent conversations, but they are likeable, intelligent when necessary, and share great camaraderie.All in all, Meltzer's book is a breath of fresh air in a genre worn stale by the likes of Grisham, Turow, Baldacci etc."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Trite and juvenile. Little girls running around fighting. Humor was weak at best. I am guilty of finishing most books that I start. This book alone alters my tendency to endure future pain."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Not at all what I was expecting with the title. If you like Washington DC action, intrigue and suspense this is for you. One of those books you don't put down the last 200 pages."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I have read two of Brad Meltzer books which I liked very well. However, The Tenth Justice has too much fill without substance. I finally quit reading the book as it was taking too long to get to the meat of the matter."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Suspensful, but some of the scenario seemed a bit far fetched. Still a good read. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Ben was one of the most annoying characters and really stupid to have such a great educational background! Very hard to keep the characters straight and who Ben could trust!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I could just stand to read it for the sake of finishing it. Perhaps later books by this author are more mature. My two greatest irritations were the blase treatment of a death and the fact that so much of the plot was hidden from the reader as well as the characters."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I've read two of Meltzer's other works, The First Counsel and The Book of Fate, and both were superbly written, with excellent crafted characters and intriguing storylines. I'm also a fan of his graphic novel Identity Crisis. I bought The Tenth Justice in e-book format and...wow, I really slogged through the first few chapters. The writing is juvenile. It reminds me of first time fanfic writers. Lots of \\"Ben said.\\" \\"Nathan replied.\\" I didn't realize this was Meltzer's first book when I bought it, so I was really confused that the quality was so, so, so down. I was wondering Meltzer had had a head injury or something. I doubt I'll be able to finish it. That's $6.99 down the tubes. Luckily, Mr. Meltzer improved his craft because the two afforemention novels of his are fantastic."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Millionaires\\" and a couple of other Meltzer titles, so I started looking for other books of his I might have missed and this one popped up.At first, I really enjoyed the book. I got a kick out of the snappy dialogue between the long-established friends and the set up to the main caper was good. However....it went downhill from there.We never get answers to a lot of questions the book prompts. Why, for example, was Lisa not in the year book where she said she went to law school? And why did Nathan forget to mention the briefcase microphones he checked out? Also, we never find out how the main bad guy, Rick, knew about all the goings on in Ben and Lisa's office.I could have lived with those things (though I prefer to have the details wrapped up in a nice little bow at the end of the story), but what really threw me was the awful, awful ending. It's like 2/3 through the book, Meltzer didn't know what to do with the story he set up so he just started rambling on and on with silly conversations that don't further the plot or get us to understand the characters any better.It just reads like a good writer who got tired of the story he was writing and pulled a couple of all-nighters to crank out the ending, which didn't feel complete and didn't really let the good guy(s) win.If you enjoy starting a book and don't intend to finish it, you might enjoy this one because I liked the first half or so...but beyond that, I ended up forcing myself to finish it just because I was hoping the ending would make it worth it -- it didn't."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I liked it a lot! Kept me reading it and this is the first book I've read completely in a long time!i plan on reading them all!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Brad Meltzer keeps getting better with each book he writes. His characters always have a human touch that are easy to get involved with."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer must have some of the best &quot;imaginary&quot; friends in the world. The dialogue among the roommates is just plain awful and redundant. The book contained over 300 (out of 498 pages) pages of senseless communications b/w the 4 roomies. The main character Ben is so contradictory. He is a Clerk for the US Supreme Court (we're reminded of the incredible feat countless times throughout the book) and he does some of the most moronic things that a non-top law school graduate would never do. Although Meltzer graduated from NYU Law, this book is not top rate; unfortunately, it is more like bottom 10% in class ranking."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice was my second Meltzer book to read, and I enjoyed it just as much if not more than Dead Even. Meltzer's style seems to appeal to a younger crowd than the other legal thrillers I've read because the main character's personal life is also a primary part of the plot--involving conflicts with roommates as well as a love life. I hope to see more from Meltzer soon!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice was a quick thriller, that was hard to put down. The plot was great, and I enjoyed the twists and turns. However, the dialog was terrible and the language was unnecessary. It seemed as if every conversation ended in one of the characters saying &quot;I don't want to talk about it anymore.&quot; Also, I got the impression that the author used four letter language because he could not come up with anything more intelligent to say."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The story was an exciting one for a teenager that did not have have much understanding of the law. The story was to &quot;pat&quot;. The pieces fit together like a very simple jigsaw puzzle that when complete did not have a satisfying picture. I recieved it as a gift and did not have the heart to say it was not a good read."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"&quot;Five votes can do anything around here.&quot; William Brennan, Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court behind the scenes! Leaks, screw-ups, deception, greed, &quot;sneakiness,&quot; misuse of power among the lesser ones - the Court staff and interns. Decent first novel by a former speechwriter for President Clinton and a lawyer."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"NOT bad, not heavy, but good quick reading. I like some of the insight into the court and the banter between roomates was great."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Tenth Justice. It was so refreshing to read a novel where the characters are believable and not Supermen with a law degree. And it was also informative - I really feel like I have a new perspective on how the Supreme Court operates. (Whether or not it's accurate, I can't say!) The story kept me hooked and I just couldn't figure out how the author was going to resolve the conflict, but the book came to a very satisfying resolution."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I completly injoyed this book from start to finish! It really makes one think, and is fun enough to understand! GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I loved the style of writing by Brad Meltzer. His charecters were lively. The humour was good. The thing I liked the most about this book was that it I could see the charecters in my life. But when I was imagining a thrilling ending I was dissapointed . I had to close the book feeling that the ending could have been better. But overall its a good piece of work by Melzer."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I noticed that not everyone liked this book, and I can see their points. However, if you are looking for something quick and entertaining, this fits into that category. The dialogue, though sometimes trite, keeps things moving quickly, and it is nice to have a woman character who does not need saving by the men. I liked the male characters, and found their closeness, and subsequent &quot;break ups&quot; to be very true to life. Much of this book rang of thinly disguised autobiography, but I'll still be waiting to see the author's sophomore effort."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"...with liberty and corruption for all -- actually 3.5starsI have a few Brad Meltzer books but this is the first one I've actually read and I can only say I am moving at least one more up on my TBR pile as I write this review.This multi-layered thriller set in the US Capitol gives us insight to America's legal decisions. Navete, ambition and a lapse in judgment is a dangerous combination as Ben Addison proves with his second judicial clerk assignment. I would have liked the story to be a little tighter in the beginning. While easy to get into I wasn't captivated by the world building in the very beginning. Also since the entire situation is because of Ben's actions, I had a hard time being sympathetic to his character. Then when all of his friends got involved, I wouldn't feel sympathetic to them either - because once again anything bad would be because of what they each did not a situation that that fell into.All of that being said I really did like the premise and the elements of the story. There was a perfect balance of supposition mixed generally regarded fact to involve me as a reader and pull me into the heart of the story. I am also a fan of the writing style and the many twists in the mystery itself."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This book ended up being good, it starts out really slow and took awhile to get into it though. But I know this was his first book and I am figuring that they do get better. I don't think you have to read them in order but personally I like to read books from the authors first one and so on. Just a little quirk. I will go on to the second book next."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This thriller will keep you wondering \\"what's next\\" all the way through. Excellently written by a real pro. Couldn't put the book down - from start to finish. A real plus for your library!"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This was my first purchase by this author ... And last.I found myself screaming at his characters because they were doing such screaming dumb things and then surprised at the outcome. I tried to pick it up and finish it several times and finally decided life was too short to be yelling at fictional characters."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I'm very thankful that I started this novel early on a Sunday morning. It virtually didn't leave my hand until I'd completed it. Great plot, wonderful dialogue, nice ending."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I give Melton credit for starting with a unique and intriguing premise. Ben Addison, a hotshot Supreme Court legal clerk, inadvertently discloses an upcoming decision to a friendly seeming Court outsider who uses the inside knowledge for financial gain. The outsider then proceeds to blackmail Ben for additional confidential Court information, threatening to publicly disclose Ben's initial leak if Ben refuses to cooperate. With the assistance of three childhood friends and a fellow clerk, Ben attempts to identify and trap the slippery and clever outsider, while keeping his ethical lapse and \\"detective\\" activities secret from the ever watchful eyes of the U.S. Marshals assigned to the Court.Unfortunately, a solid initial plot is quickly overwhelmed by horribly unrealistic dialogue. The protagonists are all unceasingly glib, sarcastic and verbose. Most of the time, they come across as though they are either lecturing the reader or trying to impress with their verbal cleverness, as opposed to genuinely interacting with each other. Ben is especially irritating and for a main protagonist, he is at times downright unlikeable. As the book progressed, I found myself caring less and less for someone so unflinchingly arrogant, snide and self-pitying.The story also suffers from several plot devices that are rather implausible. The notion that four childhood friends from Boston would all end up living together in Washington D.C. as twenty-something professionals seems a stretch. This arrangement is particularly curious since the facade of friendship is quickly and easily fractured as soon as the going gets tough. These guys really do not like each other all that much. I also found it odd that in a story presumably set in the mid to late 1990s, none of the friends (all white collar professionals) owned or carried a cell phone (a manufactured absence that was necessary in order to create conflict and tension at several points during the story). And for what it's worth, I tend to doubt that Supreme Court clerks of this era would have been working on computers equipped with floppy disc drives.Despite the book's various problems, I still found myself engrossed by Ben's desperate race to unmask and implicate the outsider before the authorities caught wind of what was going on. While the ending was perhaps a bit anti-climatic (bad guys should be far more bad and interesting than the outsider ultimately turns out to be), it was still reasonably satisfying. Not great but not horrible either."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"The Tenth Justice is my first legal thriller, and I must confess that it was legally thrilling. Ok, bad joke, but I really did enjoy reading this book! The dialogue was completely realistic and humorous (if a bit mature) and the plot was uber mysterious. I stayed up late reading it! The twists and turns had me suspecting every one of the characters at some point. The characters themselves were so well developed it made reading a special treat. I didn't once think that Ben's, Nathan's, or any other character's reactions were fake, or questioned whether they would act a particular way. Even though it's a legal thriller, there wasn't a lot of confusing references to laws, and the cases were usually explained easily enough to understand. This coming from a girl who regularly confuses the democratic and republican parties, mind.My favorite character is Ober. He is the clown of the four close friends/roommates but he has a sensitive side. His quotes are the funniest, like when he was discussing the Batman Theory, which is basically his opinion that people's lives can be completely changed by one traumatic event. Think Catwoman, Joker, and other comic book characters. The lessons I learned from this book are 1) If you take an oath not to talk about something, don't talk about it! 2) Treat your friends with respect, you never know what favors you might need to call in. The negatives of this book are the language, sex and sex-related humor.I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars, and I can think of at least one person to recommend this book to."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"And now look where Brad's gone after the book. Instead of a movie deal he winds up with thought provoking \\"secrets\\" in the government. Way to go man! Easy read, fun to go through again, and I've caught parts of your evening investigative shows."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"There are more than 250 reviews ahead of mine so I will dispense with a plot summary. A large number of reviewers are more critical of the novel than I am, perhaps because they took it more seriously than I did. The plot isn't wholly plausible but it's entertaining. The characters don't always behave sensibly but they have sharply defined personalities and their interactions contribute to the story's melodrama (which isn't always a bad thing). Ben's scheme to redeem himself is clever, although the resolution of the novel's mystery (are his friends helping or betraying him?) feels contrived.I wanted to strangle most of the novel's characters (including, at times, all of Ben's roommates). And frankly I wanted to strangle Ben for his indiscretion and, more importantly, for his failure to fall on his sword as soon as he realized what he'd done. Still, I don't dislike a novel because of unlikable characters provided the plot carries me along and the characters are interesting. The novel works well enough on both fronts to earn my mild recommendation.The Tenth Justice delivers fast paced entertainment that isn't quite fast enough to speed past the plot holes. It also delivers a certain measure of fun. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Having read and enjoyed The Millionaires, I was looking forward to this one. The Millionaires plot concerned an intelligent guy, working in the American legal system, who gets suckered into making a wrong move, and spends the rest of the novel trying to extricate himself, with help from his brother and family. The Tenth Justice plot concerns an intelligent guy, working in the American legal system, who gets suckered into making a wrong move, and spends the rest of the novel trying to extricate himself, with help from his flatmates.I thought it was poorly constructed, and that it ran out of pace at the point where the central character decided to turn himself in. At this point, I was waiting for the Get Out of Jail Free card to be produced, but there wasn't one. In other words, he was no better off than he would have been had it done so from the word go; in fact he was worse off. Which left me feeling that he'd wasted not only his time, but mine also."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Meltzer's book is about the most juvenile, poorly written and plotted thriller I have ever read. The dialogue is stiff, the plot goes beyond suspension of disbelief, and the characters lack depth or even a hint of reality. If I could give it no stars I would. How this book got any raves boggles my mind. Other than the author's personal story of writing the book (being just out of law school, etc.), there is nothing about it that recommends it. It took me over four weeks to finish it because it was most definetely not a page-turner-- I could put it down and not care what was happening."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Nothing rings true about this book. The plot is based on a ridiculous pretense: a law clerk is suckered into breaking major securities laws by a con man who breaks even bigger securities laws. The clerk's only solution at this point is obvious: Keep his mouth shut -- THE CON MAN WON'T SAY A THING OR ELSE HE'LL GO TO JAIL FOR DECADES. Instead, the clerk mounts on a quest to find the con man. The pathetic excuse for plot is that once the con man is found, the clerk is now safe.It takes 348 pages for our legal geniuses to even get close to grasping the situation. Finally, his co-clerk points out that if they *do* manage to find the con man, they can't really do anything with him, or else the clerk goes to jail too. Well....DUH. That's obvious in the first 40 pages. But now it's too late, because the clerk and his Friends have completely antagonized the con man to the point that he HAS to react to them.As if the ridiculous excuse for a plot weren't enough, there are so many holes in the story it is insulting. For instance, the clerk rents out a PO Box in an assumed name. The con man rents another box in the same assumed name and sends the bill back to the clerk's parent's house. Hmmm. The clerks parents must by pyschic, because they tell him that he has a bill. In an assumed name? Give me a break!Then there's the supposition that all they have to do is get a picture of the con man and the computers in the State Department will certainly be able to &quot;ID&quot; him. Oh, right, the government has pictures of every person in the country in a datebase that can be searched like fingerprints. Not only is the technology not yet available, the database certainly isn't either.While I actually enjoyed the moronic banter between the characters (in a Beavis and Butthead kind of way), I definitely wonder if they could definitely work the word &quot;definitely&quot; into the dialog any more than they definitely did. Definitely...not."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"If the real Supreme Court, State Department, Washington newspapers, and Senators have employees like the characters in this book, it's a wonder the Republic has survived. The characters sound more like drunken Frat rats than elite government employees. (Altho Monica Lewinsky &amp; Linda Tripp give me second thoughts on that last comment, though they are hardly Supreme Court clerks).I notice that the &quot;average&quot; Amazon reader review is 3 stars, illustrating the problem with averages.In fact readers either give it 1-2 -- those who found it sophmoric, inaccurate, and poorly written; or 4-5 -- those who identified with the characters, accepted the description of Supreme Court workings at face value, and equate Friends scripts with good writing. Like Meltzer's other book, Dead Even, the characters are unsympathetic.The kernel of plotline is pretty interesting, so in the hands of a good filmmaker, with a good cast, it might work as a summer movie. Frankly I would have preferred to read the napkin where Meltzer jotted down the idea than read pages and pages of stupidity.Why, you ask, did I read TWO of his books if I disliked them so much? I was hospitalized unexpectedly and my friends, knowing I like legal thrillers, brought them as gifts."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"How worse can you get for a legal thriller without a single court-room scene? The plot was horrible, dialogue simple yet boring, characters and situations totally unbelieveable. Most rediculous of all are the &quot;reviews&quot; inside. This is a book that does not respect the readers at all."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"This is one of those books that gives hope to aspiring novelists. &quot;Man, if he can get this clumsy stuff published, why can't I?&quot; The dialogue does not even come close to matching the characters as Meltzer wants you to imagine them. On several occasions when the plot loses it way (which is often) I fully expected the roommates to break out in the &quot;Friends&quot; theme song. You have to wonder if a writer (or maybe we should just call him a &quot;typist&quot;) like Meltzer ever really met any &quot;normal&quot; people and/or actually listened to &quot;regular&quot; conversations. His writing certainly makes you wonder. The cute banter among the roomies really gets annoying ... like after the first 100 pages. This is a book that is really easy to put down ... I know this because I've done so frequently. As you read along you're reminded of the Peggy Lee song, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;"},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I should have known from the glowing quotes from People, but Supreme Court novels are always interesting. Except this one. I did read it to the end just to see if there was &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; at all in it to justify my $6, but there wasn't.The story idea has some merit, but once one gets past &quot;clerk for supreme court justice blackmailed for advance information on rulings&quot; there is simply nothing there. Except for some poorly written sex scenes, and endless and mindless &quot;roommate&quot; dialog undoubtedly inspired by, but nowhere near even the minimal standards of, Friends, all that is left is some &quot;inside&quot; information about the workings of the Supreme Court of the United States and some of that is wrong.Meltzer should write a book on how to make money by getting absolute drivel into print. That's about the only book with his name on it that I would buy, again."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Some of the reviews here have been a bit tough on Meltzer. Believe me - I've written my share of caustic reviews as well. Just read one of my reviews of James Patterson or Catherine Coulter, for example. But Patterson and Coulter have collectively written dozens of novels each. This was Meltzer's first. And he was only 26 when he wrote this, so cut him some slack. No, it wasn't a great book. Yes, the dialog tried too hard to be constantly clever and the characters came off being impossibly witty and intelligent.But it was still a fun read and a reasonably good story. It kept me turning the pages and deciding that Meltzer was worth another few books. And, it was head and shoulders above any of the thrillers I've read from James Patterson who, in my opinion, does much better in the YA (Young Adult) category with his \\"Maximum Ride\\" series than with any of the books he wants to be taken seriously as adult fiction.Ben Addison is an up-and-coming legal eagle who scores a job as a clerk for a US Supreme Court justice. He has the world by the tail and the recruiters are upping the ante to snag him at their firms once his one-year clerkship at the Supreme Court is up. When Ben is contacted by a former clerk and invited to lunch, he lets slip the pending decision in an upcoming case and suddenly finds himself the victim of an elaborate blackmail campaign. His roomates - his three best friends from high school - become part of the plot as well and before long Ben is unsure whether he can trust any of his friends or his Supreme Court co-clerk, Lisa Schulman. What starts out as an attempt to salvage Ben's career for violating the code of ethics becomes something much bigger with Ben's life, his friends' lives, and Lisa's life at stake.Were there implausibilities in this book? Sure. But like I said, Meltzer is just getting started with this book and I thought it was considerably better than those written by guys twice his age. And, consider that Grisham's first novel never got published until his later works, like \\"The Firm\\", had made him into a star. First efforts are sometimes just that. First efforts.I'm willing to give Meltzer a couple more chances as a result of this book and will pick up his newest book next. If that pans out and he's matured in his style, I'll go back and read the intervening books. He tells a fun cat-and-mouse type story here and I'm confident his style has matured. He seems to have the basic ingredients intact and he's clearly intelligent. Yes, the one reviewer in the \\"spotlight\\" section pointed out the implausibilities, but for the rest of us schmucks who aren't actual supreme court clerks, I doubt that the implausibilities at the legal level will be quite as problematic. That reviewer has a perspective that only 1 reader in a million will share. It was heartening that in spite of the implausibilities he (or she) found, it was still a gripping enough yarn to have him/her pour through it in two days. That should at least say something about the \\"thriller\\" aspect of the book.Also, relegating this to the YA category, as some reviewers have suggested, is unnecessarily harsh. Apparently, these individuals have never read truly bad thrillers. If they need something really dismal to calibrate their reviews against, I suggest they pick up any thriller by Catherine Coulter. It should quickly acclamate them to what a \\"zero stars, worse than juvenile\\" thriller reads like.Meltzer is well above that, and hence 3 stars."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"You'll spend the entire book wondering why &quot;He just doesn't....&quot; Of course if he had, all those trees wouldn't have died to make the pages of this atrocious effort."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I admit, the premise of this book got me. I read on. But at what price! Supposedly the protagonists are our best and brightest. Oh my God, shoot me now! I've never read such inane, adolescent dialogue. These guys are supposed to be brilliant fellows in their late 20s? Right. The sex stuff? Beyond ridiculous; shall we say fifth-grade level? The characters' interactions: When was the last time you saw men in their late 20s (4 roomates yet!) dancing around together with glee in the living room? It makes me sick that this author is no doubt rolling in dough by now. For all of his moralizing in the text, and his groveling credits at the end, we'll see if he has a conscience and the guts to resist pressure from publisher and agent and manages to produce a thoughtful, worthwhile legal thriller. If he does, I'll consider him a writer. Right now, he's just a huckster."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I gave this book a try on the strength of the number of Amazon reviewers who gave this book a 10. (I thought those who gave it a 1 were simply being pretentious). Boy was I wrong! This book proves that you don't have to be a writer to get a book published. It gives hope to all who would like to write a book but have no talent."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I can't believe that this book was published. The characters were not interesting. The plot was not original. The writing was juvenile. I just can't believe that a book of this caliber got published. I've read books that are hard to follow and didn't make a whole lot of sense, but I would read those books again before I read another book by this author."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I agree with all the negative reviews of this book; it is a very irritating book, for various reasons and on several levels. First, as many readers have noted, the dialogue and behavior of the main characters is sophomoric. One gets the impression that this is the way the author and his age coherts conversed and behaved when they were in law school, and Mr. Meltzer felt (for whatever reason) the general reading public would like to read about it. I don't think so. Second, where was the editing of this book? Mr. Meltzer is a fledging 'legal potboiler' author. Maybe he'll improve with age and experience. This book badly needed the experienced hand of an editor. Better yet, it never should have been published. Third, this book says a lot about the corruption of the 'book blurb' business. The inside pages of the paperback version of the 'Tenth Justice' were replete with accolades for this book, from 25 or so newspapers across the land. Is the caliber of newspaper book reviewing so execrable that these reviewers actually liked this book? Or were they paid to say something nice about the 'Tenth Justice'? Finally, it is not clear that the author (or his editors) even understands how the Supreme Court works. In several places in the book, Meltzer describes his protagonist clerks hammering out original opinions for the clerks' Supreme Court Justice. That ain't the way it works. Every case that lands at the United States Supreme Court (or at any appellate court, for that matter) is accompanied by the parties' extensive legal briefs (i.e., proposed court opinions) and legal briefs from dozens of 'friends of the court'. It is the clerk's job to wade through all this paper and 'cut &amp; paste' an opinion once the justice decides how he or she wants the case decided. To suggest that the clerks create Supreme Court opinions 'from scratch' is dishonest. In summary, a very irritating book."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"After all the hype, I bought this book expecting something as least as good as Grisham and hopefully better. What a letdown: cardboard characters, a tepid plot, wretched pacing and inane dialogue. Why it is getting a big push from the publisher is beyond me. I found it juvenile and boring."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"When I finished this book (and I am amazed that I did) - I came to the conclusion that it was written by a high school kid (or younger) - the content was extremely amateurish. Very disappointing book from this author and to compare him to the likes of John Grisham and Scott Turow is somewhat misleading. From the implausible storyline to the shallow and irritating characters - this book was simply too awful."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"More than anything, &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; reminds me of the adventures of Nancy Drew, which I used to read avidly but which I outgrew well before I reached the age of the author of this book. The intrepid hero/heroine, the group of &quot;chums&quot; who set about solving the mystery, their obstinate refusal to let the authorities handle it, the bad guy who seems to have nothing better to do with his time than devote it to tormenting them.... Like poor old Nancy, who was always getting conked on the head, Ben (the hero of &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot;) gets roughed up and even shot (don't worry, it's only a flesh wound). Unlike the Nancy Drew books, though, this book is so full of holes in plot, logic, and credibility that you could use it to strain spaghetti. It's hard to believe that an editor at a big-name publishing house could have gone through this manuscript without fixing the many lines of unbelievable dialogue, the awkward transitions, the heavy-handed dropping of hints and false clues that eventually leave the reader thinking &quot;Who cares?,&quot; not to mention the frequent occasions when legal jargon creeps into the mouths of the nonlawyer characters. A good editor should also have questioned this book's portrayal of what it's really like on the inside of the Supreme Court: do judicial clerks REALLY work in complete isolation and have complete privacy and autonomy as to their work schedules? Still, good editing wouldn't have solved this book's basic problem, which is that it is painfully shallow and immature. It reeks of wishful thinking on the part of an author who hasn't yet outgrown his juvenile ideas about what constitutes an exciting and glamorous life, and hasn't yet learned the difference between real life and Nancy Drew."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"I want to support new novelists. I live in Washington, D.C. and particularly love to read about my adopted and beloved city. I eagerly bought this highly praised first effort and settled down to be amused and dazzled.

I couldn't get past the first few chapters and skipped to the end just to learn what happened -- and found out, after reading it, that I didn't care.

Just how in the name of sweet Jesus do you know that us naysayers are jealous? How can you know that? Maybe we just thought that this was the most unpublishable piece of crap to come along since Absolute Power. I for one am stunned at just how bad Meltzer's book is. I didn't think there could be a lawyer book worse that Absolute Power, but I was certainly wrong.How about that cutesy-pooh little scene where we meet the cute, crazy, wacky, and funny gang?

It really is for the 20-Something generation. It's funny, a little devious, and a little informative.Unlike Grisham's novels, which are grey and brooding, Meltzer is lighter and more postive about the legal profession.A few of the scenes in the novel are reflective of some of my generation's relationships (I'm 27) and how some of us view life.There are a couple of spots where the novel goes overboard. The death of one of the roommates seems to be an &quot;easy&quot; way of elevating the novel's level of drama and moving towards a resolution. I honestly hope Mr. Meltzer avoids that tool in his next novel.I also had a little difficulty understanding Nathan's character change. If Nathan is the smartest one of the bunch, he scored 100 points higher than Ben on the SAT, why doesn't Nathan voice his resolution early in the conflict instead of after all the damage has been done.Regardless, I would still suggest this book for the summer. The glitches mentioned aren't noticeable until well after the novel is over. Purchase this Meltzer to escape, not for insights to the profession."},{"Title":"Tenth Justice, The Low Price","review":"Close to THE CLIENT in style and pacing, this is for Grisham fans.

Who knows, she could have been the antagonist for the sequel.Some reviewers have complained of the characters being immature. Well of course they are! We are all immature, especially when backed into a corner. In a less realistic story, the protagonist glides into being a hero, because he or she has got everything planned out-- as if someone had written the plot for him or her.

Mr. Meltzer did not let me down. As he has proved in all of his books, characterization is his strong point. While most authors of fast paced thrillers and the legal genre focus more on plots twists to engage us, Meltzer endeared me immediately to his characters. Ben, Nathan, Eric, and Ober could have been my friends or the group of guys living next door while I was in college. As was the case in Tenth Justice, I left this book caring about each of the characters and wondering what happened with them later in life.I was, however, a little disapointed in the ending. It seems to simply end, with no closure for any of these characters that I'd grown to love so much. I didn't expect a storybook ending, but felt a little dismayed at the outcome of my new friends.

Virtually all developed economies, including that of the United States fall into this category. Ikeda's work is within the Austrian tradition, which has held (following Ludwig von Mises) that mixed economies are unstable and internally contradictory. They must either cast off their regulatory shackles and return to a state of laissez faire, or complete the descent into totalitarian socialism. Ikeda develops the theory that each regulation, designed to address some mis-perceived occurrence of market failure, actually introduces new inefficencies into the market place. Regulatory intervention begets more intervention, the results of which are inevitably inferior (even in the view of the responsible policy makers) to the original situation. In this manner, Ikeda proposes that the bias of the mixed economy towards increasing socialism is the result of the law of unintended consequences, rather than, for instance, a rent-seeking dynamic.Ikeda applies his analysis to the minimal state. He defines the minimal state as the smallest, least intrusive state possible consistent with providing enough order and infrastructure to permit free markets to exist. It provides enough of a defense, police and legal system to protect private property, and only those public goods that are inherently impossible for free markets to provide. Ikeda finds the minimal state unstable. Given citizens's heterogeneous preferences for the services the state provides, it is not possible that each citizen's benefit from the existence of the state will perfectly match the cost they incur in taxes. The perceived difference will result in calls for adjustments by the state. Since the minimal state, by definition, can not shrink without collapsing, all adjustments must take place through expansion. This sets it on the path towards the interventionist state. Ikeda does suggest, however, that the ideology of the populace can potentially hold that drift in check.Ikeda attempts to rescue Mises from the paradox of interventionism. Mises argued that the interventionist state cannot persist. Following the dynamic developed further here by Ikeda, the interventionist state must collapse into complete socialism. This is contrary to what we observe around us, however. Most of the world's economies are interventionist, and have been so for an extended period. Rather than leading to inevitable collapse, it would appear that interventionism is remarkably stable. Ikeda has an explanation for this paradox. He describes the dynamic as a gradual descent into a more socialistic, and thus less efficient, condition, interrupted by occasional contractions of the sphere of interventionism. The destructive character of the interventions become so apparent in some area of the economy that deregulation becomes politically feasible. Since total deregulation of the economy does not occur, however, economic inefficiencies persist. New interventions are gradually reintroduced, once again choking the system. The progressive deterioration of the economy occurs with increasing socialism as Mises predicted, but the descent into complete market socialism on the Soviet model is checked by occasional partial deregulations. In this manner the interventionist state can persist indefinitely, rather than collapsing, as was predicted by Mises.Ikeda's methodolgy helps illuminate important questions. Can government shrink? Is a minimal, night watchman state a viable political order? This book is a worthwhile read for students of political economy who care about such things."},{"Title":"Dynamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of Interventionism","review":"Ludwig Von Mises said, in Human Action:\\"The interventionist interlude must come to an end because interventionism cannot lead to a permanent system of social organization.\\"Mises went on to explain why, and expected in the end for all mixed economies to end as pure socialism or return to a free (unhampered) market economy. The observed fact that we see instead mixed economies everywhere is called the \\"Miseian paradox\\" by the author of this text. This text, after supporting Mises and the Austrian school's critique of mixed economies, proceeds to explain the dynamics of such economies, and how instead of necessarily ending up at one extreme or another, real economies can be expected go through a series of crises (much as we are seeing now) that cause a continuous cycling between collectivism and free markets. This is a kind of dynamic stability.The text is interesting and illuminating. It does tend to drag on at times, but those parts that drag on for me may be fascinating for others. It doesn't offer any real hope for the world, except that if there was an exogenous shift in ideology toward free markets, we might then be able to maintain stability in the minimal state. Otherwise, we are stuck with what we got. Sad, but the arguments ring true."},{"Title":"Dynamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of Interventionism","review":"After reading a chunk, I find this book right up my alley- it addresses and expands upon work that Mises started.

He goes on to map out the evolution of Gregorian chant in depth, from its beginnings in Roman Catholic liturgy to its termination as part of everyday worship at Vatican II. If it is this kind of extensive historical treatment you seek, then buy this book.However, be forewarned: if all you want is a better understanding and appreciation of plainchant purely through a knowledge of its mechanics (classification of different types of chant, melodic contour, texts used, etc.) you might come away unfulfilled, if not overloaded. Some time is indeed spent on this, but the focus is mainly a historical one.Mr. Crocker does speak eloquently, at times almost philosophically. Thanks to this, you not only gain a thorough understanding of where chant \\"came from,\\" but you walk away from the choir and out of the cathedral with a profound sense of affinity for this old and venerable sound.You also leave with a strangely immediate awareness of your European roots.Then again, such is the power of Gregorian chant; that it in some way, somehow, seems \\"familiar\\" to us, like something we once knew well but had forgotten. Mr. Crocker delves into this phenomenon, and tries to help us understand why this is -- an account which I personally found fascinating.The compact disc is unspectacular in itself but a perfect learning companion to the book. No technical knowledge of music is assumed. Whether you buy this book now or later, it is an indispensable addition to any collection of tomes on plainsong, whether you be an enthusiastic novice or a weathered scholar."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Gregorian Chant","review":"\\"There is no assumption of a technical understanding of music. ............, Crocker's aim is merely to promote greater knowledge and enjoyment of Gregorian chant\\".This is the end-part of Product Description from Editorial Reviews.Generally, it must be true and enough for this book. But, I am not satisfying. The reason of what I am not satisfying is caused by Mr Crocker's singing (CDs).In fact, his singing is utterly tedious monologue. Moreover, his singing is just like a light-headed-humming-song which is sung in a bathroom. Neither piety nor dignity is there, though true Gregorian chant has an essence of Faith and Art.Such as Crocker's Gregorian singing is allowed for when there is only one person, just as for his own himself. Absolutely, we cannot to sing it with all together in his style. Clearly saying, it should never be performed at the public places anywhere.I know his valuable works. (e.g. for the splendid Chanticleer's CD liner-note, etc.) But I do not want to listen to his singing again. I do want to imagine the pure singing by monks at St. Gall in the Middle Ages.Perhaps this book has shown anew to us that the faith exists only in the individual person."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Supernatural","review":"Once again, Joe Nickel, with John F. Fischer, shows that he is a researcher and investigator with few peers. He has tackled several &quot;unexplained&quot; mysteries, and explained them.Using available-- if not common-- historical records, as well as first-hand investigations where possible, Nickel has managed to explain such mysteries as the Crystal Skull, the &quot;moving&quot; coffins of the Barbados Vault, and specific cases of Spontaneous Human Combustion. These are just three examples of some of the cases investigated and fully explained within the pages of this book.This book is a must for those who are truly interested in learning about the world's mysteries, rather than blindly believing the claims of credulous writers who simply wish to sell books to... well, credulous readers."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Supernatural","review":"Joe Nickell shows that he is neither a fanatical skeptic nor a quack paranormal investigator in this sometimes humorous look at the occult mysteries.

If people state the supernatural is visible physically, then science and forensics should be able to prove these claims. If not then these claims are a hoax. Mr. Nickell does an excellent job of pointing out these hoaxes. All in all this book is a must for true paranormal investigators who prefer to apply science and common sense to claims, instead of unproven flim flam like psychic abilities in their research.

The selection was a search to find poems of suitable length for and worthy of memorization. So the term \\"by heart\\" functions both in the sense of knowing by memory and feeling something deeply. Anyway, you will find many poems you will want to know by heart: \\"Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone\\", \\"There's a certain Slant of light\\", \\"Fear no more the heat o' the Sun\\" for example, excellent works. Lots of Shakespeare and Yeats, Blake and Dickinson. He has also included Hamlet's \\"To be...\\" and Macbeth's \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow...\\"Now that the internet has replaced individual mental retention, I suppose this book seems anachronistic, which is too bad. The great English poems are among the few mental constructs will have seemed worth preserving in the future. Furthermore, the capability to remember something exactly is a real gift. Memorization is a mental capacity that is being lost, so too the ability to contemplate. The slowing down to contemplate a subject, which poetry invites us to do, is important if there is ever to be an American civilization. Life without it is quite stupid, not to say exhausting.Having done this for a while, i.e. memorize poems I love, I can testify to the worthiness of it, not for recitation purposes (no one wants to listen), but because it's a way to knowing the work and the poet more intimately and because it becomes part of you. You finally have something good up there.It's probably good for the brain as well: poor, distracted thing.Hughes provides hints on memorization in the introduction, which is somewhat useful, but you have to find your own method, make your own memory palace.

It is of course hard to claim that Light is a culturally-constructed image. Yet this book disappoints thoroughly as no real allowances are made for the differing approaches of the likes of medieval Byzantine Hesychasts, medieval Kabbalists, the Iranian Illuminationists etc. and the far more developed philosophy of Luminous Consciousness of the tantric, nondual Kashmiri Saivite Abhinavagupta. Paul Mueller-Ortega points out that the latter, living around 900-1000 CE, could draw upon the vast resources of the Indian yogic traditions in this regard. The fact that Suhrawardi (killed by Saladin), Kabbalists and Hesychast mystics are operating in cultures where persecution and adherence to Biblical orthodoxy plays a major role in colouring perceptions and interpretations(constructivism of course is correct to some extent)is ignored in accounting for the differences between traditions!Kapstein in his concluding chapter keeps reassuring readers that he will not pull the perennialist rabbit out of the hat. However, his personal views against the perennialist arguments of an Innate Capacity etc. are unconvincing. The reader interested in the perennialist versus constructivist debate would do well to read the two collections edited by Robert Forman, The Innate Capacity (which clearly shows that philosophical mystics themselves argue that the deepest mystical core experience of the nondual Light of Pure Consciousness involves an innate capacity of the processes of Consciousness itself which goes beyond their own culturally indoctrinated conceptions and perceptions) and the earlier The Problem of Pure Consciousness (both by Oxford UP). Forman argues for a Perennial Psychology based on the deep structure of our consciousness.Coming to this argument from a scientific perspective, I would add that religious studies will never be able to resolve these debates as no discussion of the scientific basis of of mind and consciousness is involved. The whole constructivist argument is transcended by the identification of the Divine Light of Pure Consciousness with the activating brainwaves of the brainstem Reticular Activating System which is common to all humans. This is the basis of the medical distinction between Arousal (based on the RAS and the contents of attentions which are supplied by the cortex and subcortical regions. As in Near-Death Experiences a mystic can deactivate the brain and uncover the deeper activity of the RAS brainwaves which are always present beneath other brain activity. This uncovering of the everpresent Light of Consciousness clouded over by mental activity is what the great philosophical mystics all claim. As Bailey says in Bailey and Yates (ed.) The Near Death Experience (Routledge), the purpose of philosophy for Plato was to unforget that primal vision of pure, powerful Light.Numerous other pieces of authoritative yogic knowledge fit perfectly this RAS interpretation (see my The Oneness/Otherness Mystery: The Synthesis of Science and Mysticism; Motilal Banarsidass, 1999) and for further support the Dalai Lama's comments on the Clear Light of Death in Allan Wallace (ed.) Buddhism and Science being a continuous series of moments (the RAs Brainwaves are everpresent, only stopping at death) and Travis' model of Pure Consciousness as a background State in the Dalai Lama and Varela's Sleeping, Dreaming and Dying. The link between enlightenment and death has been known for thousands of years with Indian Buddhism acknowledging that Nirvana is only slightly different from death, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the lack of heartbeat detection in Ramakrishna in deep samadhi etc."},{"Title":"Seven footprints to Satan and Burn, witch, burn!","review":"A.

While some of this may have been due to being paid \\"by the word\\", the results were gratifying to the reader.This particular story is not a typical fantasy.

The police smell whisky and think he was joyriding, but at least one colleague at Daniel Kearny Associates (DKA) isn't buying and sets out to figure out what really happened, with a 72-hour time limit imposed by his apparently-unsympathetic boss.This is the first book in Joe Gores' DKA series, and the second I've read after \\"32 Cadillacs,\\" which others rave about being the cream of the series but which left me a bit flat. This one, however, is really good, and I found myself warming to it despite a slow start and my low expectations.The feeling of the book is dog-eared and desperate. After a few pages of setting the scene, an already-tired Larry Ballard sets about trying to unravel the mystery of who clocked his partner by checking up every one of the last few cases on his partner's file. This is when the story begins to take off, not so much in terms of plot (it takes a while for Ballard to narrow down the list, and longer still to figure out why the final suspect might have done it) but in terms of giving the reader a sense of what the life of a repo man is all about.Ballard meets up with all kinds of people, lawabiding and otherwise, like the 30-something woman who left her husband to shack up with a teenaged boy, the movers who loll around their office drunk as skunks on a weekday morning, and the rock musician who plays at a club called \\"Freaks.\\" It's set in San Francisco in the early 70s (Gores wrote the book in 1972) and you get a real sense of what the city was turning into in the decade and a half since \\"Vertigo.\\"I didn't mind the long time it took for Ballard to get to the bottom of things. I was enjoying the ride. Gores gives you just enough story with each person to give you a sense of life's richness and cruelties, then moves on to the next one as Ballard keeps on the clock.Gores is not only sharp and deft at building a multi-faceted plot, he is really funny. \\"Why do those middle-aged swingers, when they start swinging, always buy a T-Bird?\\" one guy asks Ballard. Another woman old enough to be his grandmother loses her matronly reserve when asked about a bail skipper: \\"She made a two-word comment about Griffin and his mother that was probably more ritual than fact...\\" I was still laughing at that one a dozen pages later.Gores's dialogue, pacing, and rich sense of character really put him in league with other great modern-day mystery writers like Elmore Leonard and Ed McBain who typically give you a lot more to chew over than a dead body. \\"Dead Skip\\" would be worthwhile reading even if it didn't lead to a series of other books. The best part is there's more of them still ahead for me."},{"Title":"Dead Skip","review":"Barton Heslip has had a good day, repossessing three cars for his employer, DKA. Back at the office, he calls his friend and co-worker Larry Ballard, then steps outside to collect some paperwork from his car. Someone emerges from the shadows and hits him with a sap. Now Heslip is in a coma, having been pulled from a car that went over a cliff, and Dan Kearny, founder of DKA, has given Ballard 72 hours to find the man who tried to kill Heslip. As time begins to run out, Kearny joins the hunt.Dead Skip is a fast-paced, carefully plotted detective story. Joe Gores has a sharp eye for the people who walk San Francisco's streets and a finely tuned ear for dialog. He writes with an economical style, providing just enough detail to give personality to his characters and authenticity to his settings. The mystery of Heslip's assailant isn't easy to guess but the resolution is credible. The process of detection, as practiced by Ballard and then by Kearny, is fascinating.

I need the occassional escape book that is nothing but fun to read, no deep plots or twists and turns, just brain jelly for the day. This book by Pat Cadigan seems to have been written directly off the movie. A few descrepencies but it is all there in print for you. The author then adds to it by developing backgrounds on Brodski and his grunts as well as Rowan and explains just why the heck there are teenagers running around in a spaceship. She also gives some reasoning to Jason's very limited thought processes which are enough to make sense without going overboard, I mean the guy is a walking slashing zombie killing machine now so how much can be going through his brain.By no means is this the Great American Novel, it's not even the Good American Novel, but it is an entertaining read for those who are fans of the series. Those who aren't fans, just watch the movie, you'll get the same thing out of it in 1/4 of the time. It's an 80 minute movie versus an 8 hour read.

(One of my favorite experiences in life: finding unexpected treasures.) Anyway, I picked it up, skimmed a few pages, and was hooked. I plunked down my money and started reading it the second I got home. It was great! Ms. Cadigan is a great writer. It takes a good storyteller to turn a 93-minute movie into a 400-page book.One thing I like about books based on movies: they have more time to go into more detail about the events and characters in them. I could tell from the movie that Professor Lowe was a moneygrubbing moron, but the book really fleshed out his motives and gave me a better understanding of his character. And Tsunaron and Janessa? It surprised me to learn that those two had more than two biological parents apiece. It boggles my mind to think we might actually be that clever someday.I especially appreciated the insight into Brodski's past: joining the military when he was eight years old(!) with the absolute certainty that it was the best choice for him, the last time he saw his great-aunt, the loyalty he inspired in his troops. And he and Rowan stood a good chance of hooking up before Jason finally caught up to them. Oh, well......And this book offered a compelling reason for why Jason is so hard to kill: He's the embodiment of a force that exists simply to kill, to wipe out all life wherever he finds it. As long as there's life of any kind in the universe, Jason will never die.This is a good story and a wonderful companion piece to the movie. I know I like them both, and I know that a lot of others will too.

Sure, that gem is rough cubic zirconium compared to the diamond that is the original Friday the 13th, but it is still a good way to kill about 90 minutes. Its one of my favorite horror films, and when I heard there were books based on it, I immediately rushed out to find them.Six years later, I finally find the first three books in the series. I started, obviously, with book number one, the film's novelization. Anyone who has seen the film knows what to expect: the terrifying mass murder Jason Voorhees is put into cryogenic suspension (read: frozen in a big block of ice) in the early years of the 21st century, but not before taking one last victim, Rowan LaFontaine.In the 400 years since then, Earth became uninhabitable and humans sought refuge on another planet. But Earth 1 was now an archeological marvel, which is why Professor Lowe drags his class of students to the planets surface in search of artifacts. They find two: the ice-preserved bodies of Rowan and Jason.When they return to their spaceship, the Grendal, Rowan is revived by futuristic technology, but not Jason: he wakes up on his own and begins stalking through the ship, snuffing out any and all life he comes across.The author, Pat Cadigan, does a noteworthy job adding depth to all the characters, the highlight possibly being the relationship between the android Kay-Em and her owner/creator Tsunaron, which was touched on briefly in the film, but explored in incredible detail here.Moments like thay elevate the story, but what goes up must come down: Cadigan tried to get a good grip on the Jason character by say ing he is, \\"anti-life.\\" But it seems that she winds up calling him anti-life more than his real name. Also, while Cadigan does some excellent detail here, it seems that she wasn't using it in all the right places. There are moments that were easily the highlights of the film that are dismissed in a few sentences or removed entirely (\\"I think we need to reboot,\\" is counted among them).But overall, the book is fun and definitely enjoyable if you look at it as the sci-fi title it is, not the horror you have come to expect from the Friday the 13th name brand."},{"Title":"Jason X","review":"Hay but what can u expect. It's Jason, u blow off his head (this happens in the book) and he's still not dead. The deaths were very original however.Like one girl gets sucked out of the spaceship when jason rips the wall open. If u saw the movie read it it'll explain some stuff that u were confused about (take the girl getting ripped out of the spaceship). Its a quick read but don't be ready to be impressed.Its just another old slasher flick. What u get is sex, stupid people, and gore."},{"Title":"Jason X","review":"I thought the book was good, but not as good as Jason X. The book dragged too much half way through it. I thought all the best parts were at the beginning when Jason was discovered in the lake then the book went down hill until the last three chapters. I hope the other Jason X novels and the Friday the 13th novels will be a lot better then this one. If I was a Jason fan I would skip this one. I was more SFI then Horror."},{"Title":"Invitation to Go (Vol i)","review":"I am a begining Go player and have just finished this book. The first 30 or so pages comprise a solid introduction to the basics, but after that the book gets vague and difficult to follow. The directions for some of the practice problems were confusing.I understand that it is hard to write a slim volume on such a complex game, but I think some important intermediate steps were left out before the book started on more advanced material.It's cheap price makes it worth picking up if you aren't sure whether or not you will get into the game enough to make buying a more expensive book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Invitation to Go (Vol i)","review":"While they are many excellent and more expensive Go books for beginnes on the market now, this one is the best at the price of only $5. If a new player is serious about learning the game, they can buy all 5 volumes of Janice Kim's series, Learn to Play Go. The single volume introduction, Go: More Than A Game, is another good choice for new players. That book includes more background and history of this 4,000 year old board game than any other book suitable for a beginner. So the choice is just a matter of determining one's level of interest in the game, and how much you care to spend on a go book. If you become a regular Go player, you can always give the Fairbairn book to a friend you want to bring to the game, or sell it to another beginner. If you play the Bookcrossing game, you can \\"release it the wild\\", as they say in that fun, booklover's treasure hunt activity.
