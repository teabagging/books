Now that I finally have the book in my possession, I can say that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Cronenberg on Cronenberg and Tim Lucas's Videodrome retrospective.Original review:Why does this title continue and and continue to be pushed back? This book was originally to be published in the fall of 2003, but was delayed multiple times in roughly three month intervals. Each time the newly posted release date was reached, a new delay of roughly three months was issued. I'm skeptical that this book has been published even today. \\"Usually ships in one to three months\\"? That's ridiculous."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"If you read a lot of self improvement books and find the same information presented again and again, try Robert Anthony's material. All the newer \\"gurus\\" like Tony Robbins and Joe Vitale blatantly took Robert Anthony's material and re-wrote it. Badly.There may be typos in this particular book, but it's straightforward, easy to read, and is well-written (unlike most of the more modern hype).My daughter is a thirty-eight year old going for her PhD in Psych. She reads everything she can get her hands on regarding self help, self improvement, etc., and she's been complaining that everything is beginning to sound alike. I gave her a copy of Beyond Positive Thinking, and she loved it.Buy this book. Enough said."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"*Post review EDIT* The Title 'Beyond positive thinking' is explained in the book to mean something along these lines: The idea of thinking positive is flawed in a very fundamental way. Many times when we are confronted with a situation in our lives that cause us pain, we are encouraged to think positive about some aspect of that situation so that we can find some peace about it. But finding the positive in a painful situation doesnt help us to solve the underlying problem that caused us the pain, it just gives us a coping mechanism. The concept of going 'Beyond Positive Thinking' teaches you to see the situation for what is really happening and then discovering the root of what is causing the pain so that we can then focus on the solution to that problem that is causing the pain. The way that this book teaches you how to do that is described below in my origional post *End EDIT*I have been reading and skimming success books for some time now, I am fairly young, but the subject of perceiving reality as it truly is really interests me. One of my goals is to become a master of my thoughts and emotions. This book is really helpful if you are interested in finding the truth in any situation in your life.Many times in people relationships there are many different perspectives... what this book teaches is how to get to the truth of the situation by seeing around the perspectives we place on situations in our lives. The focus on the book is to get you to understand that we all have our own way of interpreting reality, but our interpretations are filtered through our accumulated experiences and therefore are not processed by the mind as they really are, but as we perceive them to be. If we can become aware of our environment in a present moment awareness and a willingness to not judge positive or negative of any situation, then we are more apt to see things as they truly are and we will then understand the truth of the moment and then have the ability to respond accordingly to it. Basically it replaces the idea of thinking positive or negative with the concept of 'Right thinking' and 'Wrong thinking.Also this book teaches you not to judge yourself or anyone else for that matter. It teaches you to replace your judgements of yourself with 'observation of yourself'. In other words, if we will just watch how we act in certain situations, we can learn so much about the way we think. If you feel yourself getting anxious in a certain situation, dont panic about it, Calmly watch the situation unfold and do not judge yourself over it. Allow yourself to be anxious and see yourself as you go through it. Then learn from it! That is what it is all about....Like I said, the book is Deep, but it is written in a very Simple format and the ideas here will strike you with stunning clarity. There is no hype in this book; just plain speech.If you are looking for a book that teaches the fundamentals of the human mind and how to overcome fear and all other human folly, then I would sincerely recommend you buy this book then read it twice!"},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"I truly believe that every person can learn a great deal about themselves by reading and implementing the recommendations in this book. I would reiterate what many of the other reviewers mentioned here. Take more control of your life and put it on a better track to not only achieve your goals but interact with the world.That said I would like to say to the author that this is absolutely the worst edited book I have ever read. There are so many examples of a \\"the\\" that should be \\"he\\" or and \\"of\\" that is in a sentence that shouldn't be there, or similar grammatical mistakes. Interestingly these are not errors that would be picked up by a spell checker in a word processor.Despite that, the book can truly change our life.

Positive thinking, says Dr. Anthony, doesn't work. How true that is. How often has it been recommended and tried. Dr. Anthony has a new approach that actually works, is very simple, but requires constant monitoring of your moods and self-talk. It's simple, but requires vigilence and practice. It works. Ask my formerly depressed husband who's life has turned around. He'll tell you. We first read this as an e-book several weeks ago, then ordered copies to give as Christmas presents.

I wish I had bought it earlier to begin applying the principles into my life. Folks, this may be the best book on this subject i have ever read, it certianaly is in the top five and I would suggest everyone I know to read this book.Why? Becuase, Dr Anthony has provided the clearest explanation of why we have what we currently have and the best explenation I have ever read to how to get to where you want to go and to get what you want to get.I now for the first time truly inderstand that life is lived from the inside out and that when it comes to getting what I want in life it is not a matter of \\"I believe it when I see it\\" but rather a matter of \\"I will see it when I believe it\\".We truly do live the lives that we have brought on ourselves and when we change how we see wealth, health and happinesss and begin to see that we can have and deserve wealth , health and happiness than it will come to us.As a Christian I endorse this book, even though it isn't a \\"Christian Book\\" becuase I believe that the laws mentioned in this book were placed on this planet by God and are indeed the laws and concepts behind Faith and having Faith that are mentioned in the Bible, I also believe that the law of attraction is the mechinism behind Jesus saying that if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can move that Mountian.Do yourself a HUGE favor and get this book or the CD series offered on DR.

It will appeal to people who want to know more and who want to understand why.An example: \\"Anytime your mind is out of the present moment you cannot receive the answer you need from Higher Intelligence.\\" This makes sense to me, and helps me to understand why I would want to stay present and mindful, although I'd never thought of it this way. Another example: exploring the Law of Circulation (with respect to money), which is one reason money is called \\"currency\\"---as an \\"idea in action\\" it will flow one way or another, either flowing with life (which is what you want) or with unexpected expenses (which is what you don't want) when there is a blockage.This book is recommended and promoted by Joe Vitale, a popular speaker and author of LOA materials. He calls it the one book he would have on the LOA above all others.The flaws: Some recycled information (for the advanced student), poor editing, light self-promotion. The flaws are very minor compared to the great value of the information.If you are not an advanced student of the LOA, I would recommend Michael Losier's \\"The Law of Attraction\\" instead of this book.It is a book I will read again and again. Highly recommended.*****"},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"I can not belive that what this book has to say it has made a very big impact on my life.

I have numerous friends that have also read it and are enjoying the benefits. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme or book.

One commentor hit it on the nose when they said that most people jump from book to book. I personally beleive there are many great books out there with the same theme but very few people pick one book and actually stick with that book and make a real committment to applying the concepts of that one book. The concepts in this book are timeless and are very simple to understand but if you are not able to make a no nonsense committment to applying what you read its just another book and all you will be doing is going from book to book and wondering why you're not getting any results. Pick a good book and stick with it. This is a very good book. Easy to read with lots of good sound wisdom. As to those comments about the gramatical errors in the book, yes I've seen them too but to me thats like majoring in the minors. Choose to focus on what counts and there is so much in this book thats counts."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"Since 2006 I have been a self-help new-thought reader. I have read countless books, taken numerous (expensive) courses, all which were great in their own way. There are gold nuggets in all of these and I remain eternally grateful to the authors of these books and programs. Still, after reading and listening to over 100 books/courses I still seemed a bit hazy in my understanding of the very basics of this new mind technology. What was I missing? If you're anything like me - you know exactly where I'm coming from. You too are probably searching for the very basics upon which all other books/courses are based.While Dr. Anthony is not the first to teach this \\"secret\\" information, he definitely has devoted his life in explaining it via a more personal one-on-one approach. He does not raise himself to a level above humanity nor does he compete with others teaching this same information - many which seemingly have lifted the information from Dr. Anthony's teachings. Dr. Anthony lays the information before the reader in a very plain easy-to-read style that makes absolute sense. For the first time I have found the answer(s) I have been seeking for. All in one book.Yes, this book is the culmination of all other books/courses. In fact, I would say that this one book is all that is needed by the self-help new-thought reader. If what is written within is practiced - you will see results. Guaranteed. I know I have.One comment mentioned the several misspellings and wrong words throughout the text. This is true - they do exist and sometimes can make for a difficult read. But don't let that distract you from reading this book. You won't regret it.Thank you Dr. Anthony for re-releasing this information to the world."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"This is a great book for anyone looking for improvements in their lives.

This book really spoke to me in a way other personal development books have not. It taught me that most people are prisoners of their mind - which is attempting to control the present through the past and future. Also, it notes how so many people are toxically unhappy - I've especially noticed this in my life with people who seem to not know what they are really interested in. He talks about how people who are unhappy compensate by buying a lot of unnecessary things and therefore trapping themselves into doing more work they do not like on that treadmill, producing more unhappiness. Overall I found this guy's perspectives far more integrated than that of anyone else. He also offers a section on how to find out what you like with a series questions like... \\"what subjects do you most enjoy discussing with friends?\\" etc. to figure this out as it is key.More Quotes from the Book\\"It is wrong to ask for love, security, or anything else because these things are separate from our own true nature.\\"\\"The mind becomes panicky when it meets a problem it cannot solve - so it turns to\\"...false solutions that create another problem.\\"When you learn to love yourself, you won't need to seek love from others.\\"Overall Dr. Robert Anthony provides uncommon wisdom in this book that probably contains more integrated, valid knowledge than any other 50 self help books combined."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"Had this book recommended to me by a millionaire businessman as the greatest book on self improvement.

In 1973 it was created as a series of audio cassettes; in 1988 turned into a book and in 2004 rewritten with the original title restored, a good title. (Anthony's publishers have foisted a couple of dumb titles on his books.) In my view this book is golden, the Mt. Everest of self-help books. Don't be fooled by its briefness because Anthony makes every sentence count and there is more than 30 years of experience behind it, which gives it clarity. True, some people have sniffed out the spirituality grounding this book and reacted like Dracula to the cross. The fundamentalists also, the \\"if Adam and Eve were not real people then the whole Bible is a lie\\" type of thinkers, won't like it. But that's their loss. The spirituality gives the book depth, power and roots which all the \\"no sweat, get rich quick\\" books lack. There is just one problem. Most people will read this book and go on to the next self-help, success book. But those who read it again and again and diligently, patiently, put its teaching into practice may find a miracle in their life. (I regret that Anthony keeps such a low profile and his life very private, since you always want to know an author you admire. Still, its the message that counts, not the credentials.

And the author says it goes \`Beyond Positive Thinking'. However, let's face it. This is the same stuff you've seen before. Note: this book was first published in 1988 under the title: \\"The Advanced Formula for Total Success\\" And it embraces the same positive visualization technique you've tried before. If someone sees something revolutionary in the book I've missed, please post that.One thing the book emphasizes is aligning a person with the universe so that they become naturally attracted towards the things they want. I've never found this to be a problem. I want the things I want. I don't always get the things I want, but I still want them. My desires remain oriented towards what I want.Here's the thing I wish the book included. I was hoping the book allowed the individual to evaluate the things he/she wants. That is, I was waiting for a measure by which to determine what desires to pursue and which to turn away from. There's no distinction made between good and bad emotions, desires, and wants. I'm not suggesting all desires should be suppressed, but I'm suggesting it's important to differentiate between the good and the bad.In short, this book is 80's California-based self help material.

So you can limit the good in your life by harboring limiting beliefs. You must change your thoughts, in order to change your life. He emphasizes that we are responsible for everything that happens in our lives. In other words, we create our own reality.He also explains that who you are and what you do are not the same.

The day I knew for sure that this dream of mine was a reality, I began that old behavior & process of invoking \\"fear, doubt, & disbelief\\" into my (already assured [it was assured, I had made sure of that for months])success.In order to remedy my MENTAL back-stabbing, I came onto Amazon and purchased some books. (I've read \\"self-help\\" books my entire adult life, and my MBA is doused with NLP as well as applied sales so I know how PMA works.)At any rate, I needed some support, well; let me tell you this tiny, itty-bitty book was like a bucket of cold water on a steamy lazy day in August. Wow!It's length speaks volumes as to its efficient manner, as well as the direct (nearly obvious) answers it provides.I personally chose 4 other books later to help with the lessons this great book initiated (but by all means this book is a stand alone pillar of actionable knowledge) they are: Master Key workbook, What to say when you talk to yourself, Taming your Gremlin and The Winner's Bible.I am certain that by simply reading \\"Beyond Positive Thinking\\", you will do well, but if you follow-up with these other fine titles your Self-Esteem, Self-Confidence, and Self-Awareness will reach such new (or reinforced) heights that you will ACT in success. That is the ticket...when you catch yourself in the \\"act\\" (whether positive or negative)you must be able and skilled enough to know what & how to react to your TRUE wants and desires. If you are (no other books I had read: EVER told me this) than you must also know what to say to yourself, know yourself, talk to yourself correctly, encourage yourself (no one else ever will), but know how and why you're doing so."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"It is one of the best book I have.

Whatever you do, read this book it will change your life for the better!"},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"This book explains setting an intention, how we create our own reality, and most of all, how our beliefs basically make us who we are and determine our lives. If you change your beliefs, you can change your life. Tons of other self help authors have preached the same ideas, but they don't always explain very well how to change your beliefs.The only thing I didn't really like was that the author said to spend 15 minutes relaxing every day and reciting the script thing, but didn't explain whether we are also supposed to repeating our intentions, visualizing, etc as he explained, on top of the 15 minutes of relaxation. So all together this would probably take at least half an hour. For some of us who are very busy or can't set aside time like that, this is going to be difficult to do. It would have been helpful for him to explain other ways we could change our beliefs.As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is FULL of errors and typos. Honestly they are so bad that they can't even be classified as \\"typos,\\" they are not just misspellings, they are downright nonsensical errors. Sometimes you will be reading and you will have to try to guess what the sentence was supposed to say. I have trouble understanding how this book could have ever been published with so many errors.

I confess that I would have never picked it up based on the title or the back cover, but this mentor had already helped me to improve my thinking enough that I felt compelled and even excited about reading it. It did not disappoint. What was most surprising was how much the material was in alignment with my current belief system. OK, that is not completely accurate - it showed me things that I should be doing \\"mentally\\" from my own belief system that I had failed to do. I simply was not connecting with all the Truths in my current belief system, and Dr. Anthony's approach to teaching how to get the results we want opened my eyes to ways that I was defeating myself with my attitudes and thinking. I am now reprogramming myself daily in healthy ways, and I feel more aligned than ever with my belief system while being more critical of those that are possibly teaching their own thing rather than the Truth. However, the proof of this is not because I say it. It rests in the fact that you can see the reality of what Dr. Anthony is saying in successful people. In short, there are many highly intelligent people that never become very successful, because they think (program themselves) poorly. There are people of average or maybe even below average intelligence that think (program themselves) very well. I am definitely more on the better thinking (self programming) path now. Thanks Dr. Anthony."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"I'm usually not into books on the Law of Attraction. I found \\"The Secret\\" kind of hokey, and the metaphysical explanation of how it worked, I think took away from the basic message of the film.However, I found Robert Anthony's explanation of the LOA very practical. He does veer into metaphysical-sounding language at times, but Beyond Positive Thinking is by far the best description of the whole \\"like attracts like\\" principle that I've heard. In the book, he also covers:*The \\"glitch\\" that keeps most people from attracting success into their lives, and even causes them to sabotage themselves, and what you can do to fix the glitch in yourself.*How to identify and clear out negative beliefs about money and financial success.*How to set \\"goal intentions\\", as well as affirmations and visualizations to move you in the direction of the things you want in life.It's a short read, but Dr. Anthony manages to cover a LOT of stuff in here.

Some chapters alone are worth the price of the book (probably more). Dr. Anthony's explanation of how we are perfect just as we are, and why what we have and do are separate from who we are, is an essential truth for peace of mind and successful living. His mantra of questioning old beliefs and replacing them with new, empowering ones is indispensable. For example, most of us believe that success takes hard work. If that's what we believe, then that's how it will be. What if we believed the opposite? i.e. success is relatively easy. A lot of Dr. Anthony's teachings resonate or are similar to those expounded by others, but he has a way of getting to the core that others don't.

You can see the same idea on Clason's Richest Man In Babylon book too.Carefully read and analyze if you really MUST have to read this book.

I wish I had known."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"To help you steer clear of letting the authors get their hands into your purse, here are some facts about this awful book:\\"If you are standing in the shade, it seems like the sun isn't shining on you.\\"What?:1. IT \\"SEEMS\\" like it isn't? Since when can a person not tell if they are under the shade with some sunlight shining on them?2. Who in the world doesn't think the sun is shining on them when they are under the shade? Everyone knows the sunlight around you is reflecting off the ground back onto you or that some gets through the cracks or leaves of or holes of whatever it is you are under.\\"But who moved you into the shade? Who moved you into the darkness?\\"The author is symbolizing the shade and darkness as evil. Okay, but his analogy between shade and darkness makes no sense, and he is wrong to make it seem as if you are in a bad situation merely because of whatever it is you've done. Example: Being raised wrong, being poorly educated or miseducated, if you were minding your own business or doing good even, and then you were raped, molested, tortured, wrongly imprisoned, or abused. Yes, \\"Doctors\\" (and wannabe sages), not everything is everyone's fault. It's bizarre to say that raping a woman is like being in the shade.\\"The truth is we are in the darkness because of our ignorance.\\"If that statement were in the Bible it would make sense, however in this book, it's hardly helpful for the reasons I listed above.This book is also anti-Christian as it virtually says that we are God:\\"Your Word is LawWhat we are saying is that your word is the law in the universe.\\"1. So much for God's commandments.2. What if someone says we should rape kids and another says we shouldn't, which law should be obeyed? The authors then say,\\"But you need to know these laws, without an understanding of the laws, through ignorance, you create what you want.\\"1. Why do the authors refer to your laws as \\"these laws\\"? Confusing grammar eh?2. LOL! WE CREATE LAWS THROUGH IGNORANCE? What does creating what you want have to do with making laws? So if I declare that, \\"Thou shalt not steal any blue socks\\" I can create a banana sandwich? What are they talking about? Maybe he messed up what he was trying to say (which probably didn't make sense either.)3. And we can create what we want through imaging laws lol??? Was that also mistake? I can imagine the authors laughing at the people who would fall for this book as they wrote it. Or maybe they are truly very confused.More nutsense: \\"Who you are is spiritually perfect, but what you do is not always perfect.\\" Oh really, so if a person rapes kids, who they are doesn't include \\"rapist\\"? And what is the author's point in bringing this up? Weird.More nutballery: \\"Before the Law of Gravity was identified, nobody knew it existed.\\" Really? So no one knew that things thrown up into the air will fall down, or that if a metal ball hanging on a rope will fall if the rope is cut?More lying: The authors (or maybe one was asleep) claim that when Buddha said, \\"desire creates suffering\\" that what he really meant was \\"that when you want something more and don't accept what you already have, you will suffer.\\" Sure he meant that! And that's why that's what he said right? Wrong. Also \\"accept\\" is the wrong word to use, there is nothing wrong with not accepting something but rather not being CONTENT with something. So even their vocabulary is poor.One more laugh: \\"When you think - the universe moves [why the dash?] This means that when you put an idea out into the universe, people, places and things, come into your life fulfilling that idea.\\" What The hell? Not all thinking is composed of ideas, much of it is analyzing, furthermore, if I envision Donald Trump bringing me a super-nutritious pizza, I doubt dogs and tooth fairies will come to my rescue to fill my grumbling belly."},{"Title":"Beyond Positive Thinking: A No-Nonsense Formula for Getting the Results You Want","review":"terriable!!!it stands for everything i'm against!!!if you're a christian, you don't want to get this because it goes against scripture from the very beginning!!"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Presents Infantry Bugle Calls of the American Civil War","review":"As a Commander for an American Legion post, I purchased a bugle to play taps at funerals.

I wanted the CD to train youngsters to bugle Civil War calls around our own re-enactors camps. I never dreamed that someone could screw up the traditional calls as badly as George Rabbi did.First, the organization of the calls in the book is a mess. Usually, bugle call books are organized by the order they sound throughout the day. This book is not organized this way, and the calls just appear in a hodge-podge manner that makes no sense.Second, many of the calls are just wrong. 'Attention', 'To the Colors', 'Assembly of the Buglers' are completely wrong. If you play these calls at any military encampements, you're going to get a lot of puzzled looks as no one is going to know what you're playing. 'Assembly of the Buglers' is an example of a call that is completely wrong. The author says that this is the very first call of the day. Wrong! The first call of the day is called 'First Call', it was used to assemble the buglers to plan the days call and it's the same tune used to call the horses to race tracks around the country. Even the 'Church Call' is completely unrecognizable.I will say that the historical accounts relating to each call are interesting.

Incidentally, the death of this particular bookstore had been long in coming. With a Borders across the street, I was not particularly alarmed or concerned at the little drama I was witnessing. The reductions began several weeks prior to the expected closing with 25% off everything in stock. In the weeks to come, I made a point of malling in its general vicinity so as to check in periodically as the store emptied and the reductions rose. Like the shark I am, I entered gleefully to participate in the final dismemberment once the magic discount of 75% was reached. So, that's the story of how I came to own this book.I am as yet undecided whether a book on letter writing should be derided as an anachronism, or extolled as something virtuous yet woefully absent from today's bookshelves. Sadly, I believe there are far too many modern households lacking bookshelves at all or, if bookshelves are indeed present, they are more likely to hold vintage Star Wars toys (collectables?) or porcelain pig figurines rather than books. If you hold to the theory that any book is better than no book, then this book undoubtedly has some merit. However, it was not exactly what I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting a quainter book that brought back a bit of the golden age of letter writing: courting the girl next door or describing in vivid detail the most wonderful time you and Mumsy are having on the continent and just who you happened to have met on the steamship passage over. What I got, disappointingly, was a book of business form letters. Here is a sample:\\"Dear Mary Daylily:I'd like to add your name to our Professional Educator subscription list--at no cost to you--for four months! That's right, four free issues without any obligation...\\" well, you can imagine how that letter proceeds. Is this a guide for the aspiring form-letter marketeer or--dare I say it aloud--spammer?You will find no discussions of style in this book. A little theory of letter writing would have been nice. You won't find that here. What you will find is a collection of sample letters, just one of each type, and the letters tend to be somewhat dry. Complaint letter? One example. Collection letter? One example. Wedding invitation? One example. Apology for a dog attack? One example.To be fair, there is a chapter on message composition touching on word choice, conciseness, style, and other useful stuff. This makes the book almost worth its 75% markdown. Almost.Dear Ms. DeVries:I'm sorry to let you know that the 2nd edition book product we acquired two months ago has not met our expectations.

In so doing he hopes to dispel the generally accepted notion that the response of the American Negro to his bondage &quot;was one of passivity and docility&quot; (p.374). Behind this notion of docility lies the belief that African-American slaves were well treated by their masters, generally contented with their lot, and inferior to whites. Jefferson Davis asserted this notion of docility on January 10, 1861 in the United States Senate in &quot;Declaring that he found the speculations as to whether 'our servants' would rebel or not 'exceedingly offensive' he went on to assert: 'Governments have tampered with slaves; bad men have gone among the ignorant and credulous people, and incited them to murder and arson; but of themselves - moving by themselves - I say history does not chronicle a case of Negro insurrection. (p.105).&quot;Herbert Aptheker's meticulous documentation of hundreds of cases of slave resistance, which often resulted in the death or grisly punishment of the slaves, easily refutes statements denying African-American discontent and rebelliousness. His collection of materials is quite remarkable, for slave state newspapers censored most accounts of insurrections. &quot;The particulars, we are constrained to observe, must be withheld for the present, from motives of precaution (p.158)&quot; typically wrote one Virginia newspaper. To achieve his narrative, Aptheker drew upon &quot;government archives, personal letters (sometimes published in distant newspapers), journals, diaries, and court records (p.159).&quot; The Aptheker book should be a standard reference work for anyone exploring this topic.In arranging his materials, the author first discusses slave insurrection according to major themes, and then he describes the insurrections in chronological order. This reader sometimes felt overwhelmed with example after example of insurrection, especially when they were treated chronologically.The thematic chapters on: &quot;The Fear of Rebellion&quot;, &quot;The Machinery of Control&quot;, and &quot;Exaggeration, Distortion, Censorship&quot; were particularly rich in materials that highlighted the American slave society's predicament. Many slave owners had valiantly fought in the Revolutionary war and championed republican principles. Yet, slave ownership was driving them away from these same principles by requiring them to place increasing limitations on free assembly, free speech, a free press and jury trials. Slave society began to live in a general siege atmosphere, especially after the Haitian revolution. Aptheker quotes one Virginian on the possibility of a slave insurrection; &quot;I wish I could maintain, with truth ... that it was a small danger, but it is a great danger, it is a danger which has increased, is increasing, and must be diminished, or it must come to its regular catastrophe (p. 49)&quot;. In such a growing atmosphere of fear, the white inhabitants of the slave society felt themselves increasingly threatened and moved to curtail civil liberties. Abolitionist ideas could be &quot;infectious&quot; and possessing an abolitionist document was a crime. Free Negroes could not travel to other states without losing their right to return home, and they could not possess weapons. Vigilance committees began to replace the police and court systems. Slavery was no longer a topic that could be openly discussed by citizens. It would appear that removing the topic from discussion had the unfortunate consequence of undermining the republican institutions necessary for managing social change.Aptheker's narrative is replete with fascinating historical tidbits. He carefully documents how religious instruction was aimed &quot;to inculcate meekness and docility&quot; in slaves (pp. 56-59) and quotes from a white preacher's sermon to slaves on why whippings, called &quot;corrections&quot;, should be suffered patiently. The preacher goes to great lengths to demonstrate how any whipping is merited and concludes: &quot;But suppose that even this was not the case - a case hardly to be imagined - and that you have by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction you suffered; there is great comfort in it, that if you bear it patiently, and leave your case in the hands of God, He will reward you for it in heaven, and the punishment you suffered unjustly here shall turn to your exceeding glory hereafter. (p.57)&quot;. Another item describes John C. Calhoun's concerns about the loyalty of federal troops if they are called upon to suppress a slave revolt. The Secretaries of the Navy and Army were required to report on the numbers of Negroes, free or slave, in the U.S. military. Here it was reported that a regulation &quot;forbade over one-twentieth of a ship's crew to be Negro (p.68).&quot;Woven throughout Aptheker's narrative are numerous references to maroons, or fugitive slaves who live in relatively inaccessible, generally swampy, areas and periodically prey on local residents. &quot;Reports, no doubt greatly exaggerated, were current that two or three thousand Negroes were hiding in the Great Dismal Swamp ... (pp.307-308).&quot; I suspect that assessing the relative prevalence of maroon activity is problematical and to his credit Aptheker carefully avoids such speculation. Aptheker simply cites maroon activity as further evidence of general slave discontent. I found less convincing Aptheker's attempt to identify periods of greater or lesser slave insurrectional activity, but this analysis is not crucial to the book's narrative. For example, while Aptheker uses this analysis to establish a causal link between increasing insurrectional activity and periods of economic stress, common sense might do just as well.This reader admits to having approached this book with some reservations and a bias. Herbert Aptheker was an active member of the US Communist Party for a number of years. Quite a few years ago I completed a serious graduate school course in Marxist-Leninist thought, which required me to read all of the important original documents of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao. I find it difficult to imagine that an intelligent person can read these materials and still become a Marxist-Leninist. I would like to think Dr. Aptheker was too busy doing his path breaking historical research to read all of the Communist classics. His American Negro Slave Revolts contains none of the turgid prose and convoluted theorizing that I associate with Marxist historians. We're spared discourses on the labor theory of value, class struggle, increasing concentration of capital, etc. As for its accuracy, I confess that I didn't check his footnotes. Curiously, I don't see this work widely cited. I wonder how many American historians are afraid to cite a Communist work, even when it's good research."},{"Title":"American Negro Slave Revolts","review":"This book was originally Aptheker's PhD thesis and was written to de-bunk the idea that the enslaved Africans were docile and accepting of their lot. After reading this book, you will know that they were not docile or accepting of their lot and that slave revolts were more or less constant from the beginning of slavery.It's not a fun read -- it's quite dry and mostly a carefully researched and documented listing of facts. But after you read it, your attitude toward how slavery affected the people enslaved will be different.You'll know how the Ku Klux Klan came to be, how powerful the African-American people and culture were even while subjected to slavery, and you'll be able to spot so many lies that are being told today about slavery, black people in America, and white people in America.Go ahead, read it. Yes, it's a little dry but it will change your life. It reads a lot faster if you skip the numerous footnotes."},{"Title":"American Negro Slave Revolts","review":"This isn't a \\"how to\\" kind of book, but it does inform the reader of the lesser known, but equally effective insurrections that were incorporated during this period.It's enough to teach our babies that the ancestors were not happy to be in this land working under these conditions. Like in a regular street fight, they used any and every method to gain freedom; and marching, sit-ins and protests were not on the agenda of these warriors. Read it, study it and make sure you know enough to have it burned into your subconscious so that in the next life, you'll know what do do when you see aliens off the coast of your shores...either run away and let the land itself take care of them or take them down yourself.

Besides covering the war for our nation's independence, one of the nice things that it accomplishes is a more human depiction of Paul. It talks about his two marriages and the 16 children that resulted. It also emphasizes that Paul was constantly working to learn new crafts and skills in order to support his family. There are descriptions and pictures not only of his school days, but also of some interesting kid-friendly trivia, like the fact that Paul once sold a woman a chain for her pet squirrel.Five Stars. All in all this is a very good biography. The artwork is colorful and interesting, and there are enough fun details about Revere's life that children should find the book engaging. Very young children will likely need to have the wars and politics explained to them.Reading Level: Fifth Grade (5.3)"},{"Title":"A Picture Book of Paul Revere (Picture Book Biographies) (Picture Book Biography)","review":"This picture book is an excellent resource for children of any grade level.

Secondly, the authors do not explain what part of the plant should be used, nor what dose is recommended. Some herbal tinctures have a dose of 30 drops or more, while some should not be taken in doses above ten drops.

She told me its a good place to start in my reading. I've already read through it once and can't wait to devour it again. There is so much lost art in this book-information on poultices, remedy combinations as well as a section on individual herbs. The only drawbacks to this book are that the index isn't that thorough, and it doesn't have a section on cancer remedies; however it lists under individual herbs if they are used for cancer treatment. Not sure why that is. Having said that, this book is well worth the 12.00 I paid. I'd probably pay a lot more now that I know how much information it has! It doesn't get much into why/how they work-- it just lists combinations of herbs and individual herbs and what they cleanse/balance/heal. Its not so much a book for those who aren't sure about herbs or alternative medicine because it doesn't give in depth rationale or anything, but if you've done enough reading to have bought into the philosophy and you just need a good working reference guide, this book's for you. I immediately felt it was a good source because what I started reading jived with some of the information I already knew.I've already started using the remedy suggestions for asthma and I'm completely off my Singular after being on it for five years. This book also has suggestions for cleansing enemas and fruit/juice fasting. Very helpful guidelines. My suggestion is to buy it and then just make your own tabs for it. Not that hard to do but I wouldn't trade the info in this book for the world. I'm so excited to have found this book. You will too.

Even the lack of mention of them while he narrated the mens stories was a statement about their importance in the men's thinking of the time. It rang true. There probably exists little record of that type of thing for one to draw on.Small pieces of the book keep recurring to me - for me this is an indicator of a good book. The story of the two boys sitting on the hill talking about New Mexico becoming part of the US...the hispanic boys reaction and the white boys...subtle and a bit tense. The story of the chaos in the barn at Turley's mill.and the encounter of old friends in the hills that lead to betrayal.All in all, a very enjoyable read that I'd strongly recommend.I reserved the 5th star because I'd have loved to see more maps, photos and illustrations."},{"Title":"The Taos Massacres","review":"This book is excellent fiction that tells a story in a highly readable fashion.

It brings the familiar gospel alive by analyzing the manner in which the orignal Greek has been rendered into modern English (RSV translation). In doing so it gives the reader a better sense of the original work in Greek. Likewise, Nineham provides context for better understanding the life and work of Jesus and the role that the gospel of Mark played in the history of early Christianity.

It's high time and past time the martial disciplines of the Middle Ages got the credit they deserve, and while the book may not be as all encompassing as the author may have meant it to be,it can be seen as the rallying point for works of its kind to answer the desperate need to exist in the FIRST place.

But do expect it to give you basic stances, cuts, attack routines and terrific illustrations. No book can teach you to fight, but John does an exceptional job of presenting a template that can be used to learn swordsmanship through training.If you are on the fence...buy it. You will be pleased with your purchase. I was."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Every time I see a book on Western swordsmanship, I buy it. I think it is imperative to support the efforts of the growing Western Martial Arts (WMA) community, including all the authors and editors who invest time and money into it. But what a pity when such a book is abused to advance one's petty causes, as Mr. Clements does rather petulantly in Medieval Swordsmanship.What better way to dispel &quot;myths&quot; then to accurately and faithfully show how swordsmanship was practiced in the olden days? If Mr. Clements had done this, there would have been no need for his protracted diatribe. But instead he throws at the reader a myriad of unconnected actions and techniques, interspersed with his off-color comments about the groups with which he disagrees. Furthermore, many of these actions and techniques are intuitive and anyone with half a notion of body-mechanics can figure them out for themselves.By the end of the book, one feels like he has been stuck in an elevator with a hyperactive (and aggressive) close-talker, who character-assassinated any and all who fail to see the world the way he does. There is no generosity in these comments, and the tone of the book makes you wonder whether Clements wears the same intellectual blinders when analyzing period sources.What a pity. A book is a promise -- and Medieval Swordsmanship is a promise broken."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Mr. Clements has done a complete and authoritative job of introducing a new reader to the lost martial art of the west, medieval swordsmanship.I am a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and am an authorized rapier fighter in the Middle Kingdom (which includes my home state of Michigan). I purchased this book based on reviews here, to aid my rapier fighting techniques since I am a relatively new fighter.[The Postitives]The book has excellent diagrams of weapons and fighting techniques. Even more, he explains such things as the \\"why\\" behind the differences of period rapier fighting and its modern successor, sport or Olympic fencing. He also shows how the differences of various grips upon a rapier or sword will impact a combatant. He covers cut-and-thrust swordsmanship with the same depth. Each weapon and technique is clearly explained. Many diagrams have human figures displayed in the appropriate stance. While sparse, they are very effective.[The negatives]As noted in an earlier review, Mr. Clements does spend time debunking those he disagrees with. However, I interpreted this as someone who was taking the time to explain why they were doing this (swordsmanship) to someone coming from another discipline. I didn't find it condescending or irritating.While Mr. Clements does an excellent job with showing you various stances, parries and cuts, they will probably quickly lose their luster once you have practiced them. There are no further drills to practice or techniques to learn once you have figured out what he has shown you.[Conclusion]This book is excellent for someone with little or no experience in re-creating swordsmanship. I highly recommend it. The only thing keeping me from rating it a full five stars is that it has no provision for you once you have advanced past what it has to teach. Still, it was a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to buy this book, as it had mixed reviews here on Amazon. Now that I've read it for myself, I can safely say that it's a outstanding guide for a Western Martial Arts newbie such as myself. I highly recommend it for anyone who's interested in seriously exploring European sword fighting.Some of the inital background information might be a bit redundant for those with a decent knowledge of warfare in the Middle Ages. However, it doesn't detract from the wealth of information in this book. The chapters are well-organized and easy to follow. The various swordfighting techniques are nicely illustrated and very easy to recreate on your own.I was especially taken by the chapter on fighting with a one-handed sword &amp; shield. I had always taken my cue about shields from TV, films, and Ren-fair stuff, basically hiding behind the shield, while the other guy clubs it like a deranged monkey on crack, waiting for an opportunity to strike out. Mr. Clements presses the importance of viewing the shield as a weapon, and provides techniques on using it as an integral part of the fight.As for the digs on the stage action/Ren-fair/SCA &quot;battles&quot;, John is not nearly as harsh as some of these reviews make him out to be. He basically explains how such theatrical fighting causes a degraded mental image of what Western Martial Arts really are, at least as far as the general public is concerned. And on that point, I have to agree. Reenactments are great fun, but no-one should kid themselves that it's even close to the real art. He's calling it as he sees it, and quite frankly, he's not too far off the mark.Anyway, if you want an excellent beginner's guide to the sword, you would do well to start with this book."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book covers a great deal of old-fashioned sword-play (inlcuding swords versus polearms, etc). The way it &quot;shadows&quot; in every diagram showing whatever is undefended, is also a great way to show what is vulnerable.It also covers guard positions, the use of a shield, two-handed swords, some interesting quotes from old warriors and an excellent reference on what to look for when buying a sword in this modern age (where the author feels we should catch up to the old forgers in maybe the next generation or so... because our swords are still not as good as the old ones).I have to admit that the author does compare to the silver screen/ theatrical a great deal, but I think it is more in the spirit of &quot;if your trying to learn how to sword-fight from movies like &quot;Excaliber&quot;... this is why it isn't going to work. Also, just because you've studied fencing with your theatre group... don't think you're going to be able to take on a kenjutsu student.I've studied into several styles and forms of sword-fighting... this book still offers something new.I just wish there would have been a section on double-sword styles (which was mentioned... but never really illistrated) and more on short swords."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I study Japanese martial arts, and I purchased this book in an effort to understand the Western tradition of sword useage and broaden my general knowledge of sword useage. Both the similarities and differences between medieval swordsmanship and what I know of kenjutsu struck me: both utilize the same basic biomechanics (surprise! we're all humans) and even some general techniques, but each method is uniquely adapted to its own particular cultural environment. The subject is interesting, the author knows his swords, and the book reflects this. If you're looking for something along these general/introductory lines, this is the book for you. It contains a few specific techniques, but these are there for the purpose of illuminating the concepts rather than as part of some \\"exhaustive list.\\"Topics that are covered in detail include:Design/production of medieval swords (from a warrior's perspective)Use of the medieval sword and shieldUse of the medieval longswordMedieval shield designs/usesTraining in medieval sword stylesAgain, this is an interesting and worthwhile introduction to a very interesting subject. If you're curious, it's worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is all about the martial art that is (or was) medieval swordsmanship. This ain't for folks who want to play-fight.The book covers the history, construction, and usage of the longsword (two-handed or hand-and-a-half sword) as well as the single sword and shield. The author is interested in clearing up the misconceptions that have been generated over the years concerning European swords and swordsmanship, and does so very well in this book. His goal, it would seem, is to make sure that people actually understand how these weapons were used in war.From the standpoint of a martial artist, I find this book to be an insightful look at weapons which have been neglected for, perhaps, centuries. Clements provides information on what makes for a good sword and how to judge a replica, which is the first step in becoming a swordsman/woman: know your tools. Then he explains the basic principles and techniques for using the sword and shield, explaining the various guards and the attacks which can be launched from them. Proper posture and the use of the shield, both defensively and offensively, are important enough for him to mention. He briefly covers sword & shield techniques vs. the axe and flail before moving on to the longsword.In the longsword section, the use of the grip is covered as well as the numerous postures favoring this particular weapon. Parrying is given some fine points as well. The advantage of having one had free of the sometimes-cumbersome shield becomes apparent upon viewing the techniques; apparently, this method of fighting allows one to take advantage of anatomical weapons that the sword & shield method did not. At the end of that section, he presents strategies and tactics for the longsword vs. the sword & shield, the spear, and the halberd, as well as a brief section on true two-handed swords, which were often five or six feet in length.Mr. Clements end his book with advice on how to train, and the pluses and minuses of training in the modern age.As a martial artist, I found many of the principles in this book to be compatible with other practicle war-arts (no telegraphing your movements, guarding your weak points, etc) and recomend this book to anyone who's interested in what fighting with the European weapons is/was like.My reverence for the sword, as a weapon, is based on the fact that it was the first one that was not a variant of a pre-existing tool, such as a flail, bow, or spear. It was the first true warriors weapon, and Clements gives it it's proper respect by viewing it as such."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I must say before I begin that John Clements is a very talented and knowledgeable martial artist. His years of experience have made him reliable, and perfectly authorized to write this text.However, this book is, as he says, nowhere near being the only source for any researcher of medieval swords. In fact, it is more of an introduction for beginners to start their studies upon. It offers many fundamental concepts essential to Western Swordsmanship, and gives readers a starting point in learning European martial arts. Many of the points he makes, especially regarding bodily movement, balance, and the like, are self-evident to somebody already involved in martial arts, especially in Western Martial Arts.The only drawback to this book was that, in an effort to rid the world of common myths, and to dispel many misconceptions about WMA, Clements was very redundant. However (and this can be good or bad) he sprinkled different facts all through the book, so a reader cannot skim over parts without fear of missing something.Overall, I'd say that this book is worth a look for anybody interested in WMA, but a beginner would definitely find it much more useful than would a veteran. It does provide a good reference for certain tidbits; the name of a guard, or the execution of a strike. As always, a book is no substitute for a bona fide teacher, especially in the world of WMA, where our knowledge and understanding of the principles and concepts adopted by our fencing forefathers is always changing and expanding.UPDATE: It's been several years since I first started studying historical European martial arts, and several years since this book came out. Many, many advancements have been made since then, and much of the information in this book is outdated. As a jumping point for a beginner, it may be a worthwhile read, but there have been a lot of really spectacular books on the same subject in the last couple years, so you may be better off starting elsewhere."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This is the book my group has been looking for. We were at a loss to find a genuine source for technical expertise and hands-on experience to aid us in our quest for a better swordfighting program. This book is descriptive with good illustrations and is fairly easy to read. Mr. Clements has done an excellent job of creating a manual for self-instruction. I believe a person who had never picked up a sword prior could acquire genuine skill through the use of this book. It is complete. It tells not only how to use a sword, but how one is constucted, how shields are made and used, and how to fight with other hand weapons of the period. Mr. Clements has definitely done his homework."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I not only read this book, I also saw the Author giving lectures and demonstrations (Leeds, England). I must say that the book is good and realistic and the experitise of the author very good (saw it in the demonstrations). He really knows what he is talking about and he leaves the flowery stuff out. That's why he places critical remarks about stagecombat and moviefighting. But he has a point. Since movies are there to enjoy, swordfighting is there to kill and thus has to be realistic. As I have seen the author himself in action and as I do have an extensive Martial Arts background I can tell every reader that Mr. Clements is very good at swordsmanship. Just buy the book and read page 277 good (there he says that the critical remarks are not meant to put anyone down)"},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is a great survey of German Style school of fencing techniques, and provides quite a bit of detail on the sword itself, including how to select one, etc. While sold as a book that covers the complete German school of fencing, it does appear to lack polearm combat, which is blatantly advertised as encompassed by the text. Irrespective of this, the techniques are quite well illustrated, and this would make a nice supplement to an authentic German school of fencing study. As always, however, to make full use of this material, you would really need to be enrolled in a medieval swordsmanship course and, while we have them in Prague, Budapest and most cities of Germany, I'm not sure how much access you folks in the USA will have. As such, it's likely to be an informative novelty sitting on your bookshelf til then."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Amazing attention to detail. Provides useful data on materials, dimensions and techniques applied to many varieties of Medieval swords, even going into estimated carbon content of various early steels. Similar attention to authenticity and detail in describing techniques and styles of swordsmanship. The drawings used are very easy to follow, better than trying to decipher photographs, and clearly demonstrate the movements and techniques detailed in the text.The author is occasionally rabid in his disregard for fantasy and sport enthusiasts, but that is understandable, considering the culturally-ingrained stereotypes he has to overcome before he can even begin to teach.Sadly, few of us will ever be in a position to train in the way the author recommends. I agree with the author that banging away with sticks is a poor reflection of actual medieval sword techniques; unfortunately, that's as close as most of us can realistically come.An outstanding reference for anyone interested in Medieval swords and the way they were actually used."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Having studied eastern martial arts for over 14 years, mostly Japanese, I had always pined over the lack of material available to those who wished to pursue Western martial arts. What I like most about this book is how clear it is. Many other books do not show enough pictures in sequence for a particular move to fully understand it, but the drawing in this book are very easy for me to follow. Although some reader have apparently found the author's remarks regarding those in the stagecombat and reenactment camps, I found them to mirror my experiences of them exactly. It is high time someone put forth a scholarly work to refute those people who think THEIR way is the &quot;only way&quot;. Mr. Clements shows us the basics and then allows us to take what he gives us and create our own personal way of using this most ancient and revered weapon. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I've read all 61 reader reviews of this book, and I feel like there is one important point none of them have covered. The point is simply this: Whatever its faults, this is the *only* book of its kind. You simply will not find another introductory text to Medieval Swordsmanship out there. There are plenty of translations of old fechtbuchs, but those were never intended for the beginner and are virtually incomprehensible to the novice. There is a fair amount of material with a focus on theatrics, archaeology, history, etc., but there simply isn't anything other than this one book for the beginner on learning how to use a sword the way it was actually intended to be used. Not once in any of the 61 reader reviews of this book does anyone mention a better alternative book. (Of course, in any martial art a real live instructor is much preferred over a book.)If you already know how swing a sword, then I can see where you might object to some of Mr. Clements diatribes, but the rest of us will just have to accept them, because nobody else has done us the favor of writing an alternative introductory text to medieval swordsmanship.It is also worth noting that John Clements through his ARMA organization has arguably fostered more scholarly research on the subject of swordsmanship as a martial art than anyone else in this decade. On the ARMA web site you will find more free PDF's of ancient swordsmanship manuals in one place than anywhere else on the planet. (AEMMA also maintains an extensive online library, but only a small portion of their archives are free to the public.) They also have many contemporary essays on various sword topics and a neat library of video clips.In summary, if you are interested in learning about medieval swordsmanship as an authentic martial art and you don't have an instructor in your area, then this book is *THE* place to start."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is a pity. Guy Windsor's \\"The Swordman's Companion\\" available from Amazon is a much, much better book. As has already been mentioned, this Medieval Swordsmanship is a horrid composition that has some technique and information, but highly disjointed and the filler between these bits is nonsensical diatribe firing off at a number of groups. In some respects, it is good that Clements wrote this book; he made mistakes that other writers in the Western Martial Arts community learned from. However, in reading his book, one has the impression that the majority of his failings would be repeated if he could write it again, out of sheer refusal to admit when he is simply wrong or ignorant."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This was an excellent book. I was getting nervous when it was on order that I wouldn't like it as much as I hoped. I was pleasantly surprised. There are numerous diagrams and my husband and I can now properly play with our swords. The book also goes into swords while used with shields. A very helpful book."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book obviously is written by someone full of passion for the techniques of Medieval Swordsmanship. However, the passion does not cover for some of the flaws. With a little more research worked into this and a correct of some of the faulty information, it would have been the bible for writers, reenactors and people interested in the historical technique of medieval sword fighting. Still when used with other historical works, it is an excellent resource.He covers medieval swords, their making, swords use with shields and against shields. He discusses sparing methods, how to stage reenactments, then historical decline of the swords, and then how the sword has evolved in martial arts of today.It's a good work, but due to glaring problems it just misses as being a great work. I would still think writers and reenactors - using it conjunction with other works - would find it a useful book and would not want to miss it."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Having read the reviews listed here I brought this book knowing that it had its detractors. I went ahead anyway because so many raved its merits. I was really disapointed at what I got. It seems more like a brief overview rather than detailed methods and techniques. The author may very well be a expert but the amount of book space wasted complaining about other who seek to preserve swordmanship could have been used better to further describe methods and techniques of swordsmanship. Overall this book is not bad but it is not a five star book not is it a zero star book. Just given the glowing review I was expecting alot more. Don't make the same mistake I did. This book shows and describes a limited number of sword styles and goes into the history of the sword as to how it evolved but it falls short where I counts the most. There really is not that much in this book that worth the price. Yet I am glad I have it for my collection as another viewpoint. Although I'm sure many won't feel the same way."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"John Clements' latest work on historical European martial arts is impressive in both scope and ambition. The graphics are excellent, clear and dynamic. Although rather haphazardly organised, the sheer volume of information offers a wealth of inspiration and practical advice, particularly for those experienced enough to &quot;join the dots&quot;.BUT - unfortunately, Mr. Clements wastes reams of paper in his oft-repeated critiques of fantasy role-playing combat, SCA fighting, and so-on. Many of these attacks seem petty, and his tactic of repeating and re-stating his case ad nauseam is tiresome to say the least.Hopefully, future editions of this book will drop the flaming and baiting in favour of some good editing, and (one hopes) expanded chapters on unarmed combat, etc."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"... there are much better books on this subject available today - Tobler, etc. Clements' work is well illustrated - good use of diagram figures, etc. - but it's disorganised and he wastes reams of paper slamming fencers, Hollywood, and everyone else who's ever picked up a sword."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This is one of those &quot;love it or hate it&quot; books depending on how much of John Clements' style you can take. I really like the idea of a martial art based on medeival sword fighting, but Mr. Clements does waste a lot of time knocking other people. I think he is just so into what he's doing that he thinks everyone else is trying to do the same thing and getting it wrong. However, fantasy game players are not trying to do martial arts, they are just having fun! Evereyone knows that movie actors aren't really fighting, they are just acting! Parts of this book do came across like advertising for HACA, but that's fair enough. The pictures are good and there is a lot of information in this book that was new to me. I just wish he had stuck to the point. This book is not very organised and contains too much knocking!!"},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"An unparalleled book on Western Martial Arts. After reading this book and applying the techniques and principles therein, my ability with the sword increased radically. Mr. Clemonts Practices what he preaches: I have seen him in action. There's a lot of people talking, but not many delivering. John Clemonts delivers."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Medieval Swordsmanship is a milestone document in a field long dominated by fencing myths and historical inaccuracy. Solid text and simplistic terms....Clements' work reads like a military field manual that provides both novice and veteran with the essentials. Excellent illustrations and detailed descriptions of techniques make the book a very valuable training support package for martial arts instruction of that period. Clements' aggressive criticism of other methods and systems is a bit bold, but reflects an honesty of purpose normally ommited by the &quot;politicaly correct&quot;. His intent is to teach not impress reminiscent of some of the earlier work of the late Bruce Lee. Rennaissance Swordsmanship and Medieval Swordmanship hit the market at a time when the Western Martial Arts was in need of &quot;How-To&quot; instruction. Clements filled this need and agree with him or not these books are a headland for all students."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I became interested in fencing a few months ago. After reading some literature on the subject, it became clear that sport fencing is a few steps removed from swordplay. Participants must skip up and down a narrow lane and flick their flexible blades at each other in an attempt to depress an electric button. I want to learn how to use a sword, not a fencing foil.Several trips to libraries (university and public) bore little fruit. I did, however, find copy of John Silver's work (which is 400 years old). I enjoyed reading it, but gleaning techniques from unfamiliar Elizabethan terms proved too much for my poor little brain. Enter &quot;Medieval Swordsmanship&quot; by John Clements.The author spends fully 270 pages discussing the history, characteristics, and proper use of swords. The illustrations are excellent. Simple figures demonstrate Mr. Clement's techniques clearly and effectively. They are as instructive as 2D pictures can be.Most important, the methods outlined in the work are drawn from REAL fighting manuals, written by masters who practiced their art 500 years ago.Pages 271-324 contain the author's &quot;rants&quot; about modern swordsmanship. Mr. Clements feels that the sort of swordplay found in live action role play groups and historical reenacting societies does not reflect how medieval warriors actually fought. He makes some good points, but take it or leave it as you choose. If you rip this section out you still have 270 pages of well-documented instruction on how to fight with swords.A final note to Mr. Clements' critics: write a book! I'd buy it! Research the masters' antique fighting manuals, put them into practice, and publish! To my knowledge, Medieval Swordsmanship is the only book of its kind to be published since &quot;Old Swordplay,&quot; written before Teddy Roosevelt was President."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"First, I would like to complement Clements because his book does contain a wealth of knowledge and was one of the first widely accessible books on the subject I ever came across.He has spent a great deal of time in developing his skills and knowledge about Western fighting techniques and it shows. You can learn a lot from this book. However to do it you will have to wade through some of Clement's literary shortcomings.He has a tendency to be overly critical of anyone who he disagrees with, wasting way too much space in his book talking about what he feels others are doing wrong. I would much prefer he spend more time discussing what he is doing right. I've read several other papers written by Clements and this is a consistent complaint of mine with his work. Another conclusion is that Clements is very impressed with himself and wants to share that with everyone.Still, he has a great deal of knowledge to share on this topic and with this book has given us a widely distributed and affordable tome. When he is sticking to details he has a lot to offer."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"But for a lack of an editor and source citations, both this book and the Renaissance book could be better.Both could be consolidated into a single text the density of the Medievial.It appears the author was rushed. Either because of over committment or a hurried publisher. Either way, neither text was ready for press. It is either that or the author lacked enough informational text and filled the blank spaces with the occasional stage combat, collegiate\\\\Olympic fencing, or SCA tirade.I own both books. I bought both books to get me started in Western Martial arts. I am willing to continue to disagree with the author on some issues and concede others.Is this book worthless? I don't think so.Could the author have done better? Heck yes.Would I recommend this book? As a primer, but not for advanced study.If you are already a student of European martial arts, this is not a book for you. If you don't know one end of a sword from another, it is a place to start.Patiently awaiting Bob Charron's Fiori translation with very high expectations."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is amazing, it has helped me to not only understand the use of broadswords but also a majority of the swords of the period. If you want to know more about medievil weaponry, this is a must!"},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Midieval Swordsmanship presents to martial-arts students and instructors, historians, and anyone interested in European culture an overview of European armed combat techniques from appx. 1100 to 1500. It is a work of impressive scholarship and helps to fill the gap in knowledge which exists concerning Western fighting styles. Mr. Clements demonstrates how to use the midieval longsword and also presents the use of the sword and shield combination, spear useage, and the use of the shield as a weapon. As with his first book, Renaissance Swordsmanship, the author's excellent illustrations clearly demonstrate how to use these weapons. The illustrations are actually better than the photos which are used in most martial-arts books. In addition, the author also provides a historical background and setting for the weapons which are demonstrated. He also addresses the various types of midieval combat systems which are currently practiced by different groups around the world as well as describing the basics of evaluating a sword. All of these \\"extras\\" help to make this book a most worthwhile purchase. The author clearly takes this subject seriously and sets high standards for himself and for other practitioners of armed combat arts. This seriousness, and the demand for exacting historical accuracy which the author demands for those who wish to practice midieval combat, will probobly cause controversy. Mr. Clements is clearly willing to back up his historical claims, however, and also presents powerful arguments for his theories in the text of the book. This helps to make the book a valuable resource in and of itself. The reader will not only find a blueprint for studying midieval weaponry, but also solid historical research which shows how these weapons were used. The book is a welcome addition to the libraries of martial-arts practitioners worldwide. It is also one which is long overdue. Many myths and pseudo-histories exist as to the history of European martial-arts. Mr. Clements helps to dispel those myths and invites others to do so as well."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Just comment based on the preview...While at first glance at the section for Problems with stage combat can send a knee jerk reaction to some one that does this for film and tv shows.. and it did at first.... The book is on actual fighting... so perhaps the message could be misunderstood on certain sections. It is very true, the stage combat you see in film and tv and live shows is NOT fighting. Yes we do in fact muddy it up and do silly things to draw out a fght that in reality could well be over in a few seconds. That is for entertainment only. No one pays me to do a fight to be over in a few seconds.The writer clearly has passion for his subject of Real Fighting, some of that may seem to spill over as venom towards everything else...but it is more an impassioned pointing out of his views on what is fighting and what is not. After 20 plus years in Kungfu, I agree, I would hope no one confuses what I do in a show or film for real fighting. My weapon work for fighting in the martal arts is light years different from stage combat.From what I have read so far of the book, it has good value even for an entertainer that may wish to broaden their range. I am snapping a copy up for my library."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"When I heard of John Clement's book I immediately rushed to purchase it to add it to my reference collection. Despite the intriguing jacket,I was unfortunately disappointed by the content. The text reads as a coarse exposition of opinion despite its fairly lengthy bibliography. The bibliography is poorly cited so it is difficult to determine what is based on medieval source versus opinion. The only exception to this lack of reference is in John's discussion of the long sword technique where reference to German sources is obvious. As a result, his discussion of the long sword carries greater authenticity than the other weapons systems that he describes. This strongly illustrate the need for references in the rest of his work. John's writing style is abrupt and scathing of many of the groups that would find his book useful. This scathing tone is not necessary and detracts from the text as a serious work. He could make effective and useful critique of certain practices (kneeling when you are struck in the legs as a way of simulating damage, for example) without resorting to contempt. The illustrations in the book are numerous. But they are repetitive, do not show detail well, and do not link with the text. Figure explanations are absent and the illustrations do not stand alone. With regard to the subject matter, the fundamentals that John describes are only crudely articulated. Topics such as how to generate power, timing/distance, and means of attack/defense are only crudely developed. This is unfortunate since there are several references that could assist with a more detailed development of these topics. For example, there is an incredible description of the relationship of timing and distance in a medieval treatise by George Silver which is the Western European equivalent of the Asian sense of MA-AI (timing and distance combined as a sense). This concept is also well articulated in modern fencing texts as well as several Asian works. Yet in this book, the discussion of timing and distance is limited to a critique of practitioners who don't attack the lower legs. The suggestions for practice are fine and I agree with his emphasis on live sword, pell work and sparring but I was disappointed that he gave no cogent suggestions as to how to actually practice. In conclusion, the book does have valuable material for a beginner or a serious martial artist but the strong opinion and crude approach coupled with poor figures and inadequate reference to the bibliography makes the task of accessing that information a difficult one."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This is a good sourcebook for someone interested in medieval swordsmanship. It is of course the only sourcebook available that truly deals with the subject by someone who actually has studied and taught it. There is some good material for the beginner, but you must be able to get past his demeaning comments, which are way too often, regarding other societies which practice it.If you want a book on the subject, this is it. On the other hand, if you just want to learn a little from people who practice and test medieval swords, I would suggest looking up the discussion forum at www.netsword.com. I personally hope Clements comes out with a more detailed book on this subject that leaves the attacks on other groups out in the future."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Let's make this one brief. I bought this book along with a few others because I was following a heated discussion on a sword forum between Clements and another fencing writer. After going through Medival Swordsmanship page by page, I think this is the most self-serving book ever written. The author has little to no grasp at all of the medival sources and his history looks and reads like it was clipped from a supermarket encyclopedia. I won't comment on the endless silly rants on everything not in lockstep with the writer's views. The whole purpose of the book seems to be drumming up business for himself and squeezing profits out of gullible fencers for the publisher. Buy it only if you feel you must to complete your set of worthless overpriced paperback martial arts books. If you're looking for genuine history: Pass."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I admit to being a complete klutz--there is no way in any world that I would be able to pull off even the simplest moves described in this book, but that is not why I bought it. I bought this book because I am working on a medieval fantasy novel, which means by default that there are swordfights and duels. That being said, this book has helped me so much with being able to accurately describe the multiple fights that happen in my novel. It also provided me with valuable information about the different types of swords (including the historical inaccuracy of the term broadsword), and the fact that the shield is just as important as the sword. I absolutely love this book for its descriptions and illustrations, all of which make for a very informative guide on medieval swordplay. I can't attest for its use as a practical guide, but for those who are looking for a good source for research, this book is all you need."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is a rare find. It shows many aspects of swordsmanship that any one but a true master cannot. THe forms were labled as correct or incorrect, but not only that, but the captions told what, and why it was wrong. The book is a product of a person who has learned from experience and experimentation, and not just research."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Swordsmen revel! You have a new source that will give you advantage in your encounters. This book's approach is truly martial. Its intent is to aid real fighting skill. The book covers in detail the history, design, and most importantly the use of the sword and shield and the long sword against a whole host of European weapons including pole arms, axes, spears, flails, swords and shields. Over 300 pages contain more than 200 hundred pages of illustrations including a nice collection of historical drawings. But be warned, there are no blows held back concerning myths, misconceptions, and other negative influences on the reconstruction of historical European swordsmanship today. If you are ready for a challenge to your current ideas and methodology for the study of medieval arms then consider this book as a definite addition to your collection. Its packed with an incredible range of information from historical fighting manuals."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Outstanding! Everything you've always wanted to know about the subject and then some. Made me realize how much more there was to the real thing. I learned a tremendous amount. This is a real gem."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Despite the controversy and negative reviews here, I found this and the author's other book excellent as introductions to the field, and am very satisfied with them. Many of the negative reviews appear to be by authors of other books who are just dissing Clements.I am mostly involved in the Japanese and Chinese sword arts rather than the western ones, but I do have at least a basic background there, and I am an instructor in kali/escrima, which is descended from and influenced by Spanish espada y daga. So I bought this book to get somemore background on that. I have also seen many battles and duels by SCA and Scottish Games recreators who have presumably researched this, and am familiar with the Wallenstein Codex, Capo Fero's and Carozzo's manuals, the Talhofer, and so on.One reviewer says that book doesn't really tell you how to fence, and that it will take much more than this book to do that. However, the author tells you that in the introduction. The book does several important things, though, which are to familiarize you with the nomenclature, the typical method or normative use of the swords and weapons, the many types of weapons, basic techniques and strategy, when and where they developed, and something of the overall and more detailed evolution of the weaponry and tactics.In short, whether the book tells you exactly how to fight is pretty moot since the author admits that would require many separate manuals just by itself, and the book is still excellent as an introduction and overview of the entire field. To me this is no different from the many karate and kung fu and jiu jitsu books I have, most of which are good for giving you the basic techniques and knowledge, but far more study is needed in order to truly become well informed or even an expert. This book is no different and still contains much useful information.However, when you consider that Clements's detractors aren't taking into consideration the fact that most videos do a far superior job of showing the true body mechanics and movement of a martial art than any book can, their own books are vulnerable to the same objection. No book can match even the most rudimentary and basic video on martial arts, and there are now hundreds if not thousands of excellent and very detailed martial arts videos out there, many by very famous and even internationally renowed masters.Furthermore, one can buy these videos on e Bay used for a fraction of the new price, and which is usually less than that of a martial arts book which conveys far less.The upshot of all this is that books on the martial arts are now best designed to give the reader other information besides actual movement and body mechanics and kinesiology, such as theory, strategy, fine points of technique, historical information, and so on. By that token, I sometimes wonder why people are continuing to write books on the martial arts at all, considering how superb some of these videos are (I've reviewed many of these myself).Anyway, all that having been said, this is still a very informative and detailed introduction to the field and well worth the price, and I wanted to dispell some of the criticisms by previous reviewers whose own books are basically subject to the same criticisms."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This reference contains far more than is implied by the title. Topics covered in addition to the expected use of one-handed sword and shield, and hand-and-a-half swords, are fairly in-depth treatments of shield construction, techniques used against spear, halberd, and flail. Extended treatises provided on the nature of medieval combat, modern re-creations of medieval martial arts, and comparisons with Japanese style sword arts, and fantasy-like re-creationists as well, ie, ones who play &quot;sword tag&quot;. The reference is heavily illustrated and presented in a straightforward, pragmatic manner. I very highly recommend this book, as the single most useful reference on what is in fact a much more complex topic than &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; suggests - a flawed depiction which portrays medieval swordsmanship as nothing more than savage hacking and beating."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I should have known better. I had noticed an ominous (or stunned?) silence among the top layers of fencing historians regarding Medieval Swordsmanship: Whereas the most qualified and vocal scholars usually don't pull punches reviewing each other's works, nobody whose judgment re: sword fighting history I trust has actually commented in public about John C.'s latest work.Now I know why.Let's get things straight. There's nothing wrong with having a platform. If that platform is &quot;Those Hollywood guys and sports fencers are baaad&quot;... that's fine. Hey, it could be provocative, in a sad little monomaniacal kind of way. But at some point, even the most dedicated reader might want to see an author take the plunge into substance.John Clements does his darndest to establish his platform. He expands it by multiplying the ways someone can say &quot;Hollywood is baad&quot;. But Clements never gets around to working up the guts (or knowledge or competence) to actually take the plunge into anything that could be remotely considered Serious.Of course, if Hollywood -- and anyone else who ever practised, exhibited or wrote about fencing or sword play -- is baaad because they're just so darn sloppy, unauthentic, unmartial or otherwise incorrect, you might expect unprecendented degrees of accuracy at least in Clements' own historical analysis.But the Guy Who Brought You &quot;Domingo Angelo&quot; in his Renaissance Sword Yucks (for outsiders... the man's name was Domenico... everyone who's actually read one stinkin' fencing book knows that) again serves up buckets of factual slop, haphazard summaries, unsupported facts, quick-draw conclusions, and half-a$$ed opinion, all stridently set off against a tailored backdrop of artificial, egocentric reality: While Clements has been compared to Silver by kind-hearted (or openly sycophantic) reviewers, the only analogy I could come up with was that of Don Quixote fighting windmills.But content is one thing. Expressing yourself is another.If the volume, pitch, and simple-mindedness of the author's world view are grating after the first five pages, his writing can only be described as amateurish. I found it the literary equivalent of Chinese water torture. To make up for substance or factual validity, each statement has to be stated and restated and stated again in the most convoluted, pompous, and self-deluded way possible -- all in the same paragraph.(In fact, reading the book makes you realize how much work must go into editing articles of Clements' that appear in magazines such as Hammerterz Forum or Renaissance Magazine. Only that he must have enough dirty pictures of his Paladin editors to have bullied them into complete passivity, to the permanent detriment of his book(s).)Oh yeah. And there's lots of stick figures in various positions. But I didn't care getting that far. Clements had blown his credibility long before.This is a one star book, simply because there's no way not to give it any less."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"The idea was great and this could have been a really good book for beginners in medieval fencing.Unfortunately with the bad editing, the boring blundering about what other people are doing, the unfounded knowledge in the historic circumstances and largescale warfare and with complete disregard of naming sources it proves to be not very worthy for someone who wants to do meore historic than hitting each other with buffer-weapons.It might be a good idea to work the whole thing over (maybe with one of the shunned historians), get some reasonable lector and put the text down to half of its length by throwing away all emotional and non helping ranterings and filling the gaps with naming the sources.THEN it maybe would do, what it's intended to and gets more than an anti-everything pamphlet of his martial arts group.There are enough rivalries in the asian martial arts.

However you gotta consider how slow the publishing industry goes vs. the advancement of these martial arts. By the time it finally hit shelves after years in the publishing process, it was already rather dated.(Like David Lindholm's \\"Knightly Art of the Longsword\\", and Christian Henry Tobler's \\"Secrets of Medieval Swordsmanship\\": both of which are only useful for their text facsimile of Ringeck's commentaries. Although no one singles them out for trivial personal reasons.)While it's definitely not the best resource out there for someone looking for up-to-date instruction of fencing, it's still a cool \\"time capsule\\" of sorts showing how far the whole field of Historical European Martial Arts have come since the early 2000's."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"If I had been able to get past all the anti-SCA, anti-Asian martial arts, and anti-stage combat whining, I would have given this book more stars - probably not five, but certainly four.In reading this book, I wonder why Mr. Clements thinks he can catch more flies with venom than with honey? The teacher who belittles his student is no teacher - he is an abuser. Repeatedly calling someone \\"ignorant\\" is no way to instruct them, or to get them to agree with you.(I am also led to seriously wonder which SCA fighter ran over his dog when he was a boy? Which stage fight instructor stole his lolli-pop? Which kendo master slapped his mother?)Despite some excellent analysis of the art of swordsmanship, Mr. Clements seems to have totally missed the point that recreational or theatrical groups aren't in the swordplay business to be killed, or even be 100% \\"accurate.\\" They are interested in a hobby - in having fun - and in \\"making it look good.\\" I've been in the SCA for 18 years (as a fighter, among other things), and I have yet to meet any SCA fighter who suggests that \\"this is exactly how they did it in the Middle Ages.\\" There is a lot in the SCA that we don't attempt to recreate with 100% accuracy: sanitary conditions (except during Pennsic, perhaps...), the Black Plague, medical practices (i.e. leeches), etc. It's the Society for CREATIVE Anachronism.Mr. Clements also takes no less than NINE appendices to thoroughly thrash the horse corpses he digs up - FOUR of which whine about the SCA's knee-fighting rules. He postulates that \\"standing still\\" would be a better alternative to going down on one knee to simulate a leg injury.As a veteran of many SCA melees, I can state without fear of contradiction that while Clements' idea could possibly work for SCA single combat (i.e. tournaments), it is wholly impractical for melees of any appreciable size (for example, those found at the Pennsic War). Imagine trying to determine - in the heat of battle, no less - whether the guy in the shield wall ahead of you has lost his leg, or is merely standing still. Simply ain't gonna work.My absolute favorite quote was this (p. 5): \\"No one can be 'expert' unless he has actually fought and killed with a real sword.\\" Wow. Really...? Disregarding the truly homicidal and sociopathic tendencies betrayed by this remark: Does it mean that there are NO expert firearms marksmen, since they have never actually KILLED someone with their guns? Can no one be an expert in the pathology of sexual abuse unless they have actually raped someone? I don't buy it, and neither should the readers of this book.Too much arrogant whining, which mitigates the value of the book. If he had started with Chapter One, and left off the many forwards, author's notes and appendices, Clements would have been much farther ahead."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"I also spent a good deal of time reading all the reviews of this book. I feel that for what it's purpose is (a beginers guide into to medieval sword types), that it's one of the best resources of its kind available. That's not to say that other books of similar type aren't good. (Most notably \\"The Swordman's Companion: A Manual for Training With the Medieval Longsword by Guy Windsor\\" and Henry Tolbers book's Fighting with the German Longsword and \\"Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship: Sigmund Ringeck's Commentaries on Liechtenauer\\") Even then, Henry Tolber's books focus just on the German longsword and the latter just on a particular master. John Clements book covers many more sword types and weapon combinations throughout the medieval era.From the negative complaints about this book, I conclude three things. These individuals are either 1) ignorant of what actual historical combat was and this evidence makes them look silly. 2) They have personal dislikes with John Clements or his habit of telling various boffer and rattan fighting groups that what they practice is not historical combat. Or 3) they forget that this is supposed to be a beginners manual and are looking for more an in depth approach.There are many, many good books out there that would be the next step for the European Martial Arts student. But for the beginner, this is a fantastic reference book."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Three times the size of his earlier _Renaissance Swordsmanship_, this book is *packed* with information about sword types, shield types, the use of sword and shield in combat, types and use of the medieval longsword, and general information about the practice of medieval swordsmanship.

If you have an interest in swords and swordplay of the Middle Ages, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"John Clement's has done a wonderful job in this book of explaining the differences in the various weapons, their evolution, and then clearly outlining various fighting techniques. For so many of us, whose ideas of swordplay are formed by bad television/movies and anachronistic role players, this book is a refreshing change. Well researched, the language is clear enough that a novice (like myself) can grasp the basic concepts. The illustrations alone make the book invaluable.A great find for writers of fantasy and historical novels."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"With this work, Clements has brought to the forefront the world of Historical European Martial Arts, particularly the sword and shield. In a way never done before, he brings the works of the historical masters to light and breaks through the misconceptions to present realistic techniques for not only the sword but also the combination of sword and shield. Long lost behind the proliferation of Asian styles and the showmanship of stage-fighting and fantasy role-playing, the effectiveness and brutality of Medieval swordsmanship is revealed as a constantly changing and evolving style that takes in many facets experienced throughout the constantly changing style of warfare in the Middle Ages.The basics of western swordsmanship are well-defined and displayed, with effective and useful illustrations that show the techniques Clements is describing clearly. Guards, strikes, and techniques against not only other swords but also polearms and other weapons are all shown with clarity and can be quickly learned and understood.Many criticize this book as spending too much time debunking myths and explaining the most recent findings in the world of medieval swordsmanship, but given the misunderstandings about the art this is not only understandable but necessary."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"The author's first book, Renaissance Swordsmanship was a shocker. This book is perhaps worse, and it's a mystery why it continues to receive favourable reviews. I guess you can fool some of the people, some of the time.The book covers two main weapons, longsword and sword and shield. As with his earlier work, both sections betray a very superficial understanding of any historical source. Despite showing some historical longsword guard positions, the author chooses to give his own guards, some of which resemble some historical guards, many of which don't (for example he claims that his hanging guard is the German Ochs or the Italian Posta di Donna, it doesn't really resemble Ochs and is completely different to Posta di Donna).Clements teaches the withdrawal of the arms when cutting, something which should offend anyone with the most rudimentary understanding of tempo. He teaches what are essentially modern sabre parries with the longsword, which if he understood German theory, he would know is exactly what you are told not to do. The techniques he shows bear no resemblance to anything that can be seen by looking at original manuals.The sword and shield section is even worse. Clements claims that his method of shield use is historical, yet it violates every principle of historical shield use. He holds the shield flat in front of the body, which authors like Marozzo tell you to do against polearms or multiple opponents, but NOT in single combat against another sword armed opponent. Clements' guards leave him vulnerable to having his shield bound by his opponent's. It also means that practically every cut he shows commits the cardinal sin of shield combat, exposing the arm in front of the shield. Lastly, Clements advocates moving the shield to block attacks, when historically combatants moved their bodies around large shields, not the shield around their body. All of the fundamentals that he could get wrong he does.While in the longsword section you can see some effort (albeit poor) to follow historical practice, it is clear that the sword and shield section was simply made up. It is ironic that the author spends so much time criticising others for making up techniques and then does it himself.This book was poorly researched and out of date when it was written, but it was the only book out there on medieval swordsmanship. This is no longer the case. There are a great many books, almost all of them a massive improvement on this sorry tome. For the longsword we have Christian Tobler's Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship, followed by his Fighting with the German Longsword. David Lindholm's Knightly art of Swordsmanship and Zabinski's Codex Wallerstein are both good works on the German system. There is also an excellent DVD by a German group called Ochs. The Italian system has Arte Gladiatoria, a translation of Vadi's manual, and the Swordsman's Companion, an excellent training manual. Sword and shield is less well covered. The Art of Medieval Swordsmanship translates the I.33 sword and buckler manual, while Medieval Sword and Shield explains it. There are also two excellent articles on the use of large shields in Spada and Spada II. Any of these books is preferable to Medieval Swordsmanship.It is shocking to think that less than ten years ago, academic standards in this field were so low that this dreadful book was actually considered acceptable. There are so many good books in this field, with more being produced every year. The thought of anyone buying Medieval Swordsmanship in 2006 is apalling."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"After reading all the reviews on this particular book I decided to buy it. After the first couple of pages I got the feeling that Mr Clements was full of himself and buy the end I was sure of it. As most I am sure, I was first introduced to sword's via the movies when I was young and even at that young age I knew it wasn't real. Mr Clement's seems to concentrate to much on pointing out the obvious. What you see in the movies is fake and the actors OBVIOUSLY aren't trying to kill one anouther. The book far to much concentrates on degrading and blatently insulting any and all asunder that do not conform to his veiw on swordmanship. The final straw for me was the attack he made on the great fantasy artists Boris and Frazetta. They paint picture's for crying out loud and it's fantasy painting! Of course it's not real Mr. Clements! People that engage in fantasy combat aren't trying to kill one anouther or worry about how authentic there costume's are. They are having fun and that's what they want to do. I have met these kind of people and they don't take thensevles seriously because they just want to enjoy their past time and have fun. This particular book has very little substance to it and often it's instruction is rudely interupted by the auther digressing to attack some form or method he doesn't agree with. I am an enthusiast that has been studying authentic sword play for many year's and I enjoy watching Conan and Xena and read many fantasy novel's and enjoy the art that adorn's its cover's. This book, at the core of it, is a way for Mr Clements to endorse his own method of sword practice as &quot;The only way&quot;. Paladin Press did not do their editing job at all with this book so I did my own and took a black texter to the ranting's of the author and ended up with a much smaller and better book. I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"It's customary for a reviewer to tell some of their experience so I'll just say I am a fencer with an interest in sword history. Nuff said there. Until discovering this book all I could find about European fencing other than the sport kind was fantasy stories and choreography lessons.This book is an enormous store of information that just can't be found anywhere else. The book is not perfect but it doesn't pretend to be and says clearly its directed at many different audiences so not all the material will be relevant to everyone. The book states clearly it is not a how to work or a practice guide (although it practically is!). There is no question that in offering such a range of information and stating what has long been needed to say, John Clemens has done an invaluable service to all of us seriously studying their Western European martial heritage.Beginning with an introduction what is and isn't included in the book, it goes on to give a good overview of medieval warfare and the source material for the subject. Then sword themselves are describe din great detail in a way not previously done, that of a warrior or rather a modern student. The book then goes into the use of the medieval shield and sword with hundreds of lifelike drawings that are better than photos in relaying movement clearly. The same is done for the long swords with even more material presented. There are dozens of terms provided and historical background for almost everything discussed. Not much is less unanswered or uncovered. After about 200 pages it becomes overwhelmingly clear that this is a sophisticated martial art being described and that in spite of all the information included it has only begun to be address. The books rounds out with appendixes on various editorial matters (and gets a little dull here unless you look at the larger context, hardly \\"controversial\\").As for historical references, the book is full of them and it gives constant advice to go and study them. In a general-audience work nothing except a basic bibliography is usually required (and the book provides much more than just that). The fighting material refers back repeatedly to the source manuals and does not bother with trying to footnote every single techniques suggested or every single action a sword can make in combat (which is the same style oriental martial arts books follow in describing their styles).To make the point about how it was historically done you can't help but talk about the faults of how it's done by some people today. About 20 pages out of 340 or so detail the differences in the various styles and approaches to medieval swordsmanship followed today and he offers comments on how they affect the resurrection of western martial arts. He shares his beliefs about how while in the context of each organization their methods and beliefs are sound, they are not necessarily conducive to the study of a real martial art. In doing so he seems to have has garnered the anger of a host of enemies. Seems like the ones crying the loudest at Clement's dead-on critiques and in your face style are the same ones who all this time have done little to nothing in the first place. No wonder they attack the man and not the power of his message. Part of the problem may be that for years we heard only from theatrical fight arrangers and SCA &quot;fighters&quot; about how they were the only ones who had the ancient skills of medieval swordsmen. If the book comes across as too critical about reenactment sports, it could just be the backlash against all the earlier confusion created by the role-players and sportsmen themselves.Having seen the kind of things first hand what for so long has passed for medieval swordplay movies, renaissance festivals, SCA, and fantasy games, perhaps these things needed saying in a blistering manner to make up for it. At the least these popular practices needed to be placed in the context of what the book is conveying, namely the nature of real swords and their historical style of use. Readers need to just open up and learn from this excellent book and knowledgeable author-martial artist.Finally, given the controversy surrounding the range of the reviews above, I feel the need to offer the following. There are disgruntled critics out there who've gotten emotional and personal with their reviews rather than addressing the content or value of the book; Why? Maybe because: 1. the book contained information the id not know (-which made them feel inadequate) 2. the book contained information that contradicted or invalidated the popular ideas they believed )-which makes them feel ignorant) 3. The book contained information which they disagree (but given the first two items above, they now are unsure of and so feel insecure) I've talked to stage performs, role-players and re-enactors who all agreed with the book's characterization of what they saw in the others, but then when it came to their own group or practices they declared it was way off. That's ironic. In summary, this is a powerful and extremely useful book that does what no other comes close to doing. While I would have liked more of some areas and less of others, there is simply no other book that has ever done what this detailed and impressive book has for the subject of medieval swordplay. The author and his work should be congratulated not insulted. It will be hard to surpass."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Untill recently most practitioners of martial arts have never really taken medieval swordsmanship seriously, considering those who practise the skills a little odd .

About half of the book is a modernized, repackaged presentation of various historical resources. And that part, he does quite well.Yes, he is correct, rattan swords do not have the same dynamics as even a wooden practice sword that's shaped like the steel blade, he neglects to tell you *why* various groups choose to use such things in full-speed combat scenarios.

However, John Clements is also painfully redundant, dedicating chapters to concepts that fit entirely in one or two paragraphs. He also spends an atrocious amount of time and ink on slamming stage performers, eastern martial artists, and all martial practitioners in general other than himself and his organization (ironic, seeing as how he stresses in this very book the need for eastern and western martial artists to understand each other when he so obviously knows nothing real of eastern martial arts and insults them all greatly).

A (further) revised edition would probably be in order.My greatest complaint, however, is the amount of ink wasted lambasting &quot;certain rattan-fencing groups.&quot; Well, by that he means the SCA, which is fine, their fencing is decidedly not historically accurate, but the paper spent criticising them could have been better spent on useful, instructional material. In places Clements' vitriol sounds like George Silver foaming at the mouth about Italian rapiers.I'd love to see a new, updated edition, removing the diatribes about the SCA (which, to me, read like a defense or justification for this book...) and replacing that with solid, up-to-date, instructional materials."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"Well, I guess this is better than his last book (it is more in line with his expertise), but once again Mr. Clements gives us a lot of generalizations and a lot of non-specific advice.

I admire Mr. Clements' obvious passion for his subject, and can only regret that this passion seems to have developed into a kind of zealotry.Medieval Swordsmanship is emphatically not a &quot;How-to&quot; manual, being presented in a haphazard, disorganised fashion. It reads similarly to the &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; - but bear in mind that the &quot;Tao&quot; was compiled from random notes after Bruce Lee's tragic death. Mr. Clements does not have that excuse. As a result, although it is of value to the experienced practitioner (who should be able to piece the various sections together), I could not recommend it for the novice. The attentions of a good editor would have greatly increased this book's value.The greatest flaw in this book is not at the technical, but rather at the ethical level. Mr.Clements emerges as an egotistical, self-proclaimed &quot;bad boy&quot; of historical fencing, a wanna-be Bruce Lee railing against &quot;the establishment&quot;. He comes across as a young man trying to make a name for himself, and has, unfortunately, chosen to sling mud at all and sundry in his efforts.His basic approach is to attribute attitudes to his imagined enemies (an extensive list comprising sport fencers, theatrical fight directors, SCA fighters, fantasy role-players, weekend boffer enthusiasts, and so-on) and then spend paragraph after paragraph sledgehammering them into submission. He states and restates, phrases and re-phrases, pours scorn and spits vinegar, until the mature reader quite simply wishes that he would get a life. One can easily foresee this obsessiveness developing into a full-blown messiah/persecution complex.Some of his points along these lines are valid. Some are, quite simply, ludicrous. Many are childishly insulting and undeserved. Few add to the reader's appreciation of Medieval swordplay as a martial art, painting instead a rather sad picture of John Clement's inner life.A pity."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book contains a whole lot of good information.

I especially liked his essays in the appedicies dispelling myths about medieval swordsmanship and the information about the different types of medieval swords, for they were very informative (for example, the often-depicted-as-slow-and-clumsy medieval longsword weighed only 2.5-3.5 lbs. and was really a weapon of great agility and versitility -- i did not know this before reading this book)and made perfect sense. If you are interested in swordsmanship or martial arts at all and are trying to decide whether you should buy this book or not, BUY IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"This book is a general introduction to medieval swords and the practical use of those weapons in a historical context. It is not an extensive or complete 'how to' manual and leaves much, if not too much, for the reader to discover on his own, though there are some good illustrations and explainations of some basic concepts.With the focus on the practical application of what historical swordsmanship might have been, this book may not appeal to those already involved in a recreational or fantasy/roleplaying society that may already have systemized methods of practice and sparring. The author has quite the chip on his shoulder regarding such societies and their methods of practice and play with the sword.This is the primary downfall of the book, that too much page space is taken up by rantings about the historical inaccuracies of theatrical swordplay and recreational societies, who in the opinion of the author, are too concerned with the appearance of the combat rather than the basic effectiveness and practicality of the techniques employed. That is too bad because the potential of this book would have been much better if the writer had spent more time sharing his obviously extensive knowledge of, and experience in swordfighting methods instead of venting to the reader about his frustrations in dealing with other groups.Overall, I found the book to be valuable for reference, but lacking in detail of training methods,practice weapon construction, and tactical applications. The book would have been more useful if it had focused on these things and provided more specific information. A stronger attempt at actual instruction and guidance should have been made, since this is what most readers will probably expect to find when they buy the book."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"As a person new to the western arts, I found this book to be incredibly useful. I feel that this book has given me just about everything I need to begin a more serious approach to training with both long-sword and sword and shield. Those who would seek to become students in western arts would do very well to pick up this book. Not only has it increased my knowledge of western arts, it also peaked my interest to an insurmountable level. This is definately THE book for beginners."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"First off, I believe that &quot;Medieval Swordsmanship&quot; will serve as a valuable source of inspiration and technical advice for many people involved in the recreation of historical European martial arts.Unfortunately, I'm forced to agree with the many other reviewers here who are tired of John's constant disparagements of the practices of other groups and individuals who share his passion for the subject, but not his methodology. In particular, his chapter on &quot;the Problem of Stage Combat&quot; is an object lesson in how to set up a straw man target and cut it down with maximum efficiency.None but the most naive practitioners could possibly confuse the performing art of stage combat with the martial art of historical fencing, and yet John persists in criticising theatrical and cinematic fight scenes on the grounds that they do not resemble his version of ancient European swordplay.He is emphatic many times over in pointing out that learning stage combat will not improve one's ability as a fighter. The fact that it is not SUPPOSED to, that actors learn stage combat in order to tell stories, not to educate their audiences nor master sparring techniques, seems to elude him.In short, John persists in attacking the practice of stage combat on the grounds that it is not a martial art, when it never has been, is not supposed to be, and really has no interest in being used for any purpose other than dramatic entertainment. These constant attacks are unjustifiable and frankly, a waste of energy and space.His other major critique, on the grounds of historical accuracy, is somewhat more justified, though as John himself does (grudgingly) admit, fight directors are increasingly gaining access to the same resources as historical fencers and the cliches of early Hollywood screen fencing are being replaced by more authentic techniques. The fact remains that fight directors work in an industry that frequently demands sacrifice of authenticity (in many areas, not just combat) for safety, aesthetics, and other concerns. The opportunity to create a realistic, historically accurate fight sequence is relished by many modern fight directors, but as yet these opportunities are rare. First and foremost, the fight director is concerned with the safety of his/her performers and with the art of crafting an exciting action sequence.John labours under a misapprehension common to many people who are passionate about their avocations and then see them represented in theatre or on the screen, in that he believes that performance combats misrepresent &quot;his&quot; art to the public.I think that he is missing the point entirely, and I'm growing tired of debating it. John C. has a lot to offer; the sooner he jumps off this particular hobby horse, the better."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"John Clements does a magnificent job on this book, which is a follow-up to his previous title, _Renisance Swordsmanship_. He clearly discusses the various types of weapons used in the Middle Ages (roughly 1100's-1400's) as well as the training that went into becoming a master in their use. Drawing from many period sources that are hard, if not impossible, to find and translate he describes the actual fighting techniques used by the sword masters of Europe. Whether you are a re-enactor, Medieval historian, martial artist, sword collector, or just someone who wants to learn, this is THE book to own! Having read hundreds of books on the martial arts and swordplay, I truly believe that this book will become the standard to which all other books on the subject will be compared."},{"Title":"Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods And Techniques","review":"John Clement's new book &quot;Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods and Techniques&quot; goes beyond the usual considerations of medieval swords as artifacts and, for the first time in depth, considers how these weapons were used, referring to historical records of combat when they are available and relying on experimental practical training when such sources do not exist. It should come as no surprise that much of what we have seen in the movies of medieval combat is entirely wrong, and this book has the potential of undoing much of that damaging misinformation. The use of the single handed sword in conjunction with the shield is considered in depth as is the use of the two handed sword.But, even if you, like myself, are not the physical type and possess little or no desire to actually swing these things, this book remains a highly desirable addition to your bookshelf on the basis of its detailed explanations and diagrams of the types of medieval swords and their evolution. This section is very clearly written and while accessible for the beginning student still remains satisfying for the more advanced enthusiast. Also considered in detail is rarely encountered information on the shields of the period. I find this to be the best work on the medieval sword since the heyday of Oakshott.Aside from its degenerate remains in modern fencing (my opinion), traditional European swordsmanship of these earlier periods, when the sword was in fact a relatively more important weapon than later, has long been a neglected and nearly forgotten field, particularly in comparison with Oriental martial arts. This book may well be the harbinger of a renaissance of a different sort."},{"Title":"Psychopathia sexualis: With especial reference to contrary sexual instinct: a medico-legal study","review":"Though it is difficult to obtain nowadays, this is a classic compendium of some 230 case histories dealing with sexual perversions, presented in often fascinating detail. The terminology may have changed since the compilation of these &quot;pathologies&quot;, which range from lustmurder, &quot;contrary sexual instinct&quot;, (homosexuality) frottage, masochism, sadism, sadomasochism, ideal sadism and pederasty. Though presented in a spare, descriptive, purportedly detached tone, it cannot be denied that Krafft-Ebing's purpose is not to offer an objective analysis, but to assume also the role of a guardian of moral order: a prognostician and theraputician of the deviances and illnesses that menace society. This role can only be fully understood in the context of his time, which unambiguously asserted the type of patriarchal masculinity and the sanctity of the monogamous bourgeois family. Under this standard, any &quot;deviance&quot; from these norms was not to be simply addressed by curative means, but also punitive ones. It would be interesting to put into contraposition the rhetorics and paradigms of Krafft-Ebing and Foucault, who, in more recent years, provided masterful and penetrating insights into the epistemic and discursive formations that have been used in modern society to regulate and police sexual behaviour, as in the nineteenth century's obligation to pathologise homosexuality as an &quot;aberration&quot;, a category rejected in the mainstream of the West. Though it must be of great interest to students of forensic medicine and clinical psychiatry, this study would also be equally appreciated by non-specialist readers who are interested in the subject of sexual deviance."},{"Title":"Networks on Chip","review":"Modern chip-based systems, whether ASICs or FPGA, have grown so large that monolithic designs are often infeasible. Instead, processors, DSPs, IOs, and other functions are implemented as individual units, then connected with some common communication fabric. In fact, single-chip designs now have the same kinds of communication needs met by PC backplanes and by the different kinds of interconnect in supercomputers. This book summarizes the state of the art in NoC research as of the year it was written, 2003.Issues exist at every level, from clock distribution up to programming models and operating systems. Various chapters in this book address all of those concerns. The editors invited a range of experts to contribute chapters in their areas of expertise, in three major areas: methodology, hardware, and software. Each section offers significant food for thought, starting with the first.That introduction, written by the editors, proposes two features are requirements for scalable systems: arbitrary composability, and the linear effort property. The first, being able to attach any component to any other, certainly echoes the ideas of backplanes and LANs. Still, backplane systems have \\"top hats\\" and other special connectors along with the standard interconnection. Likewise I think there's room for more than the one communication path, especially when the chip fabrics offer nearly infinite possibilities for custom communication. The second requirement, that composition require only linear effort instead of polynomial or worse, sounds audacious by the standards of today's designs. If anything, I'd hope for sublinear effort, either by replication of composite sub-assemblies or through use of repetitive arrays of processing elements with regular communication paths.Hardware specifics interest me only as background issues. Instead, the software systems mean more to me, including the real time executives and communication APIs that create higher level couplings between on-chip subsystems. It surprised me, but shouldn't have, that everything from LAN APIs to MPI and supercomputing technologies are on the table. As single chips grow into large scale systems, large scale computing technologies make increasing sense.Jantsch and Tenhunen have assembled a good survey of NoC concerns, with an extensive bibliography in each chapter. Presentation is generally at a high conceptual level, well suited to the book's purpose but possibly disappointing to practitioners with immediate problems to solve. I recommend it to anyone working in the design of complex on-chip systems and their development tools.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"SRT Diver: A Guide for Special Response Teams","review":"As a SCUBA diver and film industry stunt coordinator I found this book to be one of the best I have ever come across.

I mean, even when he works within the same genre, his stories are so drastically different it's almost like you're reading a new author every time. Sailing to Utopia is science-fiction, but it's of a science-fiction that is most unlike that of A Nomad of the Time Streams or The Roads Between the Worlds. Unlike those two, there are no framing sequences, and these don't even have the same characters. What they do have is a largeness of vision that is unparelled in scope. Some comments follow:The Ice Schooner: A world that worships ice while in the midst of an Ice Age and refuses to believe that the ice will ever go away. Okay, I'll buy it. This is a good start, though compared to the other three it pales in comparsion.The Black Corridor: I loved this one. It seems simple enough in the beginning, you know, a guy who is travelling while the others are in hibernation. But the flashbacks reveal something else, and the dreams sequences make the book worth reading. It gets really weird toward the end, but it doesn't matter. A classic.The Distant Suns: The most &quot;normal&quot; science-fiction of the trio, but that doesn't matter, because Jerry Cornelius finally appears! All right! The best of the Eternal Champions in an interesting story about a far away planet with people not unlike themselves. Good, but nothing compared to the Jerry Cornelius quartet (Cure for Caner, Final Programme, English Assassin, and The Condition of Muzak). Hey, White Wolf, why don't you publish these, either as something separate or an addition to the Eternal Champion series! Anybody listening?Flux: Moorcock's short stories tend to inhabit a new catagory of strange, and this is no exception. This time another Von Bek (Max) travels the time stream and discovers some very disquieting things. Ends things on an odd note, but there's nothing wrong with that.Halfway through the series now, and eagerly awaiting Kane of Old Mars"},{"Title":"Sailing to Utopia (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 8)","review":"White Wolf Publishing did a superb job in collecting Michael Moorcock's fantasy work into these beautiful omnibus editions. This volume, eight in the series, contains three novels and one short story, none of which have any obvious connection to the \\"Eternal Champion\\" theme. The tales do have some common elements, however; all four pieces feature a group of travelers fleeing a crumbling or decaying society and looking for solutions elsewhere, or \\"elsewhen.\\"The Ice Schooner depicts a future Ice Age. A small civilization is established on the ice fields, cities are built into crevasses, and trades and whalers ply the frozen oceans in their ice ships. Konrad Arflane, a typically moody and grim Moorcock hero, undertakes a quest to New York to discover why the ice is melting and his civilization possibly coming to an end. A rare example of pure SF from Moorcock; well told and atmospheric, with a perhaps too hasty resolution.The Black Corridor, written with Moorcock's then-wife Hilary Bailey, reads more like a Robert Silverberg novel than Moorcock piece. A group of space travelers in cryogenic freeze are fleeing an Earth where xenophobia and war are destroying civilization. One man remains awake to operate the spaceship, and reflects on his final years on Earth, as the world crumbles around him. This is one of Moorcock's best works, taut, suspenseful, evocative, and horrifying. I've read this one three times since it originally appeared in 1969, and it still has an impact... and I'm not sure I completely understand it.The Distant Suns, a collaboration with British artist and author James Cawthorn, appears in this volume for the first time in the U.S. Again, civilization is crumbling and a trio of space explorers set out to find an answer. (The characters are Jerry, Frank, and Catherine Cornelius, but names aside, they have no apparent connection to the Cornelius characters of Moorcock's other stories.) Written in a hyperventilating pulp style, the purpose here is perhaps to satirize pulp SF clich&eacute;s, but the authors mimic the purple prose of the 40s too closely for my taste, and I quickly tired of this one, skimming through the last hundred pages to get a general idea of the plot. This ranks as one of Moorcock's misses for me... or perhaps I just missed the point.Flux, a short story written with Barrington J. Bayley, describes a near future Europe, again facing imminent destruction, which sends an operative into the future to discover a solution. Anyone familiar with Bayley's work will not be surprised to find this story brimming over with madcap ideas. While not as polished as Bayley's later writings (to say nothing of Moorcock's) this is an enjoyable and thought-provoking tale.Recommended for anyone who enjoys Moorcocks' early SF and fantasy works."},{"Title":"Sailing to Utopia (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 8)","review":"All of the short stories were excellent, but &quot;The Black Corridor&quot; really got the heart moving. Imagine the movie 'Event Horizon' actually done well, heck I think I was hearing things after I finished that piece."},{"Title":"Sailing to Utopia (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 8)","review":"This review is mainly concerning The Black Corridor.I just read it (mostly yesterday and finished it in the bath). It's a shortish story which starts off harmlessly enough, almost blandly, and yet slowly draws the reader in. But by the end...Put it this way, right now I'm surfing around trying to find somewhere or someone I can discuss this story with, ask their opinion, what does it mean? What did they think? Where was the line between reality and madness?How strange that something so short and seemingly unimportant can generate such an emotion. Maybe I need to take some Proditol (read it).I read it, it greatly stirred my emotions, five stars, enough said."},{"Title":"Sailing to Utopia (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 8)","review":"Sailing to Utopia is definately one of Moorcock's best works. It's sparse language and epic plot lines will leave you terrified, yet at the same time you are completely fulfilled. Each story in the novel is fabulous, even though they don't tie in to each other. Moorcock has written concurrent stories with other Eternal Champion novels (Hawkmoon, Corum: the Coming of Chaos), you can't let this influence you in any way of how intense this book is. Instead of having a concurrent plot line throughout, Moorcock's places themes behind his stories that tie them together as one. However, each story is so enriched with life that each one can definately stand alone as an extraordinary piece of writing."},{"Title":"Sailing to Utopia (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 8)","review":"An Orion publication, subtitled Tales of the Eternal Champion Volume 5. It includes The Ice Schooner, The Black Corridor, The Distant Suns, and Flux. So, you get Arflane, Ryan, Jerry Cornelius and Von Bek version of the Eternal Champion in this one volume. This is a pretty eclectic bunch of heroes to throw together in one book."},{"Title":"Forces in Motion: The Music and Thoughts of Anthony Braxton","review":"This book recounts a 1985 tour of England by Anthony Braxton's classic quartet (besides Braxton on the reeds, the quartet featured Marilyn Crispell on the piano, Mark Dresser on the bass and Gerry Hemingway on drums). The author, Graham Lock, accompanied the quartet on their tour. The book includes transcriptions of ten or so interviews Lock did with Braxton as well as with the other members of the group. These are connected with concert reviews, stories of the tour and essays on Braxton's ideas on musical languages, systems of notations, etc. This is not a scholarly book. It is an enjoyable read that serves as an excellent introduction to the work and thought of one of the few musical geniuses that resides on the planet.Braxton holds forth on every aspect of his music (from his innovative solo work to his compositions for four orchestras or the notated composition for one hundred tubas!) as well as on his ethical, political and spiritual beliefs. Some of this stuff will seem pretty out there to most readers but what emerges is a portrait of the artist as a very thoughtful, passionate, and thoroughly engaging man. Braxton and his cohorts are very much worth knowing.One side note- for those of you who are Braxton freaks (as am I) it is worth noting that three of the concerts from this tour have been released on the Leo record label. All three are available from Amazon for your multi-media listening pleasure. They are Birmingham(1985), Coventry (1985) and Quartet (1985). The latter should really be listed as London (1985). I recommend any of the three, especially the Coventry concert. This truly was one of the premier quartets of the eighties."},{"Title":"Forces in Motion: The Music and Thoughts of Anthony Braxton","review":"This is the place from which one should begin their studies of Braxton. Clear, concise, and very readable, it introduces many important concepts that will enable anyone interested in Braxton to develop a greater understanding of his musical universe."},{"Title":"Forces in Motion: The Music and Thoughts of Anthony Braxton","review":"Graham Lock is usually pretty successful in prying beneath Braxton's surface. The almost always very abstract discussions that are filled with Braxton's unique musical terminology and his (and sometimes Lock's) personal theoretical stances are surprisingly rewarding. Lock, try as he might, does not bring Braxton down to earth very often, yet even Braxton's elusiveness usually proves revealing. Lock is surprisingly engaging, and Braxton is eager to have his music understood, though he refuses to simplify it in ways that might detract from the breadth of his personal vision.This book might be a treat to music scholars, and takes an effort on the part of an ordinary reader. However, I think the beauty here is that it sheds an enormous amount of light on how the composer and musician shapes his reality and comes to transcend mundane experience through constantly evolving personal expression. These interviews speak as much to the spirit as to the mind.These albums were recorded during the time of the interviews in this book:Quartet (London) 1985Birmingham 1985(Coventry) 1985"},{"Title":"Forces in Motion: The Music and Thoughts of Anthony Braxton","review":"Locke has managed to overcome a lingering &quot;Braxton-worshipping&quot; hang up and create a livid piece of &quot;jazz&quot; literature.We in Taranaki look foward to the next,or for that matter, any works of post-structural-vibrational-dynamic literature."},{"Title":"Down To Earth Sociology Seventh Edition","review":"This is an excellent book to introduce students into the real world of Sociology. Rather than focusing on theorists and their theories, Down to Earth Sociology focuses on real-life examples and situations in which the reader can relate. The articles are user-friendly, and fun to read. A recommendation for anyone interested in the world of Sociology."},{"Title":"Down To Earth Sociology Seventh Edition","review":"When I teach introduction to sociology, this is the book that generates the most student enthusiasm. Everyone likes it, and many students love it. They often discuss readings not assigned--they've been reading ahead, or reading off the syllabus, for their own information and enjoyment rather than because it's required. Yes, some of the readings are classics, in other words old. But they aren't useless because they describe a past social pattern rather than a current one; any good intro course should give students a feeling for how social relationships vary across time as well as place, historically as well as cross-culturally. It would be nice if Henslin added some newer readings to satisfy those students who think that sociology should be about the now, but that would mean eliminating some great readings or making the book very large. It would also be nice if a few readings could help students understand the sort of quantitative research results that are reported in newspapers and on television news programs. For most courses, I usually prefer to assemble my own bulkpack of articles for students, but in this case, although I might choose different readings, I couldn't choose better ones. Overall, Henslin does an excellent job as editor. The readings show students how sociological concepts and techniques can enrich their understanding of everyday life. And it's reasonably priced."},{"Title":"Down To Earth Sociology Seventh Edition","review":"I read this book because I loved my sociology textbook (also by Henslin) so much. (Yeah, I'm a dork.)

What a wonderful gift to translate these works in English, capturing the essence of the message without jeapordizing the beauty"},{"Title":"The Essential Akutagawa: Rashomon, Hell Screen, Cogwheels, A Fool's Life and Other Short Fiction","review":"Akutagawa Ryunosuke is regarded as one of Japan's most significant 20th century authors, and although his work might seem a bit dated to the savvy 21st century reader, there is no denying the fact that he was a master of the short story form. Chief among his strengths were a remarkable ability to build atmosphere and a knack for tightly-constructed narrative. At his best, he could even be a gifted raconteur, capable of turning an otherwise heavy-handed moral parable into a humorous reflection on modernity and the human condition. Akutagawa was also a tragic figure-- bleak cynicism and bitter irony run throughout his stories, and he eventually committed suicide.Sadly, Akutagawa's stories were among the first translated when Japanese literature became an academic field in America. Not that his stories aren't worthy of translation. After all, who hasn't at least heard of the film 'Rashomon,' the very title of which has entered the English language? The unfortunate aspect of this is that Akutagawa's stories have often been translated by individuals who are far from proficient in the Japanese language. And these decades-old translations are still the only ones available in English, in spite of their shortcomings.Sadly, this recently-published collection of Akutagawa's stories is not the sorely-needed volume of new and skilled translations that the author deserves. Instead, it is a repackaging of the same old versions that have been making the rounds in various volumes of Japanese literature for decades. Granted, there have been a small number of editorial updates. Even so, countless egregious errors in translation still stare forth from the pages of this book ('Cogwheels' is quite literally unrecognizable when compared to the original, and nothing short of incompetent). And far from being an \\"essential\\" volume of the stories of Akutagawa, this could more accurately be described as a rogue's gallery of well-intended misfires in the history of Japanese literature in translation."},{"Title":"The Essential Akutagawa: Rashomon, Hell Screen, Cogwheels, A Fool's Life and Other Short Fiction","review":"The translation is not as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. At times (I can count them on my hand)sentences may seem a little awkward but by no means does this hinder the story telling in any way. Akutagawa's use of language is not full of rhetoric that would be hard to translate. That's the beauty of his work: each line has it's own energy and he doesn't bog it down with flowering up the language. It's subtle, strong and poetic.This book is by far one of the best collections of Akutagawa's work. There are hard to find stories in here and his range as a writer are displayed to the reader. All the stories are great here, and the classics such as Rashomon and In a Grove are included, but the treasures are the visceral \\"Hell Screen,\\" the cultural investigations of \\"The Ball\\" and \\"The Faint Smiles of the Gods,\\" the surreal \\"San Sebastian,\\" the horrific view inside the mind of Akutagawa in \\"Cogwheels\\" and the poetic \\"A Fool's Life\\"plus, all the rest included in the volume are greatly executed pieces literature as well.If you are interested in Akutagawa and would like read more and get closer to the mind of this amazing Japanese writer, definately pick it up. If can find this book, get it. And usually they aren't expensive.I only wish they would issue out new printings so that it was easier for people to get a hold of and share."},{"Title":"The Essential Akutagawa: Rashomon, Hell Screen, Cogwheels, A Fool's Life and Other Short Fiction","review":"Akutagawa Ryunos'k&eacute;--a Japanese modernist writer--uses his subject matter to reflect the social turmoil, loss of identity, and changing environment of his times. Akutagawa lived in a rapidly changing world due to modernization. Some of the most drastic changes that contributed to or were a result of modernism include: the changes in transportation which enabled people to travel in a totally new way and changed people's conception of time, the introduction and assimilation of foreign culture (Western dress and furniture, influence of Western artists, directors, and writers, etc., adaptation of capitalism), and a rise in consumerism which led to the commodification of art forms. His stories in this collection reflect the repercussions of modernization, illustrating the egotistical nature of humanity, the subjectivity of truth and morality, and the struggle with identity due to a changing world.Not only did Akutagawa live and write in an interesting time but he is one of those rare artists whose life is equally engrossing as his work. His family had a history of madness and Akutagawa lived with the constant fear of going insane, his latter works give us a glimpse of his slippage into insanity. These stories are brilliant, painful, sad, and artistically executed. I highly recommend this collection of short stories for it shows Akutagawa's diversity with his craft and its genres include: horror, parables, satires, and autobiographical works. Perhaps more importantly these stories show the nature of man and the flaws of the human spirit."},{"Title":"The Essential Akutagawa: Rashomon, Hell Screen, Cogwheels, A Fool's Life and Other Short Fiction","review":"Akutagawa, while popular in the 70's is near impossible to find good collections of his works nowadays. This collection has some of his more well known pieces as well as my favorites, \\"Cogwheels\\" and \\"A Fool's Life.\\" These two gems are worth their weight in gold. I highly suggest this book for these two masterfully written \\"suicide letters.\\""},{"Title":"The Essential Akutagawa: Rashomon, Hell Screen, Cogwheels, A Fool's Life and Other Short Fiction","review":"A collections of Akutagawa's work that truly is &quot;essential.&quot; Akutagawa breaks down conventional narrative boundaries with such classics as &quot;Cogwheels&quot; and &quot;Hell Screen.&quot; &quot;Rashomon&quot; is a chilling tale of a traveler's encounter with an old thief. What the thief is stealing is what is shocking, and the morals and ethics that Akutagawa explores are extremely interesting.

Recommend it to any British mystery fans."},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"This book, in the Kindle format, is one of the later books in the Tommy and Tuppence series. Agatha Christie does not break up the original grouping of characters, so even Arthur is brought back to play a pivotal role for all that it was not the highlight of the book. Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do."},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"I enjoy a good mystery and this book fills the bill. It is like a collection of short stories that all tie together."},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"It is 1940. England is at war. Blitzkrieg is about to begin. Tommy and Tuppence are being told they are too old for active war service. Their twin offspring Derek and Deborah are of course younger and are in the Air Force and nursing respectively.A Mr Grant turns up at the Beresford flat to offer Tommy a clerical job in the wilds of Scotland. When Tuppence is called out to assist a friend Mr Grant tells Tommy that in fact what he is offering is a spy job hunting down some Fifth Columnist Nazi spies known as N and M. The previous agent on their trail is dead, run down by a lorry. Tuppence is to be kept in ignorance of this venture.Tuppence of course adroitly outwits these attempts to exclude her and joins Tommy in Leahampton where they both attempt to track down N and M, but at the same time both under assumed names and definitely not married. But neither are as clever as they think.This is #3 in the Tommy and Tuppence stories (see below).#1, THE SECRET ADVERSARY, was not published until 1922 but was set mainly in 1919, when World War I was fresh in readers' minds. As I said in my review I thought Christie was probably reflecting contemporary paranoia with Bolshevism and secret agents and conspiracies, and showed a political awareness that we don't often give Christie credit for. THE SECRET ADVERSARY was also Agatha Christie's second published novel and had many signs of an author still coming to terms with her craft.#2 in the Tommy & Tuppence series, PARTNERS IN CRIME, published in 1929, was set mainly in 1925. Tommy now has a desk job with the British Secret Service, and Tuppence, much to her displeasure is at home, though when the Chief of British Intelligence asks them to take over the International Detective Agency, both jump at the chance of new adventures. The fifteen stories contain parodies of fictional detectives who were well-known to readers of the 1920s. In each story Tommy and Tuppence assume the mannerisms and methods of a different detective or detective team, including Sherlock Holmes. The stories are bound together with an overall theme of a rather vague Russian plot. Again Christie appears to be reflecting popular paranoia.So World War II is the perfect opportunity for Christie to add to the Tommy & Tuppence series (and you may want to reflect whether they would have made another appearance without the war) but now Christie is a well established and successful novelist with 30 novels to her credit, so she doesn't wait for the war to end, but publishes N or M? while the issues it reflects are still topical.Once you recognise that, you realise that Christie is reflecting a lot of contemporary thinking. It certainly must have made the average English reader look carefully at those around him. It is a very patriotic novel.Christie introduces the idea of a \\"wooden horse\\", Fifth Columnists, people who are very attracted by Hitler's ideas, a network that has infiltrated English society and infrastructure.N or M, you see, is a term we have heard before. It refers to two of the most important and trusted German agents. We have come across their activities in other countries and we know just a little about them. It is their mission to organise a Fifth Column in foreign countries and to act as liaison officer between the country in question and Germany. N, we know, is a man. M is a woman. All we know about them is that these two are Hitler's most highly trusted agents.\`But there are those for whom we've neither respect nor liking-and those are the traitors within our own ranks-the men who are willing to betray their country and accept office and promotion from the foreigner who has conquered it.'\`We know The Day is fixed. We know, or think we know, roughly, where...(But we may be wrong there.) We're as ready as we can be. But it's the old story of the siege of Troy. They knew, as we know, all about the forces without. It's the forces within we want to know about. The men in the Wooden Horse! For they are the men who can deliver up the keys of the fortress. A dozen men in high places, in command, in vital spots, by issuing conflicting orders, can throw the country into just that state of confusion necessary for the German plan to succeed. We've got to have inside information in time.'Our Leader does not intend to conquer this country in the sense that you all think. He aims at creating a new Britain-a Britain strong in its own power-ruled over, not by Germans, but by Englishmen. And the best type of Englishmen-Englishmen with brains and breeding and courage. A brave new world, as Shakespeare puts it.There are some interesting little cameos too. I was very taken with little Betty Sprot, not yet 3 years old, but exploring language and relationships in a very engaging way.I think it is a very powerful novel in which Christie pins her own colours to the mast so to speak. If there is a weak part, it is the final roundup of information, where Christie ensures that no stone is left unturned for the reader."},{"Title":"N or M?

Her late husband was executed by the British for pro IRA activities and neither she nor her daughter ,the embitteerd Sheila .shows any kinship with the war effort.Shiela indeed openly scorns patriotism and is hostile to the British.Might it be Carl Von Dienam ,a German and allegedly a refugess from Nazi persecution?His scientific background makes him a useful man to have as a spy.How about the mountainous Irishwoman,Mrs O'Rourke -a mysterious and intimidating figure ?Or the hypocondriacal Mr Cailey, a man whose pre war travels in Germany have given him favourable views on the Nazi State.Could the almaost caricaturial Colonel Blimpishness of the bluff \\"Major Bletchley\\" be a double bluff ?Or the vague spinsterish Mrs Minton ,or the Londoner Mrs Sprott with her precocious daughter Betty.And who is the demented Polish woman who kidnaps Betty ,only to be shot by Mrs Sprott who is unexpectedly good with a firearm?And how about the forthright naval man ,Commander Haydock ? is he all that he seems to be .The book exhibits a strong vein of paranoia -the Germans have allies eveerywhere -in the government,civil service ,military etc.It reflects a very similar jumpiness to that in The Secret Adversary ,where trade unions were the focus of the author's McCarthy-ite maunderings.The book is second tier Christie but it has verve and pace and neatly melds thrillerish aspects with the trappings of the \\"whodunnit\\" or traditional mystery.it will give you an enjoyable few hours of reading and genre fans will lap it up"},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"Viciously evil sinister German spies terrorize Britain during WWII. Meanwhile Tuppence and Tommy Beresford investigate and solve a mystery about German spies N and M. I would recommend N or M because it has a complex mystery, suspense and interesting characters.The N or M mystery is very complex because usually in a mystery you are looking for one criminal, but in this you are looking for two. On top of that, there weren't 2 or 3 candidates, there were 10 or 15 suspects. Also these criminals were not normal criminals. They were very determined because they supported the Nazis. One other thing was the criminals looked like normal everyday people . They were good at fooling people like when Mrs. Sprot kidnapped Betty and she pretended she was a mom. Also they studied English to make it look like they were English, not German.N or M has a lot of suspense. For example Mrs. Sprot's daughter Betty was being kidnapped by a mysterious Polish woman. They were near a big cliff and a roaring ocean. You don't know if the Polish woman is armed. Another suspenseful part is when Tommy is at Commander Haydock's house. It is suspenseful because Tommy finds a secret compartment with the telegraph in it and realizes Haydock is a spy. One other suspenseful part is when Tuppence talks to Commander Haydock. It is suspenseful because Haydock was interrogating Tuppence. You don't know if Tuppence will get rescued in time and Commander Haydock has a gun.N or M has many interesting characters like Mrs. Sprot because she is brave. Also you don't know what will happen. She was very good at fooling people. She was smart enough to kidnap a kid. Also Commander Haydock is interesting too because he is a spy so you don't know what he will do next. He is also brave to be a spy because he could get in serious trouble for spying. One other interesting character is Tuppence because she has an amazing mind. Also she is brave for messing with the criminals. Also she is enduring because she doesn't stop when the mystery is hard.N or M is a heart pounding mysterious things and interesting chapters and a unusual setting. I would recommend this book.A Bynum"},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"This story has Tommy and Tuppence serving as spies during WWII. It is the third of five T&T mysteries that Agatha wrote, and fairly typical of the series. In the series, each story has T&T roughly 10-15 years older than the last, so you see how they age and how their adventures change over time. In N or M, T&T are middle aged, too old to enlist and too young to stand by and do nothing. The identities of the baddies were fairly evident to me rather early in the story and Tommy's rescue involves some rather unlikely coincidences (Albert the (former) butler makes a key appearance), but the story has its charms. It provides an interesting perspective on the British view of things during WWII. The anti-German bias is understandable but the characterizations of the Germans are stereotypical and simplistic."},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"Agatha Christie's sleuthing couple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, made their debut right after WWI had ended. \\"N or M?\\" finds the couple middle-aged and in the midst of WWII, desperately hoping to be of service to their country once again, but nobody seems to want them. Then a covert mission comes along that pits the married pair as strangers in a search to find traitors in their midst. \\"N or M?\\" is a fast-paced thriller, different than Christie's usual mysteries, that fans of her fiction will love for its unique if slightly easy to figure out story.When Tommy is approached by the Home Office to discover German spies at a seaside boarding house, Tuppence feels left out and takes matters into her own hands. As disguised guests \\"unknown\\" to each other, the duo tries to figure out who these spies might be, a male referred to as N and a female known as M. There are several candidates, the most likely being a young German scientist who supposedly escaped the horrors of Germany after his family was imprisoned. But the woman who runs the boarding house is certainly of a foreign descent and strange things begin to occur that let Tommy and Tuppence know they are on the right trail even if they have very little to go on. In an era of suspicion and war, everyone is a likely suspect, especially those who claim to be something they are not. And when Tommy goes missing, Tuppence must call upon her wiliest scheme to rescue him and uncover the treacherous spies.\\"N or M?\\" is an enjoyable thriller, its time period perfectly captured by Christie, as it was originally published in 1941, not long after WWII began. It plays magnificently to the fears that existed that German spies had infiltrated English society and that so-called patriots could be turned by the enemy. Christie plausibly fashioned many suspects, and while one identity may surprise, I felt that one was rather easy to figure out since it was the tried and true least likely suspect. All in all, \\"N or M?\\" is a nice thriller featuring Tommy and Tuppenece, although not quite up to par with their earlier escapades."},{"Title":"N or M?

It is the opening days of WWII, England is bracing for the Blitz and all citizens are anxious to \\"do their bit\\". Unfortunately while the twins are away on military assignments, the older Beresfords are deemed to be too old for active service. They are urged to take up service at home, like knitting. Ultimately though Tommy's old contacts pay off - for him at least - he is offered a desk job in a restricted area, Tuppence must remain at home, with the hated knitting.It is later revealed that the desk job is a ruse and Tommy is needed for an undercover assignment. Tuppence is one step ahead as usual and arrives on the scene before Tommy. Together the two work to ferret out a spy ring on the English coast. As always with these two there are deceptions, kidnappings and last minute rescues before the triumphant conclusion.It is nice to see what old friends have been up to in the intervening years and good to see that they haven't lost a step. Christie does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the time, the tension as the war builds and the anxious waiting to hear news of loved ones in peril.There are a couple of problems though for long time fans of this series. Judging from the publication dates of the earlier novels, 1922 and 1929, Tommy and Tuppence are in their early 40s and the twins are 11 years old during this one. Even going by the slighly different time frame listed in this novel the twins cannot be more than teenagers and Tommy would still be very young to be retired.The plot is, as usual for Christie, clever and designed to keep the reader guessing until the end.

She published it in 1941, in the mid of World War II. It is said that she wrote this story while London was suffering under the German air attacks. Agatha never wanted to leave London during these attacks, because she felt too involved. The novel is one of two which the author worked on simultaneously during World War II while she stayed alone in London. She alternated writing 'Body in the Library' and 'N or M?' to keep herself \\"fresh at task.\\"Although not being a big fan of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford I must admit that this story was quite special. This book is one of the few Agatha Christie wrote that have a historical background. It has certainly a nice atmosphere to it. First I was a bit put-off by the amazingly unrealistic espionage rubbish often seen in this kind of books, but discovered to my surprise that some -not all- subplots would not have been miscast in an average Poirot adventure. It was quite refreshing to see that Agatha had put this story in an almost realistic setting: the struggle against collaborators that tried to prepare a German attack on the coast of England.Not the best of her works, but certainly very close."},{"Title":"N or M?

(Great Pan)","review":"Normally Agatha Christie chooses to focus on the mysteries and not really concentrate on political and social events of that period; consequently her characters sometimes seem to be living in a vaccuum, removed from all that is happening around them. What makes &quot;N or M?&quot; unusual is that Christie chose to focus on WWII and what was happening in England at that time. Tommy and Tuppence who are living quietly in London suddenly find their routine interrupted when Tommy is called away on a secret assignment to try and find Hitler's most dangerous agent who has infiltrated England in advance of a planned attack by the Nazis. Of course, Tuppence who refuses to be left out of anything, follows him and actively helps him while posing as a garrulous widow. The book is more powerful than most because of the very real sense of menace that Christie creates and the feeling of evil lurking in the air. Wingding suspense and a knock-out ending - the only flaw was the focus on romance. Normally, it is nice to have a romantic attachment develop in Christie's books as they provide a nice relief to the mystery, but in this case I thought she should have concentrated only on the mystery; romance is almost superfluous in such a setting. It's interesting to think that while Tommy and Tuppence never actually existed, there may have been characters like them - ordinary people who possessed above-average intelligence who were picked to lead dangerous spy missions and who succeeded precisely because they were so ordinary and therefore not what the enemy was expecting."},{"Title":"N or M? (Great Pan)","review":"When one thinks of Agatha Christie, one usually thinks of novels in which a sharp-minded detective--such as Hercule Poirot or Jane Marple--unravels a tightly plotted puzzle from the comfortable safety of an arm chair. But Christie sometimes defies this concept of her work with a spy-thriller, and N OR M?, set during the early days of World War II, is among her best efforts in that direction.The novel re-introduces husband and wife Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, characters Christie originally created for the much earlier spy-thriller THE SECRET ADVERSARY--and they are among her most immediately likable protagonists: quick witted, snappy, and unwilling to sit in an armchair when they can be up and doing things. Although they have been long out of the espionage game, when rumors indicate that one of Hitler's most trusted agents has arrived in England. they are sent to a small coastal boarding house in an effort to unmask the spy who might be hiding among the apparently innocent residents.Readers will enjoy becoming reacquainted with Tommy and Tuppence, who Christie presents with considerable charm--and unlike the other novels in which they appear N OR M? is as much mystery as pure adventure: the book contains one of Christie's trademark twists at the conclusion. Although somewhat mild by the standards of her more famous novels, Christie endows the tale with a subtle sense of menace that serves it well; fans will enjoy the book, and newcomers will have a good time too."},{"Title":"N or M?

(Great Pan)","review":"Tuppence (about the British Secret Service): \\"I don't think the Intelligence is anything like what it was in our day.\\"Tommy (gravely): \\"It will attain its former brilliance now we're back in it.\\"As much as I appreciate M. Hercule Poirot's little grey cells and Miss Marple's insight into human nature, my preferred Agatha Christie sleuths are the fun-loving and very engaging Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Christie, in 5 novels, chronicles their exploits, which, while often containing elements of real peril and intrigue, managed to convey an air of lightheartedness and real fun. And this stems directly from the personalities of Tuppence and Tommy (but mostly Tuppence). Near two decades of married life find them still best pals, still devoted to each other. No change in personalities, either, as Tuppence remains intuitive, quirky, and impetuous while Tommy is solid, practical, and plodding - \\"plodding\\" meaning that he takes his time figuring things out. But he gets there, to the ruin of various so-called clever criminals. Meanwhile, Tuppence's ear for the preposterous surfaces again with the fashioning of her alias. Gotta admit, Mrs. Blenkensop is a pretty silly moniker. Anyway, N OR M? finds the duo back at catching enemy spies.A bit on the plot of N OR M?: Tuppence and Tommy's glorious amateur detecting days are years and years in the past. As we catch up to the Beresford couple, we now find them in their mid-40s and once again inhabiting a war-torn London. The still adventurous couple volunteer but are outraged to find their services spurned by the war effort. Discouraged and feeling useless, they suddenly receive a visit from British Intelligence and are offered a secret mission. Or, rather, Tommy is offered a mission. Tuppence pretty much elbows her way in.A British operative has expired thru mysterious circumstances. His baffling dying words: \\"N or M Song Suzie.\\" British Secret Service has already ferreted out that \\"N or M\\" are codenames for Hitler's two most trusted agents. N and M have been responsible for establishing fifth columns in nations opposed to Germany's warmongering, and it seems one or the other or both are doing their thing in England. N and M's true identities remain veiled in secrecy. \\"Song Suzie\\" might actually be Sans Souci, the name of a sleepy guest house found on Britain's South coast. Tommy's long shot of a task is to take up lodging at Sans Souci and nose around and hopefully unearth a spy or two. Persistence pays off as Tommy and Tuppence (or \\"Mr. Meadowes\\" and \\"Mrs. Blenkensop\\") are soon up to their necks in sinister skulkers, break-ins, kidnappings, and deadly espionage.Reading N OR M?, the Berefords' third outing, is like dropping in on comfy old friends, and Tommy and Tuppence make such charming hosts. I always enjoy re-reading this one. Agatha Christie has always excelled in peeling back the sedate, banal layers of British society to reveal the startling villainy festering beneath. Gradually, the routine of the seaside resort gives way to an atmospheric mood and an air of quiet menace. Written during WW2, the author does her patriotic bit as she has her cast express damning commentary on the appalling rot within the system: English turncoats. The mystery in N OR M? isn't as intricate as in her Poirot or Marple bafflers, but, still, her flair for the clever whodunit, her planting of the odd red herring or two are much in evidence.As usual, she works from an unassuming cast of characters. Who's N, who's M? Is it the blustery Major? The faintly superior landlady or her feisty, moody daughter? The fretful invalid or his fussing wife? The foreign woman who's been spying on the premises? Or the German refugee? Hell, could it be the merry two-year-old girl who enjoys being read \\"Goosey, goosey gander\\"? (well, no, it's probably not her). One letter's identity is stumbled upon, but the other is ferreted out quite nicely in a clever twist. Tommy and Tuppence are urbane and amiable company and make for competent detectives, and I had fun as they bask in the excitement of skullduggery afoot. But these two are now mature enough and have lived long enough that they aren't any more as frivolous in nature. They still live in the moment, but they comprehend the gravity of this war.Whereas Poirot and Marple always seemed old but never aging, Christie does pile the years on Tommy and Tuppence with each progressive thriller/mystery. In five novels (The Secret Adversary, the short story collectionPartners in Crime (Tommy and Tuppence Mysteries), N OR M?, BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS., andPostern of Fate) Christie has Tommy and Tuppence go from the bloom of careless youth to spry middle years and finally on to graceful old age. I've mentioned that the Tommy and Tuppence mysteries had a fun, breezy quality to it, and that definitely holds true for the first three books. But there's a change of pace and feel with the last two books. In BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS and the elegiac THE POSTERN OF FATE, Tommy and Tuppence are decidedly getting along in years, although still with all faculties intact. There's a melancholy, bittersweet flavor in these last books, which satisfyingly round out the lives of this fictional couple. Because I witnessed Tommy and Tuppence get old, they seem more real and resonate more with me than her other, more celebrated detectives. N OR M? finds them a bit long in the tooth but still delightful and still very effective at what they do, even as they have fun in the doing of it. Carpe diem, Tommy and Tuppence."},{"Title":"N or M?

GraffWhat Is Marriage For?(Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1999)(ISBN: 0-8070-4114-9; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: HQ734.G716 1999)This book is a careful study and critique of the roots and branchesof the institution of marriage as known in the Western world.When we review the early patterns of traditional marriage,we see how far we have already come.Marriage has changed and it will continue to change.The author is a lesbian in a long-term committed relationship,which could be a marriage if same-sex partners were permitted to marry.A computer search discloses that there areover 1,000 references to marriage (spouse, husband, wife, marriage, etc.)in US federal laws and regulations.Graff argues it would be easier to giveall these rights, responsibilities, and privileges to same-sex couples(if they choose to marry) as a packagethan to re-write all the laws one by one to grant all or most of these rights.Many Scandinavian countries have already granted the right to marryto same-sex couples, sometimes with a few exceptions such asthe right to be married in the state church,the right to adopt children, or to get tax-supported fertility services.But even such exceptions are likely to be abolished.The United States has not adopted same-sex unionsas readily as other advanced countries,but even we are seeing the beginning of such rights in some states.Wherever same-sex marriage has been allowed,no noticeable or measurable effectshave been observed on heterosexual marriages.Thus the federal \\"Defense of Marriage\\" Act is a complete misnomer.It does not protect marriage in any sense.It merely says that same-sex couples may not have their legal marriagesrecognized by all statesif some states decide to grant such rights and responsibilitieswithout regard to the sexes of the partners.Marriage was originally created as a cultural institutionbecause of the belief that sex ought to be registered and regulated--in large part to protect the rights of childrenwho often resulted from sexual intercourse.But now even the most conservative religious groupsrecognize that sex and marriage can be for non-procreative purposes.If marriages can legitimately be directed toward sexual fulfillment,then lesbians and gays also qualify.Every society ought to have laws protecting children.But heterosexual marriage as the only context for raising childrenhas now largely become a pattern of the past.Less than half of American children live with both of their biological parents.Adoption is permitted by single people and increasingly by same-sex couples.Children don't need fathers as much as they neednon-abusive, involved, caring parents.And, of course, gay and lesbian people can be good parents.If we are concerned about good parenting,perhaps we should train and license all adults who wish to be parents.Simply being a heterosexual coupledoes not magically grant the ability to raise children.Graff observes that many of her gay and lesbian friends are becoming parents--by taking over the parenting of children born to one of them,by adopting children already alive, or by artificial insemination.Experience shows that these children of gay couplesdo not become gay any more often than the general population.And the quality of the parentingshows the same range as for heterosexual couples.The church and the state have long struggled over who controls marriage.In the West the state has basically won the battle to register marriages.But some churches still insist that their regulations are paramount.However, in ever-increasing numbers even heterosexual couplesare deciding to avoid legal, state-defined marriageand are creating their own more personal and flexible relationships.In the Middle Ages--when the Church controlled the definition of marriage--it sometimes took years to get a decisionabout the validity of a particular purported 'marriage'.In the meantime people kept having babies and changing their relationships.To help clear up this chaos of private marriages,beginning in the middle 1700s various governments in the Westestablished rules for the creation and registration of marriages.In frontier America, it was hard to enforce rules about marriage,so common-law marriage was also recognized:If a couple held themselves out to the public as married,by virtue of being together for a certain number of years,legally they were the same as any other married couple.In places like Ireland,which only recently recognized divorce and remarriagebecause of the eternal opposition from the Roman Catholic Church,people were ending their unsatisfactory marriagesand going on to create new couples and new groups of childrenwithout involving either the state or the church.The first feminist movement in the United Stateswas very critical of the marriage laws of the time,which granted all property rightsand control of the marriage to the husband.These laws have largely been modifiedto allow women to own property in their own names,to run their own businesses,to refuse to have sex with their husbands, to get divorced, etc.Both in law and in practice,couples are now able to create their own patterns of marriage.And more and more couples are demi-marriedbecause they do not fulfill all of the requirementsfor an official legal marriage in their jurisdiction.So why can't same-sex couplesdefine their committed relationships as marriage?Given all the changes in marriage customs and lawsthat have already happened,it seems likely that soon same-sex couples will be allowed to marry.Men and women are equal in most modern marriages.The man no longer owns the woman.So why should not two men or two women be permitted to marry?Graff says that she falls in love with womenas easily as most women fall in love with men.So it seems entirely natural to her to insist on all the rights of marriage,not some watered-down version called \\"domestic partnership\\".No history of marriage could be complete without an account of divorce.The Roman Catholic Church has long tried to enforcethe one-marriage-for-life rule.But most civil laws now recognize the possibility of changing partners.Each jurisdiction has its own rules and regulations for divorce,many focused on the rights of childrenand the economic rights of the former partners.When same-sex partners are permitted to marry,they also will need the protection of divorce law.What is marriage for?It reflects the deep commitment of two adult persons.If so, two adult persons of the same sex can qualify.If you are

For?","review":"A very interesting book about the history of marriage and what this history suggests for the arguments surrounding gay marriage. It really opened my eyes up that what some call \\"traditional\\" marriage is hardly traditional at all in the context of human history where \\"marriage\\" took a variety of forms."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I thought this was a very entertaining look at the history of marriage and how it has changed through the years. It is full of interesting stories that really open your eyes about how much things have changed throughout the centuries. It is very informative, but still a quick read.The only thing that I didn't like about the book is that some of the facts that she brings up are not cited, and also, I think there are some factual errors here and there throughout the book. For example, she talks about how married couples would have been growing the same potatoes in the same fields as their parents for thousands of years...but potatoes aren't native to Europe, they were imported from America. Also, it seemed like she dismissed peasant marriages as not important, and yet I think of contemporary artwork (such as Pieter Brughel's painting of the peasant wedding feast) that seems to contradict this.However, despite these minor flaws, it is still probably one of the best books I have ever read on the subject, and so I still give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I was never that interested in the same-sex marriage debate until I learned of the legal protections that are automatically granted straight people when they marry.

Similarly, I enjoyed Graff's biting witticisms but also found it was overdone at times."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I really enjoyed this book and can't say enough good things about it.

However, I would like to make an observation on what others have said about this book: It's only the straight people who think that Graff \\"overdoes it sometimes\\" or \\"beats people over the head with.(..)\\" her remarks on same-sex marriage. This is yet another example of how straight people just can let it go. Please, for once, stop trying to control the lives of gay people. Let us love in peace. You people are the ones with all the power in the world. You have absolutely no room to talk. You can't even dream of what it is like to be hated and oppressed. (...)"},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I picked up this book for the history-of-marriage value instead of the same-sex-marriage-propaganda value, and found the history and debated &quot;reasons why people have historically married&quot; to be rather uninformative. A lot of what was said seemed common knowledge about basic history of society. Marriage concepts are talked about generally more often than not. I would have liked to see more hard core facts rather than musings and contemplations. I was hoping for statistics to be sprinkled liberally, and perhaps many tales of certain marriages in the past that stood out either as especially abnormal for a time period, or exceedingly typical."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"While E. J. Graff gives a broad social history of marriage, she does not delve deeply enough into the religious history of marriage which leads to errors in her arguments. From her book, one could conclude that the Catholic Church did not consider marriage to be a sacrament until the 13th century. However, Terullian in the 2nd century wrote, \\"Whence are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified.\\" Lacking this foundation of the essence of marriage in the Christian Church which so heavily influenced our society, she cannot argue for what marriage is for because she does not know what marriage really is."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"What I expected was a well researched history of marriage laden with colorful commentary, humorous ironies, and insightful analysis. What I discovered is a heavy-handed argument for gay and lesbian marriage that is tedious to slog through.The author makes much of the fact that a)marriage has always been a strictly controlled institution that generally has financial implications; and b)that the institution has undergone constant, radical change. Somehow, this is supposed to support the thesis that states should revise their laws to include same-sex marriage. Somehow, I missed the logic.On one hand, since marriage has always been strictly controlled by the state, where's the injustice in the fact that it is still strictly controlled by states who allow only heterosexuals to marry? And on the other hand, while marriage has survived constant change through the ages, one thing has never changed: it has always been a heterosexual institution.My bottom line: flawed logic expressed in a pedestrian writing style makes for very dull reading."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I picked up this book when I was having doubts about my friends' upcoming nuptials - I had hoped it would give them something to think about before they made that major step. I examined it more closely and realized it was a much more interesting book than that! The author has throroughly researched the various reasons marriage has existed as an institution (in Western civilization) and presents a compelling case in favor of same sex marriage as well. I was already in favor of same sex marriage, but now I have ammunition! It's lively, amazingly researched, and also full of facts you just don't get in history class. A must-read for social history buffs, gay-rights advocates, or anyone who wonders about relationships today."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"The historical overview Graff provides covers not only the institution of marriage itself, but also the wide spectrum of gender roles that have been standard in past Western culture. (For example, the idea that the wife should stay at home didn't occur to anyone until Victorian times brought along industry and 14-hour factory jobs!)The author writes a fine history, quoting original sources and backing up her information, in a tone conversational and interesting enough for even a reader like myself, usually terrible at reading history books, to follow and enjoy.Her overview of polygamy is the only thing in this book that fails. The overview is brief, and the only examples given are the Mormons and the Oneida commune. I might opine that she neglected this area on purpose. Part of this book's thrust (perhaps ten percent of the text is focused on it) is providing factual support for the idea that marriage between two people of any gender is simply the next natural consequence of the changes in our society and economy. The critics of this idea often use the negative media image of polygamy to their credit.I'm guessing that she glanced over it in order to keep this argument at bay -- which is a pity, because the book could have been stronger with an actual refutation, citing historical and modern examples of polygamy in their societal context. But at least she is careful enough with her language that she does not tar all multi-person couples with the same brush.Aside from this qualm, I'm quite satisfied with the text as a whole, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a better understanding of marriage and gender roles throughout the ages in their economic and social context."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"This book is a wonderful read. It talks about the history of marriage in a way that is incredibly engaging, and also grounded in careful historical research. There is no other book which presents the history of marriage in the US and Europe in this way; most such books are quite dry but not this one. The author uses the wide variety of functions of marriage over the years to craft a persuasive argument in favor of allowing marriage by same-gender couples. But the book is much more than that! It discusses religion, economics, law, and a host of other social phenomena as they have related to marriage over the centuries, in a format that is brilliantly organized and eminently readable. This book makes a great wedding present or birthday present. It is timely and important. Marriage is the subject of much public policy discussion these days, and this book gives readers an informed, nuanced perspective on the institution. It is especially strong in pointing out the ways that what many of us think of as &quot;traditional marriage&quot; has changed over the years. The author shows, in her entertaining way, that many of the things we take for granted as part of &quot;traditional&quot; marriage (like Love, for example), actually are rather recent additions to the elements of marriage. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"Like Graff, my daughter is a lesbian in a committed relationship, and it angers me that she is prohibited from marrying the person she loves. I was delighted to find this book exploring the changing purpose of marriage in the western world from Roman times to the present and read Graff's case that the battle over same-sex marriage is just the next iteration in a centuries-old line of views of what marriage is for.Graff never claims that her book is a balanced history; she lets readers know right up front that she is gay and that her purpose for doing all the research and writing was to present her argument that same-sex marriage should be legal. Anyone (like an earlier reviewer) who is surprised by that simply wasn't paying attention.Graff's writing is both informative and lively, with plenty of facts interspersed with anecdotes and human interest. I already agreed with her premise so I didn't need to be persuaded, but she makes her case so well that it's hard to see how anyone could read this book and still believe gay people should be denied the right to marry. Even for those who are already believe that, the book is well worth reading. Now I can back up my assertion that same-sex marriage should be legal with a persuasive argument based on historical fact: What conservatives call \\"traditional marriage\\" is actually less than 100 years old, and this is the logical next step in its evolution.This is an excellent book that belongs on the bookshelf of everyone who believes in human rights."},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"As the debate over same-sex couples' freedom to marry rolls from state to state, much of the discussion is framed in terms of the \\"purpose\\" and \\"definition\\" of marriage. Opponents claim that legally recognizing same-sex couplehood will somehow change the definition of marriage, while proponents say that civil marriage (as opposed to religious concepts of marriage) merely reflects centuries of change.Lesbian-feminist author E.J. Graff tackles that issue head on in her new book, \\"What is Marriage For?: The Strange Social History of Our Most Intimate Institution,\\" due for release in June by Beacon Press.Graff's book is a welcome addition to the debate, which, on the proponents' side, has been advanced almost wholly by men. The most public voice has been that of Andrew Sullivan, former editor of The New Republic. Sullivan certainly has his own appeal. He serves as an effective foil to social conservatives, because he can counter them in their own language. But the other voices --primarily constitutional attorneys and social critics -- have also been male.When I heard that Graff was writing a book, I was instinctively pleased that a woman's view was finally to be added to the conversation. My only exposure to Graff's work has been through her many fine op-ed pieces; I suspected that she'd do a reasonably good job. However, op-ed writing is a specialized craft, keyed to the pithy observation, made in 500 words or fewer. Thus, I wasn't prepared for the depth of scholarship that Graff deftly wields in this book. Nor was I prepared for her skilled interweave of the personal, the wry, and the scholarly.This book seems to flow directly from Graff's regard for her partner, Madeline, with attendant curiosity about the \\"fit\\" of her relationship in today's society. It's unusual to find a book of this seriousness that so explicitly celebrates the challenges, the joys, and the hard work of couplehood. As such, this book should serve as an important touchpoint, and not only for participants in the debate over legally recognized same-sex marriages. Graff's book illustrates an important point: Much of the most incisive writing about marriage and couplehood is coming from gay and lesbian writers, who are adding much-needed clarity. One of the greatest ironies of the late 20th Century is that gay people are often the most impassioned advocates for committed couplehood.E. J. Graff is one such voice.Graff traces the history of marriage from the Old Testament Hebrews, to 19th Century Utopians, through to today. Though some critics may take fault with specific historical interpretations made by the author, the broader sweep of her inquiry will be much harder to challenge. Her conclusion is clear: marriage is a complex, shifting institution that has always reflected local understandings about things like money, sex, babies, kin, order, and, in Graff's final chapter, \\"heart.\\"Most tellingly, Graff finds that shifts in perceptions about marriage have often produced just the kind of tumult we're now witnessing over legal recognition of same-sex marriages. She writes that such past commotions have reflected rear-guard actions.Graff writes:\\"Disease, bestiality, incest, polygamy; a flagrant violation of the very definition of marriage; threats to children, family, society, and civilizations; God's coming punishment for sin: These same apocalypse-now charges are hurled in every marriage battle. Are such predictions any more true now than when they were, say, when early Christians advocated celibacy; when nineteenth-century women struggled to control their own wallets; or when twentieth-century feminists worked to legalize birth control? Such outcries are always a backlash against social and economic changes that have already taken place.\\"Graff's book is an unusual amalgam of scholarship and popular writing: just when the more casual reader is about to drown in a sea of historical fact, Graff throws a life vest. She applies a liberal sprinkling of \\"In other words . . .\\", and \\"To put it differently . . .\\", that takes a convoluted set of facts and adroitly compacts and clarifies them for the reader. What I had at first thought to be an annoying writer's tic became a signpost that I counted on.This book is too centered, gentle and scholarly to be to be labeled a polemic. But \\"gentle\\" isn't a synonym for \\"timid\\" -- she directly engages feminist critics of marriage in a way that no male writer could hope to do. Her work should have a direct and salutary effect on the conversation amongst women.\\"What Is Marriage For?\\" comes at a critical time, with an upcoming court decision in Vermont, and the expectation of a noisy electoral battle in California. This book is a must-read for many kinds of readers: marriage advocates, politicians, researchers, writers, feminists, couples, and, most surprisingly, non-gay people who may find their own understandings of marriage and family life reflected in this important book.--John Wilkinson Co-founder and former Director of the Legal Marriage Alliance of Washington"},{"Title":"What Is Marriage For?","review":"I expected this book to be kind of dry and boring, but it turned out to be absolutely fabulous.

He enjoys working for Paul Vannorsdell, but has plans of moving North with the women he loves to open a new ranch and create a new life. Vannorsdell has big dreams too. He wants to buy the Rancho de Cava from an old friend, Don Francisco. Eeverything seems to being going to plan until Don Francisco is found dead by Bullet Creek. Vannorsdell is suspect number one and soon a war erupts and Navarro finds himself in the middle of a torrent of lead...This is the second book to feature Navarro and like the first it's full of action. All though the book Peter Brandvold carefully gives clues as to who killed Don Francisco, only thing is he masterfully points the finger towards a number of different people which makes the book difficult to put down until the truth is revealed.So a book that reads like a murder mystery yet never looses touch with the fact that it is foremost a western. A book filled with strong characters of both sexes on both sides of the range war. People struggling to survive the violent situation they find themselves in and unmask a killer.A great read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ralph Compton Bullet Creek (Ralph Compton Novels)","review":"This is the second book I've read about Navarro. It was a well written story.

His brilliant early performances contrast his later portrayals as his manic depression (and the mis-prescribed medications destroys his body) takes over his mind. The book covers every aspect of Brett as Sherlock Holmes but does not delve into his earlier life or roles. A MUST HAVE for all Sherlockians everywhere, I re-read it often. Photos provide a record of the struggle Jeremy had with his weight, depression and the dangerous drugs used to manage his mental state. More like Holmes than he probably realized in the beginning, the two men became intertwined forever. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bending the Willow Jeremy Brett","review":"Calabash Press will be reissuing BENDING THE WILLOW in a new and updated edition in January, 2001. This book is a moving and informative account of the making of the landmark television series and also describes the difficulties of keeping the quality of the series consistent over ten years through management changes (always the bane of film production) and the declining health of star Jeremy Brett.Television is still considered a 'second class' medium, so this wonderful series has not received the praise it deserves. Not a single one of the filmmakers were ever awarded for their work, an amazing omission. The best episodes of this show are fine films in their own right, and one does not have to be a Sherlock Holmes fan to enjoy them.BENDING THE WILLOW is well worth adding to any library of film production books and is also of great human interest."},{"Title":"Bending the Willow Jeremy Brett","review":"This book gives the reader an unique perspective into Jeremy Brett's talent and genius. His portrayal of the master sleuth is one of the best in the world even though his own nature was the sort to never &quot;cross the street&quot; to meet Sherlock Holmes if he were a real person. Brett's acting abilities are partially displayed to its true immensity in this book. Finally, a book that gives Jeremy Brett the credit he so rightfully deserved and deserves."},{"Title":"Bending the Willow Jeremy Brett","review":"I was fortunate to be able to get Bending The Willow through my Library as I can't afford the $100 it's being sold for. My review is for fellow fans wondering if this book is worth them shelling out their hard earned money for it:).As a big fan of both Jeremy Brett the actor as well as his masterful portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, I was anxious to read this book. The book, for the most part, was very well written and informative as to the years the Grenada production was being filmed, as well as Brett, Burke, Hardwicke and co feelings, thoughts and memories on the production. The photos alone are fantastic.I have a few minor foibles with the book-and they are few. Mainly-the length-166 pages-I feel that it should have been a little bit longer, and more descriptive. I felt the author, like many fans, thought that the last three seasons were inferior and he therefore glossed over them, where as Davies went into quite a bit of depth with season one.As a biography-Davies one on one insight into Jeremy Bretts personal life and actions were delightful and mostly insightful, but I do feel the author repeatedly kept focusing too much on Jeremy's weight gain. While the weight gain was an issue (for the actor, the show and some fans)-too much is made of it as Mr Brett was such a phenomenal actor that his brilliance shone through-even at his lowest times of illness.Therefore-I would recommend the book to the diehard Jeremy Brett fan, though I only wish there was a little more for the money.4.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Bending the Willow Jeremy Brett","review":"Ever wonder about the man who portrayed the Great Detective so well on the Granada series of Sherlock Holmes - who was Jeremy Brett?'Bending the Willow' addresses these questions by telling us about Jeremy Brett - his background and influences - and most particularly by focussing on his years spent on the television series and the difficulties he had then, and throughout his career, with debilitating bouts of manic depression and poor health which continued until his death in 1995."},{"Title":"Your prayers are always answered","review":"First person experiences as told to a reporter.

As a native Nebraskan living in Kansas, I found the geographic setting superbly detailed and the historical background rich in detail. I also found the main character, Lute North or &quot;Little Chief,&quot; to be interesting and engaging. My only disappointment was the final confrontation between the book's two main adversaries - it was a bit anti-climatic. I also would have liked to see an Afterword containing the author's comments on the actual history behind the book.Overall, I found this book carrying me away to the plains in search of hostile Cheyennes. I hope the author continues the adventures of Lute North!"},{"Title":"The Mormon doctrine of deity: The Roberts-Van der Donckt discussion, to which is added a discourse, Jesus Christ, the revelation of God : also a ... utterances on the being and nature of God","review":"Latter-day Saints do not have a strong apologetics tradition. Basically, we say &quot;Read the Book of Mormon, pray over what you have read, and then be honest with the answer you receive.&quot; (Book of Mormon, p. 529-530; Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 61-62) And this is how it should be. Truth should be so easy that a child should understand it; and when you bring in lawyers and doctors and philosophers and whatnot to &quot;help&quot; and &quot;clarify,&quot; you are in trouble.This debate between Elder B. H. Roberts (the presidency of the Quorum of Seventy Apostles, i.e. a general world leader) with the Rev. Van der Donckt is therefore unusual, and this singularity is what makes this book fascinating reading.Chapter One is a straightforward elaboration of what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes about God the Eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. Chapter two contains a reply from the Rev. Van der Donckt to Elder Robert's teachings. The rejoinder not only constitutes a Catholic reply, but also serves as a response embracing the quote-unquote &quot;traditional Christianity,&quot; inasmuch as both Protestants and Catholics (generally) subscribe to the same creeds-Nicean and Athanasian.Chapter Three is Elder Robert's rejoinder to the Rev. Van der Donckt reply, and it is in this rejoinder you see the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ's position. For example, the creeds hold that God is unchanging, but Elder Robert's points out that Christ is God, and the Reverend's position is that God is unchanging. But Christ started out as spirit, was then born (incarnated), then was crucified, and then resurrected. So he gained, lost, and regains this body, and isn't that a change? (P.95)Boing!The rest of the books contains statements from church presidents Joseph Smith, Joseph F. Smith, Brigham Young and LDS apostle Orson Pratt, plus a chapter comparing religious traditions vis-&agrave;-vis Jesus Christ.The Prophet Joseph Smith said, &quot;By proving contraries, truth is manifest.&quot; (History of the Church 6:428) This debate proves that, and this book would be useful for review and pondering for Saints and the curious anywhere.The type is readable, being a facsimile edition of the original book. They did a good copy of the text, and kept the same pagination so you can compare with earlier editions. But I wish they had found a better picture of Elder Roberts for the cover-I know there are better ones out there..BIAS: my philosophy professor Dr. David Paulsen, who also worked on the BYU Studies edition of &quot;The Way, The Truth, The Life&quot;, writes the introductory essay.

One can not escape the similarity in these statements. In many ways, religions throughout human history have taught that men either were or would become deities themselves, contradicting God. The Mormon view of God is perhaps the most direct expression of this concept in modern times. It is in contradiction, however, to the clear expressions of God in the Scriptures. How one man may fare in a debate, as in this work, is irrelevant to how a religion fares when compared to the clear statements of the God they claim to worship. It is the avoidance of addressing these issues that is the ultimate failing of this book."},{"Title":"Rome on the Euphrates;: The story of a frontier","review":"In this book, Freya Stark recites her travels in the Middle East as she stops near the important cities and battlefields that marked the fluctuating borders between Rome and Parthia. A good scholarly presentation that is backed by strong historical evidence and research.The book reviews Rome's first contact with Parthia under Sulla in the early 1st century B.C. to the time of the Byzantines and the Sassanians. Stark argues that the Euphrates river marked the geo-political limits of each empire and that incessant warfare between them was only a waste of resources as neither had the ability of expanding any further. Stark also covers how the military tactics of each state were a disadvantage against their enemies. Rome's strongest military asset was its infantry and its ability to conduct extended sieges but the legions were slow, with limited range, and vulnerable to cavalry. Parthia's main asset was its heavy cavalry and archers that could cover vast distances rapidly. The Parthian empire was a disadvantage to Roman legions as the territory was vast and primarily suited for cavalry engagements: legions such as Crassus' at Carrhae could easily be outmanevered, enveloped, and crushed. Parthia's cavalry on the other hand was of little use in confined territories and even less useful in laying sieges: Parthian invasions into Roman territories therefore tended to be short and more akin to raids and skirmishes than full invasions.This is a good book on studying the frontier between Rome and Parthia and how it affected both empires. Stark's arguments are well supported by historical texts and other evidence: her research is sound. The reading is not purely a scholarly lecture and so can be read by someone who has little to no knowledge of Roman history."},{"Title":"Rome on the Euphrates;: The story of a frontier","review":"Freya Stark is a wonderful writer and a delight to follow along her outrageous travels, but her scholarship holds too closely to her citings from a rich variety of sources, and while it proves she has done her homework it lacks conviction. It wanders. It digresses. It strays too far from her own natural gift for language, which would be put to better use in descriptions of her own. She could tie up all the ends and commit herself to the process, instead of leaning on ancient historians. She would like, herself, to be considered an historian, but she doens't really qualify: she wants it both ways and it doesn't work. Otherwise, I adored the book because it just happens to deal with a region I know and love, but I had to invest my own enthusiasm, and my own references, for weaving some sense into it."},{"Title":"Embroidery Machine Essentials - Quilting Techniques: Jeanine Twigg's Companion Project Series: Book 3","review":"This book came free with my embroidery machine.

It isn't something too complex: you have a few things that have been recovered from the TRASH, and these things weren't considered too important to the people throwing them away. The things are important, however, in the sense that they tell us the story of us. Sometimes there might be a shopping list with something meaningful written on it or a love letter that was found that said something about a time when things were beautifu for two people just learning to swim. It could be something different as well: you never really would know, would you? I mean - what have you thrown away without thinking? Did you draft a break-up letter or something filled with emotion? Did you record feelings and not think what would happen if someone else read them?How good or horrid have you been lately?The last book and this book are esentially extensions of one another, with the world boiling down to the science of the find. Sometimes we are moved by what is dug up, sometimes we find pity or hate or something we connect with. But a lot of this is what we, ourselves, would dispose of, too.I've always wondered what had to be dug through to make this book - something that is a grand entry into the heart of mankind - esentially making us feel in the process? I know they have to find a lot of junk while didgging for something golden - sometimes they show a little of that but it all points back to what we esentially are - and I can only imagine what it has taken to make two books and a magazine of things of this nature. And I also wonder what makes something beautiful - they sometimes give a story of how something is found and, without it, I wouldn't have thought of singling that piece out.When it was singled out, however, it was beautful and needed in some way.All of these words are saying that these are good reads, and that they devle deeply into the us that is there when we don't know anyone is watching. Unlike a Postsecret, where you tell your secrets and have some say, this is found material. You have no control over what is there and neither do the onlookers. It is simply there, looking back at them. I like that feeling, that private curtain unfurled, and I like the fact that things with meaning are looking at me from a book nobody expected.In other tomes, people enter things. Here, things enter an archive. In a way, its beautiful because, like much of history, it is not what we would want to show of ourselves that is really what we are."},{"Title":"Found II: More of the Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World","review":"Very Interesting.

She had heard about the book from some local radio station. At first the basic premise of the book didn't sound too intriguing. It sounded like a book full of trash. Essentially, that is what Found is, but trash that tells stories. Love letters, photos, shopping lists, homework (one kid handed in a report on a certain part of the male anatomy) etc. Some finds are funny. Some tragic. Some heartwarming. Think of the finds as short stories, sometimes conisisting of only a few words. Or better yet, windows into the lives of others. This is one of those books that is fun to just pick up and flip through making it a perfect \\"coffee table\\" book. I took the first Found book to work a few years ago and was constantly lending it to people (or rather leaving it around while people couldn't help but be intrigued) who would soon be showing me their favorite finds. After reading this book you will never look at trash the same way again. I constantly scan the streets in search of my own finds worthy of Found Magazine. So far the most interesting thing I've found is a name tag that says \\"Pastor John Issacs.\\" I wore it around work for awhile as a joke before it broke and another card behind the one that said \\"Pastor John\\" spilled out. It said \\"Elizabeth Jenson\\". Why did Pastor John have Elizabeth Jenson's nametag? Duel-Identities perhaps? You make up the story. The same goes with many of the finds in this book.

That's what makes it so remarkable. Indeed, how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages? This work by Davy Rothbart, co-editor Jason Bitner, and all the Found crew deserves praise because this is a cross-section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials.

But, after I'd raced through it, after I'd let a little time pass, I kept on picking the book up, and every time I found something I hadn't seen before. An expression in a photo. A strain is someone's handwriting. A painfully significant crossed-out line.This book is a terrific follow-up to the first FOUND book, and well worth whatever the cost. It's packed with new finds (including a few from yours truly), filled with hope and sadness, and serves as a stunning collage of a worthwhile existence.I'm going to dinner."},{"Title":"Found II: More of the Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World","review":"Found II is a great book!

The two books serve as \\"bookends\\" for the First World War. Tuchman's covers the first month of the war, August, 1914, when it was a war of movement, and there were possibilities for a quick ending. \\"Glory\\" was much on the minds of the elites of Europe, as well as the men who fought for them. By 1918, the Glory had long gone, save for some new arrivals from across the Atlantic. As Pitt states, that was one of the two major developments that changed the dynamics, and possible \\"winners\\" of the war, and once again the outcome was as finely balanced as it was in 1914. Due to the Russian revolution, and the withdrawal of their troops from the Eastern Front, this gave the Germans the opportunity to transfer their troops from the East, and throw everything they had at the Western Front, in the hopes of beating the English and French before the arrival of the Americans in substantial numbers. The author tells the drama of this story well.Pitt sets the stage for the final year, aptly describing the immense gulf that existed between the officers and men who were fighting. Consider: \\"By this time, it was the Staff who were regarded by the British front-line soldier as his main enemy (a not uncommon development in any army) and for them he nursed a bitter hatred and an undying contempt...The fault lay basically in the peacetime structure of the Army, in which the officers were separated from the other ranks by an impassable social and mental barrier.\\" Included in the book are numerous black and white pictures I had not seen before. The first two dramatic underscore this gulf. The first shows some field officers looking down into a \\"model\\" trench, all properly sandbagged, with six rows at the top. The second shows the awful reality of the mud holes that serve as a trench at Passchendaele.The author writes well, and contrasts the state of the British and French armies with the Americans who had just arrived: \\"Five yards apart, in four ranks, twenty yards between each rank, the marines advanced. Nothing had been seen like it, in mass innocence, in hope and at the end in unavailing heroism and self-sacrifice, since the British attack on the Somme in 1916--it is quite possible that the lack of immediate reaction from the enemy was due to disbelief that in 1918 such naivet&eacute; could still exist.\\" He then goes on to describe the carnage as the American Marines were mowed down.Pitt has a deep understanding of war, and can equally describe the thinking at the General Staff level, as well the privates in the trenches. Concerning another tough fight, by the American 2nd Division, at Belleau Woods, Pitt says: \\"By evening many of the companies were commanded by sergeants, a breed quicker to jettison Staff theories than are those holding commissioned rank.\\"Pitt is British, and reserved his harshest criticism for their military leaders. His epilogue and aftermath is rich in anecdotes that should be long remembered. Apocryphal, or not, he has the following unattributed quote: \\"'Thank Heavens the war is over is over', one of them is reputed to have said'...now we can get back to real soldiering.'\\" And in terms of learning anything, in preparation for the next war, Pitt says that \\"...as late as 1940 a candidate for a war-time commission was asked by the interviewing board at Cambridge three questions--and three only: What school did he attend? What was his father's income? Did he ride a horse?\\"A solid military history, with excellent maps, by one who understood, and depicted all the madness of that war as it truly was. 5-stars."},{"Title":"1918: The Last Act","review":"Since 1962, a great deal of scholarly research has been done on the Western Front in World War I. This has involved the search of primary archives, unpublished memoirs and detailed technical and topographic research. Yet the conclusions reached by Barrie Pitt that, 1) By 1918 the contending armies had, each in their own way, worked out how to overcome and breakthrough the entrenched defences of the time 2) none of the armies had the operational ability to create sustained offensive drives like those seen some twenty years later 3) by the fall of 1918 the German Army was being unwillingly and systematically driven out of the territory it had occupied since 1914 yet it still had some level of relative military effectiveness, hold up well to the light of the most modern work.Barrie Pitt's work is distinguished by a continued tone of moral outrage at the level of human carnage inflicted by the two sides on each other and his attempts to balance considerations of high level politics with the awful reality on the ground. He does not appear to disagree with modern scholars that dedicated and intelligent men on each side did a great deal to work out their battlefield problems in a rational and thoughful way. He just seems to remember 10 million reasons they cannnot be said to have been highly successful.The book has a useful number of clear large scale maps and a good section of photographs which are not so directly connected with the text. As suggested, this is not a scholarly book with footnotes and so on and seventy secondary works are cited in the bibliography including seven by B H Lidell Hart the once famous and now maligned military critic.The reasons this book gets only four stars is that it is really about the Western Front only and in many cases you have to accept the author's judgements without a lot of facts to back them up. For example, he talks at some length about the significance of the Allied blockade in undermining Germany's power to resist but there are not any numbers for those of us who look back from the distance of ninety years."},{"Title":"Logit and Probit: Ordered and Multinomial Models (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)","review":"If you are looking for an applied logistic book that has the useful code and/or applied instructions (for anything other than STATA) keep looking.

It almost feels as if Ian Fleming or Ken Follet contributed to this book, lots of &quot;spy stuff&quot; and policital intrigue. It's good to see UNIT back, with Lethbridge- Stewart, Yates, and Benton, but it's all a bit strange, Key to the story are an American spy who infiltrates UNIT for information, leaving a trail of bodies and destruction behind him; and Russian guerillas determined to abduct the Doctor to solve their problems of a mysterious mine in the tundra, from which no human investigators return. Meanwhile, the Doctor is being jumped upon and nibbled on by--you guessed it--Devil Goblins from Neptune. There's a bit too much Spy VS Spy-type activity, and not enough of the Doctor, who seems to be unconscious through quite a bit of the book. Once or twice I began to wonder if the author had forgotten the Doctor altogether. It picks up towards the end when the Doctor becomes more active and prepares to avert a nuclear attack by the Devil Goblins. If you find it a bit hard to start on, as I did, I recommend you keep going, the pace changes frequently enough to keep you interested and hanging on, but not so quickly that you can't keep track of what's happening. I was pleasantly surprised with a book I thought I would end up laying aside, and thoroughly enjoyed as it went on."},{"Title":"The Devil Goblins from Neptune (Dr. Who Series)","review":"An exciting and intriguing plot told with dialogue and characterizations that ring true to all the beloved early Pertwee years Dr. Who characters: Liz Shaw, Yates, Benton and Lethbridge-Stewart. Pertwee's Doctor was always concerned with social issues that blended into adult plotlines without ever overshadowing the story and characters. Like Pertwee TV stories, this book mixes scifi, espionage, and a taste of horror (which was later exploited fully in the Baker years) and delivers all of these elements with style and vigorous pacing that never allows any single element or character to get in the way of an exciting tale. It is a guilty pleasure that surpasses expectations. Like the early Pertwee stories, it offers a satisfying plot, fully-developed characters and the same sense or reality that made the first seasons of the third Doctor seem so relevant."},{"Title":"The Devil Goblins from Neptune (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This is a great who novel with the third doctor. It really flushes out a lot of Unit history and helps to understand unit's place in the bigger international picture. Russian Unit includes a great women charecter and Liz and the Doctor are written in such a way that I could hear them speaking the dialogue. As usual with Who novels, I felt the ending was just thrown togetheras an after thought, but I have come to expect that. A great page turner, this reads like Terrance Dicks better books, but with the introspection of Mark Gaitiss. Try this novel and you will be happy."},{"Title":"The Devil Goblins from Neptune (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This third Doctor novel, set between seasons seven and eight of the TV series, has got to have one of the hokiest names ever forced upon the reading public. But don't judge a book by its title.An alien object breaks up when entering Earth's atmosphere, and you know that means we're in for alien visitors. The matter is duly reported to the Doctor, but he is having problems of his own. Someone is trying to kidnap him...This story contains some globe-spanning intrigue as well as a new menace from beyond Earth (from Triton, one of the moons of Neptune, to be precise - the hokey name had to come from somewhere...), and, following on from the more &quot;adult&quot; tone of season seven, UNIT is not the happy family you might have expected from season eight.A decent read, with quite a few plot twists which may surprise you."},{"Title":"The Devil Goblins from Neptune (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Even for Doctor Who, that's a pretty ridiculous title. It's goofy to the point of being extreme, which may have been the intent of the writers, since it contrasts quite weirdly with the actual contents of the book itself. The early 1970s stories were marked by a Earth-centric focus (partially due to budgetary considerations) and revolved around the UNIT organization and the cast that went along with that crew, as they and the Doctor fought alien invasions nearly every week. While it probably shouldn't be what the show is like all the time, it was fun while it lasted and many fans do fondly remember that era. This book attempts to bring it back and add an extra layer of seriousness to it. It's a Third Doctor story and takes place at the end of the seventh season, so Liz Shaw is still on board. What starts out as a rather conventional \\"aliens are landing\\" story winds up becoming something more interesting as the novel develops, as the writers decide to focus more on the espionage aspect of the decade, as UNIT is suddenly besieged by a spy and a conspiracy that appears to go all the way up to the top of the hierarchy. Thus while you have scenes where aliens come down and apparently kill people as part of some bizarre plan, after a while it starts to take a backseat to all the international politics that are winging around, with the Russian version of UNIT appearing to try and kidnap the Doctor, with the Brigadier trying to manuever and manipulate his way to the top in an effort to figure out who the heck has it out for him, while the rest of the cast scrambles around just to stay alive. It makes for oddly tense reading, with a weirdly fatalistic sense of resignation hanging over the proceedings, as people like Benton and the Brigadier almost actively questioning what it means to be a soldier and kill people for their country, often in cold blood. The Doctor is characterized well, by turns arrogant and preening, as well as undoubtably brilliant and moral. Liz Shaw is also handled well, an intellectual match for the Doctor who is questioning her involvement with UNIT even as she likes working around the Doctor (as much as he frustrates her), but by the same token she does not really enjoy the blood and horror that seem to come with working for UNIT, an aspecpt she really can't get used to. The plot does eventually seem to involve the aforementioned Devil Goblins and they do have a plan but it is almost extraneous and it's when the plot does seem to focus on them that the plot seems to lag, with the climatic scenes lacking just a little bit of logic and the solution coming really way out from left field. But it just reminds you how well the rest of the story is told and while it won't convince you it's a replacement for the latest Tom Clancy novel, it's a surprisingly mature and realistic tone for a Past Doctor Adventure, evoking the era while at the same time updating it ever so slightly for contemporary readers."},{"Title":"Madman: The Oddity Odyssey","review":"All books by Mike Allred (perticularly this origional Madmanstory arc) are simply a pleasure to read.

Paris was recently quoted as saying that she prefers food over sex. (And this theme is hinted at in the forthcoming memoir I'd Rather Eat Chocolate: Learning to Love My Low Libido.) Greene, the longtime restaurant critic for New York magazine, proves without a doubt that food and sex are not only compatible but a luscious combo, and each page practically oozes with both. This is a rich, sensual story of her unabashed enthusiasm for the finer things in life, and her feistiness is made clear in the first chapter, where she seduces none other than Elvis (she doesn't remember much about the sex, but he ordered a fried egg sandwich afterward).Interspersed with recipes that relate to her story, such as Infidelity Soup with Turkey and Winter Vegetables, The Morning-after Orange Fruit Soup and Jean Troisgros's Figs Candy Blue (named after her scandal-causing erotic novel Blue Skies, No Candy), Greene's is a tale of decadence and sensuality. It's refreshing to hear from a woman who's over 50 who claims her pleasure everywhere she can get it. Greene writes about food and sex in a way that will make you hungry for both.In the chapter \\"About Sex and Me,\\" she begins:The best lover turns into a pizza at 3:00 AM. Who said that? Was it Woody Allen? For me, the best pizza would turn into a lover. I have read restaurant critics who claimed to have tasted chocolate ice cream that was better than sex. I have never eaten anything that was better than sex; almost as good as great sex perhaps, but never better. Though I am sure I was born hungry, I am less certain I began life as a sensualist.Growing up in Detroit, Michigan, Greene wasn't exposed to the delicacies and worldly cuisine she would late dine out on almost every night, traveling extensively to seek out the best in French, Chinese, American and other foodstuffs. Hers was a basic American childhood, but after graduating college in 1956 she was determined to get a job as a writer, and started out at UPI (which led her to Elvis). She soon found herself in New York and took no time getting acquainted with its ways, worshiping at the pen and palate of Craig Claibourne, building up her portfolio before joining upstart New York as the Insatiable Critic.Aside from detailed accounts of endless meals, including the ups and downs of the restaurant world Greene becomes immersed in during her time in the \\"mouth trade,\\" the bulk of her story is about her affairs, which she's refreshingly up-front about. Speaking of an affair with a friend's ex-husband, she writes simply, \\"He touched me and I burst into flames,\\" juxtaposing their lovemaking with missing her longtime husband, who she was still married to and had been exclusive with for nine and a half years up until that point. While Greene doesn't gloss over the pain she felt when her husband's affairs became known to her, she never apologizes for being a lusty, empowered woman intent on getting what she wants, not in a vicious, bitchy way, but in a liberated, of-the-moment way. She knows the power of seduction but is not in it to gain power, but pleasure. Her descriptions of sex, men and food are so sumptuous, they will likely make you think twice about having lackluster sex or eating a bland meal when you could be having a sense explosion.She also tracks her own learning curve when it comes to pursuing pleasure. While she doesn't disavow her bedmates, she looks back on her younger self and what made her tick, upon meeting Don Forst, who was engaged at the time but who later ditched his fiancee for Greene. In one of her most honest moments, she recounts a pitfall in the dating landscape:It's easy to see now that all that traffic in and out of my bed before Don was due not just to my uninhibited appetite for sex but a way to get close and make somebody love me. I was rarely cool. I thought getting a man was like getting the story. You had to be smart and aggressive, tie up the phone, park on the doorstep, and shove interlopers out of the way when necessary.Seeing her transformation into someone who knows what it is to love and lust and doesn't have to resort to games is one of the highlights of the book, which is filled with grand adventure inside the kitchens of chefs around the world, providing insight into both the restaurant business and painting the scene of New York dining over the decades, as well as documenting her romantic and sexual triumphs and low moments. When she winds up dating porn star Jamie Gillis, he introduces her to a whole new seedy world, one she initially recoils from but soon finds herself so enamored of him they embark on a relationship that puzzles many of her friends. It's this ability to make bold choices that her peers may have eschewed, from pulling no punches in her reviews to taking on extra-marital lovers, making waves and seemingly not looking back until now, that makes Greene, the character, one you want to follow until the very last page.And yes, there are movie stars, Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds among them. You'd think it would be the salacious details Greene highlights, but instead she has a way of humanizing her lovers, showing the beauty she saw in them. On Reynolds (after quoting his ex-wife on what a great lover he is in her Cosmo profile of the star):There are men like that. Men who love women, really love women . . . men who get into a woman's head and play you like a violin prodigy, sensitive to every nuance of the female response, of one female's specific response. A man who takes you out of your mind, sends you somewhere you've never been, shows you the sexual woman you can be. Usually superlovers are the most ordinary men, short or bald, attractive perhaps but not likely the classic Adonis, certainly not the movie-star sexpot with box-office allure. Or so I would have thought.Bottom line: I am not a foodie in any way. I am happy with takeout Indian food, a piece of spinach pizza, Burritoville, Tasti D-Lite or Taco Bell. I don't care to know every ingredient in what I eat as long as it tastes good. I don't read Gael Greene's restaurant reviews (or anyone else's). But I loved this book because of her passion--not just for food or sex or men, but for life. The Greene who starts out by seducing Elvis is not the same person we see at the end, one who's gone through marriage, countless affairs, starf*cking galore, divorce, losing friends to AIDS, losing her mother, starting Citymeals-on-Wheels, writing several books, falling in and out of love and lust. While Greene doesn't dwell on the low moments, they are there, buried between truffles and halibut and Michelin stars. You don't need to be a foodie to be insatiable, or to love Insatiable. It may be a dubious honor (though I don't mean it as one), but I think even Paris would savor it."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"Just having read Julia Child's \\"My Life In France\\";Anthony Bourdain's \\"The Nasty Bits;, and, Bill Buford's \\"Heat\\" (all beautifully and wryly written); I found Ms. Greene's memoir sleazy and extremely self-absorbed. Ms. Greene was living in a halcyon period of evolution in the history of cooking in America; but alas, she was more engaged in her own glorification. Way too much self-promotion and not much real information on the wonderful awakening of Americal's taste buds and techniques in the kitchen."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"I picked up this book because I remembered reading Gael Greene's many ecstatic restaurant reviews in New York Magazine over the years. I found her to be more reliable for my food and service preferences than Craig Claiborne was, and she was always down-to-earth in her comments.But I must admit that I was more than a little puzzled by the cover image of a woman wearing only a hat who is somewhat covered by food and beverages. Within ten pages, I knew what was going on. Ms. Greene has decided to enlighten her readers about her voracious bedroom appetites and her desire to romp with celebrities. She could have skipped those parts for me. I really didn't need nor want to know about all that. In addition, she kindly shared all of the details of her marriage falling apart. I really didn't need nor want to know about that either.Back to the food and beverages. Ms. Greene had a wonderful vantage point as the restaurant writer for New York Magazine for more decades than she cares to remember. In the book, she recounts the highs of those experiences and gives a fast-paced panoramic view of how the passing scenes changed. While early on, the details came relatively slowly . . . by the end of the book they come in such a rush that it's head spinning . . . and ultimately not too rewarding. Restaurants and chefs rise and fall. It's our connection to them that count.I was struck that by 1980 she had become enough of a force that she wasn't usually having a normal meal experience at the restaurants. The material became more like celebrity gazing after that, rather than focused on food and beverages. I was struck to see that her celebrity position didn't necessarily gain her better treatment at these restaurants than I had received myself at about the same times. I began to realize that somewhere along the way Zagat became more reliable as a restaurant guide for me than restaurant reviews: Those who comment in Zagat were having experiences like I was likely to receive.Having digested her large appetites for sensual experiences, I must admit that I liked the recipes the best. They are all ones that I could make without too much trouble . . . and I found myself drooling over them.If you are interested in her whole life (including her semi-autobiographical novels), you'll like this book much better than I did.If you are interested in her for her sense of the restaurants and the people . . . and just read those parts, you'll probably think this is a 4 or 5 star book. She adds many insights in the early years that I don't remember seeing in New York Magazine.If reveling in morally uninhibited behavior in public bothers you, you'll like this book less than I did. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a family member because of its tawdry side."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"INSATIABLE: TABLES FROM A LIFE OF DELICIOUS EXCESS celebrates the food world like no other, blending a peppering of recipes with the author's observations of the growing world of exotic foods and culinary expertise. The unschooled Greene differs from the quasi-chefs who normally write modern chef's explorations these days: she's immersed in the New York food world but not a chef herself, revealing an undercurrent of snobbery in culinary circles which originally regulated her to the back rooms rather than the center of foodie circles. Her observations of culinary fame, sensual excess, and rich experience provides both a personal memoir and a series of connections to New York's food society, whether it be a gourmet restaurant or her work spearheading Citymeals-on-Wheels, a charity program for the elderly. It's her diverse experiences which set INSATIABLE apart from the many food surveys on today's market.Diane C.

As one other reviewer commented, this oeuvre don't hold a candle to, for instance, the recent posthumous work by MFK Fisher, My Life in France, which was a total delight. And would somebody please tell Ms. Greene that she wasn't making conquests??? Most guys will sleep with anybody, especially if that anybody is famous and has money!

It is a book I hug to my chest in memory of reading it."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"\\"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess\\" is an excellent read and extremely well-written. Gael Greene does an excellent job detailing the transformation of the New York restaurant scene, which underwent its own revolution alongside the transformation of society through feminism and sexual liberation. The author's voice is candid, strong and unapologetic; at times her voice may feel condescending to some readers, but that should not deter one from reading this book. New York truly experienced a culinary explosion and is now one of the best places in the world for fine dining. I personally witnessed this and was always a little curious as to the \\"behind the scenes\\" details as to how this phenomenon occurred. Greene's professional and personal accounts provided me with some insight into the foodie subculture so pervasive now, but virtually non-existent so many years ago. Reading this book actually changed the way I think about several of my favorite NY restaurants.It seems certain readers are intimidated by the author's candid accounts of her sexual experiences, which include some very famous names. I believe that providing such details adds an important dimension to the story and its characters that is often omitted from autobiographical accounts. The sexual aspects of food and the creators of great cuisine are intimately related and it is refreshing to find an author who acknowledges this and is willing to write about it in such a gutsy way."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"Let me say right up front that Ms Greene is a horndog. A brilliantly funny, articulate, interesting horndog. But a horndog nonetheless. So if that bothers you, do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- read this book.That said, I sure wish I could have been her roommate in 1952 Paris where she fled to escape \\"the Velveeta cocoon\\" of her Detroit.She was the food critic for New York magazine for many years. She knew every restaurant, every chef, and every tidbit of gossip. It's the ultimate sensual memoir -- men and food. Perhaps she has written a \`menoir.' Sorry.She shares her dalliances with Elvis, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, among others (many others!) along with recipes for things like Infidelity Soup with Turkey and Winter Vegetables. No Fried Egg Sandwich recipe, however.I was delighted to see a section where she talked about the changing times and habits and smack-dab in the middle of this book about excess, there was this description of a 445-calorie lunch ...Lunch was breathtaking to look at and delicious, too: a perfect poached egg crowned with tomato coulis and snippets of chive, and beside it, slivered chicken riding in an artichoke heart on a cool pale green sea of cucumber puree. A concerto of texture, color, and taste. Okay, I thought. Nice lunch. But there was still more. A second plate, a statement in beige: thinnest slices of duck in a rich pepper-studded sauce, with saut&eacute;ed apples.\\"Can it be cream?\\" I asked. No, Michel insisted, looking wounded that I would suggest such perfidy. What looked suspiciously like a cream sauce was the result of whisking zero-calorie white cheese with duck stock and water in a blender.\\"But surely the apples are saut&eacute;ed in butter?\\"\\"Absolument non,\\" Michel cried. \\"It is my pan of Teflon that does that.\\"Dessert was yet another still life: a trembling little mold of delicate coffee custard capped with a crunch of espresso ice, beribboned with candied orange peel and a punctuation of ripe currants. I'd eaten a total of precisely 445 calories.Delicous to read, eh? And I love when people -- complete strangers -- validate my Lazy Low Cal Lifestyle theories!She's very funny, too. Here are a couple of my favorite lines:* All my life, people have assumed I am an only child. No, I am not an only child. I just act as if I were the only child. I am left-handed. That's enough to overcome.* Still freshly hatched and an ing&eacute;nue in the world of the grape, I was not used to drinking from a flute. The fragile crystal in my bridal trousseau included saucer goblets for champagne. (I'd grown up with the myth that a perfect breast would fit into a champagne goblet, and mine were embarrassingly Burgundy balloons. Certainly the flute banished that conundrum.)Much of this book will appeal to those true foodies who know NYC, restaurants and chefs, but the name-dropping was lost on me and got a bit boring. But did I mention she was a horndog?"},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"Ms. Green lives a totally amoral life. She embellishes herself in it and is proud. Kind of like Satan himself. Yes, she knows about food, but while reading her book (which I actually burned in finding it so disgusting), she has whored herself into her position and is quite proud of it. I truly feel sorry for her and her inherent feeling that she is such an expert in any thing other than food. She truly embarasses me as a woman and it is probably good that she had no children who would remain tremendously embarassed to have her as a mother.The few recipes she provides are worthless and other than providing her some income, this book is totally trash, as is she."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"Greene should have titled this The Repugnant Personality.

While the 51 chapters do touch on Ms. Greene's life before \`New York', they generally stay very close to their \`New York' wellspring, her column, named \`The Insatiable Gourmet' by magazine editor in chief, Clay Felker.The most immediate comparison which comes to mind is to the three volumes of memoirs by current \`Gourmet' editor in chief, Ruth Reichl who, for several years, sat in Craig Claiborne's chair as principle restaurant reviewer for \`The New York Times' and whose most recent book, \`Garlic and Sapphires' deals entirely with her \`New York Times' restaurant reviews and her tactics for maintaining her anonymity while in the hunt for excellence at New York's finer eateries. And, as similar as these two women's careers may be, the differences make both bodies of work that much more interesting.While Reichl, the younger of the two by at least a decade, grew up in New York City and learned French at a very early age, her professional culinary journalistic career was shaped on the west coast, firmly under the influence of the American food vanguard lead by the California vintners, Alice Waters, Jeremiah Tower, and Wolfgang Puck. Greene grew up in provincial Detroit, but had her culinary instincts formed by the emerging community of French restaurants in New York City. Her center of culinary gravity was in the dining rooms, kitchens, and cellars of the great French culinary establishment. She even admits that she came late to the California culinary movement. To her credit, as soon as she had her first experience of Alice Waters' cuisine at \`Chez Panisse', she recognized that there was something important going on by the Pacific coast.Reichl's first two volumes of memoirs are more strictly biographical than \`Insatiable' in that they are strictly chronological. Reichl's revelations about her life are also unusual to me, at the time, for the remarkable candor about her sexual life. Madame Reichl was a Den Mother compared to Ms. Greene, whose title refers not only to her culinary appetites, but to her sexual appetites as well. I won't dwell on this much, but her exploits make me and most average Americans feel like monks or nuns in comparison.These sexual exploits include dozens of famous figures from the culinary world, but they also include several notables from Hollywood. As a hint, I will reveal that Ms. Greene tells the tales of how she landed in bed with two very big leading men, both of whom appeared together on the cover of \`Time' magazine. And yet, Ms. Greene can be remarkably circumspect about the details of many liaisons.It is interesting to see the difference in reaction to some of the major figures both have met. Danny Kaye appears in both narratives, however, he is a much bigger part in Ms. Greene's story, as does James Beard, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, and M.F.K. Fisher, as Ms. Greene was able to encounter all these people while they were still at or near their prime, unlike Ms. Reichl, who did not arrive in the \`big time' at the \`Times' until most of these people were retired or gone. The stories regarding Danny Kaye are especially nice, as I have been pining for more information on his culinary abilities ever since I read Ms. Reichl's report of a dinner he prepared in his custom build \`kitchen theatre'.Ms. Greene also fills in a lot of information on some of the more romantically interesting figures in the culinary world. For example, when one reads other accounts of the lives of \`Le Bernardin' founders, Gilbert and Maguy LeCoze, you are left with the feeling that their closeness can only be explained by a particularly \`unnatural' sexual relation. Miss Gael assures us in no uncertain terms that both Gilbert and Maguy were decidedly conventional (At least for young French natives) in their sexual behavior, each with their own one or more partners, including, for Gilbert, Ms. Greene herself now and then. She also sheds light on the fact that suspicions to the contrary, Pierre Franey was a complete heterosexual, with no erotic connection to culinary colleague, the well-known homosexual, Craig Claiborne.One feature of New York dining on which Ms. Greene and Ms. Reichl agree is that most of the high end venues are far too inclined to give preferential treatment to favorite customers, most of which are celebrities. One of the most disagreeable cases appears in the chapter about the literary watering hole, \`Elaine's' which became popular among celebs almost by accident, when \`Harper's' editor Nelson Aldrich (not even Nelson Algren), wandered in and stayed awhile, bringing a few other literary luminaries along in later visits. And, while we are less likely to be inconvenienced by this, this is just as true of Parisian venues as those in the Big Apple.Like Ms. Reichl, Ms. Greene sprinkles in a few recipes here and there, after every second or third chapter. These are interesting, but I found her passing remarks about dishes within her text to be far more evocative, as when one New York maestro filled a baked potato with creamed chipped beef and how Gilbert LeCoze prepared such simple fish dishes, because he never received the kind of training which showed him how to do elaborate preparations (Under Eric Ripert, \`Le Bernardin' is still a temple to simple, fresh fish cooking).While Ms. Reichl's last book may be more interesting to the serious foodie as it deals in much more detail with the specific restaurants, reviews, and events surrounding her researches, Ms. Greene's book has far more interesting and far more lascivious information about the lives and loves of the culinary great in New York and France.A delicious tart of a read!"},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"I absorb \\"foodie\\" books at the rate that some breathe. Reichl, Bourdain, Child, Buxton and others are the source of hours of fond distraction from my too-busy-to-do-anything life and my aspirations to understand food the way I understand my professional work -- intuitively, technically and personally.I had read that this book was more of a bawdy personal history than others, but I always adore the personal details of the writers, and am hardly a prude. Nevertheless, I could hardly muster an ounce of empathy for the gratuitous sexual self-objectification of the author who viewed restaurants more as stars in a social strata than producers of cuisine. I did not care about her tortured relationship with a porn star, whom she fed and bedded on her employer's dime. I grew exasperated as she ended a chapter about three marriages with a confession that she wrote it without understanding the point, and still, after writing it and choosing to include it in her book, she did not. The simple reality is that a writer is speaking to a reader, and Ms. Green's reader appeared to be...Ms. Green. While it is apparent that others enjoyed this book, I would suspect that a day with \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" would disabuse anyone of the notion that this is a delightful memoir, and instead expose it for the indulgence that it is."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"If Reichl's memoirs were a nourishing meal, then Greene's is a bag of chips. Reichl's trilogy about her life in food is ultimately about developing relationships, and discovering how to make a meaningful life.Greene's book, in contrast, reads as a series of lists 1) foods she has eaten 2) men she has slept with 3) celebrities she has known. There is no real character development, nor any personal insights.True, she has enjoyed amazing, sumptious meals, but to what end? There is no meaning to her life beyond the endless quest for rich meals on her employer's dime. Her sexual appetite, although clearly prodigious, leads her to make empty choice after empty choice. Some people will wish that they shared Greene's luck that allowed her to live a completely self-indulgent life. But most sensible people will be grateful that they haven't haven't wasted every moment pursuing nothing.An empty life leads to an empty book--a bit ironic considering the title.

I realize that at the time Greene became a food critic, critics were well known by the restauranteurs and treated like Queens with special menus the rest of the people dining did not ever see, but I had no idea how bad it was. To think everyones opinion was determined by a few egotistical food critics in New York who never ate the way the rest of the people did is disgusting. Couple this with her flamboyant use of her magazines money to pay for all her meals (and her lovers meals) and you can't find a reason to enjoy the true life of Gael Greene.Frankly, for me, her little splurge with a porn star was the most interesting part of the book, but then she would move on to sleep with the very chefs she was reviewing.Halfway through the book it became a real snore with very little mention of food - which is why a foodie would buy such a book. Instead it was one celebrity name after another, one bit of gossip after another and list after list of names of chefs and all their restaurants and if they made it or not. It was more one long dull gossip column than a book."},{"Title":"Insatiable: Tales from a Life of Delicious Excess","review":"As a restaurant critic Gael Greene has had a life full of delicious meals, interesting travels and exciting encounters with the opposite sex, and not only.

Talk about TMI! You'll come away from these pages feeling like you've eaten mediocre swill at an overrated restaurant; Greene evidently had all the depth of a finger bowl.

This is such a bad book on so many levels."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"This was a disturbing book in many ways--not because of the subjectmatter or the storytelling, but because it reaches out to anyone who reads it, forcing them to confront their darker, hidden sides. As the story begins, Theresa Dunn is a 10-year-old child who comes from a large Irish Catholic family and frequently gets overlooked. The degree to which her parents pay her little attention while lavishing affection on her older sister, Katherine, is shocking, because Theresa's spine curvature could have been corrected immediately had they noticed. This, of course, adds to Theresa's self-loathing and her feeling that she is insignificant. The operation is a success, but Theresa is not quite the same. Katherine gets emotional and tells Theresa that she looked like she &quot;came back from the dead&quot;. Theresa also has a slight limp to show for it, a constant reminder of her unimportance. From this point on, anyone who makes a reference to Theresa's limp, however casual, is basically striking Theresa in her most vulnerable place. Her failure to come to terms with her self-loathing eventually will lead to far more trouble in the future.Theresa is still very much the good Catholic girl, however, and she still loves children. Her decision to become an elementary school teacher allows her to temporarily step into the role of &quot;Mother&quot; (nurturer) and &quot;Father&quot; (educator), to be simultaneously the parents she wished she had. It is during her college years that she meets Martin Engle, a sardonic English professor who will have a profound effect on her already shaky self-image. Martin is married, but he is still very much adored by his female students, and he does nothing to overtly discourage them. Theresa soon finds herself the object of Martin's affection, although he teases her for having such a &quot;serious Catholic girl&quot; personality. Rossner includes a number of vivid images in this section; for instance, Theresa, about to be seduced by Martin, watches coffee dripping from the coffee-maker, looking like brown mud. Their affair lasts for four years, until one day when Martin casually shrugs her off. She is simply another fling to him; he openly informs her that he will probably have another one by this summer. Theresa goes into a deep depression and again, comes out of it permanently altered. Now she is &quot;soiled goods&quot; in every sense of the word, and as her casual alter ego &quot;Terry&quot;, she begins to behave recklessly, seducing strangers and bringing them to her apartment at night. During school hours with the children, however, she is still very much &quot;Theresa&quot;, the &quot;good&quot; Catholic girl who lavishes affection on her students.The &quot;Mr. Goodbar&quot; of the title is simply the name of one of Terry's haunts. Her double life is two such extreme opposites, that on the rare occasions when one element appears in another, it often leads to disaster. For instance, she meets a &quot;nice&quot; gentleman, James, who turns her off sexually, but who is comforting because of his unconditional love for her. This, of course, is beyond Theresa's comprehension, and in her perverse way, she often strives to push him away by acting &quot;hard&quot;, swearing too much and being sardonic in much the same way as Martin. It is during one of these phases that Theresa attends a wedding in a &quot;slutty&quot; black dress that &quot;Terry&quot; would wear. At the sight of James' mother, Theresa is suddenly filled with shame, to the point where she feels physically ill. Likewise, with her &quot;regulars&quot;, she is careful not to let them intrude into her &quot;other life&quot;; after sex, she immediately demands that they leave.The most painful aspect of reading the book is the loneliness Theresa experiences. She has no close friends, her parents are remote and distant, and her older sister is flighty and cannot be depended on. Theresa's life is a dark abyss that she gradually sinks into, and she is a tortured, conflicted woman to the end. This can be a very depressing story, in spite of the vivid sexual imagery. Living in Theresa's skin is like going to a wild party every night, only to wake up with a horrendous hangover the next morning. The late 60's sensibilities are very much in evidence here, also; none of the so-called &quot;peace and love&quot; generation are any more successful at intimacy and committment than Theresa. James is a symbol of a more noble, idealistic time, when &quot;old-fashioned&quot; values like honesty and chivalry were treasured. Theresa herself is symbolic of people's best and worst selves; the tragedy is that the worst will often win out."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"It's the 1970's and the world has lived through the sixties and exploded into a one big wild and careless party. The vestiges of responsibility and family begin to tear and no where is it better illustrated than in depicting the life of Theresa. Theresa is a lonely single girl, teaching underprivledged kids during the day and cruising the bar scene looking for love after dark. Living in the shadow of her seemingly fabulous sister, Theresa born the shame of spine curvature (eventually corrected by surgery), the indifference of her parents, lack of friends, and the pain of empty love relationships. Theresa during the day, Terry is her night time persona who takes the young teacher to levels she never dreamed off as the story unfolds. Theresa is at odds with the good girl vs. bad girl images and yet is spurned by physical pleasure and the thought of a lasting and pleasurable relationship. The book's end is shocking and inevitable as Theresa looks for love in all the wrong places. A cautionary tale which rings true today, a copy should be given to every Washington intern."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"Judith Rossner, Looking for Mr. Goodbar (Washington Square Press, 1975)Looking for Mr. Goodbar was an unconscionably shocking novel when it appeared in 1975. It was still shocking when Richard Brooks turned it into a devastating film featuring rising stars Richard Gere, Tom Berenger, and William Atherton as the three most important men in Diane Keaton's life. Now, here we are thirty years later. The scene Rossner set isn't shocking. But in some ways, her treatment of it is, and this is why Looking for Mr. Goodbar is still in print, three decades after its original release.Theresa Dunn, we learn on the first page, is dead. She was killed by a guy she picked up in a bar a few hours beforehand (leading to Rex Reed's famous, and utterly inaccurate, statement \\"this is the story of what happens to Theresa in bars.\\"). We go from police report to said guy's statement, which is equal parts amusing and chilling. Then the rest of the novel's three hundred ninety pages gives us Theresa's story as it leads up to her murder.Despite Reed's tantalizing review, Theresa Dunn is not the kind of barhopper one might find in a bad seventies softcore movie. In fact, she spends not much time at all in bars themselves. (Mr. Goodbar, the name of the bar where she picks up the guy who kills her, is only mentioned by name twice in Theresa's portion of the story, if I recall correctly.) The novel actually focuses on Theresa's relationships, and how they contribute to the novel's outcome-- first with one of her college professors, and then conflicting, simultaneous relationships with two men, the macho and aggressive Tony and calm, staid James, as Theresa tries to figure out who she really is and what she wants from life.Rossner approaches her subject matter in a frank, matter-of-fact tone. Thirty years on, it's not the sex that's shocking, nor the idea of having it casually; we've seen it all a thousand times before. It's small offhand comments about tangential topics, or terminology (none of which, of course, is capable of being used in an Amazon review), that are still a shock to the system. Reading it, you realize that not all of the boundaries we pushed in books in the seventies were eventually broken; some of them rebounded.But all that aside, what's it like as a book? Well, it's readable, and a relatively quick novel; Rossner does know how to keep the pages turning. I'm not sure whether she had literary aspirations with this novel (and, to be honest, I'm not sure whether she achieved them, though being re-released by Washington Square Press in 1995 certainly lends the novel an air of credibility in that regard), but it's certainly two or three rungs above your garden-variety genre potboiler or Beeline novel. Rossner's characters are deep, rich constructions, even when they border on the stereotypical (Theresa's sister Katherine and her husband are clinging-to-the-sixties free love poster children, better for a laugh these days than anything else), and the situations in which they find themselves are grimly realistic. Rossner wrote herself a fine novel, and one that deserves to be rediscovered by a new generation. ***"},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"Theresa is a teacher by day, and a bar cruiser by night. It's the seventies, and everybody's doing it, and as often as they can. I first read Goodbar a few years ago and have read it a total of 5 times since. It's a haunting story, one that gets into your blood and won't let go of your concious thoughts for days after finishing it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about the inner turmoil women face when confronted with situations where their sexuality faces off with their morality. I would also like to point out that the film based on this book and of the same title confronts the issues of sexual independence with stark and vivid imagery. I would recommend reading the book, though, before seeing the film as the book delivers a real kick to the theoretical groin while the movie doesn't delve as deeply into the mind, the heart and motivation of its main character."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"This is definitely one of those novels that is like a car accident-- it's ugly, but you can't look away. Rossner's hypnotic writing style and pitch-perfect characterization will hook you from page one. What is perhaps most haunting about this work, however, is not being ushered into this dark, lonely way of life that Theresa Dunn leads but rather finding out just how many similarities you share with her. This book will definitely stay with you, which isn't the best feeling, frankly, but trust me, if you don't read it, you're missing out on a superb literary experience."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"Judith Rossner's warning in her novel to take a flashlight when we visit the darkest corners of sexual experimentation is forever relevant. \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" (the title not a character but a pick-up bar) gives us a Catholic teacher of deaf children who, after dark, takes on a truly dark character and sets out on the bar scene looking for sex and, maybe if she's lucky, love. But the search for both is strewn with broken hearts, disappointments and dangers, as Theresa finds out too late. Rossner's main character comes across as a basically desperate human scarred by years of indifferent parents, a sister who was preferred in childhood over her and a low self-image caused by a curved spine (although later corrected by surgery). In seeking approval, validation, redemption and love, Theresa ventures forth into the darkness and risks of anonymous sex and, of course, not finding in the darkness what she seeks. The accomplishment of \\"Goodbar\\" is Rossner's uncanny ability to focus on and then bare the desperation that fuels any person's search for love or whatever it's called. All too often, the searchers who wander too far into the blackness meet the same final fate that Theresa does, and Rossner's descriptive talents of that fate spare no one. Hers is a cautionary tale that, if we must, don't go too far into the night without a light on in the brain. Without it, we may never get a second chance. The book was later turned into a theatrical film with Diane Keaton turning in a tremendous performance. Both the film and book warrant attention and respect of the dangers of the night."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"Rarely has a bestseller had such a powerful yet upsetting impact on the psyche of contemporary American sexuality. Judith Rossner's novel brutally reflects the condition of today's swinging singles scene with the story of Theresa Dunn, a young 20-something grade school teacher living alone in Manhattan during the freewheeling 70's. On the surface, Theresa resembles the compassionate, down-to-earth All-American Girl that we can all identify with. Her ambition and desire for freedom and personal liberation transform her from a shy, insecure girl into an independent young woman living in the Lower East Side with a career teaching second graders. But as a result of a few traumatic events in her childhood and several debasing sexual relationships, this image is slowly deteriorated as we gain more insight into Theresa's troubled emotional and mental state. Add to that the unforgiving tide of the era's sexual revolution, Theresa becomes swept away in a pessimistic and alienated life of nameless sex and drug use.Fearing genuine emotional intimacy and attachment with anyone, Theresa instead tries to fill the spiritual and emotional void inside of her by taking home various men from bars and clubs for sex, and then kicking them out afterward so that she won't have to face the emotional consequences. Not surprisingly, Theresa soon finds herself spiraling downward at an out-of-control rate, and just as she realizes that she is careening toward catastrophe, she takes the wrong man home with her, and thus seals her own tragic fate.Rossner spends a considerable amount of the novel producing the background circumstances for Theresa's behavior, so that we can see why she unwittingly paid the ultimate price for the sake of misguided pleasure. What sets this novel miles ahead of similar psychological thrillers is the unsympathetic realism that is portrayed in the circumstances surrounding Theresa's self-destruction. The sex scenes are unpleasant and emotionally deadening and you'll never find more starkly realistic dialogue anywhere else. And then there's that notoriously graphic and bone-chilling ending which will haunt you for several weeks to follow....Probably the biggest reason why such an overwhelmingly depressing novel like this was so widely popular and culturally influential is because Theresa is such an explicit reflection of the very worst in all of us. Not only do we see Theresa's insecurities and fears in our own thoughts, but her story is still told today again and again through the real-life tragic misjudgments of Natalie Holloway, Matthew Shepherd and others. This is not a crime novel or thriller. Rather, it is a psychological study of the tragic self-destruction of a human being. Overall, \`Looking for Mr. Goodbar' is an essential must-read for those who are brave enough to acknowledge why we as individuals often cannot help but destroy ourselves."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"The story is a classic is all I can say, and deserves well known recognition for the real truth behind the story that many people can't see because of the excessive sex and swearing that goes on. Truthfully, this is at least one of the best and most intruiging stories I have ever read on all accounts. The dioluge isn't like that of so many other stories, where the characters don't talk like real people but like rich and artiqulate writers with a deadline to meet. Even the relationships and the issues they cover are completely realistic. These things aren't usually pulled off very well by a writer for numerous reasons. But probley my favorite part about Looking For Mr.Goodbar is Theresa *or Terry*. She's the ideal protaganist, really, because she has human faults and human issues, and she's not like the typical good girl hero we are supposed to love through and through. However, she's not particularly bad either. Instead she is caught in the middle going from side to side trying to make sense of where she really belongs.But I must say that even the ending, which is very depressing and morbid, doesn't leave anything to be desired. In fact, I think it was the perfect and inevitable ending to one of the best books of yesterday, today, and tomorrow."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"When I saw this book I picked it up. I recognized it from its mention in \\"I Hate You-Don't Leave Me\\" which is a book about borderline personality disorder. I think the author wrote this book before there was even such a diagnosis, but even so, she gave the most realistic description I have ever seen.From reading Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid, I think Judith Rossner has a talent for creating characters that are neurotic- characters that you sometimes sympathize with, and sometimes want to slap in the face. This is especially true of Theresa after I have known someone like her in real life.This book describes the main character from her childhood and on. Her childhood is not rife with melodramas such as abuse or molestation, but it is unhappy in a more subtle way. This shows how there are often problems under the surface within \\"normal\\" families. Medical problems and sibling rivalry are two things that have an ongoing effect in her life.Her famous one-night-stand habit develops gradually after a long affair with a professor and meeting some other people she hoped would develop into a relationship. The scenes with these various people show the unpredictability and coldness of the bar scene, and people having obligatory sex with people they don't care about. Instead of describing fantasy sex laden with multiple orgasms, this book mainly deals with \\"realistic\\" sex, full of dysfunction and disappointment. I think since the characters all had unprotected sex, and plenty of other sexual problems were mentioned, it would have been an appropriate book to write about STDs (which are rarely mentioned outside of health books, but are a common result of all these sexual escapades so frequently written about).She has 2 main relationships in the book. The one is an ambiguous ongoing sex-partner thing with Tony. He is unpredictable about when he shows up and when he ignores her, but she waits around for him and obsesses over him. The other is with a gentlemanly character named James Morrissey, someone who treats her respectfully and takes a lot of her abuse. I've seen this happen so much in real life: someone clinging to someone who treats her bad, and taking for granted someone who treats her well.I love some of the conversations she has with Morrissey. Like most characters in the book, he is neither perfect nor completely vile. He does come off like a wuss, but in general I really do feel for him. Theresa tries to push his buttons sometimes, then other times she suddenly bursts into tears, and other times she suddenly hates him, only to cling to him a few minutes later. She doesn't know how to feel from one moment to the next.There are some great descriptions of Theresa's thoughts as well. Her wondering what makes her so unappealing that no one calls her back. (This is early on in the book, when she does seem like a nice person.) Her resentfully thinking her sister is still closer to her parents even when she's across the world. Her not believing Morrissey is in love with her, and thinking he's either lying or has a distorted view of her. These and others are thoughts that a lot of people can deeply identify with. Some of her thoughts are pretty insightful, and some of them, even though they're petty, are honest.Sometimes (just like in real life) I'm thinking \\"big deal, your problems aren't that bad, you're spoiled\\", but then each person reacts differently to their situations in life. She doesn't really have friends (some people have a hard time relating to anyone who doesn't give them a hormone rush) and has few other stable relationships. She becomes more lost as the book goes on.I can see how some reviewers haven't liked this book, and when I was younger I probably wouldn't have liked it either, but now that I am older and have seen so many people who are like the characters, I thought it was pretty amazing."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"This is another that I read WITHOUT seeing the movie. But again, this one is so much a part of American Culture that I knew the main points of it.Enough plot summaries on the page already so, straight to the review:Even for today, this well written story is shocking and heart breaking. I read a lot of very hard fiction, yet even I was shocked at the explicitness of some of the scenes. This is an unflinching view into the heart of a tortured woman - and you don't want to look away.The characters are compelling, the 70's era gives you a slight feeling of nostalgia, and it's a book you won't want to put down.If you've only heard about it, you might want to pick it up and see what all the fuss is about. It's worth the read!"},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"This book gets to a matter that is very seldom explored by the people reading it - their own deep dark insecurities.

For me , a must-read."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"There is some flair for the dramatic in this book, but the thing is, it even makes fun of itself having a flair for the dramatic (sunlight spills into the room...). That in itself should give the author the benefit of the doubt as to the motives behind some of the didactic subplots, which in the end all really seem to support the underlying themes and characters. It's not that the author is for want of creativity, but the book is not war and peace, and there is a definite mood and trajectory of the story which flows quite easily from page to page. A tight, terse, and brutally honest story which resonates today as well as the free-wheeling birth-controlled seventies."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"\\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" is sad, heart-breaking, and often intense. The book takes place in the 1960s (NOT the 70s, as many reviewers have stated)...it actually ends on New Year's Day, 1970. This is an important detail because Theresa's behavior was considered far more socially and morally unacceptable in the 1960s, than it would have been in the 1970s. She was not part of the counter-culture movement, so her promiscuity has nothing to do with \\"free love\\" in that sense. She is searching for something, some kind of escape from the feeling of abandonment she had in childhood. In short, Theresa has issues. The book does a good job of detailing her childhood sadness and showing how those experiences permeate her adult life, thereby affecting the decisions she makes."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"Good, spot-on writing with a plot that takes off right from the beginning. Judith Rossner makes keen observations and phrases them just right: \\"...the look that was just becoming commonplace on the streets of New York - of having been someplace else which made them realize that Earth was just a two-bit town.\\" As for the plot, I don't see this as a cautionary tale. (And Rossner's writing is dispassionate enough that she is observing only and definitely not judging.) For whatever reasons (which alone are worthy of debate) Terry chooses to exploit her vulnerability. She's quite self-centered and childish. She chooses to do exactly whatever she wants to do, at the expense of her students, at the expense of James' feelings, etc. Intellectually she realizes it, but she does it anyway, often enjoying it. At one point when she considers herself \\"so strapped down\\", I almost had to laugh out loud. And in the end, did you really think she was going to change? Just because she spruced up her apartment? If that were really true she would never have gone into Mr. Goodbar."},{"Title":"Lookng Mr Goodbar","review":"I read this book in my third year of undergraduate study in English. This book challenges the paragdigms of the 50s and 60s and also serves as a coming of age story.

This book impacted me greatly because I identify with the protagonist. I am anxious to read it again and determine how it will affect me at yet another stage in my life.

We know the stories about the lives of the pharoahs but not of common laborers. Until now. This book documents the life, not of a chief, but of an ordinary Native American woman. We see how she lives, how she feels, how she thinks, and she is open in expressing her opinions on political issues as well as cultural and social issues.In addition to telling the accounts of her life, the author Mary Brave Bird opens up to allow the reader to see deep into her heart and innermost thoughts. She is very candid not only about her thoughts and feelings but about her actions as well. She does not try to hide her faults and describes her own infidelity and irresponsibility without excuses.While reading the book, one is tempted to judge her. But don't. She must be applauded for being so open and honest.At one point, she assigns blame to the white man for all the ailments of Indian society. Yet remarkably she knows that more handouts from the government or more government programs will not be the answer. The Indians themselves are the only ones who can lift themselves out of poverty, and she is honest in that her own decisions and her own behavior has prevented her and her children from living better lives."},{"Title":"Ohitika Woman","review":"Mary Brave Bird's first book, &quot;Lakota Woman&quot; (written under her former husband's last name, Crow Dog), is a gripping and explicit account of Native American life on a reservation and details the beginnings of the American Indian Movement and its battles against the United States government and corrupt tribal government. It is also an illuminating first-hand account of a feminist within the movement. The sequel, &quot;Ohitika Woman&quot; (which translates to &quot;brave woman&quot;), which takes place some 15 years after its predecessor, attempts to pick up where &quot;Lakota Woman&quot; left off but instead spends much of its length reiterating everything from the first book. Brave Bird's divorce from Leonard Crow Dog and her subsequent remarriage is touched on, but the bulk of the book is devoted to disjointed retellings of the first book's stories. There is little to gain from reading this sequel, and it is written in a confusing manner; not only does the book repeat its predecessor, it repeats itself---characters are introduced and reintroduced over and over throughout the book by telling the exact same stories. &quot;Lakota Woman&quot; is a stellar book, and those interested in Native American topics or feminism should stick with that.

Reservation poverty is described in detail. Domestic abuse and alcoholism also appear here. Plus Sun Dance self-torture. Thankfully, many sweat lodge and cedaring-off descriptions dull down the affect of the more shocking parts of Mary Brave Bird's experiences.She falls prey to an alcoholic lifestyle inolving &quot;party-ing&quot; until you're either beat up or in jail. She eventually leaves her husband, Sioux medicine man Leonard Crow Dog, and treks across country (with 4 children), moving from women's shelter to homeless shelter, until they all spend a wild three years in Phoenix.Definitely, the alcoholism mars this narrative, and lowers Mary Brave Bird's credibility. Yes, there are a lot of references to the American Indian Movement's standoff at Wounded Knee. And there's a good chapter about native American traditions with regard to menstruation. And inspiration about fighting for the land.But I can't help wondering if the sort of hopeless drunken revelry portrayed here typifies ALL reservation Indians, and if so, aren't they in fact contributing to the end of their own culture..?

As usual, one part of your mind, while reading, is noting which Lovecraft stories and ideas Lumley is recombining this time -- and he believes in reusing all of Lovecraft. Yes, these are pale imitations of his model and provide only a tiny bit of Lovecraft's cosmic paranoia, but they're still more engaging than August Derleth's work.Plotwise, the teenaged Robert Bloch's 1934 effort, \\"The Shambler from the Stars\\", doesn't have much to offer. However, there is the fun of a thinly disguised Lovecraft who meets a grisly end. The master returned the favor with his last story, \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\", which has one Robert Blake meeting a horrible end after uncovering a fearsome alien artifact in a Providence church. Bloch's 1951 story \\"The Shadow from the Steeple\\" completes the trilogy and shows how much Bloch developed as a writer in those 17 years. There's no imitation of Lovecraft's style here, but Lovecraft and his characters from \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" show up and Cthulhuian horrors are effectively moved to the atomic age. Bloch also makes nice use of Lovecraft's poem \\"Nyarlathotep\\". Another Bloch work, \\"Notebook Found in a Deserted House\\", uses an old Lovecraftian standby -- a journal desperately documenting horrors closing in on its writer. But here the narrator is a type Lovecraft never used: a twelve year old boy telling us about the monsters in the woods around his aunt and uncle's farm.J. Ramsey Campbell aka Ramsey Campbell started out with Lovecraft pastiches set in England, but the style of his \\"Cold Print\\" isn't Lovecraftian nor is its unseemly, vague linking of sexual taboos with Cthulhu entities. Here a teacher is lead to a mysterious London bookstore where something a mite stronger than the bondage and discipline porn is offered.James Wade's \\"The Deep Ones\\" brings Lovecraft into the sixties with a John Lily-like researcher studying some decidely sinister dolphins, a Timothy Leary-like professor warning against it, and a telepath with some family ties to Innsmouth. It's quite good.Surprsingly an even better story is Colin Wilson's \\"The Return of the Lloigor\\". Surprising because Wilson's earlier attempt at writing a Mythos story,The Mind Parasites, was so bad. Wilson uses his erudition to create a plot melange of Welsh crime, Mu, Arthur Machen, H. P. Lovecraft, the Voynich Manuscript, the Kabbala, Aleister Crowley, and Charles Fort. Mixed in is some delightfully absurd metaphysics about the sinister and congenitally pessimistic Lloigor. This clever story may use some of the themes and furniture from Lovecraft and his work, but it's no accident that the hero is a Poe scholar because the tone is that of the latter author in his hoaxer mode."},{"Title":"Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos Volume 2","review":"This is the BEST book i have EVER read!

I decided, after owning this original cookbook for 2 years, and after seeing the revised version, that I would write a revised update of my book review, to remind people of what a great cookbook that exists out there!This cookbook is divided into seasons. When I first became interested in eating with the seasons, I found this book to be an excellent advantage to actually offer menus for each season. Within each season, is a section for appetizers, main dishes, beverages and desserts. There are also sample menus for gatherings.Despite the fact, I am not a vegetarian, I have enjoyed the recipes from this book as part of a more healthy approach to eating. Also, some of the main dishes can be utilized as a side dish for a meat-eater, or you can add meat to most of those dishes. All the dishes are easy to prepare, and the ingredients are easily found in any grocery store.This cookbook does contain a goddess twist. There are Celtic festivals to celebrate and ways to honor a certain goddess with that dish. Even if you are not a Pagan, this book is exciting because the Pagans are known for living at one with the Earth. So, who better to find out what's in seasons and what meals to eat during that season, than a Pagan!Examples of some of the delicious dishes you too can enjoy from this book are: Curried Stuffed Eggs, Golden Potato Soup, Roasted Vegetable Lasagna, Summer Garden Couscous, Southwestern Polenta and Garden Gazpacho.This cookbook was so good, that I also recommend another one of her cookbooks \\"Cooking by Moonlight, 13 Menus for 13 Moons\\".Check out this book today!"},{"Title":"Cooking by the Seasons: Simple Vegetarian Feasts","review":"I was thrilled to receive Cooking by the Seasons as I'd enjoyed her previous cookbook Cooking By Moonlight. This aimed more specifically at vegetarians and vegans, a large and growing market. Delicious food non-vegetarians will enjoy as well. As with Allrich's previous work, she writes from a Goddess-centric point of view, while briefly incorporating hints of the God and masculine energies, this work is mostly aimed at women in general.Divided into four main sections by season, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each contains a short description of associated colours, elements, brief bits of Goddess lore and so on, as well as menu suggestions for the festivals or sabbats.Allrich sensibly recommends eating in tune with the seasons to align oneself closer to nature and the Goddess, eating fruits and vegetables as they're harvested. Many recipes for light fresh greens in the summer, warm simmering soups for the winter. Too often you hear about neo-pagan festivals and such with no actual connection to the changing of the seasons and alignment with Nature; for example, harvest festivals sans the harvesting, etc. This becomes symbolic at best, and at worst supremely naive. Allrich reminds us to &quot;eat in season&quot; to maintain that connection to the Earth and Her bounty.She includes recipes for flavoured wines, appetizers, soups, main course, salads and desserts for each season with appropriate produce, with a section for notes and additions. Also contains three appendices: resources list to search out ingredients and natural products, as well as a detailed list of cooking terms from US to UK, additionally there is also a measurements conversion chart. Category index, and alphabetical recipe index.As mentioned in a previous review, I'm no gourmet chef, however, when reviewing a cookbook, it makes sense to give the recipes a go. So I had a go at making the Baked Eggplant with Goat Cheese (page 74), as I love eggplant though rarely know what to do with it. It turned out fantastic, absolutely divine. I even managed to find something my notoriously picky husband (a non-vegetarian) loved, the Bread Crumb Pasta For Two (page 121). The recipes were easy to follow, making me almost feel like a chef on surveying and enjoying the finished product.I'm gradually learning that food can be much more than stuff you eat to stay alive - it can also be a delicious life affirming experience to be sensually induced and indulge in. Kerri Ann Allrich's cookbooks have contributed to a large part of that. If you're looking for something deliciously flavourful to add to your cooking repertoire, pick this up."},{"Title":"Cooking by the Seasons: Simple Vegetarian Feasts","review":"I have this book, and 'Cooking By Moonlight', as well. They are both great books. The recipes in this book are SO GOOD, and the ones I haven't tried yet look good, too. They are not necessarily quick recipes, but everyone I have made has been worth the time it took. I am slow when I cook, so to a more experienced cook, they probably won't seem that long. Karri Ann's recipes are flavorful, and some are even \\"exotic\\" or \\"gourmet\\", but not so much that I have to go out of my way to find the ingredients, which I appreciate, living in the middle of nowhere.Some of my favorites are: sundried tomato focaccia, lemon risotto with baby peas, rosemary focaccia, and dense lemon cake in chocolate-cognac sauce. The focaccia is to die for, in my opinion. It was one of the first breads I ever made, besides bread-machine recipes, and it's not too hard to make. The focaccia recipes all have variations in which you can mix it with the bread machine, should you wish. I personally love to add a little extra \\"energy\\" by mixing it by hand.Probably because I live in a region that doesn't really have \\"seasons\\", I have enjoyed this cook book. I feel much more in touch with Autumn, when having a winter squash or pumpkin dish, even if it is 80 degrees outside! Very nice work. I hope she keeps writing cook books."},{"Title":"Cooking by the Seasons: Simple Vegetarian Feasts","review":"Cooking By the Seasons (formerly Recipes from a Vegetarian Goddess) is a great cookbook for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Organized by (you guessed it) the four seasons, chapters highlight appropriate foods evocative for each seasonal holiday.For those new to the culinary arts, Ms. Allrich's recipes are simple to put together with clear, consise instruction. Notes on the turning wheel of the year accent creative menus; from beverages and appetizers, to soups, salads, main dishes and desserts, you'll find a satisfying recipe to help you celebrate the seasons with toss-together pasta recipes, tasty side dishes, quick soups, focaccia and pizzas, and plenty of hearty baked dishes - lasagnas, roasted vegetables, enchiladas, stuffed peppers. Unlike many vegetarian books, the desserts are tempting &amp; wonderful. I highly recommend the Key Lime Pie.A few personal favorites include: Roasted Acorn Squash Risotto, Southwestern Polenta, Paradise Pizza and Penne Rustica. Note: the focaccias are surprisingly easy (especially if you have a bread machine to mix the dough).Allrich's recipes are easily adaptable. For those sensitive to dairy, recipes that feature milk, cheese or cream are offered with both non-dairy or dairy ingredients; one has a choice, and most recipes are easily adapted to a vegan approach. If chicken or fish is included in your diet, you can easily add these.All in all, a very creative, user-friendly cookbook with everyday recipes your family will enjoy."},{"Title":"Cooking by the Seasons: Simple Vegetarian Feasts","review":"Cooking by the Seasons is the reissue of the cookbook, Recipes from a Vegetarian Goddess. I noticed a few minor changes in some of the recipes and a new updated introduction. Also added to this edition are cooking conversion (charts and glossary) for US to UK translation, and a new resources section.I am a fan of Karri Allrich's cookbooks. Her recipes are not overly complicated and adjust easily to adding your own dash of creativity. This book focuses on the four seasons and features seasonal menus and recipes that reflect the pleasures of spring, summer, fall and winter.There is Pasta Primavera and Heuvos Rancheros for spring. Lavender Cookies, Corn Mother's Relish, and Baked Eggplant with Goat Cheese for summer. Autumn offerings include Cranberry Apple Crisp, Stuffed Acorn Squash and Corn Pancakes with Black Bean Salsa. Winter is the time for comfort foods and this cookbook features many, such as Winter Risotto with Mushrooms and Pine Nuts, Solstice Pumpkin Soup or Hearty Chili Bean Soup.There are sections featuring appetizers (my favorite is the Brushcetta), beverages (I've tried the May Wine and Mulled Cider - very tasty), soups, salads, side dishes and main dishes. There are also desserts...the Key Lime Pie is my dessert of choice whenever I'm asked to bring something to a gathering... everyone loves it (and it makes me look good ;).For those interested in goddess lore there is a nice (but not overpowering) touch of goddess and Celtic viewpoints in this cookbook. The focus is on the Earth, celebrating the seasons, and taking time for simple pleasures. The text surrounding the recipes is poetic and gently humorous. All in all, an inspiring cookbook with plenty of recipes you'll actually use.Check out her other cookbook - Cooking By Moonlight - for even more seasonal recipes and extensive information on the folklore of herbs and foods (though the focus in that cookbook is not completely vegetarian). I recommend both cookbooks as they are very complimentary."},{"Title":"Your Doctor Can't Make You Healthy","review":"In an era where we are constantly being bombarded with a pill for every ill, it is refreshing to be reminded that I am still ultimately in charge of my own well-being. This book reminds me that I am in control of my own destiny and that if I am not presently in control of it, then I can regain control. I have choices to make and that my future is to a great extent dependent on the actions I take now. For anyone seeking truth, self-reliance and self-responsibility, this book reaches out to you.&iexcl;The health of the patient is his or her primary responsibility but the patient first must be empowered before being delegated such a task&iexcl;.

Indeed, you will find this book peppered with statistics that will blow your mind and drive even the most sedentary couch potato to thoughts of taking an evening stroll instead of playing round-robbin with the TV remote control.This book is a call to arms ...

I found the book to feel oversimplified and sort of biased - in the sense that in many cases the author implies that he knows something that your doctor does not (whereas there was not any \\"news\\" in here for the average North American MD). In my opinion, much of the information presented, while perhaps interesting, so far underrepresents the currently-known \\"whole truth\\" that it may mislead the layperson into believing that exercise and nutrition can solve all of one's ails.I am also not a fan of the \\"Dummies\\"-like style and layout.The communication level seems appropriate for a teenager.Certainly, this is a reasonable primer but I do not recommend this book as a loner on one's home medical bookshelf since it omits so much explanation and truth (and conflicting evidence in some cases!) to further the author's dramatically simple agenda."},{"Title":"The Reclamation Project.","review":"Ruth Marie Davis transports us to the year 2250 in her spectacular science fiction romance novel. Davis explores what would happen if the infamous Egyptian Library of Knowledge were found. What would those secrets revel? Dr. Lindsey Larimer and Dr. Kevin Sanders will discover those secrets and how they could change the world, as they know it.Lindsey is an Egyptologist who discovers the Library along with her famous father. The U.S. and Egypt work together to unlock the secrets of the ancient scrolls. The scrolls reveal that a human key is needed to unlock the pyramids' secrets. Scientists determine that this key is an Egyptian Pharaoh; however, the problem is that Pharaohs have not existed for hundreds of years. As a result, a team at IBAT is given government approval to perform the first human cloning on King Tutankhamun and his wife Ankhesenamun. The hope is that when mature, the clones will be the human keys.Kevin is a member of the IBAT team and Lindsey is brought on board as an Egyptian expert. The two get off to a very rocky start. However, neither can deny the attraction they feel. Once they meet with the scientists working on the Library's scrolls, they are drawn together for a common goal and to explore the feelings they cannot ignore.Lindsey starts to experience dreams that are almost too real involving the growing clones. She is concerned about the intensity of King Tut and perhaps ulterior motives he may have. Ankhesenamun becomes close friends with Lindsey and will shock her with unsettling knowledge. During all this Lindsey and Kevin solidify their relationship and start thinking about starting a family. Everything seems to be going fine until the secrets of the Library and the clones comes to a head.

The first human clones are to be copies of none other than King Tut and his wife, Ankhesenamun, for they are possibly the human key that will unlock the wisdom of the ages, recently uncovered in ancient ruins. In charge of this joint project are Drs. Lindsey Larimer and Kevin Sanders. After an inauspicious beginning, the couple quickly falls in love. Though it seems the project is going well, Lindsey finds herself plagued with dreams that hint they have opened a can of worms that might be too much for the world itself. King Tut is power crazy, and the boy king may get a chance to unlock evil that he has been denied for four millennia. The price of saving humanity from his dangerous schemes comes with a heartbreaking cost.***** This is an incredible book. I hardly know how to praise it without giving away too much. Mixing profound Christian faith with myths and science so expertly that I cannot stop thinking about the possible truths that could be found herein, I am reminded most strongly of Madeline L'Engle and C.S Lewis' classic works. With a scope that takes you from the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of Heaven, this book is not to be missed. Yet, there is no skimping on characterization. As with Nora Roberts, you get to really know the people, and love them, making the ending that more poignant. Be prepared to not be able to put it out of your mind easily. *****Amanda Faye Killgore"},{"Title":"The Reclamation Project.","review":"As a student working toward my doctorate in Egyptology, my mother bought me a copy of this awesome book for Christmas. I can only say that I wish I had thought of and written about this concept first! While reminiscent of Stargate and The Mummy, The Reclamation Project is without a doubt in a league of its own. The ancient Egyptian/Alien theory has always been of exceptional interest to me and the author has created a believable and incredibly well-researched book. The romance element also made for an exceptional read and while the hero/heroine relationship is heterosexual, the inclusion of a well-written gay character was most refreshing. I will certainly pass this book around to my friends and will definitely recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Reclamation Project.","review":"Wow! I just finished reading my copy of The Reclamation Project and have to say that it just about left me breathless. I know it's only a sci-fi novel, but with the capabilities we have today, this story-line could well be plausible. I've always had a fascination with the possible alien/ancient civilization connection, which was why I was interested in reading The Reclamation Project in the first place. Legend tells of a lost 'Library of Knowledge,' that is supposed to contain first-hand writings from the Atlantians. Perhaps some day it will actually be found. Using this theory and weaving an intricate story around it, Ms. Davis certainly succeeded in holding my attention from the very beginning to the very end. I had just finished reading the book, &quot;Signs,&quot; after having seen it at the theatre when it was first released. To be perfectly honest, that book didn't hold a candle to The Reclamation Project. I honestly hope that Ms. Davis writes a few more novels along these same lines as I could read her work every day and never tire of it.

Though I really had no intention of actually reading the book, I am a Vietnam veteran and wanted to support such a kind and patriotic woman. As it happened, my wife read the book and enjoyed it so much, she begged me for a month to read it. Just to make her happy and for no other reason, I sat down and read The Reclamation Project.

However, this book is not one of his best. It seemed to me that he was trying to find his footing in writing this and as a result, the narrative is too spotty and anecdotal. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with anecdotes but when they dot every other page it is a little too much. Most importantly, he hops around way too much in following a group of spies as they tried to penetrate the Reich. While there may be no other way to have written a book about these varying groups, I just think I would have stayed away from it all together. I really found the writing to be too interrupting and stopped reading it after a while. Nevertheless, read \\"Eleventh Month\\" and you will find a writer extraordinaire in Persico's subsequent development of his craft."},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"This outstanding autobiographical recount of Ardery's WW2 experiences ranks amongst the top in this genre. Follow his career through flight training and initial assignments, trials, tribulations and finally, a combat assignment. Ardery, his crew, and their B24 participated in several critical and unprecedented bombing missions during the war, including the infamous Ploesti raid. His recount of flying into a virtual &quot;wall of fire&quot;, which was the defensive flak being levelled at their bomber, is one of the most horrowing experiences written to date. In addition to this book, those interested in the B24 should definately read Thomas Childer's &quot;Wings of Morning : The Story of the Last American Bomber Shot Down over Germany in World War II&quot; which stands alone as the absolute finest piece of literature written to date on this subject."},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"This is an account of Col.

This story also includes his account of the low level raid on the Ploesti oil fields of Romania by B-24s of the Eighth and Twelfth air forces. This is truly a must-read book for those who have limited knowledge of what pilots of the B-24 had to go through! Check it out!"},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"Ardery's account of his life as a B-24 pilot is excellent. From all the training it took to simply get into the planes, to combat in the skies over the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, Ardery's account is an even-handed account of what a bomber pilot's life was like.The chapter about Ploesti is especially fascinating. James Dugan and Carrol Stewart used Ardery as a source for their book on the subject, and the details of Ardery's part in the raid offer some really interesting stuff. Especially intruiging is the background and fate of Medal of Honor winner Lloyd Hughes, who was flying on Ardery's wing when when he perished.This book is really good stuff; Steven Ambrose's &quot;Wild Blue&quot; pales in comparison.

His narrative illustrates that the threat of injury or death was constant for every member of the crew and that either was just as likely to happen whether one was in training, flying through flak, trying to avoid German fighters or avoiding mid-air collisons while flying in tight formation with your squadron mates. Readers will have an excellent idea of what our airmen endured during World War II."},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"The cover of Bomber Pilot displays a photograph of a Liberator skimming the ground on a low level attack on the Ploesti raid. This photograph alone makes you want to reach out to grab Bomber Pilot assured that you will have an exciting read. And you won't be disappointed. Pilot Phil Ardery won a Silver Star, two DFCs, four Air Medals and the French Croix de Guerre with palm. He didn't get those sitting around some Officers' Club.He flew 24s on missions ranging from icy Norway to baking North Africa. Some Eighth Air Force crews were detached to Libya to join in the fight to drive the Axis from Bengasi, Tripoli and all of the Mediterranean. You'll be able to compare bombing in hot and dusty Libya and lurching through the Norwegian sky trying to find any identifiable landmark.Ardery flew missions to eastern Mediterranean islands. He says when he was stationed in Bengasi with Ninth Bomber Command there was no Protestant Chaplain and no Jewish one but there was a remarkable Catholic chaplain who was capable of conducting services for Jewish personnel. Ardery, a Protestant, notes that Fr. Beck could conduct a Jewish funeral with perfect form and dignity. He never missed an opportunity to give all possible aid and comfort to the Protestant boys. He never pushed his religion on any of them.Fr. Beck actually flew on combat missions from time to time . Crews thought it was lucky to have him aboard. One day the Group Commander found out and grounded him. He apparently feared having to explain what the chaplain was doing up in the air if he got wounded, taken prisoner or shot out of the sky.Read this book. My library got it for me which means most Massachusetts's libraries should be able to get it for you. Ardery, who later became a successful attorney, will take you on raids as far north as Oslo as well as deep into Naziland. He describes the buzz bombing of London, flying over the D-Day beaches, the courage of the British civilians.

It is one of the weakest memoirs of the air war that I have read. Mr. Ardery is not a born story-teller and writes drily, generally, and mechanically in the first 40% or so of the book, when I felt as I read that I was listening to someone speak in a monotone. His tone improved as I read on, but the reading was not a pleasure. His account is virtually devoid of humor and, at times, he sounded as if he took himself way too seriously. He seems to have gone through the war in a cocoon, with almost no relating to the world around him. Towards the end of the book he did relate some his experiences in London during the V-1 raids, though this trip was taken more as a research effort to see how the Brits were bearing up and comparing the coping skills of Americans in London at the same time. I cannot recommend this book, although the author was obviously a very accomplished and conscientious pilot and commander. Its focus is too narrow, being almost entirely restricted to missions, and personal command and control issues. On the other hand...I can recommend 'A Thousand Shall Fall' by Murray Peden, which is at the other end of the spectrum from 'Bomber Pilot' as a war-time memoir. Simply an excellent, entertaining and very informative read (3 times for me). Although a Canadian bomber pilot, he flew Fortresses towards the end of the war. The forewords are written by Lt. Gen. Ira Eaker, USAF (Ret.) and Robert J. Dixon, General, USAF (Ret.) In his Dedication, Mr. Peden states, \\"...Night after night the battle was joined. In the morning the swelling roar of hundreds of Cyclones and Twin Wasps heralded the start of the complementary operations of the Combined Bomber Offensive flown by Fortress and Liberator crews of our redoubtable partners, the US Eighth Army Air Force. Those daylight operations were carried out only at the price of a matching tax in blood levied against the American air crew. I remember them all, with pride, respect and enduring affection.\\" General Eaker states, \\"...This is an unusually entertaining and factual account of the air war which Britain and her principal ally, the U.S., waged against the vaunted German Luftwaffe.\\" General Dixon states, \\"...to relive that experience in the words of Murray Peden's superbly written classic...\\"; and \\"All those wonderful minutes, hours, days are brought back by the clear, bright recollections of Murray Peden...and whose book, even in its tragic moments, attests to the free spirit that characterizes airmen the world over.\\""},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"This is a balanced work of historical detail and personal experience, well written and a great read."},{"Title":"Bomber Pilot: a Memoir of World War II","review":"I had read a hard copy of this book, borrowed from the library, several years ago.

It covers the neo-Calvinist ethos in a nutshell. These guys want the kingship of Christ but aren't too clear on how to get there.Bolt recognizes this as he surveys the religio-political options available to Americans. He doesn't like theonomy but he also realises he doesn't have a really good critique of them. He wants socialism but he is also aware of the Reconstructionists' blistering critique of socialism in the form of David Chilton. At least he did his homework in that regard.The book is good as an exposition of some of Kuyper's political themes, but, if one may wax Hegelian, that appears to be part of the problem. After Kuyper--and I want to be sensitive to the complex political struggles in the Netherlands--the Netherlands not only did not become a Free City on the Hill, but today is arguably the most degenerate country in Europe.Is Kuyper at fault? Probably not, but his vision of the kingship of Christ lacked any specific biblical and legal content.Evaluation of the book:The reader was uncomfortable with the repeated references to Lincoln and Martin Luther King. The former openly rejected Christianity and the latter espoused an extremely liberal version of it. The reader is left confused with what specifically to do. How does one appropriate a Kuyperian vision in an increasingly violent and anti-Christian culture?"},{"Title":"Spencer's Mountain, a Prologue to Love, a Time to Stand, Give It Back to the Lemongrowers, Kirkland Revels (Reader's Digest Condensed Books: Winter 1962 Selections, 1)","review":"Great Book. from a true story about Waltons Mountain.

Briefly, it deals with a 19-year old illegitimate youth, Arkady Dolgoruky, who comes to Petersburg to join his family, which he barely knows because he was shipped off to boarding school throughout his childhood. In the brief time during which the action takes place, he becomes embroiled in the intrigues surrounding his family and its close acquaintances, culminating in a blackmail scandal surrounding a letter which the young widow Katerina Akhmakov (with whom both Arkady and his father Andrei Versilov are in love) had written a couple years earlier which expresses her interest in having her wealthy, aging, and mildly senile father declared insane--she is expected to be disinherited if her father finds out about the letter.The greatest strength of the novel, to my mind, lies in its intriguing characters. In particular, both Arkady and Versilov are rather deeply probed, and instead of hastily fitting into certain types as can often be seen in Dostoevsky's work, they both emerge as extremely complicated individuals pulled by multiple conflicting forces, and their confusion about themselves and the world around them is a superb reflection of the confusing atmosphere that prevailed in Russia in the 1870s (and in Arkady's case, also the confusion inevitable for a 19 year-old young man with no strong roots). In addition, the cast of female characters is probably as strong and diverse as I've seen any of Dostoevsky's works (with the possible exception of The Idiot), and the saintly old Makar (Arkady's mother's husband and hence his legal father) is an excellent precursor to Zosima from The Brothers Karamazov.The plot, though, leaves a bit to be desired, and that's probably why The Adolescent is less noted than its sister novels. Part of the problem, I suppose, is that the fate of a letter is not quite as interesting a thing to center a novel around as murder (as in Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov), radical political mayhem (as in The Possessed), or a meek hero's Christian love for humanity (as in The Idiot and, to an extent, Karamazov again). Also, Dostoevsky inserts a few too many somewhat implausible plot twists (in particular, characters randomly run into each other in the street so often that you'd think Petersburg was no bigger than a small village), and the whole plot, especially the ending, is really quite melodramatic.The weak plot doesn't prevent The Adolescent from being a very engrossing novel (and as an aside I might mention that translator Andrew MacAndrew's introduction is the best introductory essay I've read to any of Dostoevsky's works). If you're a Dostoevsky fan, consider it required reading; if you're not, you'll probably still enjoy it, but I'd say that The Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot share most of its strengths and have more to offer overall, so you should read those first."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"Written before The Brothers Karamazov in the later part of his life, this novel again demonstrates the Russian masters ability to meld heavy characterizations with the Dark vs. Light moral and spiritual conflict. Again somewhat autobiographical(as many readers are already aware of this pattern), the story concerns a 19 year old bastard son of a cultured nobleman and a simple peasant wife. Determined to break his awkward social position, since he is the son of an ambiguously respected man yet cannot carry his namesake, Arkady begins an intellectual and moral quest to discover more about himself, his dichotomic parents and the people most closely with which they are entangled. Yet beginning to burn beneath the surface are other queries as well: his attraction to an older woman whom he knows is maybe linked romantically to his father, his mysterious &quot;other father&quot;(his mothers' serf husband until her affair with Arkady's father ended that, yet he carries this man's name), and a dangerously rebellious group of young men that succeed in rousing his moral and intellectual curiosity. Beautifully complex in its many layers, I believe this particular novel of Dostoevsky most vividly displays the authors genius. He is an artist who can only be compared to the best the world has ever known. Russia's most prolific artist ever, PERIOD. Also, not to go unmentioned, Macandrews' translation is by far the best I've ever found for any of Dostoevskys work, PERIOD. If you have never gotten around to reading any of the many great 19th century Russian novels, I recommend this novel with the highest possible honors."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"I picked up this book not knowing much about it and not having read any of the reviews here on Amazon. Being a big Dostoyevsky fan and having read most of his other books multiple times, my first thought after reading about 20 pages into The Adolescent was, &quot;why didn't I read this sooner!&quot; What I like most about Dostoyevsky is his ability to develop such vivid characters, mostly through dialogue. In this book, the eponymous main character is also the narrator (the book is meant to be his memoirs) so the reader gets an even deeper insight into character. We get to read how the young man wants and intends to behave, and then we get to see him repeatedly fail to come across as the dignified adult he wants to be as he behaves more like the adolescent he is. It's often pretty funny--I found this book far more humorous than Dostoyevsky's others.That being said, I agree with the other reviewers that some of Dostoyevsky's other books are probably a better place to start for people who have read none of his books. I think of Crime and Punishment as being the best introduction. Any of his more well-known books gives a more fully-explained intro to his thinking and style and will probably make The Adolescent a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"Without doubt one of his great novels. It is the second time i've read it in quiet awhile and am struck by how modern it really is. The narrative structure of using Arkady as the story teller helps explain the rushed, uneven and feverish pace at with the book unfolds: but it is an example of the blending of form and content. All Dostoevsky's great themes are here but on a smaller scale. The novel is a clear example of a great writer warming up to the themes and ideas that he was to explore fully in his next work and masterpiece, 'The Bros K.' 'The Adolescent' is an excellent introduction to the thematics and style of the world's greatest novelist"},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The Adolescent must, in my opinion, be acknowledged one of Dostoevsky's masterpieces. The Adolescent, Dostoevsky's second-to-last novel, stands on par with The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot, Crime & Punishment, Devils, and Notes from Underground.It difficult for me to understand why some critics have dismissed The Adolescent as a substandard work, or, as is the case in some instances, why others have omitted entirely a discussion of the novel in their critical works.The plot centers around the narrator Arkady, who, having graduated from High-School, arrives in Petersburg to become acquainted for the first time with Petersburg society, as well as with his biological family, with whom he had had very little contact with since the days if his early childhood. Arkady is an illegitimate son: his father a nobleman; his mother a former household serf.Adding to the drama is the fact that when Arkady arrives in Petersburg he has with him a sought-after document that could be used to extort and control several important people. One such person is the beautiful and enchanting Katerina Nikolaevna, with whom Arkady and his father, Verislov are both madly in love.Similar to all of Dostoevsky's great novels, the greatness of The Adolescent is not in the actually plot, but rather, is a result of the deeply insightful, brutally honest and endlessly fascinating portrayal of man and society.The most noticeable difference in The Adolescent is the narrative form. The novel is written in the first-person, expressing the point of view of the Adolescent himself.Another difference in The Adolescent is that it does not contain the absolute forms of personality-types that are prominent in the other major novels. This is true more for Arkady than for Verislov. Instead one finds layered hybrids and a more ordinaryAs a result of these differences -- which, by the way, I consider to be a great strength of this novel -- one will find that the character of the adolescent (that is, of Arkady Makarovich Dolgoruky) offers the most in-depth, most layered, and above all the most realistic psychological portrait of Dostoevsky's entire literary output. In Arkady one finds traces of a number of Dostoevskian character-types, i.e.: the Underground Man, Prince Myshkin, and Aloysha Karamazov. Yet, unlike those characters, Arkady is a much more ordinary, familiar and altogether realistic character in terms of both his personality and the circumstances in which he is to observed.If you are new to Dostoevsky, I recommend starting with Crime and Punishment and then moving on to The Brothers Karamazov. If you enjoyed those books and find yourself left wanting more, then The Adolescent, in my opinion, would be a good place to turn and is sure to be an enjoyable and memorable reading experience."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The Adolescent, previously translated as A Raw Youth, came after all of Fyodor Dostoevsky's great novels except his masterpiece The Brothers Karamazov yet has long been considered minor. Indeed, it not only failed to enter the world canon but had long been hard to find in English before this recent translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, the Russian to English translators now most in vogue. Pevear's Introduction seems determined to rescue the book from the critical gutter; he has legitimate points and argues well but is not quite convincing, though he and his wife did at least succeed in getting renewed readership. In the view of this long-time Dostoevsky fan, the novel does deserve more readers and acclaim but is clearly below his major work. Fans will of course want it, as his genius was simply too great to be held back, and those not normally fond of him may be pleasantly surprised by this generally uncharacteristic work.The novel is essentially a bildungsroman and is quite successful on this front - is indeed one of the popular genre's most underrated entries. Even its many critics have long praised its believably detailed and forcefully presented picture of adolescence, and Arkady, the troubled nineteen-year-old intellectual protagonist, has particular verisimilitude. It has often been said that this was the most convincing adolescence depiction before The Catcher in the Rye, which is truly high praise. Arkady was a more or less representative young Russian male, and many initial readers no doubt found him very relatable. However, since so much of adolescence is universal, his experience still speaks to many across decades and cultures; few cannot relate to his doubts and uncertainties, and even fewer will be unable to sympathize. He is essentially like any young man struggling to find an identity and place in the world. That he is not put on a pedestal makes him easy to relate to and gives much of his appeal. Arkady has many conventionally admirable qualities, not least intelligence and ambition, but is also often impulsive and reckless in a way very familiar to anyone who has dealt with promising but undisciplined youth. However, he learns much in the course of the book and comes to a sort of equilibrium after the dramatic climax, rounding out the classic bildungsroman pattern. That Dostoevsky was able to write all this so plausibly despite being well past middle age and not having such an upbringing himself is a true testament to his artistry.Many will see the similarities between Arkady and Crime and Punishment's more famous Raskolnikov, and the book is in many ways a less serious version of Crime. Like that novel, it is highly influenced by Ivan Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, particularly its dramatization of the intellectual conflict and larger generation gap between Arkady and his father. They symbolize their generations, making the discussion relevant to Russia in a larger sense. This is now of course mostly of historical interest, but associated domestic issues like responsibility of fathers toward children will surely always be relevant and also hinted at what was to come in The Brothers.The weakness is primarily in the plot - or lack of one. The bildungsroman format gives a framework of sorts, but much of the action is essentially episodic, which is fine with some but rankles many. Execution is also less than deft, with an overreliance on coincidences, chance meetings, etc. Above all, though, much of what happens is simply uninteresting in itself, though Arkady's thoughts and the greater significance usually make it worthwhile. Finally, the more conventionally exciting bits - e.g., the mysterious letter - are so highly wrought as to be melodramatic. It is very possible that this is intentional - Dostoevsky's way of showing Arkady's, and thus youth's, exaggerated self-absorption -, but most will be unconvinced as to its artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is considerably less serious than usual. There is a certain lightness to much of the material and significantly more humor than one would expect - though, being Dostoevsky, the humor is very black. This may disappoint some fans but could well be a surprising delight to others, while it is one of several factors that could attract those usually averse to Dostoevsky. Less debatable is the lack of philosophical dramatization that is one of his hallmarks; this certainly does not tackle the weighty issues of thought and theology that his best works do. His other hallmark - psychological perspicuity - is here in full force, which atones to a large degree, but it is hard not to miss the heavier elements.All told, anyone who likes Dostoevsky should read this, though all his major works should be read first, while those who have read a novel or two and not been particularly thrilled may wish to skip to it."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The above quote is from page one of the novel. So many of these reviews say that the narrator is nineteen, or 18-19. He's almost 21. Read the book.The new title by Pevear and Volokhonsky seems wrong. A Raw Youth, the earlier title, isn't any better, being somewhat archaic in English. Apparently Prodrostok, the Russian title, means teenager, but it has other connotations in Russian for which there's no exact English counterpart. Adolescent is from the French, originally from Latin. To me it means a psychological stage in growth that is earlier than the age of our young man.The novel always held my interest, but it is clearly at a lower level of artistic inspiration than the other late great novels - Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov. That some scholar can say of the book, The Adolescent is the most captivating of Dostoevsky's novels, seems so far off the mark as to be risible. Many of the reviewers here also claim it's among his best. To each his own, but I will say that it feels to me that my perusal of Dostoevsky's books would be incomplete without reading this book. I'll have to read it again some day to figure out what it's all about. The style of our twenty-year old is elliptical. But I had the same trouble with the other novels. One reading hardly begins to expose their \\"lovely reek.\\" Dostoevsky throws you into his maelstrom and you have to figure out some way not to drown.I loved someone's comment that Dostoevsky is pure soul. But this soul is so steeped in humiliation and shame, it cannot be that the soul need be so steeped. The soul is notoriously accessible also at the high end, in love, wonder, happiness, and compassion. In fact Dostoevsky's characters find the soul in both places, though there is a heavy preponderance of the low end."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The novel is good, though it drags, sometimes like a soap opera, and finally after 300 pages[which consisted of a lengthy introduction to the St. Petersburg society of The Adolescent's(Arkady Dolgorky) friends, family, and acquaintances] begins to take form. The novel seems to survive like any good story, on the &quot;idea&quot; as Dostoyevsky puts it. The relatibility of Arkady, as a 18-19 year old searching for himself and his identity, which has been confused due to his own illegitimacy of familial relations, is striking and moving. The author's portrayal even in his old age of adolescenthood reflects the author's love of children and acknowledges that even in his old age, he never lost touch with the innocence of our youth. Anybody who tells you this book is not representative of the days of youth is in denial, because though it is far from pretty at times, it is honest.The novel has many twists and turns, a variety of seemingly unimportant subplots, that in the end serve to further strengthen the emotional bond between the reader and the characters. Though the author sometimes sweeps you away too much, he always brings you back down to earth. The narrator's search for his identity and an answer to the questions that have haunted him since his childhood lend the novel to everyone. We all have questions about the early years of lives, the brighter days some might say, and Dostoyevsky shows us in many ways to how to find them; how to resolve ourselves to those we love. Being adopted at the age of 6, I often wonder a great many things about my birth parents, and the Adolescent taught me something fundamental about my own relationships with my family. As the novel is so presented in the introduction as a &quot;family novel&quot; to prove the genre is not dead. Though sometimes the lessons are hard to apply into my life, I was still moved. And I think anyone who is &quot;wandering&quot; will find many answers about their soul in the Adolescent, if only they exert patience and openness on their reading of the novel. Nothing greater than the speck of light that shines at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"First things first: this is not a book for the faint of heart. There are four or five suicides, two affairs, and one character with a split personality. Also, I'm actually thirteen. I just don't like to give out my e-mail address.Arkady Dolgoruky is the narrator of the story. He accidently becomes embroiled in a nasty (and rather strange) blackmail plot.The narrator is very sympathetic, as are his mother, his sister, and several other characters. The portrayal of an adolescent is quite convincing (to my mind) especially as it was written by a fifty-two - year - old man! The narrator has a disgusted, confused, almost dreamy, air to his voice, making for a rather pleasant read.While the chacters are well drawn, I have to concede that the plot is not the best. Dostoyevsky can do better (and it pains me to critisize the master).The translater can do better, too. Some parts are so confusing, it's hard to tell who is being introduced. I couldn't tell who le grand dadais was until I read the epilogue!That said, though, this book really does deserve to be noticed. Why should such a valueable work by such a valueable author be so ignored?"},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"If you judge this book on plot and style - you would probably be inclined to toss it after the first hundred pages. However, plot and style are not parts of what modern art is all about. Every reader is, essentially, a passive consumer, sometimes endowed with a degree of healthy curiosity. And every writer's goal today, in my opinion, is to penetrate deeply into the heart and mind of such a consumer, shake him up, wake him up from his slumber, and, if possible inspire him to &quot;create&quot;. Not to the extent of turning him into a writer, but at least into a &quot;co-creator&quot;, raise a storm in the reader's soul, so that both the writer and the reader now participate in building this amazing world that only a human mind can build.Dostoyevsky achieves this par excellence. The long and tedious phrases, the weird characters, their strange, bizarre actions, their mood swings from one extreme to the next within a sentence, and, above all, the grotesque that this novel is saturated with to such an extent, I am almost tempted to call it a farce.Above all, if one were to think about it in context of modern Russia, one would be shocked at how nothing has changed in more than a century.If, when you pick up a book, you seek entertainment - don't pick up this book. If, however, you like to embark on self-exploration rollercoaster rides, then, by all means, buckle up!"},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"This book is certainly one of dostoevsky's best. I have read this in a fairly late time in my life (aged 21) but still managed to identify rather easily and completely with the young protoganist (19 years old). The movie contains some very suspensful scenes and a very suspenseful intriguing plot, even more than in the other great dostoevsky novels. it had been said that 'idiot' had enough plots for 4 books, 'devils' had enough plots for 7 and 'the adolescent' for 9 or 10. They say Dostoevsky tried to form in this book the literary figure of chaos, which he managed alright! The book is still very intriguing, only the plots are a bit to messy, which leaves less place for dostoevsky's philosophy than in his other great masterpieces such as 'Idiot', 'Devils', and 'Brothers Karamazov' or even 'Crime and punishment' or 'Notes from underground'. Containing a very apt description of an adolescent soul, this book was indeed 80 years ahead of the 'cathcer in the rye' as some people claimed, and for me Arkady Dulgoruky is probably an even more interesting character than Holden Cauldfield. Also containing some very interesting, abstract discourses, and very moving rurals tales (as expected from dostoevsky). If you love Dostoevsky you can't go wrong with this one, it contains all the factors that made him my favorite writer - but if you haven't read 'devils' 'Brothers Karamazov' or 'Idiot' : read them first as they are this book's superiors."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"Very good, typical Dostoevsky story, good at showing a young man growing up in society, not an easy read but worth the effort."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The wisdom of literary scholars should be ignored as most of them dismiss this book. Personally, The Brothers Karamazov has been my least favorite of Dostoevsky's novels, and I have now read ten Dostoevsky novels. This book is excellent, though less explicitly philosophical and psychological as The Brothers Karamazov, which is clearly why literary scholars don't hold this book in as high esteem. However, this book is a better piece of ART. I have said it: I like The Adolescent more than The Brothers Karamazov."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"This is one of Dostoevsky's finest novels reflecting political views from his century that are not uncommon from our own. His philosophical input is remarkable that stretches into our own current time. For Dostoevsky readers and those interested in a reading that challenges our own society and frame of thought..I highly recommend it..especially if you read Crime and Punishment and Notes from the Underground by this author."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"Forgive me, it's been a while since I read this book, but I figured I'd review it.I really liked it. I mean I -really- liked it. I thought it got a bit heavy on philosophy I didn't quite understand. But then again, I was also an adolescent. I rather understood what he felt, being a bastard child myself, and now that life has taken an equally odd turn, I think it would probably behoove me to re-read it.But back to the point, I think the plot is excellent, though very thin. It pretty much focuses on letters and a supposed love-affair that occurred out of the country, where no one was watching.The only real let-down was the ending. It was very strange and seemed completely disconnected from the rest of the novel, as if he were in a rush to close it off and start on something else.As with many books, however, the enjoyment is the trip, not the destination. I think that definitely holds true for this book."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"In my project to read all of Dostoyevksy's fiction, the Adolescent (also known as A Raw Youth) was the last stop. It really is a complete mess -- fascinating, but a disaster as a novel. It is encouraging to all the aspiring novelists out there that the same person who could write the two greatest novels in any language (Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov) also wrote so much dreck (also check out The Gambler for uncontrolled failure on a grand scale). Get to work!Everything about The Adolescent is a flop -- bad versions of people and ideas that Dostoyevsky handles better elsewhere. It is as if he had to get the bad versions out of his system so he could learn to edit and control them (somewhat). Everyone in this novel is incoherent; the relationships are absurd; the philosophizing (Verislov gives a whole speech that is a poor draft of Ivan Karamazov) is patched in; and the plot devices (a letter sown into a jacket!!!) are so stupid as to be comic at exactly the moment when they are supposed to be devastating. The excuse for much of this is that the adolescent is, well, being adolescent. Sorry.The only really dangerous thing about this novel is that it reveals some of the classic tricks Dostoyevsky uses, and undermines them somewhat. The most important is the endless whirligig of delirium -- so effective in the other novels, so cardboard here."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"Dostoevsky's words bless the page like the stars do the sky. This books momentum is like a pot of water set to boil on the stove, the more time that passes the hotter it gets until it expldes b4 ur eyes."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"In my opinion this is definately the worst of Dostoevsky's five mature novels. There are a propondurance of translations of every other Dostoevsky work, but to my knowledge, there is only one English translation available of this one. I think that that accurately portrays the way this work has been viewed by the top translators.On the plus side, this book does offer a convincing portrait of an adolescent; full of ideals and naivety. Dostoevsky succeeds in his task of painting an accurate image of a raw youth, but fails to develop the other characters. You won't find any Raskolnikov, Mishkin, Stavrogin, or any Karamazovs in this work. I read this book not long ago and even the main characters name escapes me. I found both the writing and the storyline insipid and boring, and was surprised that this is the same author who wrote Crime and Punishment. This was the fourth major novel Dostoevsky wrote, just after The Demons and before Karamazov, but it doesn't show the brillance of either.Take my advice, skip it."},{"Title":"Adolescent","review":"The Adolescent by Dostoevsky was an extrodianrily tedious and dull work of fiction that showed little characteristics present in most adolescents. The protagasnist, Arkady Dolguruky, if you could even call him such was a loathsome and somewhat aggrevating character who was cold and unrealistic. He lived in a delirium where life was perfect and he wanted everythin g to just go his own way. Arkady posses the mentality of a two year old, ill tempered and immature. He carried with him a self centered aura that pushed everyone away from him. Arkady was a comtempuous human being who was only interested in bettering himself and fleeing from the problems that he was forced to face.In the story, Arkady is a miserable human bing who uses long and tedious monologues to describe the most monotonous aspects of daily life. Dostevesky could turn brushing your teeth into a five page long dialogue. Arkady uses any excuse he can to fail and run away. All of his problems are blamed on the antagonist, his father, Versilov. Arkady thinks everything that ever went wrong in his life was a result of his flawed father. Arkady has no respect for the man who reared him and financially supported him in his schooling and other foolish endeavors.The ambivilance of Arkady's family is the only true source of conflict that i can find hidden amongst Dostevesky's lenghty sentences that have no purpose other than to fill up space between when Arkady and Vesilov fight once more. they argue about the most minute details. There is not much more to the book than the arguments between father and son which can become quite tedious after two or three based on the same idea. the entire plot revolved around these two characters but a few others came and went. There was the typical quiet, beaten down mother, the annoying siblings, and the overbearing friend, and then those other friends who stabbed the two main characters in the back. It was like an extremly long and bad episode of the Real World.The Adolescent was not a book i would recommend to anyone unless they had a lot of time on their hands. It lacked substance and creativity. It was overall a very dull book that agitated the reader to the point of burning the book."},{"Title":"Grey maiden, the story of a sword through the ages","review":"Just an enoyable, great pulp story from one of the lesser known, most prolific pulp masters of the golden era, Arthur D.

(Its level is Grade 4, I believe.) As I always preview anything that is used in class, I read this book along with other materials provided by my district. Wow! What a let down! This author seems to think an obviously troubled young person calling others stupid all the time is funny. I found it disturbing. (In my class we have a rule about \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Shut up!\\") Even a pet bird calls everyone stupid! Strange.A child that is obviously disrespectful and troubled in his relationship with his younger siblings finds no enlightened direction from his parents whatsoever. Also, for 2005 it is quite outdated. Why would an advertising (what an enlightend profession to choose!) executive (The Dad) be living in an apartment with a wife and three children? Seems weird. Seeing that the book was written quite a while ago--well before the internet age--answered many questions.What I found MOST disturbing was that the author exposes Santa Claus! If you have a fourth or fifth grader who still believes, then you might be in trouble!Needless to say, I did NOT use this book with my class and expressed my concerns with my school district.

Peter is twelve years old and lives with his mother, father and younger brother, Fudge, in New York City. Fudge is a hyperactive child who drives Peter crazy. Peter often thinks about running away, and when his parents tell him they are having another baby, he seriously considers it. Then, as if this news isn't enough, his parents decide to move away from the city to Princeton. To Peter, this sounds like the end of the world. He will have to leave his best friend, his crush, his school and Central Park. Although he will only be in Princeton for a year, he is upset that he will have to make new friends and, worst of all, Fudge will attend the same school. However, Peter and his family make it through the year in Princeton, deciding in the end that they would rather return to the city than stay in Princeton. This story demonstrates family values in a humorous way.This book appeals to children because all children have problems within their families that they must face. Peter's problems are fairly easy to solve; he just needs to grow out of them. He creates his problems and exaggerates their impact on his life. However, many children have faced problems similar to Peter Hatcher's before, such as having a new sibling or moving to a new town. Judy Blume gives a great example of how these children are feeling inside by telling the story through Peter's point of view. Peter must deal with many stressful situations in this story, such as when he must choose between his two best friends. This book is wonderful for children because it helps them learn positive ways to deal with anger and sadness.Superfudge was challenged in a school in Wyoming because it was considered to be profane, immoral and offensive. I can understand this objection; however, I do not agree that this book should be banned. I understand why this story is thought of as being immoral because of the way the family functions. They are a very loving family, but they don't seem to be able to control their middle child, Fudge. Fudge is most likely the character that prompted the challenge because he calls his teacher names and shows no respect to elders. The only person he shows any respect is Peter because he looks up to him and wants to be just like him. This is a great book for readers of all ages, even though it is geared toward third and fourth graders. I would recommend Superfudge to anyone who has brothers or sisters and can appreciate the love-hate relationship between siblings."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"This is a good book because it made me laugh.The funny part in the story is when the canary said bonjour stupid.

I assumed Super Fudge would be about the same. After starting the book I found some of the subject matter to be for older children. It was cute and funny but not for younger children."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Superfudge is a hilarious book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages,especially young adults. Peter Hatcher is an average twelve year old boy. His family has decided to move to Princeton because his father wants a change, but Peter is not very happy about this because he is at an age in which his life is beginning to change. He is starting to enter in the puberty stage and his physical, cognitive, and social development is continuously changing. Besides having to deal with the puberty issue, Peter has to deal with his annoying little brother, Fudge. Fudge brings great adventure to Peter's life and the story as a whole. Superfudge does a great job of telling the story of how one boy goes through many changes and how he has to adjust to new situations. It takes you on a journey of child development and how young people deal with the different stages of development. Blumes entertaining nature makes the story very comical and very easy for young people to relate to."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I bought all four Fudge audio books. My kids (7 year old girl, 9 year old boy) love them. We've listened to the whole set at least 3 times in the last 3 months.

Judy Blume is a gifted reader, each character has their own easily distinguishable voice. They ask about some of the concepts raised. My boy says the Fudge books make him feel better about things."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"My son and I read a chapter each night at bed time. We laugh at all of Fudge's antics.

I remember Superfudge from elementary school, and I have to say it was just as fun to reread as an adult. Peter has the unenviable task of being the oldest sibling to a precocious Fudge. Understandably he's not excited to learn yet another new sibling is on the way. I think he handles himself pretty well for his age, and Fudge is a riot. Just the idea that Fudge now has to see himself as an older sibling, just as Peter did when Fudge was born, was an interesting development. The parents fit their era, and Blume has provided a family drama most of us can relate to - children living with the decisions of their parents, and expected to be happy about it."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I got this for a gift for one of my granddaughters, her mother read it when she was younger. I got this for her kindle that I got her for Christmas. She loves to read"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"The gruesomely named Farley Drexel, nicknamed Fudge, (if you were named Farley Drexel, wouldn't you insist on having a nickname) along with Beverly Cleary's irrepressible Ramona has been one of my favorite literary characters since I was a child. I was a Ramona growing up, so it was only natural I'd love reading about a bright, high spirited character. Fudge fits the tab nicely.In this Fudge installment, Fudge's older brother Peter is going into middle school. Fudge, now almost 5 is excited about being a big brother for a change - a new sibling is on the way. Fudge's wonderful natural expression and clever sense of humor will no doubt delight readers of all ages.The Hatchers have decided to leave their apartment in Manhattan for a school year and spend that year in Princeton, N.J. The boys have a lot of adjustments to make - a move; a new sibling on the way and a different school.One of my favorite parts was when Fudge pretends to believe in Santa. He laughs to his brother Peter about how he fooled everybody - since their parents think he believes in Santa, he goes along with it. Peter revealed that he never once believed; at 3 he saw their parents putting presents under the tree and would later tell them that he felt it best to clue Fudge in as \\"Fudge thinks you can get whatever you want if you ask Santa.\\" He was right. I think Peter and Fudge are very lucky to be Santa savvy at such a young age. How I wish I'd had this book during my Santa believing days!Part of my delight with this book is that it does unmask Santa; for many who want their kids to \\"believe longer\\" and \\"preserve their innocence,\\" are postponing the inevitable. Although I personally wish I'd never believed in Santa and felt I'd been tricked, I do see the dual edge to this particular sword. I can understand, but not agree with the rationale for wanting to maintain this belief. In such instances, one cannot help but wonder if Santa is for the child or for the parents. Censoring a child's reading and editing story time so as to prevent unmasking Santa is only going to spark questions. Whenever anything is forbidden, as in this case a chapter in a book, it is only going to arouse even more questions and interest. Sooner or later the Santa will be out of the bag and an open frank discussion about Santa is a rite of passage to recognize, not dread.My only objection is that I didn't like the new covers. I didn't like the drawing of Fudge with a worm jar on his head and Peter drawn as a scarecrow. I felt the drawings on the new covers were harsh; garish and unappealing to the eye.Fudge, a bright youngster knows where babies come from; he is Santa savvy; he has get-rich-quick schemes and is full of personality, humor and high spirited fun. I just love Fudge!This book is brilliant; funny; deep and serious."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Taking turns to read this book....My two young, daughters enjoy their kindles, but have found actually reading this book entertaining. These young readers are enjoying this old time classic, making me realize how childhood experiences and social interactions don't change, making this book timeless in relating to some of life's growing up experiences even by our younger, \\"quick to grow up \\"generations. YEAH!!!!"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Superfudge is a book by Judy Blume. It is a comedy for kids. It is a great length chapter book for fourth and fifth graders. It could easily make a good read aloud.Superfudge is about a family that goes through a lot of life changes. They live in New York, but then move to a new city. They have a new baby and have to make new friends. The parents change jobs and the family works through many difficulties. In the end, they learn how to solve their problems and that changes aren't always so bad.Superfudge is an excellent and interesting read. The book explores the life changes of a family with lots of personality in a funny and creative way. It is a very detailed story, and it is full of surprises and suspense. Sometimes the word choice can become a bit repetitive, but Fudge and company are hilarious and unusual characters. They really carry the story and give it heart.We gave Superfudge 4.5 stars.

I also like this text because Farly Drexel Hatcher or (Fudge) reminds me a lot of my younger brother...who's always up to mischeif. Peter Hatcher is sort of like me...who tries to get at least a pretty good start to the day, and ignores his brother as much as possible.

Fudge, Peter's younger brother gets Peter into a lot of trouble. And, just when Peter thought it couldn't get any worse Peter's mom and dad told Peter they were having another baby. Peter thought, \\"another Fudge\\"! And that's when things really started changing. After Tootsie was born Peter's mom and dad told Peter they were going to move to New Jersey. When Fudge started saying big words, his mom and dad found out he could go to kindergarten a year early because he was so ready. On only the first day of school Fudge was already getting into trouble. Peter had made a few friends, but missed his old best friend from New York. As you can see the conflict in this story is Peter vs. Fudge. The theme is even if you're mad at your little brother and things just aren't working out, soon they will. You should read Super Fudge and see how things work out at the end. I give this book five stars because it was great and it had a lot of funny things in it."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"super fudge by judy blume was one of the best books i have read all year. the book was about a wonderful but complicated family.a mom,dad and their two sons petter {the oldest} fudge {the youngest}.

Blume shows how moving away from the town a boy loves can affect his life. This book was banned for several reasons, but primarily for immorality. I do not think this book should be banned because most children have no conception of the adult humor that caused the book to be banned. As a child, I could not comprehend the adult humor in this book. Judy Blume does a good job of sending out the right message for every person that reads this wonderful book.When I read this book as a third grader, I found it hilarious. Although I read a lot of Judy Blume's books as a child, I do not recall being savvy enough to understand the adult humor in them. After reading the book again as a college student, I could comprehend the adult humor that I missed as a child. I did not know that &quot;My mother's the one who likes kissing. That's why she moved to Vermont&quot; had anything to do with this child's mother having an affair (116). I did not even know what an affair was. I found this quote to be funny as an adult.

The author did a good job of writing it."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"The main characters are Mom,Dad,Tootsie,Peter and Fudge.Mom and Dad break the news that they are having another baby."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"The gruesomely named Farley Drexel, nicknamed Fudge, (if you were named Farley Drexel, wouldn't you insist on having a nickname)along with Beverly Cleary's irrepressible Ramona has been one of my favorite literary characters since I was a child. I was a Ramona growing up, so it was only natural I'd love reading about a bright, high spirited character. Fudge fits the tab nicely.In this Fudge installment, Fudge's older brother Peter is going into middle school. Fudge, now almost 5 is excited about being a big brother for a change - a new sibling is on the way. Fudge's wonderful natural expression and clever sense of humor will no doubt delight readers of all ages.The Hatchers have decided to leave their apartment in Manhattan for a school year and spend that year in Princeton, N.J. The boys have a lot of adjustments to make - a move; a new sibling on the way and a different school.One of my favorite parts was when Fudge pretends to believe in Santa. He laughs to his brother Peter about how he fooled everybody - since their parents think he believes in Santa, he goes along with it. Peter revealed that he never once believed; at 3 he saw their parents putting presents under the tree and would later tell them that he felt it best to clue Fudge in as \\"Fudge thinks you can get whatever you want if you ask Santa.\\" He was right. I think Peter and Fudge are very lucky to be Santa savvy at such a young age. How I wish I'd had this book during my Santa believing days!Part of my delight with this book is that it does unmask Santa; for many who want their kids to \\"believe longer\\" and \\"preserve their innocence,\\" are postponing the inevitable. Although I personally wish I'd never believed in Santa and felt I'd been tricked, I do see the dual edge to this particular sword. I can understand, but not agree with the rationale for wanting to maintain this belief. In such instances, one cannot help but wonder if Santa is for the child or for the parents. Censoring a child's reading and editing story time so as to prevent unmasking Santa is only going to spark questions. Whenever anything is forbidden, as in this case a chapter in a book, it is only going to arouse even more questions and interest. Sooner or later the Santa will be out of the bag and an open frank discussion about Santa is a rite of passage to recognize, not dread.My only objection is that I didn't like the new cartoon-like covers. I didn't like the drawing of Fudge with a worm jar on his head and Peter drawn as a scarecrow. I felt the drawings on the new covers were harsh; garish and unappealing to the eye.Fudge, a bright youngster knows where babies come from; he is Santa savvy; he has get-rich-quick schemes and is full of personality, humor and high spirited fun. I just love Fudge!This book is brilliant; funny; deep and serious."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"This book is kind of easy for me to read but it's definitely one of my favourite.

When I first read this and other books by Blume, I was in elementary, during the time which I was beginning to relate to her books. &quot;Superfudge,&quot; of course is a book that speaks of a boy who has a younger brother named &quot;Fudge.&quot; This book relates to many boys who have to deal with becoming a role model to their younger siblings, even though, like Peter in the previous book &quot;Tales of a Forth Grade Nothing,&quot; has no say in becoming an older brother. &quot;Superfudge&quot; deals with the universal human concern of family and finding themselves in that family, for example, Peter at first was the baby, but then he has that family placement taken from him when his brother is born. In &quot;Superfudge&quot; Peter not only finds out that there is to be another family member on the way, but that they are moving from New York to New Jersey. This to Peter is a critical change in his young life and seems like a never ending crisis. I truly recommend this book to young readers, especially those with younger siblings because this might help them understand that they are not alone in this world with the same problems. Because pre-adolescence is a critical stage, for both males and females, any type of change can seem like the world is going to end. Judy Blume's &quot;Tales of a Forth Grade Nothing&quot; and &quot;Superfudge&quot; is a reflection of such feelings in young boys who because of their family issues undergo many difficult changes that to a young boy are hard to deal with. Blume's books make young readers feel that they are not the only one's with problems. Because pre-adolescence is a stage where young adults feel as if they are alone with their issues, Blume helps them realize that life gets better, easier to deal with and most importantly, that they are not alone."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I read Superfudge for the first time when I was in 4th grade. At the time I thought it was a great book and a hilarious sequel to Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. However, I recently re-read both books (for the first time in 20 years) to my 8 year old and 5 year old. I did not remember any of the details of Superfudge, and wish I had reviewed it before I made the decision to read it to my kids. There were several aspects of Superfudge that, as a 10 year old, I found funny, but as a mom I found a little inappropriate for younger children. I had to remind my kids that Fudge's behavior and actions toward his teacher on his first day of kindergarten, his bratty friend Daniel's behavior toward all adults, and the repeated use of the word \\"stupid\\", were ok for characters in a book, but not ok for real life. As for the revelation that Santa Clause isn't real, when we came to that section of the book, I was able to completely skip it, and spare my kids from being disappointed.On a personal note, for someone who read Superfudge in the early 1980's, I was disappointed in the \\"updated version\\", with mentions of laptop computers, Cartoon Network, MP3 players, and CD's. I think the book is timeless and should be able to stand alone, without having to throw in references to 21st century technology.Overall, Superfudge is still a funny book about families, sibling rivalry, and growing up. However, if your children are going to read it on their own, make sure that: (1)they are old enough to realize that it's not always appropriate to behave like characters in a book and (2)they already know the truth about Santa. Otherwise you may want to read it to them so that you can censor certain parts."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Superfudge, by Judy Blume, is a splendid book about two boys, Fudge and Peter Hatcher, who move from New York City to Princeton, New Jersey. It is a funny book with lots of adventures in the boys' new neighborhood and at their new school. I really enjoyed reading this book because each chapter was like a separate, entertaining story. The characters in the story include a Myna bird named Uncle Feather whose trademark phrase is, &quot;Bonjour, stupid!&quot;. At one point, he calls Fudge's former teacher this during show-and-tell. All the characters have very strong personalities which blend nicely to make them all seem real. I found that I could recognize the characters' traits in many of my students. I was disappointed with the way Mrs. Blume included some topics not appropriate for young kids. For instance, Peter's friends use bad language at one point, shown when Fudge's friend, Daniel &quot;Ya Wanna Make Somethin' Of It?&quot; Manheim says, &quot;He said the A-word!&quot;. This is not appropriate language for a kids' book. Also, Fudge puts himself to sleep one night by singing &quot;B-E-E-R spells Whiskey.&quot; Overall, the book is an excellent book for kids, as long as they can handle the more mature subject matters."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Superfudge was a pretty interesting story.

Being an advanced reader for my age, I found this book to be unchallenging however, this is my absolute favorite book of all time! In Judy Blume's future books, I hope there to be more about Fudge's annoying friend Daniel who doesn't eat anything with onions, or crust on his bread and so on. Nevertheless, I forsee that small con far enough to realize that I have read Superfudge more than any one could count!"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"My child and I were enjoying the book a great deal in the car, on audio tape, until we got to the part where the author carefully details how there is no such thing as Santa, parents fake it, and even a kindergarten child knows this.

I was devastated the first time I read it, when I was about 9 or 10, because of that part. Then I read it again two years later and loved it. Please make sure your child already &quot;doesn't believe&quot; in Santa before letting him/her read it--it's a terrible way to find out &quot;the truth.&quot; Other than that, a great book, especially the parts with Uncle Feather and where Fudge asks &quot;Is this a catastrophe?&quot; and the principal replies, &quot;No, Fudge, but I'm sure you'll try harder next time.&quot;"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I picked up this one simply because it had a cute cartoon cover. A short while later, I was totally relating to the story, particularly the parts where the Hatcher kids react to major changes in their lives.The eldest child, Peter, is trying to lead a normal life, but this is being severely hampered by the presence of his uncontrollable younger brother Farley Drexel, better known as Fudge, and his parents, who insist on making big, life-changing decisions without consulting him first.Although light and funny, it casually throws in some revelations that you may not be ready to explain, like where babies come from, and the existence of Santa Claus. It also skims the surface of the trauma of moving to a new city away from your friends, having a new baby in the family, and having your parents switch their traditional parental roles.These issues are skillfully woven into a funny context, but the book can be interpreted at a much deeper level than it first appears.Amanda Richards, February 17, 2005"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"At age 9 I enjoyed this book but didn't like it as much asTales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing. For one thing, there were no pictureslike the previous book. Another thing, I felt like the Fudge series lost some of it's innocense with one of Peter's friends saying blankety-blank (they didn't actually print it out but hinted it) in front of Fudge and his pals. Peter's pal should have known better. I wouldn't recommend this book to really young readers for that reason, and it may be upsetting for some kids because of the fact that Blume gives the impression that there's no Santa. Now when I read it, I wasn't upset because I already knew. But I think it'd upset some children, and I thought it was sad that Fudge lost his childlike innocense by not believing in Santa anymore. So parents, I highly advise you to proof-read this book before handing it over to your kids, as with any questionable material."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"We love Judy Blume's books so far but, my God, what was this woman thinking? She writes a book that features an 11 year old but is read, let's face it, by 7-10 year olds. Many of these children cherish Santa Claus and this book basically kills it for them. I cannot believe that I unwittingly bought my young son a book, second in the series he loves, and had to face his tearful face asking me if it is true. This is an area that should be left to parents and children to discuss and decide for themselves. For shame, Judy Blume!"},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I read this book along side my 5 year old who's reading Double Fudge. Because he's reading at 4th grade level, we've been searching for books that are just right for him. Little did I know that I myself would enjoy reading Judy Blume's books this much as well. It is a great way for us to bond when the whole family reads the same book--and bonus for us parents to be able to read books that are not dumbed down just because they are meant for kids. In addition, I am also glad that I read the book before handing it to my son because it does \\"reveal\\" the \\"truth about Santa\\"... Since my son is only 5, unlike most of Judy Blume's intended readers, he still believes in Santa. I've never written an Amazon review before, but I thought I should point this out in case someone else is thinking of getting this book for his/her early reader. If this does not concern you, then I highly recommend this book: I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"There's no question that Judy Blume is one of the most celebrated children's authors of all time. But when it comes to the book Superfudge, there IS the question of whether or not it's fair of Blume to dismantle one of the most memorable childhood traditions in a book targeted to young children (\\"ages 7 and up\\" on the back jacket).As a parent of four kids under 8 years old, I can't help feeling somewhat betrayed by an author - even one as beloved as Blume - who would take it upon him or herself to completely cut down the Santa myth without any hint of subtlety or margin of error. For a children's author, this is a very severe stance to take and one that is most certainly intentional. In all my years of teaching and reading children's books, I have come across only one other author who took the same divisive position (Judy Delton's \\"A Pee Wee Scout Christmas\\") and the reason there are so few is this: most children's authors respect the wide diversity in the ages, circumstances, and beliefs of their young audiences. Even in books targeted to much older children, authors still take care to discuss topics like Santa in very \\"cloudy\\" terms (Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is a good example) and that cloudiness is an act of simple courtesy, not only for young kids who are reading books at a higher reading level, but also for parents who trust that children's authors will treat ANY bordeline age issue with some level of subtlety.Realistic parents would never expect children's authors to avoid controversial subjects altogether, just as they would never expect to keep their children's belief in Santa alive forever. At the same time, it is unrealistic for parents to expect to avoid specific children's books since so many are readily available in school libraries and classrooms, and that's why there exists an unoffical trust between children's authors & parents that hot topics will be \\"handled with care\\". While some reviewers feel that Blume is to be commended for her direct honesty regarding Santa, I feel that her honesty could have afforded to be much gentler, especially considering the tender ages of many of her readers.But, with all of that said, the thing that confounds me most about this book is that Superfudge would have been just as awesome a story *without* the explicit Santa reveal. The book would have been no less edgy, no less funny, and no less appealing even if Blume had chosen to go with a far less definitive reveal scene, and sadly, I find myself questioning Blume's choice to take the harsher route with her youngest reader market."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"My daughter is in the first grade and is an excellent reader. She has literally inhaled this series of books. One of my daughter's favorite bedtime rituals is for her to read one chapter of the book to me each night. I was absolutely floored (and completely unprepared) for the revelation regarding the issue of Santa not being real along with the storyline of the main character having \\"busted\\" his parents one Christmas when he was three. My daughter is six and still firmly believes in Santa. I had to do some fast talking (and quick thinking). I think my daughter's OK but I'm absolutely traumatized!! We started reading this series upon the recommendation of her Kindergarten teacher after I expressed concern about the frequent use of slang in the Junie B. series. Junie B. is not looking so bad right now . . ."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"This is a very funny book. It's pretty good for those who are nervous about moving away from their friends. This book also introduces us to some new characters: Tamara Roxanne, their new baby sister, a.k.a. Tootsie, and no she isn't really like Fudge; Uncle Feather, Fudge's pet myna bird with his catchphrase, \\"Bonjour, stupid!\\"; Beverly, a tall beautiful woman, nicknamed \\"Giraffe Neck\\" by Peter, she eventually proposes to Frank Fargo in \\"Double Fudge.\\" Did I mention the divorce? In this, Jimmy Fargo's parents get divorced. But I think it was odd for Judy to have Frank go from an actor to an artist. We never found out much about his acting career (though Jimmy can do many foreign accents), but his painting career will make him famous in the later books. The divorce becomes a serious subject, too.Plus, I'd like to note about the \\"Santa\\" thing. I read this after I stopped believing in Santa, so it was understandable. If you're a teacher reading this to kids, I reccommend you skip over the fake Santa stuff. It would've been ruder if the whole chapter was just \\"THERE IS NO SANTA CLAUS\\" over and over again.Also, if you read this in the 80s and 90s, I'd like to warn ya something. There have been many updates to make this modernized for the 21st century, and there is a bit of new content added. In the original, the mother cannot eat peanut butter for she is allergic to nuts. In this updated version, the mom is allergic to tree nuts, but she can still eat peanut butter. In both versions, Peter quotes, \\"Without peanut butter, I might starve.\\" Plus, all references to records and phonographs are gone; they were replaced with CDs and tapes. Plus, in the original, Fudge says, \\"I watch 'The Muppet Show,' 'Sesame Street' and 'The Electric Company.'\\" In the updated one, Fudge says \\"I watch Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network.\\" (Currently Cartoon Network is a pretty lousy channel; they got rid of classic Scooby-Doo and now they air live action content!) But back to the main topic, Peter's Christmas list was changed, too. It originally listed that he wanted a clock radio, a pocket calculator (which his Grandma gives to him, rather than \\"Santa\\"), a stereo for his room, six albums and a remote-controlled model airplane. The modern version's Christmas list asks for a clock radio, a remote-controlled model airplane, a laptop computer, an MP3 player and six CDs. (Grandma's gift to Peter is a check.)This would be great for first-time readers who want to read this story, and I'm sure the old fans might be aggrivated or delighted at the new content."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"I was introduced to Judy Blume books by my 3rd grade teacher.

Another problem is when his parents said they were having a baby. Peter wasn't as upset as they thought he'd be, but got mad they didn't tell him at first.

In different parts of the book it made me stop and think what was going to happen next. One part in the book that i liked was on pgs.6-7 and it was that Peter wanted to run away because his parents were expecting a baby and didn't tell him. I would recommend this book because it will make children of young ages laugh and be entertained.This book will guarantee your children to laugh at Fudge and his funny ways. Fudge is a big pain to Peter, but when his parents tell him they're expecting a baby he gets angry because it might turn out like Fudge. Even more worse is that his parents are planning to move to New Jershey for a whole year. Do you think Peter can cope?After a while Peter gets used to the fact of Tootsie, but not really the fact that they're moving to New Jershey. He has to go to a new school, but he makes a new friend named Alex.

I love the scene where he returns from the school party and really has to go and....well, Fudge is in the way.It's a good story. Blume's characters are well--developed. The conflicts that do happen (Fudge in a commercial, for instance) are funny and not terrifying.

I have read the book Superfudge many times before, and time after time it makes me laugh. Reading about Peter and his relationship with Fudge, makes me think about how we both can relate in some stuff. Peter is a fifth grader and Fudge is a four year old little boy. Peter hates how Fudge is always getting in his way. He thinks that everything would have been better with out him. And when his parents give him the surprise that they are going to have another baby, Peter reacts quite in hatred against the baby and his parents. He decides to run away, but he knows there is no where to go. then later on when the baby is born he knows that he really loves his little siblings. Fudge, can pretty much ruin his live. Just like me, sometimes we just can't stand them, but then at the end we realize how much we really do care about them. I really enjoyed reading this book.How a small four year old can easily ruin a fifth graders life. Judy Blume doea a great job."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"Super Fudge by Judy BlumeThis is how the whole story began, when the whole family was eating dinner and mom started asking Peter if he would want another brother or sister. He answered he didn't want one because he already had two Fudges with his brother! This begins the story of Super Fudge a story about Peter Hatcher and his new baby sister. When it was time Peter's mom told him that she was going to have another Fudge and that they didn't know if it was a girl or a boy. When it was time for mom to have her baby, Peter felt like killing himself because he didn't want another Fudge. When everyone got the news that it was a little girl, everyone was happy but Peter was not. A couple months later Peter taped a dollar bill on her head so everyone knew that she was for sale for one dollar.In the book Super Fudge the characters are Peter, mom, dad, brother Fudge. Fudge is the annoying little brother who can't be quiet for five minutes. He's always asking his older brother Peter questions. Fudge is always getting into trouble. Peter is the oldest son who is more focussed on school and isn't quite into girls yet but, I'm sure he'd like to kill Fudge any minute now. Finally Tootsie is the new born baby who Fudge tries to sell by sticking a dollar bill on her head.This is a great book if you come from a family like mine where the little brother dominates the picture. Then you'll love it. There is never a dull moment with Fudge around. Judy Blume is such a great author that even older people can enjoy her books as well, and yes, Super Fudge is a page turner because it's just so funny. It wasn't hard to connect with the book at all because my brother acts the same way as Fudge did . I could connect to a character which was Peter because it seems like you get so frustrated with your younger siblings that you just want to strangle them at any minute. I enjoyed this book because it reminded me of my own life and I love Judy Blume's books anyway. Yeah there were surprises in the book for example when mom said she was going to have another baby. People who would enjoy it would be people who like funny and realistic fiction books. My whole family absolutely love her books. I don't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this book. Super Fudge by Judy BlumeThis is how the whole story began, when the whole family was eating dinner and mom started asking Peter if he would want another brother or sister. He answered he didn't want one because he already had two Fudges with his brother! This begins the story of Super Fudge a story about Peter Hatcher and his new baby sister. When it was time Peter's mom told him that she was going to have another Fudge and that they didn't know if it was a girl or a boy. When it was time for mom to have her baby, Peter felt like killing himself because he didn't want another Fudge. When everyone got the news that it was a little girl, everyone was happy but Peter was not. A couple months later Peter taped a dollar bill on her head so everyone knew that she was for sale for one dollar.In the book Super Fudge the characters are Peter, mom, dad, brother Fudge. Fudge is the annoying little brother who can't be quiet for five minutes. He's always asking his older brother Peter questions. Fudge is always getting into trouble. Peter is the oldest son who is more focussed on school and isn't quite into girls yet but, I'm sure he'd like to kill Fudge any minute now. Finally Tootsie is the new born baby who Fudge tries to sell by sticking a dollar bill on her head.This is a great book if you come from a family like mine where the little brother dominates the picture. Then you'll love it. There is never a dull moment with Fudge around.

Super Fudge is about two brothers named Peter and Fudge. Peter and Fudge are not good at hanging out with one another, but this is not the point of the story. The point of the story is that a new member of the family is arriving soon. Peter was not happy with the news he got really mad and went to his room and closed the door really hard. Fudge likes the idea he is happy that a new member is coming to the family. Its hard to make Peter understand the hole idea. It was almost dinner time and they still could not make Peter happy.

My third grader, who loved Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, brought this home from the school library. Luckily, he was reading out loud to me and my eyes skimmed ahead to the next paragraph on page 129 and I stopped him for the night. There is more about Santa I don't want him to read at the end of the chapter. It's a funny, good book, so of course he will want to finish it.

Because he's ruining Peter's life. Even if this book is called Superfudge, there is nothing so super about Fudge. Fudge is a kindergarten maniac. Uncle Feather (his pet myna bird) can say bonjour, but not in a very nice way.For most people who know him, there goal probably is to get rid of Fudge. As you might have guessed, there is no solution.In this funny book, the Hatcher's move to Princeton, NJ for the summer and find some unexpected surprise. I'm not going to tell you any, so you'll have to read the book and find out yourself.My favorite part is when Fudge went to the nurse's office because he cut his knee when he was riding his bike to school. When Mr. Green came in, he said that Brian Tubkin was coming to their school, and the nurse didn't know whom he was. Fudge complained that the nurse put peroxide on his cut and didn't blow on it to take away the sting. He also said she was dumb because she didn't know who Brian Tubkin was. She didn't blow on the cut because it would spread germs. And I don't know why she doesn't know who Brian Tubkin is.Everyone will love it from ages 1 day old -300.

In particular, what I liked about this book was that it showed a sibling rivalry and how it turns out. I related quite closely to the sibling rivalry chapters -- because I've got one of my own with my own little (sometimes annoying) little sibling. The other parts of the book that did not involve the sibling rivalry were not quite as interesting, or amusing. For example, very few other sections of the book were funny.

Blume shows how moving away from the town a boy loves can affect his life. This book was banned for several reasons, but primarily for immorality. I do not think this book should be banned because most children have no conception of the adult humor that caused the book to be banned. As a child, I could not comprehend the adult humor in this book. Judy Blume does a good job of sending out the right message for every person that reads this wonderful book.When I read this book as a third grader, I found it hilarious. Although I read a lot of Judy Blume's books as a child, I do not recall being savvy enough to understand the adult humor in them. After reading the book again as a college student, I could comprehend the adult humor that I missed as a child. I did not know that \\"My mother's the one who likes kissing. That's why she moved to Vermont\\" had anything to do with this child's mother having an affair (...). I did not even know what an affair was. I found this quote to be funny as an adult. Reading this book as a child, I learned morals and family values, and reading as an adult I had some good laughs because this book is not only for kids. Superfudge is a great book, and I would recommend it to anybody--adults as well as children."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"This book would make a great gift for an older child. &quot;Superfudge&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,&quot; another classic children's story.

Their mother is going to have a baby soon, adding more uncertainty to their lives. Will the baby be like Fudge? What could be worse for Peter?Kids, especially with younger brothers and sisters will relate to the problems Peter faces. The story moves quickly, keeping the reader's attention, and is filled with humor.

While some may not like the new book as much as the previous one, you must keep in mind that there were 8 years between the writings of Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing and Superfudge. Although the buyer should be aware that the new editions of the book have been updated to reflect changes in life and attitude. Fudge now watches Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon instead of the Muppet Show and Peter watches CDs and and an MP3 player for Christmas instead of records. I think books should be left alone, because that was their original form. However, on the other hand, with these changes, the books do flow between each other better. The updates aren't so much that book is changed, but at the same time it is nice to know, in case you want one edition and end up with another."},{"Title":"Superfudge","review":"In Super Fudge, Farley Drexel Hatcher (otherwise known as Fudge) tries to sell Tootsie the new baby but Fudge fails.

But now that I am older, and will have children of my own shortly -- I will not let them read it until I know they do not believe in Santa anymore.

Yes, it's a shock, but things like this happen in real life, and I commend Judy Blume for tackling it. For those that either gave a believing child a copy, or had the myth dashed on audiotape- I want to ask why wasn't the material reviewed? You wouldn't let your kids watch a movie unless you had screened it, would you? I find it highly suspect that people today expect everyone else to police things for them. Would you feed your kids a meal where you knew nothing about the ingredients? Would you let your kids play with others you didn't know?

It does however provide a solid base of what is shamanism as a spiritual practice outside of a religious frame. What is particular about this book is that it tackles this subject in a direction that as seldom been done before and to that the title holds true. What is presented in this book is presented from a woman's point of view, a Medecine woman's point of view. She explores the fundamentals of a medecine path, a shamanic path. From spirituality to the techniques, to the medecine wheel and the variety of spirits and helpers that can be met on the way. Is this an how to book? Not in my opinion, it gives the beginner an overview of the medecine path and tool to get started in the exploration of one's spirituality and to the more seasoned practicionner something to think about as the author as firm credentials. Is it only a book for women? Not necesseraly, although it can be a help in understanding the women mysteries and a woman's own inherant magic, it can also be an asset to male practitioners as it shows a different view of things and in the path to balance it can show a part of the mystery that men may be less in touch with."},{"Title":"A Medicine Woman Speaks","review":"Ok, yes, this book does describe certain Native American practices.

The work includes the roles of famous persons and the experiences of ordinary people in equal measure.Part 1: A Time To Mourn And A Time To Dance covers the UN decision in favour of partition, the Arab reaction, some background history - ancient Israel as well as the British Mandate period - and the various missions by both sides to procure arms.Part 2: A House Divided, deals with the beginning of hostilities and unrest in the city, the deteriorating situation on the Tel Aviv- Jerusalem road, various horrific bombings of certain landmark buildings, the intensifying struggle for the city and the different Arab forces involved in the war.Part 3: A City Besieged, concentrates on the harrowing struggle to hang on to the Jewish quarter of the old city from March 20 to May 13 of 1948. It includes an account of the tragic events at the village of Deir Yassin, the veracity of which is still in dispute today.Part 4: These Shall Stand describes the movements of the various Arab forces and the Jewish response. It provides details of the Arab Legion attack on the city, Jewish counterattacks, the battle of Latrun, the loss of the Jewish quarter in the old city, and the building of a new road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Finally Israel was established but it would only regain the old city in 1967.The Epilogue looks at the aftermath of the war of independence and takes stock of the terrible losses. The root of the refugee problem is explored and the author briefly deals with the transformation of the new Jewish State into a flourishing economic entity.There are extensive explanatory notes arranged by chapter, a vast bibliography of books, articles, pamphlets, periodicals, newspapers plus private documents and correspondence. The book concludes with an index.On the inside front and back covers and in the text itself are maps of Jerusalem and Israel, whilst the 40 pages of black and white plates encompass 60 photographs of people and places.Both sides suffered terribly in this war. The authors succeed in being objective as regards the struggle between Jew and Arab, but it is clear that they consider the Haganah as the sole legitimate force on the Jewish side and they are openly hostile to the Irgun.O Jerusalem is a riveting read on many levels. It holds the reader's attention by dealing with events from the perspective of a wide spectrum of individuals. The narrative is often very sad and sensitive readers should be aware that certain passages are quite disturbing. But this book is probably the very best history of the Rebirth of Israel and the part Jerusalem played in this momentous event."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Microeconomic Theory (Schaum's Outlines)","review":"Whether you need to use this to get through ECON 300 or a more advanced econ class this is a very useful how-to guide. There is little discussion of theory and no yakking -- just straightforward microeconomic problems and parables. Use it for review or to get you through your final exam. Very helpful and much clearer than your textbook."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Microeconomic Theory (Schaum's Outlines)","review":"This book is an intermediate microeconomics book intended primarily for undergraduate, upper division students. However, those not attending college can also benefit from this book by using it for independent study or reference material. There are no major prerequisites other than some knowledge of basic economics. For those who have a calculus background, the author does include one to three solved problems at the end of the majority of the chapters which are clearly marked.Of the 14 chapters that make up this book, one is an added chapter and three are optional chapters. The added chapter introduces such topics as the Lerner and Herfindahl indexes which deal with measuring monopoly power, peak-load and cost-plus pricing, and game theory. Some of the concepts presented in the three optional chapters are: the Hicksian and Slutsky substitution effects of a price change, deriving indifference curves from inferred consumers' preferences, price index numbers, utility theory under uncertainity, the Cobb-Douglas production function, linear programming, and general equilibrium and welfare economics.A weakness of this book concerns how some of the concepts are presented. In other words, the author introduces some new ideas at the end of some of the chapters in the \\"problems\\" section rather than in the main text. However, overall, I think this book provides valuable information that can benefit many people, even those who have a minimal economics background. The author presents a reasonably clear explanation of the subject matter covered which includes providing a glossary at the end of each chapter."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Microeconomic Theory (Schaum's Outlines)","review":"As stated I have 30+ Schaum's Outlines and have used them since being a college student in the '70s. Though some Schaum's are better than the others, I have never been disappointed elative to the small prices charged. It is great to have so many problems to workout and check your answers."},{"Title":"Praying with Body and Soul","review":"Jane E. Vennard, a gifted teacher and retreat leader, offers a practical guide to many forms of prayer. Drawing on her own journey and the richness of religious traditions, she is grounded in her own experience as a Christian and open to the diverse experiences of others.Out of that journey she notes \\"My prayer now includes silence and stillness, movement and imagination, sensuality and sexuality, laughter and play, work, service, and the struggle for justice.\\" The book is organized as an exploration of these themes.For her \\"prayer has become . . . the practice of bringing all of who I have been, all of who I am, and all of who I am becoming into relationship with God. When I bring all of myself to God, I am praying with body and soul.\\"Vennard is careful to define how she uses terms like 'spirituality' and 'prayer\\". Much of her writing is in the form of stories and reflections from persons she has interviewed. The book includes a Group Study Guide and each chapter concludes with activities for reflection and discussion.This is a book that is helpful for individuals and for use in groups. Our congregation has been led by Vennard in retreats and through her books and find her leadership outstanding."},{"Title":"Praying with Body and Soul","review":"I'm beginning to share dance with my congregation by leading (college) students in movement worship sessions- each week, I'm finding great activities and resources to add to our meetings! This book is set up to work as a group guide, but can also be great pieced together in a different order, or for personal study. It's got lots of great ideas, and addresses many related topics that enrich the movement-worship experience. Suitable for beginners or those who are already comfortable with moving for God :) Playful and very smart."},{"Title":"Praying with Body and Soul","review":"I tried to like this book but failed miserably - the last straw was the apparent equation of Buddhist meditation techniques to Christian prayer. As Buddhism is agnostic while Christianity believes in a personal God with whom one enters into a personal relationship. I can cite the influence of Nestorian Christianity on Chan Buddhism or the influence of monotheist Islam on Tibetan Buddhism and I still can't make the leap the author does.The overemphasis, from my perspective, of the individual prayer and minimized reference to corporate prayer also clashes with my view of Christians composing the Body of Christ.On the positive side, some of her examples drawn from her role as spiritual director and her interest in playful prayer speaks of a woman of spiritual depth. This volume make speak to you in a way it fails to speak to me."},{"Title":"The Wiccan's Dictionary Of Prophecy And Omens","review":"This is the first book I have purchased by this author, and probably the last. I was let down with the contents of the book. I expected something totally different than what I opened the book to read. I found the book was full of the different types of divination with little explanation about what it was. Many of the different kinds were not even explained in any manner other than a short description that was average... I expected this book to be at least a little above average after reading the description and seeing a few people recommend the book. The explanations were too brief."},{"Title":"The Wiccan's Dictionary Of Prophecy And Omens","review":"I love this book,no it doesnt teach how to do every divination practice in the world.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Medieval Agriculture and Islamic Science: The Almanac of a Yemeni Sultan (Publications on the Near East, University of Washington)","review":"I read this in a university library and found it so engrossing and useful that I needed a copy of my own. An almanac initally sounds very dull, but Varisco's extensive commentary provides so many details on so many subjects, its simply amazing. It's not simply about science or even agriculture, it also contains a great deal of anthropolgical data that you don't find in other similar works. All too frequently, books dealing with the past dwell on the history, rather than the reality of the time. This work really captures the feel of the time period with its lavish details and research. Much of it could really qualify as trivia, but that's really what makes it such a wonderful piece of work, as it isn't just concerned with the big issues of the time, but with what every man knew. If you're at all interested in what the period was like, beyond simple history, this is a great book. It's largely concerned with things related to agriculture as it's a very protracted translation and explanation of an almanac, so covers crops, the weather (a topic everyone's always discussed, past or present), health, astronomy, sex, the environmental, and many things in between. This presents a real portrait of the time period beyond what the title implies. This is a very thorough yet wide ranging work. It's very light on religion, but there's scores of books on medieval Islam, so this is not a great flaw. This is not quite like any other book you'll find on the period and thus why it is so great."},{"Title":"Guide to Fly Fishing Knots: A Basic Streamside Guide for Fly Fishing Knots, Tippets, and Leader Formulas","review":"This is a handy booklet to keep in your flyfishing equipment.

Created in 1957, this one remains as original now as it was when written. Set in a time where mankind has expanded out into space but split into several distinct and mutually antagonistic societies, it is those social forces that provide the uniqueness of the story. Earthman Elijah Baley, a plainclothes detective with a sterling record, is called upon to travel off-planet to Solaria, a planet where the inhabitants abhor physical contact with other humans and where a murder has been committed. Baley is also paired with a robot, Daneel Olivaw, who passes for a human and has come from a third planet Aurora. Baley's instructions are to solve the murder and gather any information that he can about the Solarians, so that the leaders of Earth can better judge the threat that they pose.I found the murder investigation to be of secondary interest to the social mores of the two societies. Asimov creates two societies with diametrically opposite social customs and Baley is forced to deal with his own fears as well as the rigid exclusiveness of the Solarians. That interplay and how human nature manages to still be present is what makes the story so entertaining. Even though the culprits and their motives for the murder are very standard fare, the backdrop is so interesting that I did not mind that well-worn portion of the plot.This is an excellent murder mystery with a setting of social structures that provide the real story and is how a science fiction mystery should be constructed. The mystery itself is largely a backdrop to the science fiction components."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Elijah Baley solves another case with his logical yet unreasonable partner, R Daneel Olivaw. This time it is not within the steel caves of New York City, but in the open plains of the sparsely populated Solaria. A world that has reached the epitome of technological paradise.Though, the book is not necessarily well written as a detective piece. The murderer is somewhat obvious, and the investigation can at times be dull. What is interesting is this new world Asimov created. A world so wrapped up with the companionship of their advanced robots, that people shudder at the thought of seeing another person in the flesh. Some people will faint at the sight. Some people will stay a good twenty feet away from a man. Some people will do worse. They are enslaved to the robots for their livelihood, their protection, and they are even mothered by the robots after birth.It turns out that Earth is exactly the same in many ways. But instead of being isolated from individuals, Earth is isolated by other cities, other planets, other ventures. Baley can barely last five minutes in the Solarian sun without fainting himself. Whereas Solaria's wealthy estates ran only by robots cause people to fear anyone one person, Earth's primitively walled in cities cause people to fear manifest destiny.PS: There was a certian individual who claimed that the nudity exhibited in this novel should have been cesnored. I am in complete disagreement in the first case because I do not believe in censorship. Despite this, I do not believe that there is anything in this book to censor. The only line that makes desciption of the female form is as followed, \\"Gladia looked down at her nudity in surprise and said, 'Well of course'\\" (61). Not a single word is used to illustrate a nude body other than the word \\"nudity\\" itself. Everything is left to the imagination and is very tasteful. I would say the taboo of nudity in this novel, though it is not portrayed in explicit detail, is what makes this book intriguing as oppose to revolting."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Asimov wrote The Naked Sun in 1956 and as others have pointed out here, it is a sequel but a completely independent story from his previous novel, Caves of Steel. For me, one of the most compelling things about this novel was how prescient Asimov was about how communication technology and technology in general, could isolate society. There is a passage in which the hero, Elijah Baley, interviews a woman who is a murder suspect on the distant \\"Spacer\\" planet. He is interviewing her by trimensional viewer - the equivalent of what we would consider a high quality, 3-dimensional webcam projection. Interestingly, she has no qualms about nudity being viewed in this way. Yet, like most of the \\"Spacers\\" and particularly those of Solaria, she is strongly abhorrent to actual physical contact and would, of course, never appear in a state of undress in the actual presence of a man like Baley. In her own words, the fact that Baley is \\"viewing her\\" over the projection and not \\"seeing\\" her in actual proximity makes \\"all the difference there is.\\" Asimov's thesis here is that having robots to do all the manual labor and having the ability to communicate remotely with so much intimacy that it rivals being in the same room, people are now so remote from one another physically that it takes tremendous effort for them to be in the same house with someone, let alone the same room. You can see some parallels with how people today communicate with chat, e-mail and webcams across vast distances with a degree of intimacy and familiarity that would not have been possible until recently. Long-distance relationships can actually be quite intimate, even sexual, due to the improvements in communications technology. Asimov was visualizing the future of what we are now experiencing some 50 years ago. I re-read this book now and then with amazement at how well he understood the impact our technology was going to have on our social and political futures."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"A policeman from Earth, where the population all lives underground in close quarters, is called in to investigate a murder on a distant world. This world is populated by very few humans, rarely if ever, coming into physical proximity of each other. Instead the people \\"View\\" each other with holographic images. The mystery is, \\"How does a murder occur in a world where people can't stand to be in the presence of one another and robots can do no harm?\\" (Remember this is an Asimov book with his rules for robots firmly in place.) Asimov's variation on the \\"locked door\\" mystery is intriguing and adds in a sociological element that creates an interesting interpretation of what the future may hold in the relationship between man and machine is not carefully balanced. While the dated references that all older SF novels suffer from are to be found throughout the novel, this one does work as a good mystery. Even as the killer is exposed, you will be gratified to know that Asimov does not leave any loose threads by the time the book is finished."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Isaac Asimov returned to his &quot;Robot&quot; tales for &quot;The Naked Sun,&quot; a taut murder mystery wrapped in a heavy sci-fi cloak. If anything, &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is more imaginative and tightly-written than the previous novel, &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with its unconventional detecting and seemingly unsolvable crime.Cop Elijah Baley isn't too fond of robots. Or Spacers. So he's less than pleased when he is sent to Solaria, a sparsely populated world where robots do all the work, and humans &quot;toil not, neither do they spin.&quot; He's there to investigate a strange murder -- a scientist named Delmarre was murdered, and his widow Gladia is the only possible suspect. But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after &quot;Naked Sun,&quot; where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world &quot;children&quot; is almost obscene.Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.Asimov's &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is a tighter, tauter mystery than &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out. Immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"THE CAVES OF STEEL was, in my humble opinion, an all-time science fiction classic. THE NAKED SUN is the direct sequel and is extremely satisfying, thought be many to be better than the original. Personally, I feel it failed a bit, especially as a mystery. This is still superlative science-fiction writing.This time, Elijah needs to travel to another world, a traumatic challenge to one who's never been outside Earth's \\"caves of steel\\". He is venturesome enough though to want to actually experience the open air and \\"naked sun\\" of another planet and this causes some conflict with android partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who following the three laws of robots needs to protect the detective from harm.Again, the mystery part of the story owes to the classic \\"locked room mystery\\" subgenre in that the murder is one which appears to be an \\"impossible\\" one. Since the murder occured, though, there is only one apparant person who could possibly have committed it.The Solarians have through their history and their reliance on robots developed a physical aversion to each other, husbands and wives being the only ones who tolerate contact with each other, and Solarian science is working to develop artificial insemination so that even that contact will no longer be necessary.As the detective conducts his investigation, he becomes more involved with his belief that Earth must participate in colonization of other habitable worlds, and so this novel while telling its own story also develops the thread that eventually leads to the author's Empire and Foundation series. I am not sure whether or not Isaac Asimov, at the time that he wrote this novel, had any idea of developing R. Daneel Olivaw into such a pivotal factor as he eventually becomes, but it seems to me that there are slight hints here of the robot's leaning more on his reasoning ability, in spite of the fact that robots are not supposed to have any reasoning ability.Again, after reading this book, I believe one will very much want to continue into Asimov's future history."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"It may be a flight of fancy, but it seems that you can see Asimov as a scientist when you read his novels. Unlike other speculative writers, there is a clear sense of details that ring true to the present day. For instance, the trouble with getting robots to respond to a question reminds me of some of the more comical experiments with intelligent agents.Although the allegorical nature of the Solarians gives the book a somewhat dated feel, it still has that Asimov magic-- combining study of human nature with speculative fiction. A first class author, as always."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Yet again, Asimov proves that he is indeed THE Science Fiction mastermind. &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; sends detective Elijah Baley into his most challenging case yet. He must lead a successful offworld investigation against impossible odds, which leaves you intrigued every step of the way. The bold R. Daneel, and the sexy Gladia Delmarre add more spice to Lije's ordeal. A true MUST read to all sci-fi fans out there!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Asimov writes a enjoyable blend of science-fiction and mystery. The pace is leisurely, and the novel might seem almost simplistic by today's sci-fi standards. Once you consider that it was published in 1957, the novel takes on an added dimension (and explains some anachronisms like the frequently exclaimed &quot;Jehosaphat&quot;). You can see Asimov's very creative mind at work (the crime itself could only be accomplished through science-fiction) and how shows like &quot;Star Trek&quot; borrow liberally from his work. Be forewarned that Asimov likes to ponder science-fiction concepts a few pages here and there."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"There will always be a soft spot in my heart for Asimov's I ROBOT short story collection and his THE REST OF THE ROBOTS short story collection. But this is my favorite Asimov novel; it is also one of my all-time favorite detective novels, SF or non-SF. It is sort of a sequel to an earlier novel of his: The Caves of Steel. But I like this one a lot better. You don't need to read them both, or read them in order; but it is true that the two novels enrich each other in defining a future allegorical world view, and in highlighting the relationship between the two detectives.If you are one of those people who absolutely must read things in order, I would start with the Positronic Robot short story collections, then take on the novels in order, finishing with the final short story: I ROBOT; THE REST OF THE ROBOTS; THE CAVES OF STEEL; THE NAKED SUN; THE ROBOTS OF DAWN; MIRROR IMAGE. I have not read Mirror Image. I consider The Robots of Dawn the weakest novel in the series. I think Asimov got bored with the series toward the end (while writing Robots of Dawn?) and went on to other projects. When fans wanted more, all he could deliver was a final short story.A human detective: Elijah. His partner Daneel is a robot so perfectly humanoid that other humans, and other robots, think it is human.What keeps me coming back to re-read The Naked Sun is the strongly allegorical presentation, the \\"male bonding\\" between the human detective and the robot detective, the robots (yes, I'm a robot freak), and the awesome detective \\"who-done-it\\" at the center of it all. The detective aspects are not as lyrical as Raymond Chandler nor as breezy as Robert B. Parker, but they are vintage Asimov at the absolute top of his game.In this series Asimov takes neurotic mental quirks, pushes them to their logical extremes, and elegantly builds a future out of them. Elijah has lived his entire life enclosed in tiny habitation boxes of overcrowded Earth; a mob of people pressing in upon him is comforting, while a free open space cripples him with terror. On Solaria, where the detectives go to solve a murder, humans rarely come into actual physical contact; almost all human intercourse is done by \\"viewing\\" which is so \\"lifelike\\" that Elijah at first mistakes it for actually being with another person. On Solaria, with each human residing on a separate estate cared for by an army of robots, the idea of actually being in physical proximity with another person is disgusting.The copyright on this puppy is 1956. Nature versus Nurture. In this future Asimov pushes the limits of Nurture: the people in these novels are the product of their environment. Powerful Spacers versus powerless Earthers. This was state-of-the-art Science Fiction in the Fifties, and it still kicks ass and takes names in 2012. I almost wish another writer would take on this future with a few more \\"authorized\\" sequels. If someone paid me to write one, the moment I came up with a default-plot I would jump in, full-tilt boogie! @hg47Oops!P.S. - that would be Postscript.P.R. - that would be Post Review.On GoodReads I just learned about a 4th novel in this series I was not aware of: Robots and Empire. Asimov's fans demanded, and the dude did deliver. My mistake. @hg47"},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"A lot of people don't realize that as famous as Isaac Asimov was as a science fiction writer, he took great pride in writing mysteries, often of short story length. He has several volumes of fascinating short story mysteries.Here, we get a full length mystery, once again staffed by the interesting and entertaining investigative duo of Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw, his humaniform robot partner. This time, the murder occurs away from Earth on a \\"Spacer world\\". This particular Spacer world is extreme in that the residents have a phobia for human contact, which provides an odd sort of balance for Bailey's phobia of the great outdoors. The murder is a classic locked door mystery, and the solution is impossible on its face.Since Elijah had so recently solved a Spacer's murder on Earth, and since there are no such investigative skills in a society where murder is unheard of, the Spacers request Elijah as the man to solve this one. Asimov provides us with an interesting look at a society that has gone in completely the opposite direction of his over-crowded Earth cities ... a world where robots do virtually everything for the human residents, while on Earth any robots outside of routine automation are looked upon with threat and suspicion.Asimov took great pride in the internal logic of his mysteries, and this is a good example. \\"The Naked Sun\\" is an entertaining read for fans of both science fiction and mysteries. Although it is not absolutely necessary, I would recommend that you have read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" before tackling this book."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The Naked Sun is a sequel to The Caves of Steel featuring Elijah Bailey and his robot partner R. Daneel Olivaw.A murder has taken place on the planet Solaria and it's up to Elijah and Daneel to solve it. However, Solaria is not like Earth. In the future the major cities on Earth are covered by huge metal domes and Earth is greatly over-populated. Humans don't look too kindly at robots. Most humans, including Elijah, are agoraphobic (fear open spaces). On Solaria the human population is very small, everyone lives on massive estates and there are thousands of robots for each human. Humans are bred to fear direct human contact so in order to 'view' each other they use complex holographic technology. Robots cater to every human need. This is pretty much Hell for somebody like Elijah but alas he is called into action.I actually liked the plotting in The Naked Sun a bit more than The Caves of Steel. Because the people on Soliaria are the polar opposite of the people on Earth some interesting situations arise. For example, Earth humans are looked at as dirty animals and the thought of even being in the same room as an Earthman is sickening to a Solarian. Elijah, who craves direct human interaction, is forced to live by himself in a massive estate and he quickly becomes fed up with all of the robots trying to cater to every need of his. Elijah also does some 'growing up' in this novel.One of my minor complaints with Caves of Steel is that some plot elements are a bit too convenient, only to keep the mystery alive. There is still a little bit of that in the Naked Sun, but to a lesser degree.I strongly recommend this book, but read Caves of Steel first if you haven't already."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Isaac Asimov returned to his \\"Robot\\" tales for \\"The Naked Sun,\\" a taut murder mystery wrapped in a heavy sci-fi cloak. If anything, \\"Naked Sun\\" is more imaginative and tightly-written than the previous novel, \\"Caves of Steel,\\" with its unconventional detecting and seemingly unsolvable crime -- as well as a world that's as alien as any extraterrestrials could ever be.Cop Elijah Baley isn't too fond of robots. Or Spacers. So he's less than pleased when he is sent to Solaria, a sparsely populated world where robots do all the work, and humans \\"toil not, neither do they spin.\\" He's there to investigate a strange murder -- a scientist named Delmarre was murdered, and his widow Gladia is the only possible suspect. But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after \\"Naked Sun,\\" where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world \\"children\\" is almost obscene.Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.Asimov's \\"Naked Sun\\" is a tighter, tauter mystery than \\"Caves of Steel,\\" with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out. Immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I absolutely love this book. The mystery was a good one, but the moral of the story was far bigger then the story itself. I have read the foundation series and I love the way this book tied into the foundation series (specially to the last foundation book) I have ready many a mythological, fantasy books and Asimov has to be one of the great minds of all time.Love the message of the book."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I first read \\"The Naked Sun\\", by Isaac Asimov, in 1963, as a teenager.

Despite this it is well written story and full of imagination. A very easy read."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"A couple of admissions first - This is my first review. This was the first Asimov book I've read. I enjoy older (50's/60's) science fiction - no profanity, good character development, fairly predictable, but with interesting ideas and ways of looking at human life.That said, I picked up The Naked Sun at a used bookstore not knowing that it was part of a series. I read a couple reviews that complained that the first 50 pages were used to get the new reader up to speed and decided I'd take the risk and read it anyway. I am so glad that I did. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a day and a half of intermittent reading. It's basically a classic 1950s style crime novel. Yes, it was a little predictable, but so what. I really enjoyed the interplay of the characters and way Asimov made the idiosyncrasies of the Solarians equal those of the earthmen.Not groundbreaking, but a fantastic quick read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"\\"The Naked Sun\\" takes detective Elijah Baley to the outer settlements of the spacers to solve a mystery.Once again, robot R.

Baley is not comfortable, he would rather be back in his city's steel caves. Meanwhile, we learn much more of the problems of the spacers.But, Baley produces an interesting solution to the mystery.I enjoyed reading this book. However, it is a little bit too light a vehicle and does not get far enough into the spacer's problems or how Baley fits into that arena of the overall plot.Try it.

He is of the old \\"hard sci-fi\\" school that populated the \`50s and a successful member of that community by the way.This story is the second step in the long friendship between the earthling New York detective Elijah Baley and the robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw. You don't need to read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" to understand this one, it is almost a stand alone book.Situated in a far future Earth, Humankind has divided into Spacers who dwell scattered in fifty worlds (and are the rich & advanced society) and Earthlings that remain in the Mother World, inhabiting overcrowded underground cities. Both groups distrust and despise each other.A murder occurred in Solaria an Outer World. Elijah is put in charge of the investigation due to his success in the previous investigation.Once again he will team with R.

From that fact derives the title of the novel as the Naked Sun is almost unbearable to stand for him.The Solarians avoid direct contact with other humans.

Nevertheless when committed is yet more difficult to solve. Well that is the task of our heroes!On this background Asimov, once again, construct a many layered novel.

Can you put it down once you stop? No. Would you be inclined to do so? Not likely. Having written hundreds of books, Asimov had honed his craft down to a tee. There are no lengthy expositions, superfluous descriptions, esoteric metaphors, similes, or other unnecessary literary devices in an Asimov book; simply, there are characters, plot, world-building, and ideas, lots of ideas. If you've read, The Caves of Steel, or any other fiction by Asimov, and liked it, your sure to enjoy this book. as the second book in a trilogy, it felt slightly weaker than Caves, but held its own. Plainclothesman Elijah Baley develops in this book far more than in the previous installment. one thing this tale lacks that the first one had is a sense of urgency and/or danger. Asimov seems to have dialed down the action a bit well cranking up the mystery. But hey - what, exactly, is wrong with that?"},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The Naked Sun by, Isaac Asimov, is a direct sequel toCaves of Steel (Robot City). Once again we see detective Elijah Baley called upon to solve a murder involving a \\"Spacer\\" (a human from an Earth colony on another planet) only this time he has to leave Earth to perform the investigation. He is reunited with his robotic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw although the relationship seems a bit more contentious this time around. The two meet on the planet Solaria where a leading citizen has been murdered with a good old-fashioned blunt instrument. Baley must overcome his fear of open spaces, resistance from the locals to meeting face-to-face, and the seeming impossibility of satisfying all the facts of the case before he can shed light on the mystery.More than just a mystery, Naked Sun is also a social commentary of sorts. I can't say I found this aspect of the novel nearly as compelling as the mystery. Without giving too much away, the people of Solaria live in nearly complete isolation and loathe being in the personal presence of anyone, including a spouse or their own child. While this is plausible in a purely academic way given the scenario that Asimov put it place, it ignores many basic human instincts such as sex drive that are incredibly powerful and highly unlikely to be sublimated so completely. Still, as long you take it with a grain of salt, it is still interesting to read about this other culture.The murder mystery in the book was very well done for the most part. It moves along well, introduces a number of interesting characters, and is suitably puzzling to both Baley and the reader as it unfolds. The ending wasn't quite as tidy as it could have been but I'll say no more about that for fear of spoiling the story for new readers.The Naked Sun is not a perfect novel. The ending was just a bit off and the sociology is more than questionable. But these are quibbles, not crippling flaws. I would certainly recommend this book, though you should read Caves of Steel (and possibly I, Robot) first. If you've read Caves of Steel, and enjoyed it, odds are you'll find a lot to like in this sequel."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The Naked Sun is a great sequel to Asimov's Caves of Steel. There, we were introduced to Elijah and Daneel as well as the Earth in the 3rd millenium, with its industrialisation, soullessness, pathological confinement in enclosed spaces and a dictatorial intrusion of the bureaucratic machine into every aspect of life imaginable.In this book, a murder occurs in a Spacer world and Elijah is specifically requested for. The murder, they say, is a logical imposibility, as it could only have been done by one person and even that person could not possibly have done it. Reluctantly, Elijah travels to the world of Solaria, where the murder occured and, reunited with Daneel, attempts to solve it in his already well-known style.Considering the contempt of Spaces for all earthlings, his visit to the outer world of Solaria is unprecedented and he has no idea to expect from a culture which diverged from earth's 300 years ago. The result is staggering - a huge planet with only 20,000 inhabitants and several thousand robots per person means unprecedented luxury. Everyone has huge estates, isolated from everyone and life is automated and mechanised to the nth degree. This reflects in the social aspect of life, where *seeing* a person (in the flesh) has become a social taboo, to be avoided as much as humanly possible. Instead, social contact is done through the impersonal, though extremely sophisticated machinery and is called *viewing*. Even a husband and wife (allocated roles in Solaria) rarely see each other, most of the contact done by viewing.And so, without giving away the details of the mystery, Bailey is essentially faced with a thematic connundrum. On the one hand, the Solarians don't have the almost psychotic fear of open spaces and nature that Bailey and other earthlings possess due to existing all their lives in boxes within boxes. But Solarians have lost the other essential aspect of humanity, as Bailey sees what a pathetically isolated, lolly-pop world Solaria is, where most of what we consider meaningful (real interactions, children, family) are either taboo or nonexistent.The book represents a step up from the Caves of Steel which outlined the way people live on earth. For the first time, we can see Asimov's robot-filled universe and the consequences on technology. On Earth, the crowding has ensured that social contact has remained but people have lost their communion with nature and the universe itself. On Solaria, the reverse is true, with plenty of sun and open spaces but no humanity. I really enjoyed this whole take on the world (especially as Bailey learns to see his fear of open spaces for what it is - an arbitrary, unnecessary hinderance).The only problem is that Asimov hammers this thematic point with the subtlety of a Britney Spears outfit. Still, it's interesting. The mystery itself is what has been criticised in otehr reviews and I don't consider it as satisfactory/&quot;perfect&quot; as Caves of Steel, but it's relatively interesting and it just shows that the action was a vehicle towards what Asimov really wanted to say.So, overall, a great book despite its flaws as it'll actually make you think about the values of our society and the direction we *might* be going - unlike many other sci-fi works (including some by Asimov), this one's both entertaining *and* meaningful."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Anyone who has read Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction masterpiece The Caves of Steel was undoubtedly clamoring for a sequel at the end of the book. The Naked Sun (Asimov would go on to write two more sequels) fulfills the task sufficiently. Although I think that, on the whole, the plot and murder mystery in this book - with less plot twists and turns, false leads, and dead ends - is not as interesting as the one in The Caves of Steel was, it is still thoroughly enjoyable, nonetheless. Granted, the concept of the murder mystery is one of the oldest scenarios in all literature - and was perfected by Conan Doyle, at that - and is, thus, rarely fresh or inventive - indeed, is usually quite stale. This is the real strength of The Naked Sun. This has what is, as far as one could conceivably allow in a murder mystery, a totally original plot. It is strange and intriguing in that the protagonist - and, indeed, the reader - knows nothing, absolutely NOTHING, about the murder. Detectives invariably start out with few clues, but in this he has absolutely none. Another interesting aspect of the book - and the highlight of it, for me - is the world, Solaria, and its inhabitants that Asimov herein describes. They have a truly different and remarkable way of life than that which we may find customary, and Asimov manages to make it believable and highly interesting. These factors combine to make the book interesting and fun to read. It is written in the style of its prequel: fast-paced, exciting, and hard to put down. This is certainly worth reading, if you liked the first one, and I highly reccommend it. For all of this praise, however, I do not find this book to be, on the whole, as good as The Caves of Steel. The Naked Sun, while being an extremely entertaining and fulfilling adventure romp, fails to convey the profundity of the original - indeed, this may stem from the fact that Asimov wrote this book out of incessant demand for a sequel (both from his publisher and his fans) instead of having it arise from pure inspiration. Alas, this is a highly entertaining book that I heartily reccommend to fans of the aforementioned masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"This was my first Asimov book. I thought it was very well written. I wasn't sure what to expect going in because I have heard so much about Isaac Asimov. Naked Sun was very entertaining. I must admit that I was sucked into the whodunnit of the book, however. I was intrigued also by the difference in cultures between the eartman and the spacers. It was interesting to see how they reacted to each other. A book like this parallels todays world in which every city has someone who was not born there, who is a sort of outsider and must adjust to the norms of that society or not adhere and pave a path for him or herself. Naked Sun will definately make me read more of Asimov."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"This is the second novel in the Robot series and continues the adventures of Elijah Baley and Daneel Olivaw begun in The Caves of Steel. It's written in much the same style as the first book: engaging, fast-paced, and tough to put down.Baley attempts to solve a mystery on the Outer World of Solaria. Solarians run what many would consider a Utopian society; they live on massive estates in ease and comfort with tons of robots doing all the labor and necessary menial tasks. However, due to the extremely low human population, they never see each other and over the generations have even grown to shun physical human presence! Business is carried out by &quot;viewing&quot; each other through a projection medium. Asimov makes this unusual stigma quite believable and shows us several interesting facets of Solarian life.I just finished reading this last night! The plot is well developed, driven mainly by interviews and questioning. Not as much action as in The Caves of Steel, but there is one tense moment when an attempt is made on Baley's life. Daneel plays less of a role in this book than in the first one; Baley really does most of the work and makes the decisions.The initial solution to the murder mystery isn't as shocking as in the first book. But there's a surprising revelation at the very end! A good read with an obvious hint at a sequel. That's The Robots of Dawn, the next book on my list."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I read this book even before i read the other Robot detective books and i found this book fascinating! Baley's work in this book is quite great and i loved the story as well as the logic shown.

Another Spacer has been murdered, but not on Earth this time, on the newest colonized Spacer world, Solaria. Solaria is the antithesis of Earth, having a VERY lopsided robot to human ratio, while on Earth, robots are still despised and distrusted. Teaming again with R. Daneel Olivew, his investigative partner from Caves of Steel, Baley must deal with not only his own aversion to the vast robot presence, but the frequent travels through the outdoors, which his agoraphobic mind can scarcely tolerate. In addition is the nature of the Solarians, who have become so isolated from each other as to consider obscene the actual presence of humans. Meeting resistance constantly, from the Solarians and from his own partner, Baley begins to see that the Solarian way is just as bad as the Earth way, where the people are not isolated from each other, but from the galaxy. Eventually, after pursuing several wrong leads, Baley hits upon the truth, but it's not quite as one might expect.

You will enjoy it Trust me."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I already own this book, no chance I will pay almost as much for Kindle edition as I would have to pay for another paperback copy, it's all about GREED."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I recently read CAVES OF STEEL and after being seriously disappointed in it I had hopes that THE NAKED SUN would represent an improvement. In fact, it did represent a somewhat tighter story and the protagonist Elijah Baley acted a lot less stupidly than he had in the first novel, but all in all I found the book to be even less satisfactory than the first.The problems with this book are numerous. One of the more serious difficulties is that Asimov took what was the most interesting part of the CAVES OF STEEL -- the cooperation between Baley and his robot partner Daneel Olivaw and largely ignored it. Daneel plays a relatively minor role in the book, Baley, who is all in all a pretty dull bird, taking center stage. As in the first novel, Baley isn't much of a detective. His literary predecessors are not the Continental OP, Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, and Lew Archer, but Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. For some bizarre reason Asimov made the decision to follow the example of detective writers whose sleuths operated more by instinct and love to employ the technique of assembling all the key suspects before making his climatic announcement as to whodunit. As detective fiction, it is just horrible. Worst of all, Asimov violates one of the canons of such fiction: he withholds key facts, making it impossible for the reader to solve the crime ahead of time.In addition to failing in developing his characters and engaging in a literarily inferior form of detective fiction, Asimov's book is flawed by absolutely absurd assumptions about possible forms of human existence. Now, in fairness to Asimov, he wrote at a time when the insane theories of B. F. Skinner (who attempted to raise his own daughter in a box) still held current. So in fact Asimov might just be judged a victim of his time. But even before the publication of THE NAKED SUN Harry Harlow (in a series of rather monstrous experiments involving rhesus monkeys and \\"monster mothers\\") proved how profoundly primates yearned for human contact. Asimov imagines what is not merely a different form of human culture, but one that is impossible, since it cuts so deeply at what is most fundamental to human nature, namely that we are deeply social creatures for whom physical and social interaction is crucial. Asimov tries his best to make conceivable a world on which people avoid being physically present to other people, but it simply is too silly. Sure, we could suspend our disbelief, but only at the cost of suspending all critical interaction with the text.Added on top of all this is the fact that Asimov is simply not a very good writer. His prose is drab at best and in writing about characters he tends to default to extremely trite expressions. Someone says something to Baley and his reaction is to clinch his fists. It not only isn't very gifted writing, it reinforces a sense of superficiality running through the book.I've now in the past month read the first three novels I've ever read by Isaac Asimov. So far I'm baffled. I know that he is extremely famous and that he was a pioneer in many ways, but while I've found enormous pleasure in many early SF writers like Henry Kuttner, C. L. Moore, Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, Poul Anderson, Frederick Pohl, and a host of others, I honestly have found virtually nothing of value in Asimov's books. I'm not giving up yet. I'm currently trying to work through all the major books dealing with robots, cyborgs, and other forms of artificial people. I will next finish THE ROBOTS OF DAWN and ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, in addition to finishing the last couple of stories in I, ROBOT. Perhaps my opinion of Asimov will change. But I can state with some confidence that CAVES OF STEEL and THE NAKED SUN are simply not very good books."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Too shallow, stiff and hokey. No action. No emotion. Blah. The Solarians were too extreme to swallow."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"THE NAKED SUN is a witty little novel that is unmistakably a product of Isaac Asimov. Not just because of the ubiquitous robots, but because of the familiar themes that Asimov explored over the course of his decades-long career. On the surface, the novel is a science-fiction mystery story told in the author's usual enjoyable style. But by the time I reached the end of the book, I realized that Asimov had been doing something a little cleverer than his normal runaround, and upon reaching the conclusion, I immediately flipped back and started revisiting some of the earlier scenes to catch what I had missed the first time around.THE NAKED SUN starts up where THE CAVES OF STEEL left off, although you certainly do not need to have read the earlier book to enjoy this one. Earthman Detective Elijah Baley is once again teamed up with R. (for Robot) Daneel Olivaw to solve an unexplained murder. The gimmick this time is that the homicide occurred on one of the mysterious Outer Worlds, and Baley must not only act as policeman, but as an unofficial spy for an Earth government curious as to what the culture is like on those advanced, robot-dependent planets.The mystery is rather clever, although I did figure out what the murder weapon must have been before Baley did. As usual with Asimov's mysteries, I found myself enjoying the investigation more than the occasional plot logic that's thrown to the audience. In the case of this book, the storyline has some solid twists and turns, the only real flaw being that the cast of characters is so small that one could just pick a suspect at random to have a pretty good shot of correctly identifying the killer.The real star of this story is the universe that Asimov builds. The Earth is still the lagging, suspicious and enclosed world of THE CAVES OF STEEL, but now we turn our attention out to one of the colony worlds, Solaria. I could tell that Asimov was having a blast creating this society, giving us all kinds of details such as this planet's frosty relationship with Earth, its delicate relationship with other Outer Worlds, its population levels, its staggeringly high ratio of robots to people, etc. But he has even more fun giving birth to the inhabitants. He has them still as recognizable humans, but from an extremely skewed perspective. For most of the book, it's the story of these strange people and their odd customs that overpowers what is currently going on in the murder investigation. This definitely makes for an interesting read, as once we get to the end, we find that the detective portions were only secondary to the real point of the book.Often Asimov would insert little bits of social commentary into his fictions, with varying levels of success. And indeed, the summation at the end, where Baley lets the cat out of the bag and tells us what the novel has been exploring, is a little on the clumsy side. But the real triumph is how the author quietly and cunningly led us down the garden path to the end. When I opened the book to page one and found Elijah Baley nervously flying into a Washington, DC airport (by sheer coincidence I was making the same approach, albeit I started my journey in a different city than Baley had) and wishing to once again be safe indoors, I chucked to myself, recalling passages from Asimov's autobiography that discussed his legendary fear of flying and his mild claustrophilia. While reading all this stuff about people who hate flying, people who have an unnatural fear of face-to-face meetings, and people who yearn for enclosed spaces, I assumed that Asimov was doing nothing more than his usual shtick of inserting his own neuroses into his fictions (there's nothing wrong with this; it can make for very interesting reading, and it's something I particularly enjoy from Asimov). And with that assumption in place, I didn't pay much mind to what the author was actually setting up beneath the surface. So when the end of the novel rolled around and it was suddenly revealed what he had been up to this whole time, I was very pleasantly surprised.I like pulpy books that work on more than one level, and THE NAKED SUN gives us a very clever look at human fears while also providing an entertaining murder mystery. No, the characters aren't terribly deep, but the plot is a fun one and the extra bit of world building that Asimov engages in raises this book up. I like to read Asimov novels while traveling, because I find them to be a nice relaxing way to pass a few hours. Anytime the good doctor can provide me with something even better and smarter than his usual high standard of amusing, whimsical adventures, I'm a very happy camper indeed."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The Naked Sun is the second book in Asimov's robot series and probably my favorite but all are worth reading. This book continues the futuristic Sherlockian adventure of Elijah Bailey and his straight-man robot sidekick Daneel Olivaw. This time they journey to the planet of Solaria to solve a murder that has political implications across the galaxy.Asimov creates and socially interesting world in Solaria where people avoid human contact, live miles apart from each other and dependent upon robots to automate their society and keep their standard of living of high. Asimov deftly ties the intricacies of the Solarians into the mystery of the murder and ongoing multi book arc or robot progression. The whole thing is executed with Asimov's straightforward style and the character interaction and relationship between the two main characters is excellent as well.I highly recommend this series to any science fiction fan as this is really top shelf sci-fi writing from the best. The series should be read in order though and one should start with the I, Robot short story collection before proceeding to The Caves of Steel (which is the predecessor to this novel). Also this series is entirely appropriate for any one of at least high school age.Bottom Line: This series was revolutionary when it came out in the 50's. It's still one of the best ones out there."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The Naked Sun is the sequel to The Caves of Steel, and like that is a detective story set on the featuring robot-hating Plainclothesman Baley and, as if to prove Asimov really could predict the future, or movie-making of the '80s anyway, his entirely unsuited partner R Daneel Olivaw, a robot. Unlike CoS it's set on the (spacer) planet Solaria, a planet of few people and many, servile, robots.I was a little disappointed after reading CoS, and was expecting something of the sort here, but that didn't happen. CoS was set on an Earth which I found awkwardly described - you got the impression Asimov was trying to say things about the way people thought but couldn't quite get them out. No such problem with The Naked Sun, where Baley's future-Earth foibles are out in the open (figuratively and literally), and Asimov also successfully hints for the first time that a utopia made up of a world where everything is done for you and where people can live for hundreds of years may, possibly, be flawed, a thesis that becomes stronger in &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Robots and Empire.&quot;Asimov wrote that CoS was an attempt to answer a critic that it was impossible to combine the genres of science fiction with detective stories. The Naked Sun is much more than an answer to that challenge, it's one of Asimov's earliest studies of humanity, and it's a well written thoroughly readable one at that."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"This is the second book in the Baley-Daneel duo. And it's better than the first one, The Caves of Steel. The Science Fiction aspect is more creative--the Solarians are unlike any race I'm seen or read. The mystery is even tougher. Looking at the two books, The Naked Sun is almost the opposite of The Caves of Steel. The latter takes place in a confined Earth, with few robots. The former is on Solaria, a world with many robots and open spaces. Baley's reaction to the expierence rings true to his character--especially when dealing with the open spaces. To sum up, this is sequel will hook you and make you crave more. How fortunate there is a book called The Robots of Dawn!"},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"A thousand years earlier, mankind had split into two groups who now hated one another with a visceral prejudice born out of fear and a complete lack of cultural understanding of one another. Spacers, those who had seen their destiny in the stars, left earth with the assistance of positronic robot technology and colonized fifty worlds scattered throughout the galaxy. One world in particular, Solaria, was so thinly populated that the inhabitants had simply evolved away from the habit of personal contact. Birth was strictly controlled as a means of population replacement and achieved only through artificial insemination; child rearing was managed with the assistance of robots; communication, when it was deemed necessary at all, was via 3D holographic imagery; and personal contact of any kind, let alone sexual, was considered abhorrent. The taboo was so deep-seated it was capable of provoking nausea if the topic was frivolously mentioned.So when a leading scientist was bludgeoned to death, the citizens of Solaria were quite incapable of even imagining that anyone other than the scientist's spouse was guilty. But since it had also been determined that she had no weapon, the only possibility that remained was that he had been killed by his own robots, a possibility that, of course, was absolutely impossible because of the three laws of robotics that governed all human-robot interaction. Solaria had no choice but to ask for Earth's assistance in solving the problem. Only an Earth detective would have the intuitive understanding of interpersonal relationships and what would prompt someone (or perhaps a robot?) to violence and murder. And it was well known from his recent performance solving the murder in \\"The Caves of Steel\\" that Detective Elijah Baley was the only detective who could stomach prolonged contact with Spacers and Robots. So Elijah Baley was on his way to the scene of the crime on Solaria.What an incredible novel!Asimov outdoes Agatha Christie herself in concocting a compelling futuristic version of the impossible \\"locked room\\" mystery whose solution is based on an understanding of the profound differences of three imagined but superbly developed cultures - two human and one robot - all of which respond in profoundly different ways to the same stimulus. He takes a page from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brief and has his detective quote the famous aphorism about the solution, however improbable, being all that is left after one has eliminated the impossible. Asimov takes his obvious admiration of Doyle's work one step further allowing Baley to emulate Sherlock Holmes' personal vision of justice by indulging in a debate over the distinction between legal guilt and moral guilt and how the consequences for the two ought to be quite different. And, of course, in the tried and true fashion of cozy mystery detectives ever since the first cozy mystery was written, all is revealed in a showdown drawing room setting with the master confronting all of the possible culprits as he reveals his subtle chain of logic and the now obvious solution.But only a master of the sci-fi genre of the caliber of Isaac Asimov could turn what might have been a mere 200 page murder mystery into a deeply moving philosophical essay on his imaginings for the future and survival of humankind and even what it means to be human.Highly recommended indeed for all lovers of science fiction, classic or contemporary.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"While \\"The Caves of Steel\\" gets my vote as \\"The Best Asimov Book of All-Time\\", this one comes in a close second place. I sure would have liked for Asimov to expand a bit more on the world from \\"The Caves of Steel\\", but he does a great job here as well, in presenting the different culture found on the Spacer world... someone HAS to make a movie out of the Robot Murder books."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Like all of Asimov's best works, this novel is a tight exploration into how humans operate. He contrasts humans both with robots and with aliens in the work, and though humans have the lower hand here, he offers hope for the future. The book happens to be a well-crafted mystery as well, just as it happens to be science fiction. Good science fiction posits humans in exotic locales doing ultimately familiar things. The fear of Elijah Bailey is a bit odd, since it is of open spaces and sunlight, but we all fear things, and Asimov gets to the heart of what fear is and how it can--and in the humans' situation in the novel--must be overcome. It is an extremely satisfying book, as most mystery novels are not."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The late Isaac Asimov is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi writers. He was one of the old \\"hard sci-fi\\" school that populated the \`50s and a successful member of that community by the way.This story is the second step in the long friendship between the earthling New York detective Elijah Baley and the robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw. You don't need to read \\"The Caves of Steel\\" to understand this one, it is almost a stand alone book.Situated in a far future Earth, Humankind has divided into Spacers who dwell scattered in fifty worlds (and are the rich & advanced society) and Earthlings that remain in the Mother World, inhabiting overcrowded underground cities. Both groups distrust and despise each other.A murder occurred in Solaria an Outer World. Elijah is put in charge of the investigation due to his success in the previous investigation.Once again he will team with R. Daneel.Here different phobias interact conditioning the development of the events.Bailey is terrorized to be outside of he caves. From that fact derives the title of the novel as the Naked Sun is almost unbearable to stand for him.The Solarians avoid direct contact with other humans. They interact thru holographic system and are surrounded and served by robots that do not look like humans.Imagine in this context how a crime is possible. Well that is the task of our heroes.On this background Asimov, once again, construct a many layered novel. At one level is a classical detective's story at another one a study on alien cultures interacting. In yet another level is psychological approach to phobias.In a classical Asimovan way, each chapter introduces new elements and characters to the action until at last everything squares to a satisfactory ending.Both partners will continue their adventures and mystery solving in \\"Robots of Dawn\\". R. Daneel will resurface at the closing volumes of the \\"Foundation\\" saga.Enjoy one of Asimov's earlier works!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"The only reason I've rated this book only four stars is because some of Asimov's later books in the same series, written later in his career (e.g., Robots of Dawn) get even better. I found that there was a linear improvement in Asimov's writing through all of the robot novels.Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots and the continued urbanization of the Earth along with man's push into space.Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.This is the best place to start reading Asimov; however, you should begin by reading the first novel in the series, Caves of Steel. If you enjoy these two, you will absolutely love the sequels. After reading the Robots books, try the Foundation series, which starts slower but gets very good--and ultimately rewards readers of the Robot books by tieing it all together."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"\\"The Naked Sun\\" is the second in a magnificent continuation to an awesome science fiction series involving Elijah Baley and R.

With little choice, he embarks across space to face not only a foreign environment but also a robot-infested society. The robot intolerance Elijah is partnered with technological masterpiece Daneel to break the case before it is too late. Daneel continues to learn about human behavior from Elijah and is restricted in his behavior by what is known as the Law of Robotics. The story moves at a good tempo with an astonishing conclusion.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I read the Asimov's robot stories many years ago. (while I was in high school).

It is the excellence of book two that kept me in the series. The main characters Elijah and Daneel are great.

As they learn to maneuver Solaria, they uncover the alien culture and underlying social issues that drive one to murder.Although set in a very different future, Asimov again built a captivating story. More intriguing is his ability to develop these characters and make them believable. He not only does this, but creates an entire history and culture of another world. This world has far different social norms and laws than what we know.Asimov's ability to keep the reader's interest is excellent.

If you've already read the extended Foundation series, this book will give you some good background on Solaria and how the planet developed."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"Asimov is best when working with a fresh set of characters and I think that is what is so appealing with the Foundation series: The characters were constantly changing through the course of the books timeline. In Naked Sun we see the return of detective Bailey and his Robot sidekick and must endure 50 or so pages of getting the audience up to speed. Of course I hunger to learn more of the developments that occured in Caves of Steel, but obviously for those who have not read the book those character developments would reveal too much of the plot and ruin it for the new reader. Therefore we are left hanging on some plot threads as Bailey heads out to Solaris in search of another plot to solve.The second half of the book is quite appealing as Asimov makes great social commentary about America and its need for privacy and automation of life. I found myself engulfed in lives that appeared wonderful but at the same time quite strange and flawed.The book was completely engrossing until the very end where Asimov pulls out all the cliche's including the &quot;get everyone in the room to reveal the crime&quot; senario. Agatha Christie this is not, and too bad Asimov ended the book with that tired old senario. On top of that, suddenly everyone in that room is a bunch of quirky characters with the crime solved by Baily who appears extrodinarily competent as compared to the first book which made him far more human and fallible. On top of that Bailey acts as judge, jury and executioner and this is completely out of line for his character despite his newfound character development that Asimov weaves into this story to justify his ridiculous actions. Finally, the didactic speech at the end of the story from Baily was disappointing. I felt Asimov was just blowing off steam to end the book rather than finding his usual clever means of making social commentary.Caves of Steel was brilliant because of its social commentary and the fresh originality brought into the detective story. Naked sun feel stiff and a bit tired but it is still, despite my problems with the book, a decent read, but it is NO Caves of Steel."},{"Title":"The Naked Sun","review":"I hadn't read this since middle school, and happily rediscovered the Asimov robot trllogy this past year.

Touches on his experiences studying with the Professeurs of Savate in France where he became the first American to attain Professeur status.The technical aspect of the book displays the sub-systems in this comprehensive art. Boxe francaise, Chausson, Canne et Baton, Lutte Parissienne, Foue, and Panache. This book is not intended to be a teaching manuel.

It is my sincere opinion that the author does not speak nor can he write in English.The information is very vague at best. The pictures are of such poor quality that it is beyond reproach.No real technique is demonstrated against any attacks,there are only poses.My favorite is where the author slashes a man standing absolutley still with a knife for no apperant reason and calls it combative technique.

One is that of sex. The other is of ethnicity. Specifically, when the person is a Native American. She describes pivotal cases in the US and Canada where a tribe would restrict a female member's rights in some context that was specific to her sex. That is, a male member would not face such a constraint. Usually, this revolved around a most basic issue. The tribe might say that if she married an outsider, her children would not be members of the tribe. Whereas a man of the tribe who married an outsider would have his children be members.Reading through the summaries of the legal arguments on both sides leaves one with the uncomfortable feeling that an attempt is being made to square a circle.She compares similar situations in the two countries, in part due to the analogous arguments made and the opposite outcomes. In both countries, the tribes are considered largely sovereign. Hence the tribes argued that they should be autonomous in defining their memhership; the latter being a fundamental trait of a tribe. Even if this led to a dimunition of women's rights. In the US, the courts generally accepted this argument. But in Canada, the decisions went the other way.Aks also explains her view. That it is ultimately possible to protect tribal women's rights without unduly impinging on tribal rights. A very nuanced position."},{"Title":"The MacLehose Trail","review":"Like many, I spend my weekends away, up in the hills and along the trails of Hong Kong's wonderful country parks. There are rugged mountains, beautiful beaches, shady & forested valleys with deserted little villages and the occasional stunning view of Victoria Harbour. One of the best-loved trails is the Maclehose Trail, named after Governor Sir Murray Maclehose who headed the 1970s project to maintain and preserve Hong Kong' stunning landscape while allowing the necessary economic development to carry on apace.This book is a fabulous collection of photographs from along the 100km trail. Each of the ten stages is described in words, photos and delightful Chinese calligraphy. It's more coffee table than some might like, but for those of us who know what it's like to climb Ma On Shan, reach the top and look out over the small expanse of Hong Kong and its many islands, the book's images will bring back many hard-won memories. For those that don't, well, buy this book and get out there."},{"Title":"Barry and Alice: Portrait of a bisexual marriage","review":"The struggle and growth between 2 people committed to staying married while supporting Barry's bisexuality has encouraged and challenged me.

The authors reveal that our forms of sharing love and sexuality are as complex and unique as each individual. They also show that if our uniqueness is nurtured and supported, then partnerships can exist in an atmosphere of openness, honesty and change. Yet what I have come to use the book for is as a guide for raising children. Barry and Alice's child experiences an equitable sharing of an extended family of loving support. Their family model stresses individuality, community and cooperation. Thus the authors illustrate an expanded understanding of family, as well as a key to being truly partnered, by the daily choice to transform together."},{"Title":"How to Adjust and Repair Your Sewing Machine","review":"This book is really more of a booklet made up of old photocopied, type written pages. The pages are not even clear, with little black dots over the pages giving the appearance of something that has been photocopied quite often. It really looked like something someone threw together in their basement. There is some information there, but not what I was looking for. I think this item would be better suited to old &quot;Singer&quot; machine owners who do not have an owners manual since what information there is in this booklet seems more geared to the Singer owner.I wanted a more comprehensive, fix it or do it yourself type of manual on mechanical sewing machines that addressed cleaning etc. Although there are alot of diagrams in the booklet, its not information I haven't already seen on the internet.

Many parts of the war that occurred between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia have always been confusing to me. Words just cannot fully capture for me the topography, the practices, and the grimness of the confrontations.As someone who loves books of fine photography, Mr. Gardner's images immediately drew my attention. Although done over 135 years ago, they are masterpieces of the photographic art. What a nice surprise it was to find that each image came with a mini-essay that explained the significance of the place, explained more about the details of what was portrayed, and extended the observations to other situations and circumstances in the Civil War. As much as I liked the photographs, I found the mini-essays even better. The combination was incomparable!One of the great challenges in this geographic area (northern Virginia, southern Maryland, and southern Pennsylvania) was brought by the many rivers that had to be crossed. Mr. Gardner did a fine job of showing what the bridges and fords looked like in normal times, what the same crossings looked like without their normal structures in place, and how engineers used pontoon boats, pontoon bridges, and built temporary structures to fill in for exploded gaps. A lot of the infrastructure of war is captured, from barricades and cannons to sniping positions to wagon camps. There are even examples of \\"Quaker guns\\" which were not really guns at all, but simulated guns to keep the enemy away from positions where no troops could be spared to defend them.Although almost all of the images are of peaceful activities to support the battlefields, the images that show dead soldiers become all the more powerful in the context of the normalcy. You will never forget the photographs from Gettysburg. They could be an advertisement for opposing war.For modern viewers, the casualness with which the images mix African-Americans and Caucasians on the Union side belies the racism that partially led to the war itself.Mr. Gardner was the official photographer of the Army of the Potomac during most of the Civil War. He had come to the United States from Scotland at the invitation of famed Civil War photographer, Mr. Matthew Brady, in 1855 but left Mr. Brady's employ when Mr. Brady denied Mr. Gardner publication credit for his work. The very difficult photographic conditions are well described in the book, which will make you appreciate the accomplished results all the more.A version of this book was originally published in 1866. The current edition has digitally reproduced the images in a smaller size than the original. That is a shame because in many cases Mr. Gardner has captured sweeping panoramas and depth of field that would reward being seen in larger size. However, the details are not obscured in most cases. The details simply seem too small. Naturally, the purchaser gets a benefit from this because it means that the book is less costly than it would otherwise have been. My judgment is that publishers should use the size that the photographer intended the images to be published in. I graded the book down one star for this flaw.Where would people in the future benefit from photographs and detailed notes about you and your family . . . and you and your work? When can you start preparing the photographs and notes?"},{"Title":"Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the American Civil War 1861-1865","review":"My husband wanted a copy of Gardner's Sketchbook and this edition was recommended for the quality of its images. That recommendation was certainly right. I was surprised and pleased when it came earlier than expected, so I could give it to him for Christmas."},{"Title":"Gardner's Photographic Sketchbook of the American Civil War 1861-1865","review":"This is a beautifully done book of great photographs. As much as I liked the quality, I would have to tone down my excitement by the content. The pictures shown in this book are of general concern popular of telling the Civil War in a basic, simple format. The photograph qualities are much better than I have saw in other books although I have seen a majority of them. This book offers nothing new in the line of Gardner's work and is basically a 'greatest hits' of his work that followed the eastern theatre from the Union perpective. Unfortunately Gardner never took pictures of dead Union soldiers or captured Union losses that much. Gardner had a knack for enhancing pictures by using props such as moving a dead body to different locations or using weapons, canteens, etc. to be placed in the photograph. By today's standards it is hard to imagine doctored photographs in a war-like setting but that was a part of Gardner's work.His work is a very vital element to telling the hidden, horrid truths of the Civil War although this book offers very little in providing pictures not typically shown. I would have loved to see different work instead of these classic photos commonly used in history books. The book is of great quality and each photograph offers an explanation of the reasons the photo was taken or done. I recommend the book to people who really do not have an understanding of Civil War photography or common knowledge of the war itself. For the veteran enthusiast, it may seem very redundant and a perfect coffee table book. I can't recommend it to the advanced historian as this book may bore you after the initial curiosity fades."},{"Title":"Jet Smarter: The Air Traveler's Rx","review":"Jet Smarter is the Encyclopedia Britannica of air travel! Read it before you board an airplane - then pack it in your carry-on. This book can save your health, maybe even your life! There are more dangers in flying than you ever dreamed of. It's all in Jet Smarter. The book is hard-hitting, in depth, comprehensive, full of solutions, entertaining and often witty. It's a behind-the-scenes look from author Diana Fairechild, a savvy former flight attendant and now aviation health expert. Diana's advice on how to deal with flying is practical and useful. Her suggestions really work. It's obvious that she's been there, done that, and fixed that herself. Thanks to Jet Smarter, I can fly without being sick during and after the flight. I can think and work - or play - after a flying instead of going straight to bed to recuperate. Now, instead of dreading the trip, I actually look forward to it."},{"Title":"Jet Smarter: The Air Traveler's Rx","review":"No airline passenger should be without JET SMARTER, Diana Fairechild's definitive guide to air travel health. Drawing on her 21 years experience as an airline insider, Diana gives us a rare, no-holds-barred look at the dangers of jet travel and, luckily for us, offers hundreds of sensible ways to cope with or even avoid their impact on our health. Wonderfully readable, Diana's new book startles us with how hazardous airline practices are, comforts us with her healthy, personally-tested approach to surviving the travel experience, and entertains us frequently with her sometimes gentle, sometimes gritty, but always grand sense of humor."},{"Title":"Jet Smarter: The Air Traveler's Rx","review":"This review has been rewritten with the benefit of extensive comments from the author.Before reading this review, please be aware that Ms. Fairechild kindly let me know that she is bringing out a new book in October 2003 that is 150 pages in length that she feels eliminates the problems with this current book that my review addresses. Although I have not seen that book, I suggest that you consider that one instead of this one.This book will be of most value to those who are starting careers as flight attendants or are frequent fliers who experience illness during and after traveling. Occasional fliers will find relatively little relevant information for them beyond what I have read in magazines and newspapers.The lesson of this book is that doing lots of flying is hazardous to your health and sense of well-being. On pages 200-201 of the paperback, regular print edition, you can find a chart of symptoms which refers to what may be causing those symptoms. From there, you can check into the relevant section of the book. This is the best way to use this book.Caution: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, read this book from front to back. It contains the same information, on the same subjects over and over again. I estimate that there are less than 100 pages of unrepeated material in the 396 pages in this book. I found it very hard to plow through all that repetition.Ms. Fairechild was a flight attendant for many years and finally had to give up that profession due to illness caused by chemical sensitivities. During that time, she flew over 10 million miles. Her own health issues turned her into a person focused on sharing the potential dangers of flying with passengers and crew members. She is kind to share the lessons of her own problems with the rest of us.Her explanations are pretty easy to follow. The most serious problems usually relate to lack of oxygen, dehydration, becoming infected with diseases from other passengers, chemical poisoning, and stress reactions. She provides extensive lists of counter-measures -- more than most people will probably choose to follow. But if you have an extreme problem, you may choose to pursue all of them.You will probably be shocked to learn that pilots are often paid bonuses for using less fuel that encourage not providing as much oxygen to passengers as the planes are capable of providing. She suggests asking the flight attendants to request that the pilot make full oxygen available. I haven't flown since I read this so I don't know how well it will work to make that request.Ms. Fairechild also points out that almost 90% of all fliers will have some negative health outcome during or after the trip. Would you tolerate that if your car had the same effect on you? Perhaps our legislators in Congress should require some changes.Naturally, the best thing to do is to stay off airplanes.I was troubled by sections of the book where Ms. Fairechild writes quantitatively. Her numbers sometimes didn't make any sense to me. She asserts that a Boeing 777 costs one billion dollars (more than the stock market value of most airlines), which cannot be right. She now tells me that she has checked with Boeing after reading my review, and agrees that the number is wrong. She frequently points out high profitability in the industry, while the industry has cumulatively lost money since its inception through any ending year you want to use. These statements made me less confident about her quantitative statements about health. Are there really 15 million people in the United States who have tuberculosis, as she asserts? I don't think so. It may be that a large number of people occasionally test positively for tuberculosis. The commonly used test is notoriously inaccurate in producing false positives among people who do not have the disease. Ms. Fairechild tells me that she had no one to help her check facts or edit the book, which may account for these lapses.I would have rated the book lower because of its writing style and the errors which made me question the book's facts, but I think its overall message is one that all flight crews and frequent fliers need to understand. Let the inflight workers and frequent fliers beware!I certainly admire and appreciate Ms. Fairechild's sincere attempts to help us all have healthier flights. She seems to be a five-star person! I hope her new book is a great success.After you read this book, think about what else you do that is potentially harmful to your health. How can you accommodate your career and personal needs in a more healthful way?"},{"Title":"Jet Smarter: The Air Traveler's Rx","review":"Cabin pressurization was one of the greatest advances in air travel. Aircraft could fly passengers higher-above the rough weather. Airsickness is rare today. But the higher altitudes, and resulting faster speeds and longer ranges, introduced a number of not so obvious challenges. This book covers the things that affect passengers today.Jet Smarter discusses jet lag, airliner air quality, toxic sprays, radiation, electromagnetic fields, altitude, pressurization, dehydration, G-forces, noise and much more. Then the book tells you what to do about them. The latest edition of this revised volume includes several specific air travel articles from Fairechild's business travel column on the ABC News website.Diana Fairechild is an airline health and safety advocate who has flown over 10 million air miles as a flight attendant.As a pilot (SEL and gliders, hang gliders and paragliders), skydiver (1,200 jumps, D-454), author and publisher, I fly quite often.

Mitchell, who is an excellent reviewer (and connoisseur of P.G. Wodehouse) was correct in his opinions of the earlier book (now in paperback).The earlier version is poorly written, padded, inaccurate, and filled with such well-known advice as to drink plenty of water before you fly to prevent dehydration. In addition, there are several unsubstantiated scientific claims (she provides absolutely no references or footnotes), as well as the author's personal (New Age-feeling) insights. Obviously, a revision and update were in order, kudos to the author for providing one.The author has written several other books available at Amazon.com, their favorable reviews are a welcome sight."},{"Title":"Jet Smarter: The Air Traveler's Rx","review":"I am a 68 year old retired Inter-continental airline forensic researcher - 30 years on the job, 5 continents, passenger on 64 airlines, 45 countries, some years 150 flights, mainly transatlantic, transpacific, plus many NorthSouth &amp; SN.

The end result is admirable and I, personally, have no real complaints.The SDF-3, failing to appear in Earth space for the final assault on the Regis, de-folds in a mysterious void. Meanwhile, Scott Bernard on Earth begins his search for the lost ship while the remaining Sentinels on Tirol make some hard discoveries. The ensuing action brings all of the generations together, solves one of Robotech's biggest mysteries, graphically reveals the climax of Protoculture's existence, and ties up all remaining loose ends with the remarkable Intersection segment as well as a final &quot;Recollections&quot; chapter from Lisa Hayes-Hunter.THE END OF THE CIRCLE brings very satisfying closure to one of the best science fiction sagas around. As a hard core fan of the entire novel series I was quite pleased with the way the story arc was brought to a close and I believe that most other fans would probably agree with me on that. The authors deserve major credit for succeeding at a very difficult task. Five solid stars."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"I read my first Robotech book because I liked the picture on the cover. Since then I have quite literally memorized every book in the series, including Sentinals as well as Zentradi Uprising and Before the Invid Storm. I own every book of every series and all of them are very dog earred. So I know what I am saying when I say that End of the Circle was a world altering experience for me.Although I may sound like a fanatic, my reasoning is this. Jack McKinney (two authors, one of whom, James Lucero went on to write some great Star Wars books and, ironically, the final wrap up of that series as well) was forced to write his books on what is basically a kids show, Robotech. He was constrained in his characters and could do little with the story. And yet his books managed to add an amazing depth to the Robotech world that was sorely lacking in the cartoons. So much so in fact that his books touched off a virtual war between the cartoon purists and the book converts. I bring this up because in this book, the gloves are off.End of the Circle is where McKinney finally gets to write the story that he wanted to write. All the characters are much more mature than their series debute. Scott is no longer a one dimensional tragic hero and Marlene is now more human as well as being a bit grizzled. Everyone is back, if only for just a cammio. Now I have read the reviews that say this is a weakness but if this had not been in the book, these same people would probably have been angry about that too. McKinney is simply trying to include all the characters whom we have grown too like up to this point.Yes, there is a lot that is wrapped up in this book. Yes...some may say there is too much to be wrapped up, with a few eyebrows going up about some story lines. And yet, while McKinney could have left well enough alone, it would not have been a true Science Fiction book, where eyebrows are SUPPOSED to go up occasionally. I mean come on, how exactly does a crystal in a &quot;warp core&quot; enable faster than light speed. Maybe not the best comparison but its all I could come up with.When I was young, I loved this book. When I was adolecent, I loved this book and started to actually understand what was going on. As an adult, I still love this book and I think I understand much of what is going on. But you know what, I am going to read this book one more time, just to see what I might have missed. And I think all of you should too."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"There are many reviews of these book. I really enjoyed the novel, but I also think that while trying to tie up all the loose ends that sometimes the story is hurt. When finishing a series you have to let some things go, so the reader goes away still wondering a tad.I think the author (or authors) tried just a little to much to cover every person, event or plot line in the Robotech universe. That is why I took away one star.On the other hand there was a lot of humor. For example, a ship named N'trpriz with a Karbarran Captain named K'rrk, a science officer with horns, a female communications officer and the guy in engineering has a thick Highlander's accent!&quot;The second star to the right?&quot; - Rick Hunter."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"(Anyone who is (still) interested in Robotech in 2009 is probably aware that - after a dry spell in the \`90s - a new batch of comics and the \\"sequel\\" animation The Shadow Chronicles picked up where the TV series left off . . . sort of. A lot has been written about Robotech continuity, especially where the timelines presented in the novels, comics and TV series diverge. When trying to make sense of this, you have to take into account that the writers for each medium had to work around certain limitations, and when production of the Robotech: Sentinels TV series was scrapped, the comics and novels didn't have the same fleshed-out source material to work with as in the past. In other words, the writers had a script to base their work on, but had to flesh it out on their own. If that sort of thing presents a problem for you, you might find The End of the Circle to be a bit frustrating.)For starters, if you haven't read the previous Sentinels novels, this book will not make ANY sense. When the Sentinels books first hit the shelves so many years ago, I ignored them, because I was still seeing new-to-me TV episodes at the time. When I started going back and buying the novels from the original series, it crossed my mind to skip anything with Sentinels in the title, but I'm sure glad I *didn't* do that, because those books bring the original Macross characters back into the equation. That being said, The End of the Circle also attempts to reunite the various generations of TV characters with those who appear only in the novels, which from time to time makes it feel as though a bit too much effort is spent trying to (re)acquaint readers with everyone. All of a sudden, you have Dana Sterling and her Southern Cross teammates reunited with the families that left them behind. A lot of pages are dedicated to Scott Bernard's adventures immediately following the last TV episode, but to me it seemed that the passage of months between when Scott and his New Generation companions parted ways and were (briefly) reunited in this book placed a much greater gulf between them than what is encountered when Dana Sterling and Bowie Grant join their parents in deep space. Not having read any of the comics until Wildstorm acquired the license a few years ago, maybe I missed some explanations along the way. The biggest shortcoming of this book and its Sentinels predecessors is that the alien characters are really pretty forgettable, excluding those established on TV - the Zentraedi and Invid - and the increasingly important Haydonites. But since the whole point of Book #18 here is to wrap everything up, everyone has a part to play.Those criticisms aside, The End of the Circle really has a lot going for it. Rick and Lisa Hayes are relevant characters again, after being placed on the back burner in a couple of the earlier books. Dana, Dante and Louie from the Southern Cross are here, and even Bowie Grant finally finds his niche without being a wet blanket the entire time. The only \\"core\\" character who I think gets ignored a bit is Miriya, but that brings me to another point. Instead of this being a novelization of an existing episode, or at least taken from the script of an episode that was never completed, this is essentially an original story. I tried to imagine how this book could have made any sense when compared to an accompanying TV episode, and I just don't think it'd be possible. There is a lot going on, probably enough for several episodes, but the action is of a different kind than that portrayed in the original series. It's more about exploring concepts and putting together pieces of a puzzle than a war story. It stands on its own.I'm going to disagree with some of the previous reviewers by saying that The End of the Circle is NOT a must-read for all Robotech fans. It's a great read if you've already watched and read everything Robotech-related under the sun, but the underlying themes run much deeper than anything that a 30-minute TV show or a comic book could ever capture. In a way, the characters become secondary to the concepts, and some readers inevitably won't care for that. Also, the \\"official\\" Robotech storyline as dictated by Harmony Gold has been altered somewhat with the release of the comics published by Wildstorm and the film The Shadow Chronicles. The novels went off on a somewhat independent direction when there were no more animated episodes to draw from (no pun intended) and although The Shadow Chronicles does make use of some Sentinels content, the differences are almost immediately obvious. For that reason, consider The End of the Circle as just one possible conclusion to the Robotech saga, albeit probably a richer and deeper experience than anything a movie could provide. Maybe a full year of daily TV episodes . . ."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"A must read for all serious Robotech fans. It ties all plot threads together and also includes a flashback to an awesome Zentraedi-Invid battle. Want to know what happened to the Robotech Elders, the Regis and the SDF-1 fold drives?

I found the book to be very well writen and aruguably the best in the series. Reading the other books in the series does help in understanding what's going on in this book, but other than that, it makes for a very good read. This conclusion to the RoboTech series has a completely unexpected ending which involves what happened to the SDF-1's fold drives, the future of RoboTechnology, the mysterious Haydon, and why Haydon IV is what it is.

Excellent book a must for any robotech or sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"First, let me say that reviewer \\"wolf-sigma\\" is absolutely right in saying that the Jack McKinney novelizations brought a welcome level of depth to the Robotech saga that takes the story far beyond the constraints of a cartoon written for children -- not the least of which was the realism provided by actual military service on the part of at least one of the authors. Since I somehow managed to miss the show when it was aired in my area, the novels were my first exposure to the series. And I don't think the show by itself could have packed the punch for me that the books did.With that said, though, I'm not a fan of some of the more controversial elements introduced in the books that had no basis in the show -- namely, all that overly-mystical hoodoo about the \\"Shapings of the Protoculture\\". Thinking caps I get -- how else would you be able to pilot a machine with that many controls and get near-human movement out of it? -- but the Shapings? Just...no.And unfortunately, it's exactly those disbelief-straining elements that are on full display in End of the Circle. Even more gratuitous than the front-and-center role of the Shapings is an increased emphasis on the mysterious God-like figure of Haydon. Whoever or whatever Haydon was (and they never do answer that doozy of a question), he is implied to have been directly responsible for the Invid's connection to the Flower, the creation of most of the races in the Local Group, and oh by the way, for the highly coincidental genetics between Earth and Tirol.Add to this the over-the-top psychic and oracular powers of Max and Miriya's second daughter Aurora (let's not even go into her accelerated growth rate) and what you have is a novel that has the reader seriously wondering what the heck the authors might have been smoking when they wrote it.I'm quite sure it's for these reasons that Harmony Gold has not only officially declared the Robotech novelizations as \\"secondary continuity\\", but actually ret-conned the events in End of the Circle out of existence with the Shadow Chronicles. Much as I love the novels, and even the Sentinels storyline (which suffered from much of the same metaphysical burdens), I have to say I won't miss this last volume's absence from the canon.If you've already read all the other novels and want to see how it could have ended, then by all means, pick up a copy of End of the Circle; just keep in mind that it's no more than a professional AU fanfic at this point. Otherwise, you might be better off just letting dormant Protoculture lie."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"This is a great novel to finish an epic series. It can't be read as a standalone but as a closer, to at least the Sentinel's series.Take it, embrace it for what it is, and ignore what's been churned since ('cept the 3 later novels)."},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"The End of the Circle - or, should it be \\"The Beginning of the Circle\\"? - is the writer duo Jack McKinney's final foray into the Robotech saga. This final volume brings every previous volume together in a thrilling fight for survival - not only of the human race, or of every other XT life, but of the entire universe. The SDF-3 has mysteriously disappeared, and no one is sure where they could be. The SDF-3's disappearance coincides with two universe-altering occurrences - the Invid Regis and the Invid race have disappeared along with nearly all of the universe's protoculture, and the awakening of the mythical deity Haydon. An epic battle for 'Newspace' must take place between the Regis and Haydon, with all life seemingly stuck helplessly in the middle.This final volume wraps up the entire Robotech series by bringing each main character into play, and each chess-piece is set for the ultimate final confrontation. Thrust back into the light are the most important characters in the series - Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes-Hunter, Max and Miriya Sterling, Dr. Lang, Exedore, and, of critical importance, Minmei - but also included are the main players from each additional saga (and a special guest, Commander Krr'k of the Karbarran dreadnought N'trpriz...). The loose-ends are tied up, and everything is magnificently and originallyexplained to bring closure - and yet, rebirth - to the Robotech Saga.\\"Anyway, the Robotech Age, with its mechamorphosis and Protoculture, has passed away forever, and something else must now come onstage.\\" - Lisa Hayes-Hunter"},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"Ever wonder what happened to the SDF-1's subluminal space-fold engines? Or what happened to the Invid Regis after she left the Earth like a pheonix from the ashes? This is a definite read for you! It is a novel to be finished in one sitting, because you will not want to put it down! The story of Scott Bernard's attempt to convince the RDF that he didn't buy the farm during the destruction of the Mars Base forces, during the Invid Invasion, and that the Invid clone princess, Marlene, is a prime key to the power of protoculture and the Invid species itself is compelling. How he accomplishes this is even more fascinating. If you've read the series, you've always wondered if they would ever....well...find out for yourself, but only if you really understand the rest of the series, otherwise, you'll only be lost.Hence the name &quot;The end of the circle&quot;' this is where the entire story ends/ comes together, yet seems to &quot;turn over on itself&quot;"},{"Title":"End of the Circle (Robotech #18)","review":"This book is great.

Having read the entire series, this is probably my 5th favorite. This is only because of the last chapter, otherwise 2nd or 3rd.

It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work. Here is the DSI edition:[...]The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such.

Set in 1940's Australia, Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte presents an interesting and challenging character. The son of a white man and an aboriginal woman,\\"Bony\\"brings characteristics of both cultures to his detecting. The story begins when Jeffrey Anderson mysteriously disappears into the bush while out inspecting his employer's cattle station one April morning. Anderson was known around the area as a cruel man with a bad temper, thus his absence is not really mourned. However, a search is begun but yields no results. Five months later Bony is called in to solve this seemingly unsolvable mystery. Using both modern detecting skills and aboriginal intuition and dealing with both English feelings of colonialism and Aboriginal rights, Bony solves the puzzle while narrowly avoiding death himself.On a deeper level, Upfield presents a political and social critique of the English treatment of Aboriginals in the first half of the 20th century. For the 1940's, Upfield even broaching this topic was radical. Detective fiction provided a way to support civil and social rights for aboriginals in a time when such acts were not accepted. Bony presents a character who combines seemingly \\"the best of both worlds\\": a civilized, intelligent, and humorous man who understands the reasons behind both the English treatment of the Aboriginals and the Aboriginals resulting feelings. This book is not only an excellent mystery but also a wonderful look at an often ignored group of people."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"It's worth a read!

(Regretably, I am not competent to evaluate the reliability of these insights.)Has interesting characterizations of life among squatters in Queensland's outback.

When I read the also terrific books by Tony Hillerman, I wondered if he had been influenced by Upfield, and in an interview he spoke about his admiration of Upfield."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"The Bone Is Pointed is my first Napoleon Bonaparte mystery, and it was a most pleasant experience. Taking place in Australia, and written by someone who lived there, gives the reader a taste of what it's like in that world down under. Older mysteries are making a comeback and this series is a good choice for re-issue.Bony to his friends, the half-caste detective has the self assurance of Holmes and the likeable arrogance of Poirot. Knowing that he is good at his profession does not make him insufferable. He is kind, even though a few others are often goaded to unkindness at best out of fear of his ability to solve cases. His doggedness is nearly legendary, his source of pride and a reputation is fights hard to maintain.In this case, his susceptibility to the ways of his aboriginal mother come to the fore, yet he is surrounded by people who have liked him from the moment he meets them. Even though one or more of them is a murderer. Of this he is certain. The missing victim, Jeffrey Anderson, was not what he seemed, at least in part. He was well known to be a bully, treating others cruelly, and no one mourns his loss. The only fear is that in death he will bring ruin to those who knew him.The story drifts a bit and readers looking for fights and bloodletting won't get much in Upfield's novel. Still, it's a quick read and an interesting one that will lead some readers to others in the series. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"The Bone is Pointed operates - and operates well - on at least two levels simultaneously. First it functions as a highly successful detective novel. Upfield must have sorted through the various legacies of the detective genre when creating his characters - Detective-Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte certainly has reasoning powers that rival those of Sherlock Holmes himself. Moreover, &quot;Bony,&quot; as the detective requests to be called, knows Australia like Holmes knows London; he knows its intricacies, its characters. And in the absence of a Watson, the reader is allowed to participate in Bony's thought process, not completely, but enough that by the end of the novel a firm sympathy with its protagonist has been created, reinforced by Upfield's careful narrative style. Secondly, Upfield's novel operates as an insightful look at mid-twentieth century Australia. Some of the tensions in that society are personified by Bony himself, a half-caste Australian who acknowledges that to succeed, he must rely on both of his inherited halves. Ultimately, it is Bony's sensitivity to both his European and Australian that draw him - and the reader - into the landscape and the people of Australia. I will be back to read more of Detective-Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Arthur W. Upfield's beautifully crafted protagonist, Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte unravels another mystery, this time exploring the Australian outback. Bony, (as his friends call him, and he hopes you are his friend) is half-aboriginal and half-white. The powers of reason he has cultivated in white schools and the sixth sense of the outback ingrained from his aboriginal side have made him into a sort of Australian Sherlock Holmes. Enchantingly arrogant, and outrageously tenacious, Bony is ready to solve the disappearance of an abusive drunk that has been missing for five months and no one seems eager to find. Upfield masterfully keeps the reader's attention, casting suspicions as fast as Bony's mind can create them. As new clues are discovered, new suspects are created and the old discarded, only to be brought in again. What Bony finds leads him and the reader into a struggle to create an Australian identity in the vast and desolate landscape; a struggle between an aboriginal identity and white. As Bony skates the race line, the tension between the white world and the black becomes greater, and the aborigines \\"point the bone\\" at him, a sort of death curse. Racing against his weakening body, Bony struggles to find a culprit, or to discover that whether there is a culprit at all. In a superb finale to a gripping read, Upfield both reaffirms the affable side to Bony\\"s otherwise obstinate character and comments on the racial divide in Australia."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (&quot;Bony&quot;) is a likeable character. I enjoy the character and the series. However what elevated this book from just another mystery is the Australian and aboriginal element. You will learn about aboriginal mind warfare, the mind telegraph, and the massive rabbit migrations. Don't &quot;point the bone&quot; at me. This is a memorable book."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"What a wonderful adventure this one is! Not only is the murder mystery of the outstanding quality of the Upfield novel, but the insights into the great Australian outback and the aboriginal people are impressive. Interspersed with the intriguing actions of Bony, the most endearing of all detectives, are glimpses of unique outback phenomenon and an interesting peek into the lifestyles and customs of the Kalchut tribe of aborigines, a tribe protected from white society.Jeffrey Anderson, the murder victim, was not missed. No one liked the brutal, sadistic man, but Bony still needed to investigate. When he got too close to the answers for which he was searching, the tribe \\"boned\\" him, a certain death sentence for the half-caste. Not only does Bony have to solve this case, but he has to do this before he dies.

Arthur Upfield heaps scorn on the _urban_ Australian, ignorant of the outback & therefore dismissive & patronising towards its inhabitants -- white _& especially_ black. Upfield is especially scathing about those urban whites who dismiss Aboriginal culture as 'primitive'. He champions its _age_ & deep knowledge, & the undoubted power & reality of some of its so-called 'magical' practices. The book turns on the latter: Bony is definitely affected by the bone-pointing: the impact is real. And equally it is _only_ the Aboriginal medicine man who can bring Bony back from the point of death. Upfield brilliantly expounds Aboriginal philosophy -- _not_ in \\"Aboriginal patois\\" (as one review puts it) but in Aboriginal English --ie, a variety of Pidgin.Upfield also depicts accurately the relationships between the outback whites & 'their' Aborigines -- the 'station' Aborigines, as distinct from those who are still 'bush'. This relationship is mutual respect & interdependence. The station-owner is called 'boss' precisely because he _is_ that: the _employer_ of _his_ station Aborigines. He supplies food, housing, clothing, etc, _&_ employment: in the running of the station (managing the sheep &/or cattle, the horses, etc; managing the water & the land, etc.)The outback whites want to preserve Aboriginal _culture_ from destruction by the church & other urban whites. Upfield constantly contrasts the depth of Aboriginal culture -- already old before the whites had even descended from the trees -- & the superficiality of the so-called 'civilisation' with which urban whites want to replace this ancient outlook & way of life. So the tension in Bony is the tension between his ancient roots in the bush -- roots that are millions of years old, & the pull of 'white' _culture_: rational, emotionless, scientific.2. \\"the English treatment of the Aboriginals and the Aboriginals resulting feelings...an often ignored group of people\\"(a) ignored by whom? Certainly not the Australians (b)'English' & 'Australian' are _not_, repeat not, the same. The Australians are quite distinct, & refer to the English as 'Poms'. What Upfield shows us is (1)how the outback Oz whites interrelate with the Aborigines -- on terms of knowledge & understanding (2)the patronising ignorance of the urban Oz whites."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Arthur Upfield clearly has a grasp of what is required to create a solid piece of detective fiction, and yet, though all the necessaries of the genre are represented (murder mystery, self-assured detective, etc.) it seems there is still something missing. Though this book failed to grab my attention as a modern detective novel, it did serve as a poignant introduction to the not-so-underlying politics of Australia. Upfield's well-intentioned detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, known to readers as Bony, is infinitely aware of his part aboriginal, part white background, and this awareness is fundamental to all other action. As Bony attempts to solve the disappearance of the drunken Jeffrey Anderson he embraces aspects from all areas of his background, employing his ancestral history to reach a conclusion about the disappearance and death of Anderson. Bony's lineage means more to this tale than its ability to help him solve the mystery of the moment however. It is a stunning commentary about the nature of race and cultural relations in Australia. Upfield has written a book that serves as an indictment of the cultural politics of Australia, painting a picture that is a means by which he may critique the behavior of the very people most likely to seek out his tales. As a result, he is able to deliver a message that would otherwise fall on deaf ears. His is a tale is a condemnation of the inequality that has embraced Australia for more than a century."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Think Australian Agatha Christie for these period (1950's) saturated Australian detective stories about half aborigine detective, Napoleon Bonaparte (Bony). Compare to Hercule Poirot, with Bony winning, in my opinion, with his more lovable personality.Add the elements of race discrimination of the 1950's, the combination of aborigine instinct and tracking skills with the white man's thinking skills, an author who is comparable to Christie for unexpected plot twists, the ability of the author to evoke time and place, and you have books I enjoy reading more than once.\\"The Bone is Pointed\\" adds the element of the aborigine religion with its similarities to voodoo, with Bony as the victim, for even more tension in the plot."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Napoleon Bonaparte is not your average person; he's half aboriginal on his mother's side, his father, British. Born in Britain, he returned to his mother's homeland of Queensland, Australia in as a child. He learned the ways of his aboriginal roots while living in white society of the 1940s. Despite deeply routed prejudicial strata, he attained he rank of Detective Inspector for one reason, he solved every crime to which he was assigned, often by stretching or disregarding orders from higher-ups.So it was that five months following the mysterious disappearance of Jeffery Anderson, a man no one particularly missed because of his belligerent behavior and attitude, \`Bony', as the inspector is called by his friends, arrives via plane to determine what happened to Mr. Anderson and his present whereabouts.There are few clues, Other than a horse ridden that eventful night, what was on and not on the horse, and where he had last been ridden. Bony's task is to use his detective skills and insights to piece together a puzzle five months old. The night is memorable for another event, it was the last time it had rained in the area. It had been a drenching rain.The area of Queensland where the disappearance took place is isolated, save for two pioneering families who claim much of the land. There is also a tribe of aboriginals whom one of the families had pledged to protect for all outside influence since its ancestors arrived and laid claim to the land. The third was a community of hares, yes, rabbits from which the natives trade their pelts for needed supplies.\\"Bony's arrival is not welcomed by all. He is seen by some as a threat, the result of which might cost the detective his life. Being half aboriginal, with piercing blue eyes, he is knowledgeable of their ways, both to heal and to destroy or kill when necessary.Why has the Detective Bonaparte series endured, and copyrights renewed? They are classic mystery novels. Their main character has influenced writers like the late Tony Hillerman and his novels of Navajo police chief Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn.If you've never been Down Under, take any one of Napoleon Bonaparte series, of which this book is among the first,.Ssit down in a comfortable chair with a botanical dictionary nearby. Be sure to have repellent handy, and prepare yourself for a bumpy plane ride and landing ion Australia in the 1940s.

He is having the 'bone pointed' at him byelders, which will eventually kill him if he cannot solve the case."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"From the very first page, the reader's mind starts spinning, trying to figure out the mysterious death of a young man. The clever Detective-Inspector Bonaparte embarks on a challenge to pin the murderer a long five months after the incident. This book is set in a small town, a ranch-like state, which aids the book in obtaining a individual essence for each of the characters. Since the events take place in one place, we see the characters interacting with each other and are able to form our own opinions for ourselves. This only creates an even more climatic ending when Bonaparte surprises the reader with an extreme discovery.The reader is able to view the sharp wit and good-natured humor of the detecive. The detective is almost suggested to be mad, or stubbornly insane, because it seems like he is trying to find a needle in haystack. In is only in the end, when we see through the eyes of the detective, when we are able to agree on the intelligence and creativity of the characters, especially the detective himself. The local inhabitants are keeping their own secrets, so the reader is forced to think of ways to hurdle obstacles. Upfield is in his glory, writing his best and demonstrating his clever ideas and wit."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Upfield's detective hero is Napolean Bonaparte, and the first line of the novel is &quot;History repeats itself!&quot; These two details render Upfield's novel a symbolic one, with themes larger than the mere unraveling of the plot. It is the presence of these larger themes that redeems this novel and makes it worth reading. The plot itself is mediocre, not grueling but not a thrill-a-minute either. Bony is self-assured almost ad nauseum and never hesitant to make abundantly clear his own awareness/knowledge of a scene - in this way, he resembles Sherlock Holmes, whose need to remind Watson and his readers frequently that he is in fact in control and has complete understanding can become tiresome. Bony's confidence, too, can become irritating, but his charm in other ways usually succeeds in balancing it out and making him readable. The plot itself is somewhat predictable, if not in the details, at least in the general nature of the crime and the culprit. Beyond this narrative, though, there are at work the larger themes, most notably the racial element to the story. Bony is a half-caste, and Upfield's treatment of the outback's aboriginal element is laudable. However, the theme becomes a bit overdone as the reader is constantly reminded (and reminded, and reminded, and then reminded again) that this theme is at play - that Bony is half-caste, that his race is a factor in his perception of the world and in the world's perception of him. Upfield's intentions are good, and for the most part well executed. But at times it seems he is working a little too hard at making sure the reader notices this element, and remains conscious of it throughout the novel. For the most part, however, Upfield's depiction of Bony's adventures in the outback is worth reading, if only to understand more about a sense of nationality that is specific to Australia and the racial tensions of this society."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"The Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte series spans 29 books written across almost 40 years; this, the sixth entry, was written in 1938. Its hero is a half-caste (white/aboriginal) police detective who operates under his own set of rules and insists on people calling him &quot;Bony&quot; (like the Emperor). He has a 100% success rate, thanks to his belief that given enough time, he can solve any crime (a somewhat dubious assertion). This has led to his being fired a number of times, and then rehired, as he is such an ace sleuth. In this case, he is sent to the outback to investigate the disappearance of a much-hated ranchhand, which occurred 5 months previously. Undaunted by the lack of physical evidence and passage of time, he hangs around long enough to worry people and eventually comes under much danger. The mystery itself isn't very interesting--in fact, it's rather easy to solve on one's own, there are no interesting twists. What does make the book (and presumably the whole series) worth reading is Upfield's treatment of aboriginals and the outback. The landscape is given much treatment, and its vastness and barrenness really come through. More intriguing is the aboriginal magic, the telepathic abilities, and the curses which only work on those who believe in them. The aboriginal patois sparkles throughout as well. Some of the book could be considered racist by contemporary standards (such as the use of &quot;boss&quot; toward the whites for example), but the overall story seems quite progressive for its time, especially considering the abuses suffered by the aboriginals at the hands of official policy."},{"Title":"The Bone is Pointed","review":"Arthur Upfield's &quot;The Bone is Pointed&quot; introduces those of us who are not already familiar with him to Napoleon Bonaparte, Upfield's Australian, part-aborigine super-sleuth. Bonaparte inherits from this aboriginal background the sorts of tracking skills, sensitivity to environment, and keen eye for detail that we have come to expect from our literary detectives, along with the arrogance and self-importance that come with those skills. Whether we (as readers) end up appreciating those qualities is a fine line that every detective fiction writer walks, and Upfield is fairly deft at keeping &quot;Bony's&quot; arrogance checked. Unfortunately, other aspects of Bony's personality, and certain aspects of the mystery he is unravelling, tended to grate on this reader as a bit tedious. The book's strength lies in its evocation of the Australian ranch country and the ranchers and aborigines who inhabit it; but at times Upfield seems so concerned with establishing the skills and magic of the aborigines (which is, at least, a worthy cause) that Bony's actual detection work gets a bit bogged down with explanation after explanation of aboriginal behavior and magic. After all this detail towards the conflict between Bony's native know-how and the aboriginal magic acting against him, I was hoping for a real stunner of an ending to salvage the novel, but instead found that Upfield had let me in on too many of Bony's discoveries to make the conclusion anything of a surprise. While I would recommend this book to anybody with a predilection for the Australian or aboriginal, I'd have to say that, within the larger context of the detective genre, &quot;The Bone is Pointed&quot; is largely mediocre."},{"Title":"The Sacrificial Lamb","review":"The Sacrificial Lamb is definitely not just one more story about the holocaust. It's a compelling novel about man's inhumanity to man; of people caught up in events that comprised the most evil times of the 20th Century.Nathan Ludwig and Stephon Baumeister first met as young boys, for a time immune to the prejudices of the adult world that was pre-war Germany. Anti-semitism forced an end to their friendship but it could not destroy the bond that had formed between them.After his father's death, Stephon, raised by parents loyal to National Socialism, strikes a deal in which the Reich pays for his medical education, after which he is expected to work for and support the Reich. Assigned to Buchenwald, to get along, he performs experiments on the prisoners.Nathan, after the death of his parents, is raised by relatives. He attends medical school where he meets his wife, and becomes a doctor. But he is forced from his practice by rising anti-Jewish sentiment. Sensing danger, he decides to take his family and flee Germany.This compelling novel pulls the reader in and will not let go, as Nathan and his family are captured. While they are sent elsewhere, he is sent to Buchenwald where he once again meets Stephon.Time passes. Nathan, with the help of prayer and God's grace, finds the courage to minister to both the spiritual and physical needs of fellow prisoners. He uses his past friendship with Stephon to acquire additional medical supplies with which to ease their pain.Here we have a riveting story of helpless people caught up in those evil days. Doepke makes their suffering seem real as they are forced to put their lives on hold and endure tremendous suffering. We meet individuals who, because of their horrible experiences, become more than they ever thought they could be.Living at Buchenwald, Nathan develops a closer relationship with Jesus as his personal savior and friend, and through him, a close relationship with God. Ignoring the danger of discovery, Nathan, in the tradition of Bonhoeffer and Kolbe, comforts many by praying with them, offering a belief in God and hope for the future to those open enough to listen. Stephon, watching, is not immune, and he begins to question his rigid loyalty to Hilter's goals.As with the biblical David who answers God's call and strides purposefully toward the giant Goliath, eager to do God's work, in Nathan, we have another example of how God uses insignificant humans to accomplish His ends, and we see that adversity and suffering do, indeed, serve a useful purpose. It's been said that more poeple have come to God because of suffering and adversity than in any other way, and Jack Doepke's tale amply demonstates this truth.I also liked the way Doepke developed his characters. These are people about whom one comes to care deeply. You'll marvel that Nathan is not caught and dragged to the ovens; that Stephon is not exposed and shot; and hope and pray, along with Nathan that his wife and sons will be found alive after the war.A drama of excitement and moral seriousness, this book will cause you to stop and ponder the evil of those days in Europe, when civilization seemed about to perish at the hands of immoral men. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Serial Experiments Lain","review":"This book is an excellent guide to the enigmatic and ambiguous anime series, _Serial Experiments: lain_. The bulk of the book is published in full color on high-gloss paper, reproducing a lot of screen-shots from the series. At the back, there are two pages of production credits (though there's no mention of the series' script superviser, Chiaki Konaka!).Each episode is given a dense three-page summary, there are also character profiles at the back (though only Lain and Masami Eiri receive an extended profile). This is an excellent book to accompany your first or your fifth viewing of the anime series.The publishers evidently have a deal with Pioneer to produce guides for many of their anime. I look forward to future volumes on _Dual_, _Trigun_ and _NieA_7_.People interested in basing an RPG on the _lain_ world will probably find this book disappointing.

Unfortunately, there is really rather little related information presented here. Of good use is the list of Appropriate Attributes and Appropriate Defects, as well as typical Mundane, Major, and Minor Items within the world of Serial Experiments Lain, but only two characters (Lain Iwakura and Massami Eiri) have been given BESM-based stats, and only three of the items in the series has similar BESM-based details. In fact, most of the BESM-related section of the book (the final twenty-plus pages) is filled not with information, but with sketches of characters, locations, and items from the Serial Experiments Lain series.As eye candy or a source of obscure information for the Serial Experiments Lain series, this Ultimate Fan Guide is indeed a good buy.

It is well-organized, with glossy color pictures in the front half of the book, grouped by color in a relatively easy-to-find way, under descriptions such as \\"Daisylike and Dandionlike White or Whitish Flowers\\" or \\"Tiny Pink to Reddish Pink Flowers.\\" Under each photograph is the flower's common name and the page number for the back portion of the book, in which detailed information is found.In the back section, each plant's description includes: All the known common names; the scientific name and family to which it belongs; the plant's height; detailed, non-scientific description of the flowers and leaves; the bloom season; the elevation at which the plant grows; the habitat in which it is found; and additional, relevant comments, including where the photograph was taken and if the plant is poisonous, or has any traditional medical uses, etc.My only disappointment is that, surely for brevity's sake, some plants are left out, which, while understandable, can make some identifications questionable. For instance, in trying to ID a high-elevation paintbrush, the book mentions \\"Over a dozen species of Castilleja in Arizona; the species of this genus are difficult to identify.\\" And only four of those dozen species are in the book. Still, with 853 species pictured and described, Plants of Arizona is much more thorough for the state of Arizona than any other field guide out there."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"There is no current book available that discusses the plants of this state. I believe the last comprehensive book was printed in the 70's. This is a good comprehensive guide with many colorful photographs, and lots of good information."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"I have to say that I can agree with all of the reviews up until the date of this one. In other words, I can see the negative aspects from \\"A reader\\" who gave the book 2 stars and I also see the positive attributes that many reviewers expressed. Overall, this is a useful book with good information but the formating makes it difficult to use in the field. Mainly because the color plate section is separated form each written plant account but the page number is given under each photo. Sometimes the photos only show the flower and not enough of the entire plant making it difficult to quickly identify plants visually; however, this is a common problem with many field guides. The only other complaint I have is that there aren't any distribution maps but instead a brief habitat description is provided. If you live in the Phoenix area or south-central and southwestern part of AZ which is Sonoran Desert then you may find Dr. Richard Spellenberg's \\"Sonoran Desert Wildflowers\\" from 2003 useful."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"A slightly less than perfect reference for the slightly more than serious amateur or the out of region professional.Somewhat, perhaps necessarily, overlarge for convenient use in the field.Rather beyond the Sunday stroll wildflower fancier.Like any so-called field guide in which all the images are collected in a separate section, actual field identification using PLANTS OF ARIZONA is troublesome. This is a criticism of the book's utility, not of its' excellent content."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"I am disappointed with this book, which I purchased due to the mostly positive reviews here on amazon. Here are my issues:1. The book consists of different sections: First the photo section, then the descriptions. To identify a plant, one needs to first find the photograph and then find the description. Most field guides show the picture on one side of a page and the description on the other, for good reason - it is much more practical!2. The photographs are small and often don't allow identification of a plant, which is the purpose of the book. For example, I noticed a yellow-flowering plant growing next to the road, in masses. I could not find it in the book. After consulting another identification guide, it was clear that the plant was Baileya multiradiata, one of the most common roadside flowers in Arizona. The photograph in this book only shows a close-up of the bloom, but what makes the plant easy to identify is the plant in its entirety.3. As a serious plant person, I am irritated to see that the captions below the photographs and the descriptive texts list the common names. Common names are often misleading (see below) and differ from region to region. A serious plant guide should use the scientific name for indexing and captions. Case in point: to me, a cholla is Cylindropuntia. How come that there are multiple \\"chollas\\" in the book that are clearly a type of Opuntia, or prickly pear cactus?4. Ms. Epple states that the book does not contain descriptions of weeds and grasses. What makes a weed a weed? A weed is a weed only in the eye of the beholder, one person's weed is another person's treasured plant. I find this distinction non-scientific and misleading.Since I cannot find most plants on my property in this book, they must be either weeds, grasses, unidentifiable due to the size and type of the picture provided, or some other reason. This book gives information on plants that I was able to identify, but I do not recommend it as an identification guide."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"I was sadly disappointed when this arrived. I bought this because we're new to Arizona and wanted a book to help identity the trees, shrubs, cacti in our yard and neighborhood. It's almost impossible to do with this book. It identifies everything through its flower so if you're out of the plants' blooming season, you cannot identify it. Even when a plant is blooming, it's very difficult as there are only small pictures of the branches, not of the trees or bushes themselves. I'm going to donate it and buy a new one."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"Wish it were more complete, about 1/4 of Arizona plants.

A few of the most dominant species in the area were nowhere to be found in the book. The pictures did no justice either because they either showed just the flowers or just leaves. A whole picture of the plant would be nice for the amateur identifier. This book successfully embarrassed me in front of my friends. I was supposed to be real cool and identify the plants along our trail, instead we spent countless minutes frantically searching and coming to no real conclusions about what any plant was. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Plants of Arizona","review":"Arrived as expected, the pictures are all in color so identifying plants is made easier.

I had planned to use it to help identify plants in a burn area. I am glad I did purchase this item I was able to identify clearly over 50 of the 60 species I ran across in my study area. It not only contained species native to Arizona but also common invasive species. This book was a life saver I would not have been able to complete my thesis work without it. The other field guides I purchased where not as much help or completely useless to me.The book is ordered photographs first with page numbers for descriptions for you to id the plant with. The descriptions of the plants are clear and for the most part the photos of them are too. The book was also made well it survived being hiked around for several weeks in my backpack. Thrown onto the grown repeatedly during the day, often into plants and ask. It also survived being drowned, twice, when my water bottle leaked.My main faults with this book was that at times the only photo given for a species was the flower and when the plant you are looking at is not currently flowering a clear photograph of the leaves is a must. Also if you do not know ahead of time the difference between basal growth and so on it might not be as much help to you. The other fault is at times, this was a very rare mistake, and there was a photo of a plant that did not connect to a description in the book. It would be from the same family but not the plant identified in the photo.

Skimin explores the possibilities of this scenario, and it's up to the reader to decide if it makes any difference when an alternative personage resides in the Oval Office. If you know just the barest of facts about Custer, you'll find this book interesting. If you've done your homework and read &quot;Crazy Horse and Custer&quot; by Stephen Ambrose, you'll find the work intriguing. At the very least, it's stimulating food for historical thought.Unfortunately, the editing and/or proofreading job on the publication leaves a lot to be desired. When I started counting the number of times &quot;it's&quot; was mistakenly employed instead of &quot;its&quot; -- 17 -- I knew the styling was getting in the way of my enjoyment of the story. I also saw at least 11 spelling or grammatical errors; mis- or non-uses of dashes, hyphens, quotes, and question marks became too numerous to make note of. It's surprising that a commercial publisher can let that much slip by these days. For the reputation of the author, I sincerely hope the glitches are corrected if this title goes to paperback or to an additional printing."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this &quot;what if&quot; story of a successful Custer who seemed to be ahead of his time, and yet suffered from the same character defects as more recent leaders. While the details surrounding some of the lesser characters was a little tedious, it was a quick,interesting, and fun read. In the final analysis, Custer could not escape the Little Big Horn and, as with JFK, the promise of a great leader was not realized. Don't miss this book if you enjoy alternative history and Custer mythology."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"I have been reading alternative histories on and off since MacKinlay Kantor wrote &quot;If the South Had Won the Civil War&quot; several decades ago. The two key factors in any alternative history are (1) what happens differently to alter the flow of history and (2) what significant chances result from that alteration. Such stories are usually flawed because the first part becomes convoluted beyond belief, but that is certainly not the case with &quot;Custer's Luck,&quot; written by Robert Skimin with researcher William E. Moody. The pivotal moment is, of course, the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and the authors have George Armstrong Custer discover the true size of the Indian camp he is about to attack. So instead of continuing with his suicidal charge he reunites his elements of the 7th Calvary with those under Reno and Benteen. With a unified command Custer is able to compel Sitting Bull to surrender by employing his standard tactic, threatening the women and children. Therefore, instead of the newspapers being full of the massacre of Custer's troops on nation's Centennial, &quot;Long Hair&quot; is credited with a great victory. All of this is certainly plausible.Equally reasonable is the idea that Custer would then have been tapped to run for President in 1880. The main thrust of &quot;Custer's Luck&quot; is therefore going to be what happens to the destiny of America with Custer in the White House. If you have a reasonable grasp of American history--and there is no reason to be reading these types of books if you do not--then half the fun is recognizing where and when the authors are lifting ideas and events. This goes from such relatively minor things as the court-martial of a black West Point cadet to Custer insisting the U.S. cannot afford to be Isolationist, the political philosophy that was the flaw in American diplomacy throughout the 20th century. Ultimately, &quot;Custer's Luck&quot; wants to have the United States try to begin that century the way it ended it, as the preeminent military and political power on the planet. Consequently, Custer fast-forwards the nation in terms of developing a strong navy, building the Panama Canal, provoking a war with Spain over Cuba, and even supporting women's suffrage.The main sub-plot of the novel focuses on Red Elk, a young Sioux Warrior who vows over the dead body of his pregnant wife that he will kill &quot;Long Hair.&quot; Red Elk is a fictional character, originally created in Skimin's &quot;The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Big Horn.&quot; Given that previous novel along with the fact Moody is the editor of &quot;The Journal of the Little Bighorn Associates,&quot; it is not surprising that several of those who died with Custer--his brothers Tom and Boston, Myles Keogh, Mark Kellogg and William Cooke--are prominent throughout the novel. Even Frederick Benteen, never a Custer supporter, becomes a Congressman bent on derailing his former commander's ambitions. There are also some soap opera elements; at one point Custer even ends up in the arms of Lillie Langtry. But even before we get to Skimin's final postscript comment &quot;Any comparison to Camelot is in the mind of the reader,&quot; it is clear that John F. Kennedy is the major model for the Custer Administration and its theme of &quot;The New American Empire.&quot; After all, Custer puts brother Tom in a Cabinet post while his brother Boston is elected a Congressman, Libbie wants to fix up the White House and Custer has the government supporting the fine arts.I am perfectly willing to grant that many of the things Custer does in this novel could have been done at that time. I will even agree that a national hero such as Custer would have been after winning the Battle of the Little Bighorn could be swept to the Presidency (although Custer's narrow victory in the election does not ring true to me, even if the man was a Democrat). What I find hard to believe is that a President Custer would have been so visionary. When he works out diplomatic solutions to get both Geronimo and Sitting Bull back to their reservations, it is clear that Skimin and Moody are offering us a different Custer than the egotistical daredevil of history's current judgment. Then again, this only underscores that the character is ultimately only a device that allows the authors to shape their alternative America, so there is a logic to their alterations. However, the ending of &quot;Custer's Luck&quot; conveniently frees Skimin from having to finish what he has started. The significant changes that should be at the heart of this alternative history are therefore secondary to the parade of historical figures Custer and his cohorts encounter in the novel. To say the least, I find this to be an unsatisfactory way of concluding this story, essentially negating much of the momentum Skimin and Moody had in creating their alternate America."},{"Title":"Custer's Luck","review":"This book, which tells the story of a successful Battle of Little Bighorn, is painstakingly well researched. Obviously, researcher Bill Moody did his job; all the \\"players\\" of the Gilded Age fall into their obvious roles. The comparisons to JFK don't stop at the brothers in the government or the youthful (unfaithful) President and his pretty wife, though Skimin claims that the book is not intended to be compared to \\"Camelot.\\"The problem is that either Skimin is a terrible writer or his editors had it in for him.

Alternate histories fascinate me (as they do many readers) and although I'm happy to say that the author appears to have a good grasp of Custer as a personality and doesn't paint him as a heartless, Indian-hating, glory-grabbing brute (which is refreshing!), his style is extremely dry. The research is sound, but it's more like reading a history textbook than a novel.

This book gives you a feeling for the tremendous committment these workers had to improving the wages and working conditions in the plant. The book starts with the organizing effort in the late thirties and the resistance they met from management. It takes a break during the war when many of the leaders of the effort signed up to fight fascism in Europe. When they returned they renewed the struggle. But this time they had to fight not only manageemnt but also the internatonal leadership of the UAW which was being influenced by the advent of the Cold War. After a long and bitter strike the UAW seized control of the local, ousted the communist leadership of the local and settled with the company. Most of the key organizers never returned to work in the plant.The book closes with a reunion of the Local in the 1980's on the 50th Anniversary of its founding. The original president of the local is invited to return and given a warm reception by the younger members. He reminds them of his committment to a communist future by telling them that his leadership was based not so much on winning a few extra coins but rather on his vision of the future."},{"Title":"Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor","review":"Tens of millions of Americans -- perhaps 30 million -- do not have a bank account (including credit unions). The number has been going up, absolutely and proportionally, since the late '70s This should, in the \\"cashless society,\\" be an inconvenience.It is, but less so because of pawnshops and -- to a lesser extent -- check cashing businesses.In this 1994 study for the Russell Sage Foundation, short but meaty, economist John Caskey spends a good deal of his effort in exploding myths about pawnshops. Not all their customers come in because they have no place else to turn, although for the near-destitute and desperate, pawnbrokers will provide money when no one else will.The question is, would the poor be better off if the pawnshops were more strictly regulated. After all, they charge much more, if interest is calculated as a time-value percentage, than any other kind of lender, except maybe Louie the Leg. And the related CCOs (check cashers) charge much more for cashing a check than the (usually implicit) charge by a bank.On the whole, Caskey concludes, no. More regulations would drive pawnshops out of business, and since no one else would step in to provide lending accommodations for the unbanked, these people would have to turn to Louie.In many other countries there are low- or no-profit municipal pawnshops -- the Dorotheum in Vienna is over three centuries old -- but Caskey does not believe Americans would go for that.What they had gone for, and very obviously when he did his research in the early '90s, was pawnshops allowed to charge high interest rates. Surprisingly, the states that raised their limits were concentrated in the South and Mountain states, where there are now thousands of pawnshops. New York State had, in 1993, only a few dozen, about the same number as Hawaii with a population about 35 times smaller. But there are thousands in Texas.Although Caskey does not say so explicitly, he cites statistics in such as way as to leave the impression -- entirely correct -- that the explosion in the number of unbanked is correlated with the Reagan-Bush policies of destroying ordinary jobs and transferring wealth from the poor (who have little individually but substantial amounts in aggregate) to the rich.But he has to walk a fine line, because suggesting that some poor are that way because they are improvident would bring down the wrath of the do-gooding left. \\"I tread carefully in making these points,\\" Caskey writes, \\"because they are sensitive.\\"He concludes, however, that it is not poverty as such that keeps people (not all very poor) unbanked. Rather it is in large measure a tumultous income history. Periods of illness, joblessness or rootlessness cause payments to be missed, making people ineligible for cheaper (by the transaction) bank services -- whether cashing a paycheck or Social Security check or obtaining a small loan.He observes that of the aspiring poor (including many new immigrants), \\"the first financial asset of note that they acquire is a deposit account.\\"The comfortably off seldom understand how this works; Caskey himself, a bank and academic economist, did not; and he found little formal research on what he decided to call \\"fringe banks.\\" (With a sardonic twist that resonates a lot more in September 2008 than it did in 1994, he suggests that \\"private banks\\" for the wealthy could also be considered fringe banks.)I have spent many hours in the lobby of a pawnshop, watching the trade. Caskey has a good understanding of how it works, and who it works for. The key point is that while the imputed interest (counting fees as interest) sounds very attractive -- hundreds of percent annually -- for the pawnbroker, the tiny size of the loans (average about $55 in 1991) means that the absolute take per transaction is small for the lender, and the profit is also small, because of the high transaction costs.(Caskey missed that in the back office, away from the counter, pawnbrokers make very large -- up to six-figures -- loans, to people who, for one reason or another, don't want to deal with banks. The concept is the same: cash for a collateral (often real estate in the big deals) that is substantially larger than the loan amount. The geniuses of Wall St. and Washington could have usefully learned something from pawnbrokers, but pawnbrokers are downmarket and respectable people do not like to associate too freely with them. Caskey notes that, in a Newtonian reaction, many pawnbrokers cultivate an image as \\"mild social renegades.\\" Pawnshops look dowdy in part because a substantial amount of their customers are plain people who feel uncomfortable in plush bank lobbies.)Fringe banking is a complicated business -- not as complicated as mortgage banking has been made -- and not especially abstruse, but many of its drivers are not obvious, not even at first to an interested inquirer. The business has been around for thousands of years, and it has refined itself and changed itself to meet changing conditions, in ways that make sense, even if they offend ideas of rightness among people who never faced an empty gas tank and no way to pay for five gallons.\\"Fringe Banking\\" is an excellent overview, and Caskey's recommendations for making regulations more useful (not more onerous) are so well thought out that pawnbrokers could hardly object.He hoped, in writing his little book, to set off a revolution in public understanding, but it didn't happen. Not enough people read his book, and the ignorant complaints about usury and abuse -- which exist but not to the extent or in the form the critics think -- are even more loudly bruited about today than they were 15 years ago."},{"Title":"Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor","review":"This book offers a good analysis of the sector.

They were often taken in razzias from Muslim states such as Zanzibar (see Ibn Battuta in Black Africa). Many of these Zanj were taken to the Mesopotamian region of Iraq and put to work on giant agricultural \\"plantations\\" and in mines.The Zanj were involved in a number of insurrections, all of which were failures - until they joined the uprising formed by Ali b. Muhammad, a non-Zanj, non-black Muslim. Although the Zanj made up a large part of the revolutionary forces, few Zanj (unlike the black leaders of Maroon colonies in Jamaica, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba and etc.) had any real power in the new revolutionary state. Still, their continuing adherence to the state (which, as Popovic tells us, included black soldiers who defected from the Caliph's and local leaders' forces) tells us that they preferred society under the non-black Ali's dictatorship to slavery in the fields and mines. On the other hand, as with many western maroon colonies, the Zanj and others had no problem taking goods and slaves from (and making slaves ofthe local population).The nascent civilization continued to grow for many years, until the Caliph decided he had the time and resources to make a concerted effort to destroy Ali b. Muhammad's young kingdom. Using a combination of force and amnesty, the official government quickly began driving Ali's forces back into the swampy areas south of Basra and eventually drove the remnants of the rebellion to the rebel capitol. Within a few years, the \\"Zanj\\" Revolt was over and Ali bin Muhammad was dead.This historical, social and anthropological study of the Zanj Revolt stands with Price's MAROON SOCIETIES as an important study of the development of government, customs, and social status in societies generally - as well as a study of a rather interesting aspect of the black diaspora caused by slavery."},{"Title":"The Revolt of African Slaves in Iraq in the 3Rd/9th Century (Princeton Series on the Middle East)","review":"The Zanj revolt is a fascinating moment during the nadir of the Abbasid caliphate. The slave-revolt resulted in a state that eventually minted its own money and enslaved their former Arab master, but the extended revolt was also one that was the result of large number of extremely bloody massacres--mostly able to do so because the caliphate was too busy with the Saffarids to the East at the time. It's not a nice moment either in the history of central caliphate or in world history generally.The preface to the English translation states that comments deemed too scholarly were deleted, glosses for the non-specialist added, transliteration simplified, and references ammended. However, the end result is an indecipherable, insipid transliteration system which the translator was often too lazy to at least anglicize (French differs greatly often from English transliteration of Arabic), useless bibliography and notes, and a stilted wooden translation.Honestly though, this is a mere frustrating technicality. The sole virtue of the book must be that it is the only one dedicated exclusively to the revolt of the Zanj in Southern Iraq. However, its analysis-free, anallistic, stream of consciousness narrative makes an extremely interesting topic vapid and bland. Insofar as it adds little to nothing to the Arabic sources, such as al-Tabari and al-Mas'udi, there is little reason to read this account rather than going strait to the sources. Both Tabari's Annales (in print) and Mas'udi's Prairies of Gold (not in print) are in English. I would only recommend this book if someone was possessed of an ambition to understand the revolt of the Zanj, not for example a general reader interested in the history of slavery generally or only with reservation for a person interested in the history of Islam and the slave-trade/revolts."},{"Title":"The Revolt of African Slaves in Iraq in the 3Rd/9th Century (Princeton Series on the Middle East)","review":"\\". . . an extremely important book.\\"-David Brion Davis, Yale University, author of Slavery and Human ProgressBOOK REVIEWRevolt of African Slaves in IraqThe revolt of African slaves in Iraq, led by a certain 'Ali b. Muhammad, created turmoil in the heartland of the 'Abbasid caliphate for almost two decades (255-70/869-83). It was one of those rare events in medieval Islam in which genuine social and economic issues are detectable, with elements of class and race thrown in for good measure. This should make it of almost irresistible interest to modern historians; indeed, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in his introduction to this volume compares the Zanj revolt, rather generously, to the insurrections of Spartacus and Toussaint L'Quverture (p. xi).This book was first published in French as R&eacute;volte des Esclaves en Iraq (Paris, 1976). In it, Alexandre Popovic collected and judiciously evaluated all the extant source material on the revolt and surveyed its treatment in modern accounts. His account showed that the available evidence is far too meager and fragile to support grandiose world-historical theories about the Zanj revolt but, ironically, is extensive enough to bring out its many paradoxes, ambiguities, and shortcomings. It was a revolt by oppressed slaves who, once free, had few scruples about owning slaves themselves. The revolt initially had, but quickly transcended, an ethnic character (attracting peasants, Bedouin, and others). It was a vehicle of social struggle, but also of simple banditry and terrorism. It is uncertain whether the leader of the revolt, 'Ali b. Muhammad, was an Arab or a Persian and whether he infused the revolt with a Shi'ite or a Kharijite ideology or ideas of any other character. Furthermore, it is difficult to say whether the revolt was responsible for weakening the 'Abbasid caliphate, or was, itself, the outgrowth of the weakness of the caliphs and the unique circumstances of the 3rd/9th century. Although the revolt was radical and revolutionary, it seems to have lacked clear objectives and vision. As Popovic notes, it cannot be said to have affected the course of Islamic history or its social structure in any significant way (p. 154).Popovic's original study in French has been widely accepted as a standard study of the Zanj.The following review appeared in the July/August '99 issue of CHOICE:The Zanj revolt, centering around an uprising of East African slaves in the Tigris-Euphrates delta, lasted from 869 to 883 in and around Basra, and was one of the events that contributed to the late-9th-century crisis of the Abbasid caliphate. Its leader. Ali b. Muhammad, known as Sahib-I zanj (\\"Master of the Zanj\\"), claimed to be an Arab Alid from Rayy, but it is surmised that he was probably a Persian mawla (i.e., client) with a spurious genealogy reminiscent of that most celebrated clandestine agent, Abu Muslim. But why did the revolt drag on for so long? The government in Baghdad was caught unaware, at a time when the Tulunids in Egypt and the Saffarids in the east were virtually independent, the Shiite Carmathians were threatening Iraq itself, and al-Mutamid, the caliph when the revolt broke out, was a poltroon. Fortunately for Baghdad, his brother al-Muwaffaq and the latter's son, al-Mutadid, worked tirelessly and successfully to crush the uprising. Alt b. Muhammad was killed in the final battle; his head preceded al-Muwaffaq's triumphal entry into Baghdad. Basra, however, never recovered its former prosperity. First published in Paris in 1976, this is a monograph in the best tradition of French Islamic scholarship. Graduate, faculty. - G. R. G.

Although the event played a key role in everything from the fall of the Abbasid caliphate to changes in trade routes throughout the Indian Ocean, historians have shied away from studying it because the only real source we have is the chronicle of al-Tabari.Popovic has collected the fragments of al-Tabari which touch upon the revolt, and sought to provide some analysis. However, it is sometimes difficult to see the basis of his conclusions, and there are many issues which he does not explore, such as a possible ethnic connection between the African troops of the caliph who joined the rebels and the Zanj themselves. He also tends not to touch the broader impact of the revolt mentioned above. The religious ideology of the movement also needs further scrutiny.Nonetheless, for a general reader interested in this little corner of history, Popovic can provide the details in a readily accessible form."},{"Title":"The Revolt of African Slaves in Iraq in the 3Rd/9th Century (Princeton Series on the Middle East)","review":"Who does not wonder the fate of the millions of Slaves sent taken from East Africa by Arab slavers from the 7th century to the present.

Powers (Professor of Biology, Northwest Nazarene University, Nampa - Idaho) is a narrated story of observations by Professor Powers as he watched the nesting and daily habits of the ferruginous hawk - a shy bird that is the largest hawk in North America. From a battle between a pair of hawks, to the travails of a hawk mother who strives to raise her young, to the loss of a hawk chick, and more, A Hawk In The Sun is fascinating, informative reading, and very highly recommended for ornithologists, bird watchers, and anyone else who is keen to learn more about the life and habits of these fascinating feathered raptors."},{"Title":"A Hawk in the Sun: Adventures Studying Hawks","review":"Leon Powers is a truly rare find. Few professional scientists have Power's ability to communicate to the lay person in such natural manner. In this book he is able to bring his reader into the lives of these magnificent yet little understood animals. He also provides a taste a what the life of a research biologist is like. From the sweltering heat inside a small blind to the shear frustration of simply trying to locate a ground nest only to see it \\"eaten\\" in front of his eyes. Yet he does this in a style anyone can read. A previous reviewer referred to words that \\"evaporate off the page\\". This really is true. If you are interested in birding, ornithology, natural history or simply curious about the world around us; this is a fine read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Hawk in the Sun: Adventures Studying Hawks","review":"In the 1970s, the author was a graduate student at Idaho State University, working toward his PhD in Zoology. He wrote a 300-page dissertation on ferruginous hawks. This book is a shorter, less-scientific version of that dissertation.Ferruginous hawks are the largest hawk in North America. They are also very shy birds, so they are considered a good barometer for measuring the encroachment of man. Flying away, and abandoning a nest, if people get too close, is possible for them. The author chose to study ferruginous hawks because so little was known about them.Several nests in southern Idaho and northern Utah were chosen for observation. Some nests are set up in juniper trees, only a few feet off the ground, and some are set up on the ground. Most of the observations had to be done from blinds set up a couple of hundred yards away. The nests are big, anywhere up to several feet across. The hawks, especially the chicks, have developed ways to deal with the sun beating down on their nests (there is no shade nearby). The nests in the trees are not high enough to prevent attacks by predators, especially coyotes, as the author observed one day.A couple of times, while the adults were away, Powers would climb up to the nests and feed the chicks miniature transmitters. These were intended to measure their internal body temperatures. After excretion, the transmitters were not found at the base of the trees, as expected. Adult hawks pick up bones, caracsses and droppings, and deposit them several hundred yards away, so the smell will not attarct predators. For a time, there was a shortage of jackrabbits (the main food source for the hawks) in the area. Powers was interested in seeing if the hawks would make do with whatever they could find as substitutes, like snakes, rats and lizards.This is a really interesting book. The author's passion for his work and \\"his\\" hawks shows through everywhere. For those interested in nature and the environment, whether actively or of the armchair variety, this is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"A Hawk in the Sun: Adventures Studying Hawks","review":"Not since the publication of Konrad Lorenz's King Solomon's Ring, has a book of natural history come along, which more completely bridges the gap between the language of the interested lay person and university trained animal behaviorist, than does A Hawk in the Sun.This book is so readable that the words literally evaporate off the pages. It unravels not only the cognitive mechanisms of pure scientific naturalistic research, but also the less often recognized spiritual connection one invariably makes with one's own research, in such a way that the reader finds him or herself crouching beside the author, sweating together with him under the hot sun, agonizing with him over the death and predation of young hawks, marveling with him at the majesticness of the hawk and the surrounding desert landscape, together embracing a spiritual journey of religious magnitude.The reader of Hawk in the Sun cannot help but learn a great deal about the behavior of the ferruginous hawk from this slender tome. More importantly however, the reader will gain valuable insight into animal behavior as a whole and will attain knowledge of several key concepts in the study of animal behavior which heretofore were too cumbersome and scientificated for the average layperson.As a high school biology teacher, who is always looking for books which make the study and understanding of natural history and research more approachable for his students, I have decided to incorporate this fine treatment of nature into my own curriculum. I am certain that my students will learn and experience the thrill of biological discovery just as I and hundreds of other students have from the incomparable Dr. (Uncle Leon) Powers.

The book is a must read for all current and prospective entrepreneurs if for no other reason than it will make them understand better the irrational tradeoffs they often have to make to keep their businesses going because of resource constraints. It is an invaluable book for students of entrepreneurship and business as well since it more clearly than any preceding book points out the complementary roles small start-ups, emerging businesses and big businesses play in keeping the economy vibrant. While I might not agree with Bhide in all details, such as the potential reaction of horses to the earliest Altair computers, I found the book to be a compelling read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"Bhide delves into the nature and dynamics of entrepreneurial firms and entrepreneurs. The purpose of this well-researched and highly detailed book is to integrate and present the authors ideas, developed over many years of study, to help individuals start and grow their own businesses. The work brings together the experiences of several hundred entrepreneurs to examine what these people do and to understand their role in the context of markets and the economy. The author also strives to explain entrepreneurial success, concluding that profitability in small business may be more a function of tactical hustle than solid long-term strategy; persistence may outweigh detailed planning in importance. These conclusions ring true to us based on our own organization and compensation consulting experience with entrepreneurial enterprises.The book addresses the nature of opportunities entrepreneurs pursue, their problems and tasks, traits and skills they need, and social and economic contributions they make. Comparisons are made between start-ups, evolving or transitional firms, and established enterprises. An engaging, thoughtful book. Highly recommended.

Unfortunately, even it lacked a grain of usefulness."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"There are two books here. The first book, on the origin of new businesses, is a tour de force. The second book, on the evolution of businesses from fledgling businesses to large enterprises, is not as satisfying. I will confine my review to the first book.The author gives us a new perspective on new business formation. He discusses five types:1. marginal businesses. These are hair salons, lawn care services, and other businesses that are simple and small-scale.2. promising businesses. These businesses also start out at a small scale, but they are much more complicated because they are launched in turbulent markets with high levels of uncertainty. You are going into a market before most people even realize that there is such a market.3. VC funded firms. These firms require more capital and a more solid business plan than promising new businesses.4. Revolutionary ventures. These are VC funded firms on steroids (the venture funding may have to come from large enterprises), who take large risks while aiming for large profits.5. Large enterprise innovation. Here, established companies launch new projects, which require large investments but have a high probability of success (think of Intel maintaining its lead in microprocessors).This is an excellent theoretical scaffolding, to which Bhide is able to attach many interesting insights. Some are statistical. For example, in a large sample of successful small businesses, only 12 percent thought that the originality of their idea was what produced success. The rest attributed their success to &quot;exceptional execution of an ordinary idea.&quot; p.32Other insights are anecdotal, such as the descriptions of how companies adapted to customer demands.If I were the type who used a highlighter to mark interesting passages, my copy of the book would be mostly yellow.With its solid theory, statistical support, and anecdotal color, this book sets a new standard for books about entrepeneurship. No professor of business can afford to ignore this work.General readers may find some faults with this book. If an academic tone puts you off, too bad for you. Go read &quot;Seven Habits in Search of Chicken Soup&quot; or something.Another shortcoming is that the Internet receives no real mention. Email me for references to some essays on Internet entrepreneurship that I think are fairly consistent with the thrust of this book.Overall, I give the book my strongest favorable recommendation."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"Amar Bhide has written a richly illustrated book about new and growing firms, drawing eclectically on many social science disciplines. Although he makes frequent references to economics, he often invokes explanatory factors from cognitive psychology and organization theory. His resulting model thus has a strong ring of behavioral plausibility. Unfortunately, he draws on a database that is simply inappropriate for answering his central question: why do a small fraction of startups turn into promising firms, whereas the great majority do not?Bhide committed a fundamental methodological error: he selected only successful firms and then tried to infer what differentiated them from the (non-selected) unsuccessful ones. He surveyed 100 founders of companies that appeared on the Inc. 500 list in 1989 and drew upon on several hundred case studies by his students at Harvard, plus cases of successful firms drawn from business periodicals and his own research. Although he shows some awareness of the methodological problem thus created, he nonetheless injudiciously draws strong inferences from empirical regularities among the successful firms.Why is such selection bias problematic? Consider a hypothetical study, showing that 20 percent of the successful firms in the financial services industry were currently run by Harvard MBAs, compared to only 10 percent by Stanford MBAs. Would we be entitled to conclude Harvard MBAs were twice as successful as those from Stanford? What if we learned that Harvard MBAs started 80 percent of the firms in the financial services industry, compared to only 1 percent for Stanford? And, that most of the firms started by Harvard MBAs had failed? Now we see that Stanford MBAs are highly over-represented among the successful firms, compared to the initial population of startups, and that Harvard MBAs are substantially under-represented. Without information on the initial cohorts of firms starting out in an industry, we are in great danger of engaging in superstitious learning of the kind that Bhide actually reviews in his book (research conducted by Camerer, Kahneman, Tversky, and others).By relying on information from firms that made it onto the Inc. 500 list or into the cases written up by his students, as well as on case histories of FedEx, Walmart, Microsoft, and other successful firms, Bhide cannot tell us why or how those firms got there. Only a research design that allowed him to follow startups and growing firms over time would give him the dynamic data he needs to answer the questions posed by his extremely interesting model."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses When Jann Wenner launched Rolling Stone magazine, he did no market research and considered himself merely an \\"amateur journalist.\\" When Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft, they had no business plan, only a brainstorm that they should write a program in the BASIC computer language.

Rather, they must be able to adapt quickly to changing business conditions, and they must enter industries in a state of upheaval, where established players are lacking. Bhide offers a revealing look at the characteristics that make for successful start-ups. In spite of his often-dense prose, Bhide gives plenty of real-world examples to illustrate his concepts. We [...] recommend this book to entrepreneurs and to those thinking of starting their own companies."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"Arnold Kling has an oustanding review of this book, but I wanted to add my two cents on the subject.Basically, Bhide provides interesting insights into the entrepreneurs themselves as well. Entrepreneurs can generally be divided into two types: 1) those that plan a venture very carefully, and 2) everyone else. The former group gets most of the press because they tend to be associated with VC funding, corporate partnerships, and eventually IPOs. Careful planning can be a prerequisite to funding, but as the book notes, VC funding, especially with the amount of capital available today, does not automatically mean things have been well thought out.In many ways, I am more intrigued by the latter group of entrepreneurs focused on the marginal businesses. They lack the pedigree (i.e. MBA education and experience) and resources, but create many more businesses. The real key is that these investments make sense. Unlike the current state of Internet investing, these entrepreneurs look to make low-risk bets (say $50,000 of money from family and friends), which can be turned into a big hit but also have limited downside risk."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"Entrepreneurship had long been neglected by academics and Bhide changed that with this classic book forever. While a bit outdated and of limited practical value, any serious entrepreneur will find loads of basics / fundamentals in the world of entrepreneurship.Bhide's concept of 'Investment, Uncertainty & Profit' is in my opinion a principle of entrepreneurship worth the price of the book. The concept has been used a lot and probably the best re-use / improvement was written by Keith McFarland in 'The Breakthrough Company', chapter Upping the Ante.This is a major book that changed the academic and professional work on how we think about entrepreneurship. Thus, many books have been using Bhide's finding extensively including 'Extradordinary Entrepreneurship', which is to me the finest and very best book for any hands-on entrepreneur."},{"Title":"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses","review":"When Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft, they had no business plan, only a brainstorm that they should write a program in the BASIC computer language.

Bhide makes excellent use of data to support his assertions, and this gives the book its academic flavor. But he also brings the subject alive with real world evidence and anecdotes. For example, he points to data that shows many entrepreneurs lack credentials one might expect to begin a successful business. He then explains a rational basis for the low credential (not to be confused with low skill) level of many entrepreneurs: that their opportunity cost is low because they \\"don't have the credentials and experience that could secure them highly paid employment.\\" Hence they have less to lose. \\"[I]ndividuals who face high opportunity costs...usually do not start small, boot-strapped ventures.\\" Entrepreneurs often even avoid the emotional costs of quitting satisfactory jobs.

Carey from Littleton, COWithin this book Sexton has translated and edited thirty-five Mayan folktales told to him by his friend Ignacio Bizarro Ujpan who is a Tzutuhil Mayan Indian living in a town along the shores of Lake Atitlan in the highlands of Guatemala. The tales related are witty, fun and serious and sometimes bring one up with a start. This is a delightful book to read, but along with being entertaining it is a demonstration of the value of folktales within the anthropological realm of the study of a culture.Analytical work such as Sexton has performed within the pages of Mayan Folktales, as he presents the tales for our enjoyment, also provides a window through which his audience can look to grasp a concept of Mayan thought and culture, modern and ancient. It has been a recognized fact since the 19th century that information exists within the midst of a vast floating body of folk traditions and practices which can add to the speculation of cultural origins, personality, values and attitudes.Sexton's Introduction is a story in itself and gives the reader the background needed to thoroughly understand and enjoy the tales, his Notes give additional needed explanations. This book is not only a delight to read, but is also demonstrates the rich source of cultural insight concerning obligations, beliefs, values and thought systems to be found in folklore about how a people rationalize political, religious, social and economic behavior."},{"Title":"Mayan Folktales: Folklore from Lake Atitln, Guatemala","review":"James Sexton has done it again with this engaging collection of folktales from the Lake Atitlan region of Guatemala, in Central America. Here are stories of corrupt authorities, sneaky thieves, desperate poor men and frightening supernatural beings that influence or outright control the lives of the Maya Indians. Sexton is an A+ editor who knows how to tell a rollicking good tale, and he has selected a couple dozen winners which give you a broad overview of many areas of Mayan life in the modern world. Folk tales take you into the imaginative life of a people, and these will show you Mayan hopes and dreams, fears and longings even as they weave stories of earth lords, intelligent animals and brave men trying to take care of their families in trying circumstances. If you're into the Maya this book is a must buy; if you're a lover of folktales this work will expand your repertoire of world cultures and introduce you to the Maya Indians; if you're a general reader here is a fun read that will remind you of Grimm's Fairy Tales and the oral tradition that the industrialized countries have all but lost.

That's where resources like thisSharp Grammar: Building Better Grammar Skills, one of the Kaplan Sharp Series, can be helpful.Just mentioning grammar to many is the cause for eye rolling, but it is the set of structural rules that govern the composition of phrases, clauses, and words in any given natural language. It's how we communicate with each other, and why it is so essential.This book asks the following question within its Introduction, and it's one that seemed to set the pace for the book: \\"Dear Reader, Is your writing plagued by runaway commas? Do you find you use fifteen words for a point you could have made in three?\\"Author Elizabeth Chesla and the editors have done an excellent job of putting this book together, and it has a very logical flow of topics, as can be seen here:SECTION I: Grammar and Sentence StructureHere we find the book broken down into chapters, covering such topics as: the parts of speech; sentence parts and patterns; verb forms and tenses; helping verbs and other tricky matters; subject-verb agreement; modifiers and their placement; sentence fragments and run-ons; and parallelism and active vs. passive voice.SECTION II: Style and UsageThe chapter topics here include: effective word choice; being appropriate; being concise; clear and engaging sentences; commonly confused words; and spelling, punctuation and capitalization.Each chapter in the two sections offers plenty of interaction on the part of the reader, and the correct answers are also posted so that it doesn't leave the reader hanging. For example, in Chapter 5, Subject-Verb Agreement, we find the following:Building Block Quiz: Choose the word or phrase that correctly fills in the blank.(We've tinkered with quotations to create the error.)> Example: Under a ragged coat ____ wisdom. --Romanian proverb> Choices: (A) lay (B) lie (C) lies (D) lays (E) lyingSome of the topics are offered as simple lessons. In Chapter 11, Being Appropriate, where pretentious, gender-free and politically correct terms are discussed, we find this:To avoid biased language, be extra careful when describing cultural groups and use terms that fairly and accurately describe the population.> Inappropriate: Raul is very proud of his Indian heritage.> Revised: Raul is very proud of his Navajo heritage. (Indian means from India.)There's a wide range of these examples and quizzes throughout this book. In Chapter 15, Spelling, Punctuation, and Capitalization, we find this:Building Block Quiz: Correct the errors (if any) in the following sentences.> Example: My father in law plays the violin.> Answer: Father-in-law should be hyphenated.Some of these may simple, yet others can be tricky. There are fifteen lessons covered in as many chapters, and this is no worn out tome using language from the early 20th Century as is found in so many books on grammar. As an example, this observation is made in Chapter 11, Being Appropriate, and it's a good one:\\"Jargon is technical language shared by those engaged in a shared activity--members of a certain profession or people who share a hobby. Computer experts can toss around such terms as compile, jpeg, and firewall and economists can speak to each other of aggregate demand and monopsony, but average readers are likely to be lost.\\"For this reader, the inspiration for looking into this book began with a quote that I had found in a particular book by a recognized and witty authority on the English language:\\"English grammar is so complex and confusing for the one very simple reason that its rules and terminology are based on Latin -- a language with which it has precious little in common. In Latin, to take one example, it is not possible to split an infinitive. So in English, the early authorities decided, it should not be possible to split an infinitive either. But there is no reason why we shouldn't, any more than we should forsake instant coffee and air travel because they weren't available to the Romans.\\"~ Bill Bryson, American writer, editor, and journalist,The Mother Tongue, 1990From a personal perspective,Sharp Grammar: Building Better Grammar Skillsin its Kindle edition is worthy of 4-star product. As much as I will often pick the eBook versions for convenience, one might be better picking theSharp Grammar: Building Better Grammar Skillsin its paperback format, as there are so many worthwhile exercises within the book as noted above. The paper copy is easily worth a 5-star recommendation.If runaway commas inundate your writing, or you're using fifteen (or more) words for a topic you could have stated in three, then this may be the book you want to consider.8/27/2012"},{"Title":"Grammar Source: The Smarter Way to Learn Grammar (Kaplan Grammar Source)","review":"It is great, awesome, and wonderful!

Cadfael has seen his share of the world before entering abbey life. He fought in the crusades and has known his share of women. Cadfael knows what he gives up by joining the abbey and what he has to gain.Ellis Peters offers us a completely likable sleuth, with Brother Cadfaiel and educates the reader about the time in England when Maud and Stephen fight for the throne. She presents characters with the human frailties familiar to the modern reader, but puts them in a twelfth century setting. We are able to learn the tension which exists between the Welsh and the English at the time.The mystery involves the death of an opponent to the moving of Saint Winifred from her home in Wales to Shrewsbury. The mystery itself is intriguing, but not mind boggling. It is the characters and the setting that draws the reader. We become involved in the politics of the abbey with monks vying for top position.This is an interesting and entertaining start of a series. Medieval fans should be delighted. For those who love cozies this is a good series to entertain and educate."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"The premise is interesting. A cloistered brother with a non-monastic past solves crimes in middle ages England. Further, this brother is imminently likable and pursues the solutions in a manner that keeps himself out of the spotlight. Instead, he nudges the investigations along and prompts clues and confessions upon others, suggesting lines of thought that allow others to claim insight. What a great main character.It's no wonder that Ellis Peters has dipped into this well about 20 times.I liked the book and I liked the writing. It wasn't monumental, it didn't change my life, but it was a quick and fun read and there are a lot of times when that's just what I need.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"\\"Brother Cadfael had long been up before Prime, pricking out cabbage seedlings before the day was aired, and his thoughts were all on birth, growth, and fertility, not at all on graves and reliquaries and violent deaths....\\" Thus we meet Ellis Peters' inimitable monk in the initial episode of her long-running Brother Cadfael series. \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" begins a series that has collected untold readers who feel that the series is also a crusade for themselves!It is the twelfth century and throughout Britain, thoughts are on the civil war that is going on between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, twelve years of internecine struggle that, as civil wars are wont to do, has deeply divided the people.And at the Benedictine monastery in Shrewsbury, Cadfael has settled down to a life of monastic devotion, following a career as a crusader to the Holy Land. His is a past that at first seems incongruent with the life of a monk, but God works Hiswonders in many ways, and, as no sinner is beyond God's mercy, as Cadfael likes to say, he has now found his place on earth. \\"(He) himself found nothing strange in his wide-ranging career, and had forgotten nothing and regretted nothing. He saw no contradiction in the delight he had taken in battle and adventure, and the keen pleasure he now found in quietude.\\"He is a specialist in medicinal herbs and is in charge of the herbarium; he is a man of God gifted in logic and fair-play; he is a man of great understanding and compassion; and he is no fool. In \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones,\\" Cadfael is assigned by his prior to lead a delegation to a small village in Wales to acquire the bones of their patron saint, Saint Winifred. As Cadfael was born in Wales and naturally speaks the language, he is the top choice of the priory. But retrieving the relics is no simple task, as Peters displays, and before long a murder is discovered. Cadfael's expertise comes in handy, as \\"his skills as a herbalist are matched by his prowess as a detective.\\" And with Peters' abilities as a Grade A novelist, the reader is kept spell-bound until the final pages of this medieval thriller, a story well-developed and strongly-paced. It is a literary journey well worth the price!The author is the recipient of the Crime Writers' Association/Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for her Cadfael books, and has written a number of other works, including her Inspector Felse series.Billyjhobbs@tyler.net"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I highly recommend this book and all the others in the Brother Cadfael mystery series.

At the risk of going against the grain of other reviewers here, I was left unimpressed in the end. The book had a very promising start but then bogged down in contrived dialogue to such a degree that I struggled to finish. This series seems to have a large fan base here at Amazon but it's evidently not for me. I gave it a shot but won't continue reading."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This is the first book in the Brother Cadfadel mysteries. I'd already read an introductory book of short stories featuring Brother Cadfadel, but this was my first Cadfadel novel.The brothers of his abbey decide that they need their own patron saint - Saint Winifred. And...they decide they also need to dig up her bones and bring them to their abbey. Cadfadel isn't too happy about this, preferring to let resting saints lie, but he goes along on the journey to serve as an interpreter.Of course, the locals where Saint Winifred is buried are not too happy about losing the bones of their saint, and of course...it leads to murder.Brother Cadfadel can speak with the locals and soon becomes their friend. He wants to solve the murder and serve the wishes of his new friends - making everyone happy if possible. The end result is happy, and in my opinion, funny!I have to admit, I did not like this book at first. (I think it was because I disliked nearly all the monks at the abbey!) But by the end I began to enjoy spending time with Brother Cadfadel. He surprised me with his antics and his willingness to see beyond the letter of the law. I will probably continue with this series at some point."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"If you're thinking about diving into Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series, don't think about it -- just dive in. This story is the first book in the series. I came upon this series (just finished the third book) when I needed an audio book for a car trip and grabbed a Cadfael from my local library. I'll admit that I don't care much for murder mysteries, but the Cadfael series is so much more. Its medieval setting is a facinating period I know little about and the writing and characters are extremely engaging. The only other mystery series I have read in full is Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and to her credit, Ellis Peters' Cadfael series can stand quite well on the same shelf. Soldier turned monk, Cadfael is a deeply human and humane figure. In speaking of The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael (as the series is known), Ellis Peters said:\\"...the writing of these books has given me more pure pleasure than anything else I have done..\\" May the pleasure now be yours as well!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"As with many books or stories that we get involve with, the characters and their relationships to others in the environment is an important as the mystery. Ellis Peters (Edith Pargeter) strikes a balance between the characters, history and the mystery. Sprinkled throughout is faith, and a chance that they (the monks) may be correct in the explanation of saints and how the world works.The external environment is the ongoing 11th century civil war between English King Stephen and his sister the Empress Maude. We also have references to the different societies as they travel to Wales. These become more relevant as the series progresses.The inward struggle between faith and power is depicted as an individual monk is persuaded or wants to be persuaded to go on a mission to retrieve a neglected saint \\"St. Winifred.\\" She lies in Wales and it happens that Brother Cadfael has a Welsh background, so he is charged with supporting the mission.If you saw the movie you will immediately see the differences between it and he book. One main point is the fact that the monk was cured before the trip. The best difference is reviled with the detection and solution to the mystery."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ellis Peters, but I'm glad to say that it delighted me enough to go on and buy the second. Cadfael is an excellently drawn character, irreverent and witty and sharp. Peters spends a good amount of time in the book setting up the situation, but he does such a good job of drawing the rival characters, the landscapes, and issues of saints and religion that the book grips you all the way through. Once the mystery element does arrive, the tension heightens exponentially. Peters does an excellent job of providing the reader with many viable murderers, thereby always keeping you guessing. That builds to a truly masterful climax where Peters uses elements we've been seeing throughout the book to reveal the killer in a totally unique way.To sum up, great book that held me all the way through and is making me look forward to reading the next."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Life is full of twists and turns...and so is &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones.&quot; This &quot;First Chronicle of Brother Cadfael&quot; is the first book in a long series of mysteries set in medieval England and Wales.I came to this book via Eugene Peterson's recommendation of the series in his book (actually a prolonged and annotated reading list) &quot;Take and Read.&quot; Peterson has rarely let me down, and did not do so here...this is a delightful book.&quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot; is a cut above most of the other mysteries I have read. It not only keeps the reader guessing until the end, but it also has passages that reflect a keen insight into human nature. More than that, it well written (a lot of mysteries feel so mass-produced and sketchy). The characters here are well formed and eloquent. All of this is done without the usual gratuitous gore so often found in such books.One of the more interesting subtexts to watch for are the different conceptions of forgiveness that the characters hold; these conceptions largely determine the actions of each one...something to ponder in real life.I recommend &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot; to all those who enjoy absorbing and well written mysteries. I look forward to the other Chronicles of Brother Cadfael."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Having been introduced to Cadfael by Mystery Theater (I blush to admit I watch the tube...occasionally), I was pleasantly surprised to find the books so much richer and well developed than the relatively faithful television renderings. I've read all twenty Cadfael Chronicles--twice--and urge prospective readers to start here and go through them in order. Some of the background plots make more sense. That said, each stands admireably on it's own feet, so read whatever you find.Peters' fault, perhaps, was that she was a writer of formulaic mystery novels...of which these are. Long before there's even a body, you will usually have figured out who will be accused, who will really have done it, and who the romantic interest of that particular tale is/are. No matter. Medieval Shrewsbury is rendered by the late \\"Ellis Peters\\" with enough care and wit to provide many a good evening's reading. That Cadfael is a thoroughly post-modern man helps us find our way through a time and culture which we probably wouldn't recognize otherwise. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This first book in the Brother Cadfael Chronicles is interesting for its history, fascinating for its characters and consuming for its mystery.

I thought this book Was really good also. Brother Cadfael is a very enjoyable character and, I'm getting a great mystery and learning something about 12th century England at the same time."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This story takes place in Britain toward the middle of the 12the century, less than a hundred years after the Norman Conquest, so the several groups involved have not had time or chance to assimilate into what we know as the British People.Right from the first few pages the reader is captivated by the author's character description and analysis in terms of ethnic origin. The Welsh are innocent, hard-working and faithful. Normans are arrogant, duplicitous, cunning and effete. Saxons are sober, vigorous, reflective and intelligent.Seeking to improve its status among the faithful and fill its coffers, an English Benedictine monastery sends a delegation of monks to a Welsh village to bring back the bones of Saint Winifred. Her relics are sure to turn the monastery into a center of pilgrimage.But the villagers are not anxious to relinquish the bones of the maiden saint who has protected them for so long. The leader of the opposition is murdered while the monks are still in the village trying to convince them. Most the the remainder of the plot is occupied with solving the crime and restoring peace to the village. Brother Cadfael, the level-headed monk who accumulated plenty of worldly experience before entering monastic life, is the Benedictine who functions as detective.This book can be recommended to just about anyone, but especially to those who enjoy stories set in the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I came to the world of Cadfael rather backwards. First I watched all the Brother Cadfael BBC/PBS productions, then I became interested in the books. Because of this aproach, when I read this book, I already knew the outcome. This gave the book less suspense than it would have had otherwise. However, I really enjoyed this book and the ending was just different enough from the video to give to make it interesting. The sections of character description were especially enjoyable to someone very familiar to them from the videos."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This novel is one of two by Ellis Peters that I've now read. But I'm hooked! Although I've only read a couple of this series about the medieval detective Cadfael, my appetite has been whetted, and I'm certain to read more!Peters' command of the English language is outstanding, as is her precise portrait of medieval times. The intriguing element of mystery that makes detective Cadfael's presence essential to the plot clinches this novel as a romping success.If you enjoy mystery, as well as a writer's ability to make excellent use of the English language with colourful descriptions, you are sure to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Since I like to start long-running series at the beginning so I can observe character development over time, I had never read a Brother Cadfael novel. I thought the first half of the book started out rather slowly and the characters were rather formulaic. There is a great deal of description of scene, setting, physical descriptions of people but no real speculations on their inner lives. Since the story is told from the point-of-view of Cadfael, this seems apt when he meets someone new but characters he is supposed to have known for some time are treated rather shallowly. One hopes for more as the series progresses. Good use of historical detail, particularly on the uses of poppy oil and medieval superstitions about touching the dead. Part of the ultimate solution to the mystery was apparent to me early on; clues were laid on rather heavy-handedly. Overall a promising start, but in my opinion, only that, a start."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"A decent period detective story, very English style, so to speak. You have an avuncular, likable, main character, who is sharper than he appears to those around him, and uses that to his advantage. A bit Middle English Midsomer Murders, almost, you could say, but that sort of style."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I decided to start with this first Brother Cadfael novel after being intrigued by some comments I read about the series on the Internet. It does have its good points. Cadfael seems an interesting character and I hope to gain a clearer picture of him as I read the successive novels. The setting is serene by day and somewhat mysterious by night. The fear that a corpse would bleed when touched by its murderer was a good point, but not completely accurate. It was indeed believed that a body would bleed in the presence of the murderer, but touching wasn't necessary and bleeding need not happen when the murderer touched the corpse-it only happened sometimes. Hence, Peredur's reaction is a bit much. But just to have this little known point in the book, although inaccurately described, made this historian smile. I hope the other novels feature other interesting historical tidbits that may interest the lay reader.The bone I have with the novel (pun somewhat intended) is with the character Sioned. I could not find myself cheering for her as the author clearly intends the reader to do. We see her mainly as a kind of revenge figure, a hard, determined figure. Just a little more character development was needed here to get away from this hard, one-sided view of her.Nevertheless, I think there are elements here for this reader and other readers to get hooked on the series. But perhaps since this novel was not exactly a page-turner, a reader should start with another in the series."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Having just visited the Abbey at Shrewsbury, the setting for the Cadfael books, and having had a guide who was very knowledgable about the Cadfael books, I read this one on the plane back to the USA and was enthralled. One warning: the Cadfael series on TV was filmed in Hungary, and TV's 'Shrewsbury Abbey' looks nothing like the real thing."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I loved this book. Don't mistake it for Michael Crichton or Ken Follett. It is not. The pace is slower, the details clearer and more precise. You can learn something of the habits of the Middle Ages. Brother Cadfael, having lived a \\"worldly\\" life as a crusader, and having travelled the world, enters an abbey at an advanced age. This gives him an edge when mysterious things happen. Yes, some of his fellow monks are portrayed somewhat unkindly as dolts, yet, if I look around me, not everyone in the 21st century is equally well equipped. For me, that makes it more believable. One of his most endearing qualities is his inventiveness... I fairly dote on him!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"After reading another in the series I wanted to read them all so I purchased the first. It is not important to read them in order, but it makes the rest of the mysteries even more interesting. Brother Cadfael is sent to Wales on an errand he does not particularly like. Being an obedient monk he goes with others from the abbey to obtain important sacred relics, bones of a saint. As we might imagine there is a murder which Brother Cadfael solves."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This is a fun and entertaining story--nothing more or less than that--and it gets 4 stars for the simple reason it delivers on that implicit promise.Lots a period detail that rings true. But more importantly, the story is peopled with characters I want to revisit in the series' later books."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I like the character of Cadfael, who has come to the order later in life with a full history of experience behind him. There are interesting secondary characters and subplots that don't overshadow the primary mystery, and a clever the twist at the end. The book is well written, unpretentious and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"A good friend recommended this character to me, and claimed that once I had encountered what he called &quot;Cadfael-humour&quot;, I'd be hooked! How true this was! Cadfael is a monk after my heart! - This is truely my new hero! And it has given me something to read on these long, dark and bitterly cold nights we have here in Denmark! I give my new hero the warmest of recommendations, - and promise that I will read all of the chronicles!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"An English monastery's plan to bring back the bones of a Welsh saint runs into a deadly complication in this undemanding mystery. The setting, medieval England and Wales in the early 12th Century, is no obstacle to enjoying the stroy since the author provides all the historical background and the reader need only supply a little imagination. I found &quot;Bones&quot; worth my while largely because of the vivid characterizations and the way it brings the Middle Ages to life. One detail I especially liked was that Brother Cadfael had no regrets about his former life as a soldier in the Crusades. Quick take: While it keeps your attention, &quot;Bones&quot; won't make you stay up half the night to finish it."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I can't say that I'm a big fan of medieval mysteries, though I've read many of them either as stand-alones or as parts of series. I read this novel, A Morbid Taste for Bones, when it was first published, and I was very impressed by the main character, Cadfael, a former soldier, now a monk. Cadfael has known both the secular and religious worlds. He is a gardener, herbalist, and healer. But more than that, he is extremely observant, not given to climbing the social (in this case religious) order, courageous, and truthful.In addition, I think that Ellis Peters writes the best medieval fiction I've ever read. Her sentences flow effortlessly, her novels are short and succinct with no verbiage, and -- this is extremely important -- she makes the setting (which includes the historical time, the people and their clothing and social standings, the food, the roads, the means of transportation, the beliefs both religious and secular) come alive. There is no other historical fiction I've read that reads as \\"real\\" as does the Cadfael series.In this particular book, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury Abbey and Columbanus, who is highly ambitious, conspire to make it seem that a trip to St. Winefride's Well in North Wales has cured Columbanus from an affliction and that St. Winefride wants her bones (interred in North Wales) moved to another place, a place where pilgrims will come to visit her bones and be cured of their afflictions. Naturally Prior Robert and Columbanus think that Winefride wants her bones moved to Shrewsbury Abbey.From this beginning follows a trip to Wales to retrieve the bones. Cadfael gets himself invited as part of the entourage because he, being Welsh, speaks the language fluently. The townspeople of Gwynedd, where the bones are interred, oppose the removal of the bones. What results is intrigue, two sets of young lovers and rivals, and murder. It is, of course, Cadfael who uses his knowledge of death, dead bodies, and herbs to solve the murder. A very satisfying book."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Premise: Brother Cadfael has been many things in his long life, but now he is content to tend the garden in Shrewsbury Abbey. When the ambitous Prior Robert proposes a journey to acquire Saint Winifred's bones for the Abbey, Cadfael gets himself invited along as Welsh translator. What they find in the quiet village of Gwytherin involves a lot more scandal and murder than Prior Robert was anticipating, and Cadfael sets himself to discovering the truth.I loved this book. The characters are colorful and entertaining, and Cafael in particular is wonderful to follow. I found his practical, grounded attitude - born of being an old campaigner - completely irresistible. The plot is twisty, with an appropriate number of red herrings and revelations, a good balance of adventure, romance and humor, and the ending feels both completely unexpected and absolutely appropriate.Plus it's a medieval mystery about a crime-solving monk. There wasn't much chance that I was going to dislike this book.I watched the television series adapted from this book as a teen, and I remember loving it, but I hadn't gotten around to the books until now.A few other notable things:In this case I liked how long it took the book to get to the mystery. The setting and characters were compelling enough even before the plot picked up.I thought this book had a great balance between mysticism and realism. It never failed to amuse me when Cadfael would privately question the political motivations behind this holy vision or the reality of that superstition. Given that baseline, the few maybe-unexplained phenomena were just part and parcel of the medieval setting."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This is great mystery. Brother Cadfael tackles an odd set of circumstances and does so in way that a reader is at times baffled, but never bored. Peters' ability to invoke such a different time and place in a believable way is astounding."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Brother Cadfael, a Benedictine monk who came to the order at mid-life after years as a sailor and soldier, enjoys the peace of the Abbey at Shrewsbury in medieval England. The devotional antics of Brother Columbanus annoy him only mildly, although as the abbey's de facto medic Cadfael has the job of taking care of Columbanus after the younger man's ecstasy renders him senseless. Cadfael isn't as comfortable with what follows, when Columbanus declares that a Welsh saint - Winifred - has appeared to him in a vision. For now nothing will do but for Prior Robert to journey into Wales and bring Saint Winifred's bones back to shelter at Shrewsbury. Cadfael, a Welshman born, must go with the party because he will be needed as translator.Prior Robert finds it surprising that the Welsh residents of Winifred's region do not want her removed. Although he has the approval of both Church and secular higher authority, he is obliged to try to persuade the locals that what he wants to do is right; and that means persuading Rhisiart, a landowner to whom others turn as their natural spokesman. When someone murders Rhisiart, the local folk immediately suspect their visitors. Sorting it out falls to Cadfael, who develops a fatherly friendship with Rhisiart's daughter and heir, and who hopes that Brother John - a young monk who should never have taken vows - may find both love and freedom in this place.I've put off introducing myself to this historically accurate mystery series for years, because I did not take to the PBS adaptation (at all) when I tried to watch an installment of it. But now that I've finally read the first book, I intend to read as many as I can find. The setting is impeccably rendered, the social and economic fabric of time and place are essential to the story, and the characters have just the right mix of flaws and admirable traits. I enjoyed the read thoroughly.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Though thisstory was set during mediaevaltimes, in an atmosphere involvingBenedictine monks and Christianliturgical practice, I detected no love on the author'spart of the subject matter at all.She merely used it as a background setting fora mystery.Thus it was a chore to plod throughthe book, as meanwhile the authoris seemingly snickering at these&quot;backward&quot; ignorant monks.All except the hero, of course, who magicallyjust turns out to be modern-mindedand liberal, (very similar to the characterBrother William, that Umberto Ecoused in The Name of The Rose,to ridicule mediaeval thought).In other words it is a dead giveaway: straightout of the 20th century. Such an incongruitybetween the atmosphere and the main characterbecame a constant distraction and irritation.I do not recommend this book,nor am I moved to read herother works in this series."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I only listen to audio cds I have listened to many mysteries and enjoy some historical mysteries. I found the overall story line good but was so slow pace at times.I really had trouble finishing it. BUT I was determined to.This story reminds me of WORLD WITHOUT END by Ken Follet which I would give a 5 star to and his other in the series THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH I would rate 4star to.I know we don't all like the same books but if you like this story A MORBID TASTE FOR BONES you will absolutely LOVE the two by Ken Follet.I will not be buying anymore of Ellis Peters. Maybe his later books are a bit more up beat I hope so for his sake. Please so try this story and see what you think."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Ellis Peter's first Cadfael murder mystery takes as its setting the events surrounding the translation of the holy relics of Saint Winifred from the remote Welsh village of Gwytherin to the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury in 1138. Taking this real event as her starting point, Peters weaves an enchanting if rather overly romanticised tale of mediaeval rural and monastic life. Naturally, the practical common sense and basic human decency of her very worldy central character, Brother Cadfael, win out in the end. Here, he neatly side-steps all of many power-struggles - secular, political and ecclesiastical - going on around him, to provide everyone with their heart's desire and solve the inevitable murder mystery into the bargain! Ellis Peters' writing style is so wonderfully erudite that one can always forgive her the occasional lapse into stereotypical characterisation or silliness of plot which tend to pepper her novels. &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot; is no exception in this regard, and whilst the story's central murder mystery is not at all hard for the reader to solve, the telling of it is so captivating that the book is hard to put down until it's finished!Incidentally, I would recommend reading this book before any others in the series, because otherwise you will know which of the main suspects can be eliminated immediately! Of course, if you've seen the TV dramatisation, you'll know the main outcome already, but even then, the book is sufficiently different to still make it well worth reading. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"A Morbid Taste For Bones is the start of a 20-book series about Brother Cadfael. The Cadfael books are absorbing reads, as others here have stated. I would like to add that you will enjoy the series so much more if you read the books in order. They chronicle the decade of civil war in England, between the factions of King Stephen and the Empress Maud. The books always have the ongoing story of this, in a little history lesson, usually at the beginning of the book. It can be complicated history for those coming to it, as I did, uninformed. But we are taken through the war years with these stories, and in chronological order, they tell the story of the civil war, along with the mystery of each book.Also, the characters and their relationships develop along the way. Hugh Beringer comes into the picture early in the series and eventually becomes deputy to the sheriff, who is loyal to King Stephen. Hugh and Brother Cadfael begin their relationship with suspicion, but they come to respect each other for the intelligence and integrity each has. Hugh meets and marries Aileen, has a baby boy, and, around the ninth book, becomes the sheriff of Shrewsbury. By this time Cadfael and Hugh are fast friends.Cadfael has his own secrets, little episodes of his life in the Crusades, that catch up with him during the series...but not right away. Later in the series, Cadfael confides in his dear friend Hugh, also relating the secret of this first book, Morbid Taste For Bones, which Hugh had not been privy to before.I just loved this series, and I tend to think of it as one *really big* book! So do read all 20, and read them in order. They are all available, and all except one (The Hermit of Eyton Forest, no. 14) tell which number it is in the order, right on the front cover. Brother Cadfael is one of the most endearing characters ever created. Lose yourself with him in 12th century England when you need a break from the 20th or 21st century."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I have read the first ten books in this series (mostly) in order, and would recommend doing so. Otherwise, you'll miss referneces to previous incidents of importance, and also lose a sense of continuity. Reading the series in order also allows you to enjoy the development of Cadfael's character and other characters who continue to appear throughout the series. Be advised, however, that most of those characters don't make their appearances until later books.This first mystery serves as an excellent introduction to Cadfael himself, the historical backdrop of medieval England and Wales, and the general literary pattern of the Cadfael stories. It is a pleasant and enjoyable read for those who don't necessarily need their mysteries to be of the noir persuasion and who have a love of history. The title is a little bit deceiving, tempting you to think the story is more violent than it is - though there is certainly a murder to be solvedRead it, and begin a pleasant and long-standing association with Brother Cadfael."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"My girlfriend has a huge stack of these books on the bookcase, so I decided to take a gander at them. After consulting her which was first (I did not realize they were labeled), I dived into the first book.As the story unfolded, I found myself introduced to an interesting cast of characters. Some likeable. Some not. Detail varies depending on how central they are to the story. Nevertheless, I did not feel that any of them were bland. Cadfael is a curious rogue of a character who has his elder years to temper him. John is mischievous and good intentioned. Robert is pompous, well composed and intelligent, while having good qualities such as being charitable and forgiving (most of the time). Peters is able to characterize in broad strokes or narrow detail as necessary. I was duly impressed.Now the core of the mystery is the murder, and I found that did not happen until halfway through the book. I did not find myself lacking for it though. There is enough going on that you are curious about the plotting and the discoveries that take place.Peters' setting is fantastic. Yes, she is drawing upon the historical past, and in a way, it is already made for her. However, she is good at communicating it to us without loosing us in the language. Neither does the language sound modern. She meets us in a middle ground with emphasizes the style of the setting while not loosing us along the way.The book is very good, and I look forward to picking up the next. It is also brief. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in any manner of fiction. It would appeal to mystery readers, those interested in speculative settings or even someone who does not lean toward any genre. The book should appeal to all."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"In a number of visions, a young monk of the Benedictine abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul at Shrewsbury believes he has encounters with St. Winifred, in her earthly life a girl from a remote Welsh village decapitated by an evil-spirited nobleman. The saint, Brother Columbanus claims, tells him she is unhappy with the lack of care and dedication her grave receives from the local village folk, and wishes to be relocated nowhere else but to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. After a heated discussion over the appropriateness and dangers of such an excursion, the monks decide to mount an expedition to Wales to save the maiden saint's bones.Thus begins the first of what would ultimately come to be twenty Chronicles of Brother Cadfael, former crusader turned herbalist monk living in the 12th century world of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. Predictably, the monks are anything but welcome in Wales - not only are they emissaries from an English abbey, which in itself would be bad enough already; they also seek to take what village folk consider their greatest treasure and, more importantly, the village's holy protectress. When wealthy squire Lord Rhysart, who has led the village in opposing the monks' mission, is found murdered, the monks quickly find themselves implicated. ...Cadfael, of Welsh descendance himself but now part of a mission from an English abbey, finds himself between all lines of allegiance in trying to find Rhysart's murderer; but find the murderer he must, to ensure the success of his brothers' mission and their safe return home. And it will take all his world-wisdom *and* all his understanding of the divine to unravel the mystery.Like the nineteen Chronicles that would follow it, \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" is rich in plot lines and subplots and demands the full attention of any reader intent on solving the mystery together with Brother Cadfael. Set in the time of the civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen for the throne of England, Ellis Peters's acclaimed series vividly and with great care for detail portrays medieval monastery life, as well as a society caught in the middle of a civil war, with shifting allegiances, intrigue, favoritism and again and again, the innocent victims caught between the front lines. More than once, the story lines also return to the animosities between Welsh and English that are at the center of this first Chronicle. In Brother Cadfael, Ms. Peters (a/k/a Edith Pargeter) created one of the most engaging detectives in literary history. His experiences as a crusader have left him with a keen sense of reality, a certain element of world-weariness and a deep sense of morality, not only understanding the letter of the law (both divine and worldly) but more importantly, the deeper implications of the same, thus enabling Cadfael to apply the church's teachings in a truly Solomonic manner, always coming to solutions which are as just as they are compassionate and pragmatic.To the novice who has just recently discovered the series, it probably makes sense to read the Chronicles in order, because they contain a number of cross-references and the cast of recurring characters is successively enlarged - Under-Sheriff Hugh Beringar for example, Cadfael's trusted worldly sidekick, is not introduced until the second Chronicle, \\"One Corpse Too Many.\\" But even for those who are coming to \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" only after already having read one or more of the other Chronicles there is plenty to enjoy, and it is sure to be fun to discover how it all began.Also recommended:A Rare BenedictineOne Corpse Too Many: The Second Chronicle of Brother CadfaelMonk's Hood: The Third Chronicle of Brother CadfaelLeper of Saint Giles (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)The Virgin in the Ice (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)Brother Cadfael's Penance (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)The Cadfael CollectionA Bloody Field by Shrewsbury"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Any Brother Cadfael mystery is a treat--even a privilege to read. This medieval monk solves murders, thefts, and resolves deceptions and missing persons cases--using his wits, his wordly experience, plus his vast knowledge of medicinal herbs and human nature. The tales are set in late 12th century Enlgand not far from the Welsh border. Sturdy Welshman himself, our cowled protagonist is a former Crusader who discovered &quot;in the middle of the road of life&quot; his calling to the monastic community; that he could best serve his fellow man by seriving God first. In this case in the Benedictine order, at the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury (a real place).In this debut novel (read in my case after # 6-21) we find a somewhat secular Cadfael, which jars my conception of him as revealed in Peters' subsequent works. (I understand that she did not originally envision an entire series.) He indulges freely in the cameraderie of the wine jug, recalls w! ith fondness a long list of satisfied women, and openly admires an attractive Welsh girl. Fortunately his secular tendencies mellow out during the six months that pass (murderless, we assume) between novels. (I wonder if he ever noticed that fatal pattern...)This story concerns the long-interred bones of a maiden saint named Winifrid of Gwytherin, Wales. The message may be: Let Sleeping Saints Lie, but the vaulting ambition of Prior Robert ruthlessly tramples common courtesy and decency. Aided by his staunch toady, Brother Jerome, and an ardent young novice, Brother Columbanus who experiences episodes of religious zeal and ecstacy, Robert insists that Winifrid's remains be transported to England--a country and tongue alien to her in life--to serve as a beacon for pilgrims. For the renown and coffers of the Abbey of course... although he will gladly accept any reflected glory for his humble efforts, which just might advance his career.But what is the will of the peo! ple of Gwytherin, this peaceful hamlet in Wales--until the ! Benedictines laid seige to the bones of their patroness? And more to the point, what is the will of the saint herself: will she choose a champion to speak for her? Cadfael is caught in the middle of these delicate negociations--brought along as interpreter of his native, Welsh tongue. He must outwardly support the efforts to remove the saint from her people, yet he privately believes that the martyred girl deserves to rest in her native land. Can mere mortals manipulate miracles for their own--selfish or benevolent--ends? Cadfael takes a hand in balancing the scales of spiritual justice. An excellent premier novel for a fabulous series!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I had read other Cadfael mysteries before finding this one. It made me appreciate only too well the slightly rebellious Cadfael in this first book.His attitude toward Prior Robert and prissy, self-righteous prig Brother Jerome is only what I had been thinking the entire time. Of course, Cadfael will later control these rebellious thoughts but, oh, they are a joy to read after the others.I found a Morbid Taste for Bones a great book. It is very enjoyable and the ultimate secret act of rebellion (but never fear-it is just) that Cadfael commits towards the end is the crowning point, the punch line, to an enjoyable read. Peters injects the book with great humor and mystery and Cadfael's secret affords the biggest laugh of them all.This book was a great addition to the A&amp;E Cadfael TV series."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Having read one or two Cadfaels before, I decided it would be far better to try and read the 20 volumes in order, both to increase the sense of storyline and allow myself the feeling of accomplishment.It's a pity that I had to undertake this long journey having read one or two stories previously, because they showed up weaknesses in this story that would otherwise not been noticed so readily.The monks of Shrewsbury need a saint, because everyone else has one. It sounds ridiculous that people, especially monks, would think like this, but it is wholly believable considering just how much the fear of God existed in Cadfael's day. A visitation to one of the brothers and some generally strange antics from one of the younger ones, and the whole party ends up in the small Welsh village of Gwytherin. Cadfael is Welsh and so there is an interpreter. The language barrier is controlled well by Peters, and half trhe time we forget it exists - good storytelling. Anyway, the story meanders as the monks try to wrest the bones of the local Saint Winifred from the Welsh and needless to say they do not like it. Suddenly a murder, and Cadfael is onto it in a flash. The murderer is unmasked and we all go home happy. Or do we?For those familiar with PG Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster, the ending in this mystery is rather like one of the cunning and succinct ways in which Jeeves invariably solves all Wooster's woes. Whereas in Jeeves and Wooster we are looking at a comedy, with Cadfael , we have a serious affair. The concise and overtly convenient manner in which Cadfael rounds things off is too much for reality. There was another way to end this story, and one which did not stretch the bounds of belief. But Peters has opted for the clean ending and the whole story suffers.I know the Cadfaels get better, and this volume has not diminished my desire for more of the canny sleuthing monk. I do recommend to anyone that they start at the beginning and so I recommend to anyone, have a stab at this. If you like it, 19 more books sets you up for a while."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"The story unfolds slowly. I felt that the author spent more time weaving together beautiful prose instead of a solid plot. The combination of medieval setting and murder mystery is compelling, but in the end I found the book to be too slow and predictable. I often found myself counting the pages until a chapter was finished. It was an effort to push through.It is not a bad book, nor is it a great book. If you are looking for a change of pace this may be a good selection. If you are looking for a great mystery, you can do better with Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This novel is one of two by Ellis Peters about the medieval detective Cadfael that I've now read. But I'm hooked! In this first volume of the extensive Brother Cadfael series, the medieval crime sleuth is part of a quest of monks pursuing the bones of saint Winifred from Welsh soil, a quest commissioned by the blessed lady herself in an apparent vision to Brother Columbanus. But the town which houses Winifred's body doesn't want to give up her blessed bones so easily, and the peaceful mission is soon disturbed by the murder of the leader of the town. Suspects abound, including two suitors to his beautiful daughter, both of whom could benefit from his murder. Is the arrow in his body really from the daughter's true love, or has the other suitor tried to frame him? And are all the monks themselves beyond suspicion? Only Cadfael with his humble yet brilliant mind can unravel the truth, and come with a remarkable solution that ties up all the loose ends. The twists of the story-line are so ingenious they rival and perhaps surpass the efforts of most best-selling thrillers today.Peters' command of the English language is outstanding, as is her precise portrait of medieval times. Although the religious aspect forms the fabric on which the novel is painted, the real concern is with characterization and intrigue. The tale is cloaked in constant talk of the supernatural, but Peters actually offers a novel that is more psychological than religious, and it is by applying the principles of reason rather than religion that Cadfael discovers the truth. The intriguing element of mystery that makes detective Cadfael's presence essential to the plot clinches this novel as a romping success. If you enjoy mystery, as well as a writer's ability to make excellent use of the English language with colourful descriptions, you are sure to enjoy this book. And chances are, like me you won't be able to stop after reading volume 1!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I like this first book but it had too many names but it was her first and the next is alot better"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This book starts off slowly, but fans of Hercule Poirot should really like it.

I say this regretfully since I don't easily give up on books. It doesn't help that the narrative takes its time to get going, with this Brother talking to that Prior using a stilted, high language. Even the words themselves feel slow.Not necessarily a bad book, just not for me."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I watched the television series featuring Brother Cadfael back in the early 1990's and then bought the tape sets and watched them over and over. Because I had Derek Jacobi pictured so firmly in my mind as Brother Cadfael it seemed to me that I would judge the books by his performance. Well, while Jacobi was excellent in the series I never should have waited to read the novels. Nothing I saw on film came even close to the wonderful experience of reading the words set down by Ellis Peters. This was a true pleasure to read.I like this written Brother Cadfael even better because all the subtle nuances of character which are fully explored in the novel can only be hinted at in the films. This character was created to show his reverence to the calling he had chosen and yet retained all the experiences of his former life. The pomposity of Prior Robert comes across startlingly clear as he makes a choice to remove the bones of a relatively unknown Welsh saint from her current burial site to the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul at Shrewsbury. The life of the cloister is explored from the viewpoint of the humanity of the men involved there and the Welsh national and human traits are presented in kindly consideration. There is mystery here because there is a murder, but what was so engaging to read were all the maneuverings Brother Cadfael carried on behind the scenes to solve the crime and have an outcome which could, as the book states, make as many people happy as possible.Wonderfully written and an absorbing puzzle. Now it is imperative that I read them all."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I've been hooked on medieval mysteries since my brother gave me Revelations last January; but this is the first one I've read with a narrator who has a sense of humor.

The more famous the saint and the more miracles generated, the more renowned the church would be.So Prior Robert of the abbey makes an expedition to Wales in search of the bones of a holy virgin saint whose life was a chronicle of miracles. He is guided by the somewhat suspect visions of a scion of a noble house who has recently entered the monastary. Brother Cadfael is taken along because he speaks Welsh. However, the locals where the saint lived are reluctant to have her dug up and taken to England. Prior Robert makes several mistakes, tensions rise and when the local lord is murdered there are those who would suspect even the holy monks of the killing.Brother Cadfael has his hands full, trying to see justice done and to clear the good name of his abbey.So launches the first book in the wonderful historical mystery series about the former Crusader turned humble brother and herbalist. Ellis Peters (the pen name of a famous British historical novelist) serves up solid history, a pair of star-crossed young lovers and the worldly wisdom of Brother Cadfael, a man who is good company whether in the company of saint or sinner. This book is written with arch good humor, a reverent and funny wink to our more secular times. Highly recommended, and I'm speaking about the whole series."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"A Morbid Taste for Bones is a wonderful conundrum, and ends with an understanding of the needs of the different peoples in the tale.

I call them 'gentle' mysteries. (This was before I heard the term 'cozy' mysteries.) The books are based around the character of a monk in the 1100's. He is the 'doctor' of his abbey, and is often called on to help solve how and why people died. As a former...non-monk...he knows the ways of the world and has basically rejected that life style.There is not much violence, gore, sex, or blood in the books, which is why I call them gentle. Easy enough for young adults to enjoy, too."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"\\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" is the first chronicle in the Brother Cadfael mystery series by Ellis Peters, and it is the best of the few that I have read. Although slow going at first, the mystery takes off after the discovery of murder and concludes with an intriguing and twisted version of events. \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" is a well-thought-out and well-written mystery, filled with likeable characters and period details that are effortlessly interwoven throughout.Brother Cadfael's Benedictine order at Shrewsbury Abbey has decided to acquire the sacred remains of a Welsh saint in order to bring glory to their order. This is brought about by a young monk experiencing visions of Saint Winifred, a neglected saint in the small village of Gwytherin. Brother Cadfael is suspicious of these visions, given that everything seems to fit together too nicely. Yet the brothers set off to acquire the bones, only to meet with hostility from the inhabitants of the village. When the staunchest opposition to their quest is found with an arrow in his chest, the prior believes it to be a sign from the saint herself. Brother Cadfael, who knows it was murder, has no evidence to track down the guilty party and is eager to help clear the names of innocent suspects, including the younger novice in his charge.\\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\" is a unique mystery, with Peters portraying monastic life as divisive and complicated as life outside the order. Her prose is often elegantly poetic and she creates just enough suspense throughout the plot to hold the reader's attention. The first two or three chapters are rather slow in progression, but the mystery rushes to a truly interesting conclusion that satisfies all the characters and the reader alike."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I've always loved the Brother Cadfael series of books. This, the first of the series, was written rather late (1977) in Ellis Peters's writing career, which began in 1936, so it has none of the usual first-novel problems. By the time she wrote it, Ms Peters had fully realized the character of Brother Cadfael. (Ellis Peters is the pen name of Edith Pargeter, a well-known scholar and translator of Czech literature, who died in 1995.)Some mystery novels leave me with a strange taste in my mouth afterwards, sometimes a metallic taste as if the \\"food\\" was a bit off, or with a distinct feeling of distaste as if I'd eaten something that definitely disagreed with me.Not the Brother Cadfael novels. There is nothing jarring or disgusting about them, because Brother Cadfael is himself a comforting, steadying presence in them. The plotting is good, and Ms Peters plays fair with the reader. I'm left with a satisfying sense that the world is a better place for having Brother Cadfael, at least in fictional form, in it.Yet even so, she never shirks or blinks at unpleasant events, such as the murder of nuns, the struggles of a cloistered man with his sexual urges, the unbridled ambition and lust for power in a time of civil war in England (the 12th century). Only the some of the more nauseating details are left to the reader's imagination. Her historical research is impeccable, and she never feels it necessary to talk down to the reader by explaining details we can get from the context. A \\"cotte,\\" for example, may be taken for a \\"coat,\\" and so it was.I have loved these novels since I discovered them 25 years ago, and I hope you do, too."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"After a lifetime of adventure, leaving his native Wales as a young man to answer the call of the Crusades, traveling to exotic lands and learning much in his journeys Cadfael was ready to spend the rest of his life in peace and contemplation. He returned to England and joined a Benedictine monestary hoping to spend his remaining years quietly tending his herb garden. He soon learned though that conflict and intrigues existed within the quiet monestary walls as well. Cadfael's little monestary had little claim to fame, no miracles had occured there, it had no saintly relics nothing to attract pilgrims (or their alms). One of the brothers had a vision of St. Winifred calling to the brothers to come take her bones from her quiet little Welsh village.Despite his own personal misgivings about the validity of their mission Cadfael did as he was bid and joined the party to retrieve the bones. His assigned task was to be intrepreter but he was soon called upon to use his skills as an investigator to unmask a murderer.This is not an easy, quick read like many mysteries. It is definitely worth the effort though. Peters transports the reader to the little Benedictine monestary and brings the Middle Ages to life. This book is a great start to a promising series that holds appear to both history buffs and mystery fans."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I've read the first five books in this series and I love them all! A Morbid Taste for Bones may not even be the best of them, but do read the stories in order, there are a few small spoilers in later books. And it is great to see the characters develope over time."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"I am generally not a fan of mystery novels, because so many of them are so poorly written. The Cadfael books, in contrast, are masterfully written, delightful mysteries. I have read the first 4, and I think they are terrific. My favorite so far is &quot;One Corpse Too Many,&quot; but they are all great. These books are great reads for anyone who enjoys: a) mysteries, b)medieval stories, or c)a quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"A good friend recommended this character to me, and claimed that once I had encountered what he called &quot;Cadfael-humour&quot;, I'd be hooked! How true this was! Cadfael is a monk after my heart! - This is truely my new hero! And it has given me something to read on these long, dark and bitterly cold nights we have here in Denmark! I give my new hero the warmest of recommendations, - and promise that I will read all of the chronicles!"},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"Brother Cadfael is a Benedictine monk at Shrewsbury Abbey where he has taken the cowl after a lifetime as a fighting man in the Crusades. Having a particular interest in herbs, both medicinal and culinary, he is included in an expedition to a small Welsh town where the bones of a saint are buried, near an ancient chapel. The Prior of his Abbey is more interested in having the relics of the saint at Shrewsbury as a commercial venture, rather than for any religious reasons, and is very put out when the locals baulk at having their saint removed from the area. The most vehement opposition comes from the most affluent member of the community, who is found dead with an arrow protruding from his chest, whereupon all opposition ceases, mainly through superstitious fear. With the aid of one of the younger monks, Cadfael proves that no heavenly hand had a part in the murder, rather an all too worldly, greed motivated man did the dastardly deed. I loved the tv series, starring Derek Jacobi, and am looking forward to reading further Cadfael adventures."},{"Title":"A Morbid Taste for Bones (Brother Cadfael Mysteries)","review":"This, the original Brother Cadfael novel is great fun to read. It has a slightly different feel from the rest of the series, but it is still vintage Peters with the descriptive language and great humor."},{"Title":"72 Days at Gettysburg: Organization of the Tenth Regiment, New York Volunteer Cavalry & Assignment to the Town of Gettsburg, Pennsylvania (De","review":"Solid research of how a group of Union soldiers prepared themselves, both physically and mentally, prior to the Confederates onslaught of the town of Gettysburg in July 1863. The books reads like a movie, with interesting characters and fascinating events."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I use this book quite a bit and have enjoyed the recipies. I particularly like the veggie-friendly stew types of dishes and have made several of them. They work well even with the old slow cooker (it's avocado green if that's a clue to it's age :-)) that I have."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I borrowed this from our school library and made about 5 or 6 recipes. They sure sounded good in the descriptions but the final results were less than wonderful. They were edible I guess. But I guess that's the function of a slow cooker - to make something to eat while you're busy vs. make something wonderful while hovering over the stove / oven / grill."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've made a bunch of the recipes in this cookbook, and most have been really bland. Some of the combinations are downright weird and unpleasant. However, this cookbook will be useful to those who--* Have enough knowledge in the kitchen to figure out what the recipes are missing before you start your crock pots and head out for work.* Like bland, underseasoned food. (Hey, a lot of people do!)* Are in a huge hurry and don't mind sacrificing some taste for what are generally nutritious meals.* Are new to the world of slow cookers.Lkie I said, I've used this one a lot, and I find it helpful. It's a great as a beginner slow-cooker cookbook, so you can get used to the appliance and learn some basics like chili and stews. I use it as a guide to adapt other recipes for the slow cooker."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Well, the reader from Texas was quite right to expect recipes for slow cookers, given the title of the book and the picture on the cover. I just received it as a gift and I haven't cooked from it, but I've read it cover to cover (that's just what I do with new cookbooks). I was pretty dismayed when I turned to the one-dish dinner chapter to see that none of the recipes involved a crock pot in any way. I actually thought it was a printer's error or something, but now I'm thinking they just threw it in to live up to their claim to be the &quot;biggest.&quot;When you've read and used as many cookbooks as I have, you can almost taste the recipes just by reading through them. There doesn't seem to be anything special about them - they're not interesting or authentic enough for me, but I'm sure they would be perfect for a hard-to-please group. I do plan to try some of them and I could envision these types of recipes to come in handy when I don't feel like doing anything special or the pantry is getting bare.On the plus side, I thought they did a good job with the little hints at the top of each page, usually suggestions on what to serve with the dish. That's something I wish more cookbooks would do."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"What can I say, I just love this book!First of all, I must admit that I am NOT a gourmet food eater! I just want normal, everyday foods to feed my family. The kids are incredibly picky, but they actually eat things from this cookbook! That is a TOTAL miracle! :)"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This cookbook is my favorite slow-cooker cookbook. The recipe selection is varied, and the recipes are neither too difficult/strange, nor too simple. I appreciate that each recipe tells you what size cooker it is for, and there are enough different recipes for each size of cooker to keep you busy no matter what size cooker you have. I have a 5-quart, and some of the recipes for the 3-1/2 quart cookers look so good that I am considering buying a smaller cooker as well."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This is a good book. Not exceptional, but good. The book covers all the meats, veggies, and even some deserts as well as good tips here and there. It's one of the better ones I have seen to date for crock pots. If you are loooking for an all around slow cooker book, pick this one up."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I bought this book a few weeks ago and make meals in my slow cooker about twice a week. So far, every recipe I have tried have been delicious and a huge hit with my husband and two kids. I would definitely recommend this book. Some of the recipes do have some longer prep time, but there are quick fixes as well."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Easy-to-follow format, this collection of 'must have' slow cooker recipes will tantalize, satisfy, and change the way you cook (and eat)!

Most importantly though, this book of slow cooker recipes makes cooking fun and eating a treasured time!Bon-appetite!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"First of all DO NOT Mis understand my rating. This BOok has wonderful REAL NORMAL FOOD recipes. You know what I am talking about: the kind that you usually have the stuff to make it and don't have to go to a specialty store... and that you can get your entire family to eat. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the print job / and paper that the book is printed with. I am comparing the quality of &quot;printing&quot; to my Better Homes and Gardens &quot;New Cook Book&quot; (the red gigham one) which has been a staple in my kitchen since I got married 8 years ago and basically taught me how to cook.This book does not have the wipe clean type pages as the other one does. NO, the other one is not laminated or anything but if i get the pages wet i can wipe them off imediatly and it won't damage it. I am afraid that if I get this one wet then the ink will smudge and ruin the page ( but i have not tried this out ). The paper is not the slick type of the former but is more like computer printer paper. But do not let this deter you from getting this book, just be carefull while doing your prep work. I dont know if this book will last as long as my other one has but from the looks of the recipes then if not it will be replaced. I am so happy to have this book of &quot;normal&quot; crock pot recipes because lets face it, a book is not worth keeping if you only use a couple of the recipes."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Lots of good recipes; can add or detract ingredients and still have very good flavor.

I guess I will continue my search for a good slow cooker cookbook."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This book's not terrible and it's probably okay for beginning slow cooks. I didn't find many of the recipes very inspiring. The book doesn't have pictures, which doesn't bother me, but some people like pictures. On the plus side, it's helpful the book is spiral bound and the recipes have nutritional/calorie information. (Slow Cookers for Dummies is a good beginner book and has interesting information on how slow cookers work, how to choose a cooker and how to adapt traditional recipes. It also has a decent selection of recipes.)"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This is a great Cook book with a huge variety of dishes to choose from. Preparing family meals with the slow cooker has changed my working life. This book contains so many recipes I will always have some new delicious flavours to offer my family. Even the pasta dishes are great. Until I purchased this book I was unsure as to the best way to utilize my slow cooker. Now I have a guideline for the different ingredients I want to use. I would reccomend this book to anyone with a slow cooker.

When my wife is away, I can even crack open this book to the recipes that require 5 or less ingredients and put something together that my kids actually like. There are a lot more recipes in here than I thought there would be when I purchased the book, which was a nice surprise. There are also desserts, stews, various meats, etc. If you want a book that lets you create easy slow-cooker recipes, this is the bible of them all. My only wish it that there were more actual photos of various meals so you could see the finished product."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Found a few new receipies that I like.

My children and I are cooking our way through this book - we plan on trying every recipe and we are having a wonderful time! Each recipe is voted on and given a 1-5 star rating, and so far almost every recipe has 4 or 5 stars, with the exception of a few 3's. There are several recipes that have become family favorites such as the Spiced Beef Brisket, Brisket in Ale and the Mushroom Sauce Pork Chops. In my opinion this is the easiest and best slow cooker cookbook on the market."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"There's just nothing like meat that's been slow-cooked for several hours until it's melt-in-your-mouth-tender. BH&G; slow cooking book provides 416 pages of great recipes and slow-cooking tips to make some of the most mouth-watering dishes ever! A real favorite is the section on one-dish dinners that are so simple to make with five ingredients and yet so incredibly delicious.Wonderful Soups, stews, roasts, ribs, even more exotic ethnic dishes can be found within the pages of this great book. You'll even find recipes for desserts, dips ,etc. Over 400 recipes in all.Slow-cooking is not for everyone..it takes some ambition and some planning to prepare your ingredients and then let it \\"go\\" byt iteself for as long as 12 hours, but I guarantee you will love the results. My only complaint is not pictures in the book. That is one of my pet peeves about any cookbook."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have purchased about 5 slow cooker cookbooks over the years. Most of them were dreadful, or only had one good recipe. I really like this book. The recipes appeal to me, they are easy to prepare with a limited number of ingredients, cook in the time indicated by recipe, and are very tasty. My only complaint is that some of the sauces are a bit too thin, but nothing a bit of flour or cornstarch won't cure. If you buy the book, try the Favorite Beef Pot Roast - really yummy."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"You can find other slow cooker cook books that are better than this one. The recipes seem common and tired, the page layout and design is riotous and adds nothing to the content. This book compared to others had a lot more \\"what the heck\\" recipes -- \\"what the heck? I'm not going to try and serve THAT to my kids\\", that kind of thing. I'd look at other cook books, especially \\"Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook\\" which I found to be far superior to this cook book."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I originally borrowed this book from the library but because I had ear marked so many pages because the recipes looked so good I will be buying it from Amazon.It has your usual cookbook set-up: Appetizers, sopus, side dishes, and the like. I like the fact it was not just another book of the usual beef stews and chicken noodle soups. While those things are in there so are recipes like; Sweet and Sour chicken, Fettucine with sausage and mushrooms, Ham and lentil soup. I was also impressed with the fact they used not so common veggies in the recipes to mix things up a bit. Several recipes include the use of Fennel, parsnips, and leeks. The total amount of pages of actual recipes totals around 390 pages. The format is easy to read and understand often with helpful tips on the side. I especially like the fact that they included the Nutrition facts per serving for each recipe. I will positively be buying this book for gifts."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This one has it all. Lots of recipes of all types. Complex recipes, simple recipes, spicy recipes, vegetarian recipes, recipes with all types of meat, soups, stews.... Another important thing: most of the recipes only contain ingredients that can be commonly found in your local grocery store. Apparently the recipes were tested, too. There aren't any \\"bad ones\\" in there. If you are into crock-pot cooking, you'll be reaching for this cookbook more often than not."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"apparently there are two types of slow cookers, and not until page 102 does this book mention that these recipes only work with one of them. you have to have the kind that has only a low and high setting and cooks continuously.also, not the recipes are for different sizes - some small, some large, and you can't just use the biggest size for any of them, as far as I can tell.so make sure you've got the right kind before you buy!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I love this crock pot book of recipes! This has a huge collection for all kinds of different tastes! If you have this book, none others are needed! So far, our family favorite is \\"Dixie Stew\\" (kind of like chili but made with black beans and diced ham). I skipped putting in some of the ingredients I didn't have in stock, like okra, and it turned out fabulous! This was very flavorful and rich! The nice thing about crock pot recipes is they are very adaptable, if you don't like one ingredient, either eliminate it or replace it with something similar. The nice thing about this cook book is on the side of each page is a notes section that you can makes notes on, like if and what was substituted and whether it was a hit or bomb at supper. I find this book has everything, many different tastes. I've made a handful of these recipes and have lots more I want to try."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've done several recipes from this very extensive book and have found it to be of great value. As the home chef, I have done mostly sautee and oven cooking and never got into this type of food preparation. I have enjoyed,immensely, putting everything inthe \\"pot\\" and being free all day until time to plate up. My wife also enjoys the results I get!!!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I really needed another slow cooker book, I had seemed to exhaust the few recipes from the other books, and quite frankly, my kids had too.

I would recommend this to someone who does not have another recipe book for their slow crocker."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This cookbook has no pictures and the recipes are short on flavor. Making food from this book is an insult to the honest ingredients that go into it. Seriously, you could do a lot better with the raw ingredients than what you would get after following instructions in this book. Keep away!! Unless you WANT a big book of untested slow cooker recipes that were likely put together to meet a publishing deadline."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've made a couple recipes so far (I just got the book a couple weeks ago), but every one that I've read and the ones that I've made all are very easy to prepare. Not alot of extra hassle for some good home cookin'!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've had this book for years and realized I should put a review on Amazon to let people know how handy it is.Pros:- tons of healthy recipes... most recipes incorporate a lot of veggies and interesting ingredients- many ethnic-inspired dishes... not restricted to American-style food, but does include many typical America dishes like chili- nutritional info provided for each dish- serving suggestions for most dishes and even some interesting, brief commentary on the origin of the dish- very easy to read directions and ingredient lists- options for cooking on low and high- lots of grain-free, dairy-free recipes (great for people on a Paleo/zone diet or with a gluten allergy)Cons:- not as many options for desserts as I would have liked (e.g. not even one recipe for rice pudding?)- lots of soup recipes are listed in the \\"Side Dishes\\" chapter vs the \\"Soups and Stews\\" chapter... not a big deal, but you could miss some good recipes if you don't know to look in the sides section for other soups- no pictures... not a big deal, but makes the book a little boringOverall, I love this cookbook. For those reviewers that have griped about the fact that some recipes require you to brown meat first, they should realize that this is the case w/ almost all crock pot recipes that involve meat, and putting raw meat in the crockpot can lead to food poisoning at the worst and rubbery meat at best. As a note, this cookbook also includes some random chapters on cooking w/o a crockpot... doesn't detract from the book in general, but you may or may not find the recipes in these sections helpful.Do not hesitate to buy this book and enjoy its easy, yummy, healthful recipes!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This is a wonderful cookbook for Crockpot users.

This cookbook belongs in any kitchen with a slow cooker."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This cookbook is what every slowcooker should have! There are a lot of different recipes in it. Some with almost no preptime, some with longer prep time. There is also one chapter with recipes that only have 5 ingredients.

If you love the slowcooker, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I had to replace my copy when it began to fall apart from overuse. The best thing about this book is the recipes are truly fix-it and forget-it. You don't have to be home and standing over it after two or three hours to add another ingredient. Most recipes I can start in the morning when I leave for work, and eat when I get home 9 hours later. An added bonus is every recipe I have tried in this cookbook tastes great. The vegetarian chili recipe with pasta is one of our favorites. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Love this new cook book!

So much more healthy than eating processed food."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This book has become one of my go-to recipe books.I just love the variety of recipes in this book; it's not just entrees, but other recipes like desserts, soups and starters, which is just fab.We're a busy family, so we really do quite a few slow cooker meals. A good portion of the recipes in this book are child-friendly, which is great (and our girls are fairly picky, so if you have non-picky eaters, then a majority of the recipes will likely be kid-friendly!)One downside is that some of the recipes are not exactly \\"toss in the crockpot\\" simple. Some require a fair bit of preparation, which sort of defeats the main purpose for using a slow cooker in our house! But if you're not into it for speed, then it's not really a downside!The only other complaint is the formatting. The text is small, close-together and hard to read at-a-glance while you're preparing the dish.I also recommendThe Best Slow Cooker Recipes & Meals Cookbookby Cressida Elias.

One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I ordered this recipe book for my son who wanted a crock pot for Christmas.

Our family has disliked 4 out of 4 recipes we've tried so far. They all tast very 'processed', almost canned or from a jar.

So far I have made two recipes from it...German potato soup and herbed chicken with mushrooms and both came out really well. This is no gourmet fancy-schmancy slow cooker book either...while there is some prep involved with a lot of the recipes, there isn't a lot of stovetop cooking involved before you hit the on button on the slow cooker either.

I bought this book for my daughter who is a busy mom. This is just what she wanted!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Of the 400+ pages only 190 of them are of any use to me. I use a crockpot because it is simple and tasty cooking. So, I was expecting alot of main dish recipies. And I was also expecting them all to be for the crockpot. There is over 60 pages of recipes that do not use the crockpot. There is over 125 pages dedicated to beverages, soups, breads, and desserts. I have never met anyone who has made hot chocolate or apple bread in a crockpot. Of the 190 pages of worth. only 25 pages were the type of recipies that I was looking for. ie. the chop-it up and throw it in the pot type. everything else involved browning or braising or some other type of stove technique. I guess I'm just the kind of cook who doesn't want to screw around with browning anything. I bought this specifically because of the reviews on amazon. Hopefully this review will speak to those of you like me that are not chefs and are just looking for something easy and tasty to cook."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"When things are really hectic, the crock-pot seems to take on a life of its own, slowing simmering away while the garlic and artichoke chicken, or vegetable curry, or pork roast with apricot/mustard glaze do their own thing, unattended. And there's nothing quite like coming home after a busy day to the down-home aromas of a dinner already cooked and ready to serve!The Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes, like most Better Homes and Gardens products, is full of reliable, well-tested recipes, but this book seems to have more interesting recipes than the stews one finds in the average crock-pot cookbook. I was surprised to see a dozen recipes calling for parsnips in place of carrots, for example, while nine include artichoke hearts and six suggest eggplant. Several recipes are enhanced by a variety of gourmet mushrooms--shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms--while the pasta selections range from mostaccioli to orzo and tortellini.The herbs and spices are well chosen, and most recipes call for more than one seasoning, giving interesting highlights to these dishes. I did find that I needed to use more of these than the recipes called for in most cases, though there are some curry recipes that call for a hefty tablespoonful of curry powder. Many of the recipes are heavy on tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato paste, and these sometimes seemed overpowering--in the Beef and Borscht Stew, for example--but adjusting downward to suit your own taste is not difficult.Though the book calls its 59 pages of \\"one-dish\\" casserole dinners a \\"bonus,\\" I was mystified as to why these were included here--none of them use the slow cooker at all! By contrast, only 24 pages of vegetarian main dishes for the crock-pot are included, despite the fact that beans, lentils, and chickpeas are at their best when cooked slowly. Over all, however, this is a tasty and unusual collection of recipes, many of which are sure to become family favorites. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Most slow-cooker books offer recipes for food you would find in a diner. Chilis and stews abound. This book is different. It's for the busy gourmet, and it's for the person who likes to cook up a big pot of something yummy on Sunday and then heat up portions for lunches and dinner during the week. Yesterday I made the Indian Curry Soup, and today for lunch I heated up a delicious, spicy soup filled with garbanzo beans, red potatoes, tomatoes, and tantalizing spices.The best part about this book is that it includes key nutrition info- fat, fiber, and calories... it's all there! Weight Watchers will love it, because calculating the point value of each dish is a snap.In short, a must-have for the career person who wants a home-cooked meal. My crock pot had been left abandoned in a cabinet, but now it's back on the counter!"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have many crock pot cookbooks, and this by far is one of the best! Not only are the recipes new, but there is a prep time provided, a cooking time provided, and the required size of slow cooker needed. In addition, a nutritional analysis is provided with every recipe. This is a big plus since many of us are trying to watch our daily caloric and fat intake.I am thrilled to find such a valuable cookbook since I need to use my slow cooker at least twice a week now. There are 400 recipes in this book."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This book is the best slow-cooker cookbook I've come across yet!

With over 400 recipes, there are dishes to suit every occasion, from elegant parties to potluck dinners to meals for your family.The book is organized by type of dish: Appetizers & Beverages, Soups & Stews, Side Dishes, Beef, Pork & Lamb, Poultry, Meatless Main Dishes, Five Ingredients, One-Dish Dinners and Desserts. The meals in the One-Dish Dinners chapter are not prepared using a slow cooker, which I found odd at first, but their convenience really merits their inclusion in a cookbook designed for busy cooks.The variety of recipes is wonderful. The culinary style ranges from traditional slow cooker recipes such as Super-Simple Beef Stew and Country-Style Pork Ribs to more exotic, trendy dishes like Thai-Style Coconut-Chicken Soup and Spicy Chorizo Sandwiches. My family (including a picky toddler) became instant fans of the Brisket in Ale and Chicken & Rice Stew Gone Wild and we are looking forward to trying Decadent Raspberry Brownies.Every recipe includes accurate preparation time, cooking time and number of servings. Comprehensive nutrition information is provided, making meal planning easy for people following special diets. There are tips covering topics such as purchasing and preparing ingredients and serving suggestions. The index is comprehensive and logical and the binding is extremely functional (the book stays flat when you open it and lay it on the counter).Better Homes and Gardens \\"Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes\\" is a must-have for anyone who wants delicious home-cooked food but doesn't have a lot of time to prepare meals and, of course, owns a slow cooker (or will soon own a slow cooker)."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This book is awesome! I was looking for a crockpot book with a variety of recipes...but none too bizarre that called for a lot of crazy ingredients and required a lot of prep time...I mean let's face it--do you want to have to cook in a saucepan first? That is why you are using a crockpot--to avoid that! This book tells you to &quot;throw&quot; stuff straight into the pot--lowering prep time! This book is easy to use AND has nutritional values included which is definitely a PLUS! The only thing that I can say that I thought was strange about this book is the section that calls for 5 ingredient recipes...none of these use the crockpot!?! Other than that, I would DEFINITELY recommend this book! In fact, I used it tonight! =o)"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This is a beautifully presented book with a multitude of delicious-sounding, well-crafted recipes. They seem satisfying and are done in enough of a gourmet style that you'll be proud of yourself at the next dinner party, but the recipes are not intimidating or difficult to make because of ingredients that seem impossible to find. I like that very much. I also like the bonus section which gives wonderful recipes (many quick and easy) for more traditional cooking (stovetop and oven). My concern is that I have a 3 quart slow cooker. The recipes list the size of slow cooker needed for each recipe (that's very clever) and the smallest listed is always 3 1/2 quart. Most recipes in this book are meant for much bigger slow cookers. So now I'll have to take my chances with my cooker, or scale down the recipes. Readers should just be aware that the authors had families in mind, not single people with small slow cookers. That's a bit irritating, I must say."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I received this cookbook for Christmas last year after perusing my mothers and almost stealing it. Since then, I must have used this cookbook a hundred times for a hundred different recipes. It has everything from simple soups, delicious appetizers all the way to full course meals to feed a whole family.My favorite chapter is the five ingredient recipes. This portion is perfect for those with very little in the refrigerator and not much time to boot.I enjoyed this culinary directorial because it has alterations on usual recipes such as \\"Spicy Bean Soup\\", \\"Oriental Pork Sandwiches\\" and \\"Country Style Ribs & Sauce\\" as well as new things I have never heard of such as \\"Poached Pears in cran-amaretto Sauce\\". I think this book is perfect for anyone with a crock pot.One thing I did notice was some of the ingredients are a bit hard to find, not in all the recipes but in some. That is the only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"As a vegetarian, I have had a horrible time finding slow cooker cookbooks with interesting recipes. This one is a winner! I have made four recipes and we have really enjoyed each one. Many of the recipes that call for meat products can be converted to non-meat. For example, I made the Cheesy Enchilada Chowder and substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken and it was fantastic! (I also usually substitute vegetable broth if chicken broth is called for with excellent results.) If you are a lacto or ovo lacto vegetarian, or you're just trying to make one meal for a family that includes omnivores and veggies, try this book. It goes way beyond the regular anemic &quot;Meatless Main Dishes&quot; chapters in most slow cooker books with easy, delicious recipes that incorporate flavors from Indian, Italian, German and Mexican cuisines."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I've had this book for several years and several of the recipes are in regular rotation. I like the design of the book with one recipe per page, a sidebar on each page listing prep time, cook time (for both low and high heat settings), how many the recipe serves and the suggested slow cooker size. A brief introduction of the recipe at the top of each page typically offers helpful suggestions for what to serve with the recipe. There is also nutritional data on each page.I found some very unique and tasty recipes, such as the Chicken-Sausage-Sauerkraut Soup. I served this to my parents and my mother said it was the best soup she'd ever had. I also am a fan of the Split Pea Curry Soup. It's a great combination. As I type this I am making the Southwestern White Chili for the umpteenth time.Many of the recipes are, in my opinion, under-spiced. I credit this to two factors: the authors are striving towards low sodium recipes and they recognize that their target audience is families with kids who tend to shy away from highly spiced meals. I almost always punch up the spices with some additions of my own or increasing the suggested amount of spice in the recipe. For instance, for the chili I am currently cooking I added a little salt and white pepper (neither was listed in the recipe), extra cumin, extra chili pepper flakes, and am serving it with fresh, diced jalapeno on the side. I like to combine recipes from this cookbook. The Beef Chili Stew combined with the Firecracker Chili (with, again, a little extra spice thrown in) has become a tasty, spicy chili that I am famous for amongst my friends.I haven't yet made recipes from the chapters on appetizers and desserts as I had a hard time imagining such items being cooked in a big crock pot. But now that I have a 3-in-1 slow cooker that includes a small, 2 quart crock, I am definitely going to give those recipes a try.I think this is a worthy addition to your cook book shelf. The variety in this cookbook ensure its versatility. Just don't be shy about adding a litte extra salt and getting creative with the spices."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have yet to find a great crockery cookbook, and I've tried many. I had high hopes for this one, but so far I've tried 3 recipes and they all have fallen flat.The first recipe I tried was for carmelized onions &amp; potatoes. It sounded great, but the end result was really bland. The second recipe was for a main dish - chicken with wine. My husband, who loves chicken, didn't finish it and said it wasn't very good. I tried it and while it wasn't inedible, it wasn't anything I'd make again. My last try was for a raisin pudding cake that sounded delicious. We had friends over and while they said it was good, both my husband and I thought it was way too sweet, and ended up throwing the rest away (and there was a lot).While I have found many cookbooks that have wonderful recipes for cooking using the stovetop or oven, my search continues for a slow-cooker/crockery book that delivers recipes for delicious (or even &quot;make this again&quot;) meals."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I received this as a gift and I am really loving it! Great layout, super recipes! Usually, I hate reading cookbooks because most are dull and uninspiring.

The recipes are easy, filled with variety and taste superbly! As a new mommy, I find this perfect for my family! I think it's a great cookbook for young people or families just starting out.

At first glance in the bookstore it looked good and bought it. I have been disappointed by this one - a lot of recipes have \\"weird\\" ingredients that a family with small kids just wouldn't eat or that I wouldn't have in my cupboards. I keep looking for a \\"keeper\\" recipe and just can't find it. Look at other slow cooker cookbooks - pass on this one."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I bought this book for three reasons -1. Recipes that are quick to prepare2. Recipes that use fresh ingredients3. Recipes that I could preview on Amazon. I liked what I saw.So far it has exceeded expectations.Cons1. Needs more entries in the index. I tried to look up \\"Pot Roast\\" but it's not in the index, although there are actually two recipes for Pot Roast in the book.2. Needs to have all the recipes listed in the table of contents so you can scan through them all quickly.3. Needs some kind of built-in bookmark, like a ribbon or an end-flap you could fold over and mark your place.SummaryMinor quibbles aside, the area where the book shines is in the recipes, which is after all what you really want in a recipe book. I tried the Spicy Pork and Vegetable Soup and it was amazingly good. The winter vegetables disintegrated into the soup and made it surprisingly sweet and tasty.So if you want healthy recipes that are quick to make and taste great, I think this book is it."},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens, Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Time. Modern American life leaves those with families precious little of it, between the job commute, kids, chores, and other pressures, there is little time to cook a decent meal. I do the majority of cooking in our household and it is something I enjoy, but it is increasingly hard to accomplish because of my demanding schedule.I have two slow cookers; one small 2 quart model and a larger 4 quart multiple setting pot. But all too often my slow cook meals turn out bland and tasteless and despite numerous attempts to spice things up so to speak, I have met with little success.So I started searching for a book of slow cooker recipes that run the gambit of meals from soups and stews, to beans and meats. What I ended up with is the \\"Better Homes & Gardens Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes,\\" a 416 page book that contains a plethora of recipes from Appetizers & Beverages to Desserts. And over 125 pages dedicated to beverages, soups, breads, and desserts.The recipe book is divided into the following chapters:Appetizers & BeveragesSoups & StewsSide DishesBeef, Pork & LambPoultryMeatless main dishesFive IngredientsOne dish dinnersDessertsThe variety of recipes in this book is vast and wonderful; many of these recipes--mostly meats--call for cream of mushroom, cream of celery, cream of chicken soups, which is good because I enjoy cooking with soups because they are easy and quick.The \\"Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes\\" culinary styles range from traditional slow cooker recipes such as stews, soups and rib meals to more non-traditional and contemporary dishes like Ginger Pork with Dried Plums, Coconut-Chicken Soup, Beef Fajitas, Spicy Chorizo Sandwiches, and Mexican Steak & Beans.Me and my family are not big meatless (vegetarians) meal eaters so that portion of the book is not used much I tend to concentrate more on the recipes that contain meat, but I may try some of the bean recipes in the future. We also do not eat a lot of appetizers, but some of the recipes in the book look very yummy, like Thai Chicken Wings with Peanut Sauce, Pineapple Meatballs & Sausage, or Zesty Cocktail Meatballs, some of which would make a portion of a complete meal.Every recipe includes detailed step-by-step instructions for completing the meal as well as a very chart for preparation time, cooking time and number of servings. Every recipe also includes comprehensive nutrition information at the end of every write-up, making it very easy to plan meals for those with special diets or needs. The index is comprehensive and logically laid out.The \\"Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes\\" is not an overly large book and it thankfully lies flat when I open it making it easy to use. The (blue) print is a little smaller than I would have liked, but with the proper lighting it's not an issue.The recipes that I have prepared Favorite Beef Pot Roast, Old World Chicken, Italian Chicken & Pasta, Spaghetti Sauce with Italian Sausage, have all been great hits. I tend to make dishes that take 8 -12 hours on the slow setting to finish; this allows me to start a meal in the morning when I leave at 6:00am and still have time to prepare the rest of the meal when I get home. That is what slow cooking is all about after all.The \\"Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes\\" is a cook book that has found a permanent place on my growing cookery shelve. Granted I tend to use it more in the winter when grilling is unfortunately inconvenient, but still want a great meal on the table. Now, I have a source to turn to for new and exciting meals for my family.

Gradually Brits do not seem tobe aliens, a cause to fail in translation/interpretation."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This murder mystery is as charming as Vienna itself. Like the city's famed waltz, Frank Tallis moves his book, \\"A Death in Vienna,\\" along at the perfect tempo. The year is 1902, and Vienna is at its height of social and scientific development. Tallis uses all the history and social background of the city to infuse his story and characters with a historical interest that at times makes the central murder almost secondary to the setting. Almost...for the twists and turns and inscrutable details of the murder are never too far from our minds, whether we are sitting with the characters in a Viennese cafe enjoying its famous coffees and pastries or sitting in a darkened room for a seance with the dead medium.Ultimately, the story rests on not only this fantastic setting, but also all of the strong characters that Tallis has created here: the dead medium, Fraulein Lowenstein; the detective, Oskar Rheinhardt; the psychologist, Max Liebermann, follower of none other than Sigmund Freud, who makes his appearance here too, albeit briefly. This story captures the tug of war between criminology and psychology, between the paranormal and the scientific, between the old and the forces of change that have engulfed the city during this time frame. They are all played out through the mysterious circumstances of Lowenstein's death and the subsequent investigation by Rheinhardt, aided by his good friend Herr Doctor Liebermann.The beautiful Lowenstein's prime suspects are her seance circle, an unusual group of people who reflect a wide range of personalities and quirks. Through Tallis's story, we see a complete society of Vienna, the triumphs of the new century and the social problems yet to be resolved. This is a period setting rich in appeal, and where other stories may be dragged down by historical detail, this one thrives because of it. Tallis uses every bit of Viennese familiarity to draw us in, and then uses the mystery to keep us going. We become engaged with the charming Rheinhardt-Liebermann duo as they follow the leads, using every \\"modern\\" method to discern the truth about the murder. In the end, the answers to the murder mystery come from a most unlikely source.Unlike many of the thrillers of today, this book relies on character development and setting to build a strong story, showing just how unnecessary the technology of the day is to creating and solving a good mystery. The book is easy to follow, interesting, and well told. That we come away smarter than we began is just an added bonus."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"In general, I greatly enjoyed this book, both as a character study and as a portrait of a fascinating time and place. The author knows turn-of-the-(20th)-century Vienna well, both the social and political issues that people were dealing with and the nitty-gritty details of daily life, but he uses his knowledge to create a believable setting for the story rather than becoming pedantic. His understanding of the cross-currents in the nascent psychoanalytic movement gives the story depth. Dr. Max Liebermann is an intriguing character because he embodies many of the contradictions of that time and place: he's a rebel in his profession, and his artistic tastes run to the avant-garde; but he's also a member of a prosperous Jewish family and community to whom he's strongly loyal. The detective Rheinhardt is less complicated, but his friendship with Dr. Liebermann is based on a shared love of music as well as their fascination with the human mind, so it rang true to me. I felt that the mystery itself wasn't all that strong: any reader who's familiar with the genre could figure out the disappearing bullet and the locked room rather easily, although the author did a good job of dropping hints and red herrings to keep you guessing who done it. I quibbled with some of the psychoanalytic material, e.g., multiple personalities usually develop from a long history of abuse, not ... well, the way it happens here. And I concur with other readers that the author's use of short chapters became confusing -- I disagree that there are \\"too many characters,\\" but the choppy narrative made it hard to remember what X was doing the last time we met him. All in all, however, it's a good story, well written, and I'm hooked enough now to read the next novel in the series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is a well-written and interesting mystery, but be aware that \\"Mortal Mischief\\" and \\"A Death in Vienna\\" are the same book! One is the British title, the other the title used in the States. Don't buy both."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A Death in Vienna is the first in a three part series by Frank Tallis set in earlier 20th century Vienna. This is the reader's first introduction to the protagonist pair of Inspector Oskar Reinhardt and Professor Maxim Liebermann, the latter being a disciple of Sigmund Freud. This first novel centers on the investigation of the mysterious death of a spiritual medium Frauline Lowenstein. The circumstances of the murder are such that many believe that the killing was supernatural at the hands of the ancient Egyptian god Seth. However the mortal suspects include the unusual circle of people who met regularly with Lowenstein.This story is a little longer than your typical 300 pager so both the plot and characters are developed to a greater degree. The novel is very well paced, and Tallis uses a teaser approach at the end of some chapters such that the characters know more than the reader does. Sometimes I found that this made me want to continue reading (which I did), but it was also somewhat frustrating if I was at the end of my allotted reading time for a particular sitting. I guess that is the true mark of a good book! I was not able to figure out who perpetrated the crime or who until the characters did. However, I didn't find the resolution to be contrived either so Tallis did a great job of striking the balance between being obtuse and transparent.Tallis also weaves in what seem to be unrelated threads throughout the novel yet they join together nicely. He also does a good job of bringing in historical bits to give the work a feeling of authenticity. In addition to Freud who makes a few actual appearances, Tallis mentions the master detective Hans Gross and the artist Gustov Klimt. Liebermann takes both his fianc&eacute; and younger sister to see the controversially ceiling murals at The Beethoven Frieze.Amazon recommended A Death in Vienna to me after I posted my review of The Empty Mirror by J. Sydney Jones which as also a period mystery set in Vienna about 10 years prior. If you enjoyed The Empty Mirror or are a mystery fan in general, I highly recommend A Death in Vienna. I can't wait to read the second and third installments Vienna Blood and Fatal Lies.Overall: A"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I picked up this book after reading a short review in the Economist and enjoyed every second of it. The mystery is well done. It has the mark of the English mysteries where the suspects are a small group of people, each of whom is interesting. The crime was ingenious and the detective work is fascinating.The real strength of the book, however, is the setting in Vienna in 1902. We see the City and the culture. Max Lieberman the main character is fascinating. We see the development of psychology in its early stages. There is also a good deal by the occult. If one reads Larson's book about Marconi that we set at the same time one can understand that the developments in science were so amazing that people would not really know what was truth.I have recommended this to friends. It was a treat and was pleased to see there is a sequel that I will read next"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A book that started well, but was ultimately disappointing.The year is 1902 and Vienna is at the height of its glory, sporting many unique shops, entertainment venues, fine museums and was home to the rich and famous of the day. The novel features a mysterious locked room murder, that results in inspector Oskar Rheinhardt and psychologist-physician Dr. Max Liebermann becoming involved to try to solve the crime.The descriptive writing had a pleasant ambiance to it, detailing an early 20th century Vienna and its surrounding area. We also meet with some interesting characters within the frame work of the investigation, some of which are, of course, the suspects. And there are several subplots referred to on a regular interval that, although not directly involved with the murder, have a tangible effect on the story has a whole.So what was wrong with the tale of this mysterious murder...end-novel unbelievability!The book went along quite well for the first 4/5...an intriguing tale but with a lot of apparent dead ends; I was beginning to wonder if the culprits would ever be apprehended, and then...*PARTIAL SPOILER*Out of the blue, one of the side characters suggest two theories as to1.) how the murderer left the room (it was locked from the inside) and2.) how the murder itself was committed.Although the two theories suggested regarding these murder solving details were not entirely outside the realm of possibility, given the information available and characters involved, but they were a definite stretch...extremely remote to say the least; especially considering the time-frame and era involved. I had the feeling of having receiving last gasp information not previous presented to the reader, solely for the purpose of solving this crime because we'd reached the end of the book.*END SPOILER*Conclusion:A generally well written, murder mystery but with a highly unlikely ending, taking the entire novel down several notches. Too bad really, the story had a definite appealing feel to it...however, as it is 2 to 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"\\"A Death in Vienna\\" is as much a tour around the Ringstrasse of Vienna circa 1900 as it is a mystery. The story---told by author Frank Tallis in short episodes--has its characters and plot revolve around the city's landmarks like the Prater, Graben and Cafe Central while discussing the social and cultural events of the moment. The book's protagonist is a young pyschiatrist/psychoalnalyst, Max Liebermann, who is called upon by a police inspector friend to help solve the \\"locked room\\" murder of a beautiful clairvoyant, which seems to involve the occult.The plot is intricate with not a few red herrings strewn in the protagonist's (and the reader's) path.This a particularly enjoyable book for anyone with an interest in the cultural life Vienna of the early 20th Century, psychiatry, the cultural/social dynamic between Austrian Jews and Gentiles, the Secessionist Movement, pastries, or just a well-told mystery."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Lots of reviews already; lots of synopses, so I won't bother with such standard elements.What's good about it, in one reader's quite eccentric opinion:* The central character, Max Lieberman, is well developed, original, someone you can get interested in.* The 'relationship' of Rheinhardt the detective and Lieberman the psychologist is a good gambit, though it was better done in the Aubrey/Maturin nautical adventure tales.* The evocation of place (Vienna) and epoch (fin de siecle) is quite rich and convincing, but it will appeal only to readers with some historical sensibilities.* It's fun to find Sigmund Freud playing a walk-on role and telling ethnic jokes.What's not so good about it:- The writing style is blunt and clunky; every chapter follows the same pattern of set-up > revelation.- Lieberman's \\"elementary-my-dear-Watson\\" deductions are far fetched and formulaic.- Some readers may disagree, but I found it too easy to 'spot' the real killer, early in the book, despite all the blatant misleading clues.Within the genre of murder mysteries, I suppose I'd call this one \\"first class\\" reading, but don't expect memorable literature."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Tallis tells us that criminology and psychoanalysis started at the same time in the same place, Vienna around the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. Furthermore, says he, detectives and analysts do similar work. Hence there is logic behind his concept: team up one from each school for the solution of crimes. (One might however stretch the comparison and say that archeologists, paleontologists, and many other scientists work similarly too.)Volume 1 of the series which teams up Maxim Liebermann and Oskar Reinhardt gives us a classical Sherlock Holmes - like case: a medium is shot inside her locked living room; neither gun nor bullet is found. There was a mysterious and incomplete note, which could have been a suicide note... In other words, a first class mystery is set up. Initial suspects include a locksmith and a magician. Tallis is not above some cliffhanger tricks, which usually turn me off. I forgive him for them.What recommends Tallis most, in my taste, is his writing. He gives us plenty of credible background on the time and place. Social circumstances of both partners are made clear. Max is from a wealthy Jewish family; he fights against his loving father's wishes for him to join the family business. He wants to continue in his less than promising career as a Freud follower. Oskar is some years older; he has a wife and two teen daughters. He tries to be a modern cop in a stiff conservative political scenario.The two men are friends and partners as amateur musicians: Oskar sings, while Max plays the piano and others. We also learn some about Freud's circumstances at the time.My main take- away from the book, and it is a real find: festina lente! Haste is slow! Says the pathologist, who does the post-mortem, to the impatient cop. A sentence that I can use myself every day, either to remind myself or to remind my surroundings."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"From all aspects this is a truly wonderful find. With characters well formed and intriguing, and a setting that does not disappoint, this read accelerates quickly from page turner to page burner! I will not go into plot details, (you can read that on your own!) but I found the plot to be provocative and the flow of the story to be quite affable. I will surely continue with Mr. Tallis throughout the remainder of this series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"A superb book all around. I wish he had more than 2, with a 3rd on the way. Loved the characters, the plot, and the writing style. Easy to read and a pleasure to behold."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"It might be that I'm not that interested in turn of the century Austria or that I thought I was picking up Dan Silva's book of the same title, but I found this book disjointed and lifeless. Tallis spends too much time describing pastries and music and nowhere near enough time developing the plot or the characters. Too many 50 cent words combined in grammatical \\"terrible twos\\", typified in the epic sentence, \\"Brugel smiled: an enigmatic half smile--opaque and saline.\\" I nearly choked on my cremeschnitte. Tallis' other deadly sin is that each chapter is a vignette that doesn't relate to the previous chapter. Because none of the characters were very compelling, I had to remind myself who they were and why I cared at every chapter - quite \\"irritating and abstruse\\".The locked room mystery with the supernatural \\"how\\" is trite. The parallel plots of multiple personalities, women's rights and anti-Semitism seem like empty impulse buys at the pastry buffet line. I'm off to find that elusive Silva book."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The book could be exciting if they cut it down by 100 pages since not a lot of action or introspection is reflected in the size of the book. I had to skip the middle and go to the end, and I am used to reading even longer texts."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"The characters are ok, but the plot is horribly predictable. The promised \\"twist ending\\" is anything but. Your first guess on the how-dunnit is likely to be right; 400 pages later, it is merely confirmed. A disappointment."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Okay, so mysteries really aren't typically my thing (I read this for my book club), but I couldn't help (eventually, though it took quite awhile) getting sucked in to this story about a woman named Charlotte Lowenstein, whose grisly murder appears, at first glance, to have a supernatural slant. Enter Dr. Maxim Liebermann, a psychologist, and Investigator Oskar Rhinehardt to collaborate on solving the crime. Then add in the usual suspects (in this case, the primary ones are those who regularly attended Frau Lowenstein's weekly seances), and you have yourself a nice little story with some grisly scenes and great interactions between the numerous characters. Best of the book: the many twists and turns that lead you to believe suspect A committed the crime followed by lots more information that leads you to believe suspect B committed the crime (and so on), and excellent character development. Worst: as a fan of writers who write sort of succinctly (like Lois Lowery and Cormac McCarthy), Tallis' level of detail was more than I needed to get what was going on, but my only real problem with the plot (and the reason I rated it three stars instead of four) was the bit about the bullet. To those who've read it, need I say more? Except for the aforementioned plot flaw, A Death in Vienna is a detailed, well-written read. Better: The Hangman's Daughter by Oliver Posch, The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins and The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"While I can appreciate the level of research that Tallis must have done, he seems to have gotten carried away with it. For example, I didn't need to know that a shopper can get items at half price in one part of Vienna vs. another. This information contributed nothing to the story. I have been to Vienna, and he did capture the monuments, etc. very well. But ultimately, I read a novel for the story and characters, and I wish he had focused more on them."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"This is a compulsively readable novel, which is also a mystery. Actually, there are several mysteries. One -- a murder mystery -- is the central event around which the novel is structured. It is one of those cute locked-room mysteries, which, unfortunately, will be reasonably familiar to many detective fiction aficionados (as well as regular watches of \\"CSI.\\" A second, and possibly more interesting, mystery concerns what happened to cause hysterical paralysis in a young psychiatric patient of the main protagonist, Dr. Liebermann, a Jewish doctor in turn-of-the-century Vienna. The Viennese atmosphere is almost magically reproduced, lavishly using the rich musical, artistic and culinary Kultur of the city to bring it to life. Locales are vividly evoked. But the most enjoyable feature of the work are the dozens of accomplished little vignettes made into a profusion of short chapters which constitute the structure of the book. Each chapter has economically drawn characters of impressive subtlety and interest, each with their own short story to tell. The book is often like a collection of many jewel-like short stories, and I loved it. I'm already reading the sequel."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I am always happy to find a literate yet easy to read series and this definitely meets my criteria. The author can sometimes be a little too 'instructional' with his aha! factoid moments (ala Dan Brown) which can be annoying but fortunately he doesn't overdo it. AND... as a bonus there is a story arc with the characters' lives (outside of the crime solving) that carries through the narrative in each book. I thoroughly enjoyed this and all the subsequent books in the series and I am eagerly awaiting the next!"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I loved this book and found myself captivated by the story and the characters. Frank Tallis, through his writing was able to transport me to another time and place which is exactly why I love to read. This and his subsequent 'Liebermann Papers' are some of the most intellectually challenging and interesting murder mysteries I have ever read. Selfishly, I hope he keeps writing them."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"It almost sounds like a riddle: a gorgeous medium, Fraulein Lowenstein, dead in her room. A door that only locks from the inside. A bullet wound but no projectile - and no evidence of the bullet having been removed. A group of potential suspects, all of whom regularly attend the victim's seances. Who did it - and how?This is the problem in Frank Tallis's early twentieth century novel \\"A Death in Vienna\\". When police investigator Oskar Rheinhardt finds himself unable to solve a crime that has seemingly been committed by a ghost or demon, he turns to a friend, Dr. Max Liebermann. Together, the two are determined to prove that the murderer is a mere mortal. Their list of suspects is extensive: a banker and his wife, a seamstress, a locksmith, a Hungarian count, a magician, and an aspiring politician. None seemingly have motive until Liebermann uncovers the victim's huge secret - a forbidden pregnancy. But who was her lover? And is this the same person who was her killer?While \\"A Death in Vienna\\" certainly revolves around the mystery presented above, it also features some interesting side notes - we see much of Liebermann's life, learn about his friendship with Sigmund Freud, follow one of his patients on the road to recovery, and more. We also experience Rheinhardt's frustration at his inability to solve the case in the time he feels that it should have taken. Some may argue that these diversions detract from the novel, but in fact they only enhanced my reading of the book. Sure, it would have worked without them, but it was a glimpse into the characters that I found refreshing. It made them human and infinitely more likeable.Would I recommend this book to a friend? Definitely. And I look forward to reading the next few books in the series."},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"I had higher hopes after reading a review in the Economist. Written as a classic mystery with psychoanalytical elements, this is an interesting although not a compelling effort. Not exactly a page turner because of the introduction of extraneous characters. Some are necessary to set the tone but others just puff up the book. Aside from the mystery there is a nicely done love story that makes you want to read a sequel"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"Turn of the century Vienna - at the time, the social, cultural and scientific centre of a Europe rapidly entering the modern world of the twentieth century - serves as the setting for Frank Tallis' debut historical mystery - a provocative, head-scratching locked room mystery. The very deceased and brutally murdered body of the colourful and beautiful medium Fr&auml;ulein L&ouml;wenstein has been found in her apartments - securely locked and bolted from the inside. The puzzle deepens and becomes even more cryptic as an autopsy reveals a gunshot wound to the heart. There is a very clear entrance wound but there is no exit wound and there is also no bullet to be found in her body.Detective Oskar Rheinhardt, an ardent fan of the newest applications of criminology and psychology, frequently finds himself at odds with his superiors who believe in a more dogged persevering application of older tried and true procedures in the solution of crimes. Rheinhardt and his companion, Max Liebermann, a physician who is also exploring the cutting edge possibilities of his own area of expertise - the developing science of psychoanalysis - believe the murderer can be found among the small group of somewhat eccentric folks that form Fr&auml;ulein L&ouml;wenstein's regular s&eacute;ance circle.To be sure, \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is a very workmanlike, well-constructed and completely entertaining locked room murder mystery but it is also so very much more. It is a wonderfully informative essay on some of the advances in modern medicine that were being developed at that time such as shock therapy, psychoanalysis, blood typing and blood transfusion.It is an enthusiastic travelogue of what is arguably the most beautiful, charming and exciting city in all of Europe - the coffee shops, the scrumptious, tantalizing pastries, the Ringstrasse, the Opera House and the Musikverein, Karlskirche and Stephansdom, the Riesenrad ferris wheel and Prater Park.Through Tallis' wonderful narrative skills, one can almost imagine hearing the romantic music of the time and admiring its flamboyant composers who were such an important part of the Viennese social and cultural scene at the time - Chopin, Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert and, in particular, the contentious and controversial Gustav Mahler, who had held the post of the Director of the Vienna Opera since 1897.Tallis accurately portrays the breathless, often scandalized reaction of the Viennese artistic community to Gustav Klimt's racy and often overtly sexual style of painting that was, in only a few years time, to form the core of the Viennese Secessionist movement now celebrated in the Belvedere Palace.Last but not least, he breathes life into his complex characters who are so credible, so human, so complete and so well-crafted as to turn other more experience and vastly more celebrated authors completely green with envy.For once, I completely agree with some of the marketing information on the cover. The New York Times Book Review called it an \\"elegant historical mystery ... stylishly presented and intelligently resolved.\\" I couldn't agree more. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"A Death in Vienna","review":"On the recommendation of Amazon readers, I gave _Death in Vienna_ a read. I was both impressed and pleased. In Tallis' debut novel, readers are treated to fin-de-sicle Vienna, a city at the zenith of its glory. I was utterly engrossed in his ability to capture the nuances of my second love, (Vienna) and to keep me riveted to the unraveling of a murder mystery. Admittedly, I am a sucker for mysteries set in this time, doubly-so for any story written in the major cities of Central Europe. Yet my enthusiasm for this story goes beyond my personal tastes - Tallis is a great writer.The plot revolves around the murder of a well-known medium, her death made more complex by the fact that her body was found in a room locked from the inside, the gunshot wound to her heart revealling no bullet. Police Inspector Reinhardt, reluctant to attribute her death to supernatural causes, enlists the help of his friend Maxim Lieberman, a psychologist to help solve the crime.As the story unfolds, Tallis gradually reveals details that add complexity to the mystery, as well as showing readers \\"K u. K\\" (royal and imperial) Vienna and its most famous residents: Mahler, Klimt, and Freud. The cafe life of Vienna is also elegantly written, his descriptions of pasteries and tortes are so vivid they almost widen one's waistline. The icing on the cake (or Sacher torte, to stretch the metaphor) was Tallis' contrast of the etheral, supernatural world of the victim with the emerging science of psychoanalysis - and the thin line between science and superstition at the time. Tallis also does a marvelous job of giving character and substance to music: works by Chopin, Brahms, Beethoven and Shubert all play ancillary roles throughout the novel. The mystery will keep you guessing to the last 20 pages, Tallis does such a wonderful job of leaving clues both important and irrelavent.Apparently this is the first of several books featuring the characters introduced here. I will be certain to pick them up. For fans of a good mystery, I strongly recommend _A Death in Vienna_. I likewise would recommend it to those who enjoy historical fiction: characters travel in Viennese society to satisfy readers who prefer this genre as well."},{"Title":"The Call of God: Women Doing Theology in Peru","review":"This is more than a story of women who rose above the oppression of abject poverty; this is a story of the \\"will to live.\\" The story of women who found each other and formed a common cause. This is what can happen when the seeds of hope, in desperate souls, are watered.I have seen, after living in Peru for five years, that the majority of Peruvian women (and most any developing Latin American country) have to face 4 tyrannical forces that oppressing them -- the autocratic church, government that is lethargic & indifferent, condescending, machismo men and ultimately, poverty - debilitating poverty; poverty that can strip a soul of both hope and humanity and ultimately lead to a philosophy/theology of fatalism. This is the story of how the women of El Agustino faced the four totalitarian forces and prevailed. How they rekindled hope among the hopeless and gave directions for a better life to the lost. The women of El Agustino have not slain Goliath but they have kicked the dickens out of his shins.The writer, Tom Powers, S.J (Director of the Center for Ignatian Spirituality), explores, in intelligent manner, howbeit academic, the struggle of women who have come to a neoCatholic theology which highlights both a transformed faith and their social action. Tom Powers' writing is more a 'white paper' on the struggle and modest triumph of these women; the women of El Agustino, Lima, Peru.To Tom Powers credit (as an established Catholic), he 'pulls-no-punches' when critiquing the Peruvian Catholic church and its stilted and oppressive dogma which keeps both women and the poor in servitude to existing political, social and economic systems. He writes \\"The conservative (Catholic) church in Peru exhibits little concern for the social realities and presents itself in the model of the authoritarian and dogmatic institution that thrived before the Second Vatican Council\\".His book is a quick contextual sketch of many aspects of the Peruvian system. Tom Powers discusses the history of Peru, the struggle of democracy and the rise of the 'Sendero Luminoso' terrorists, the Catholic Church, liberation theology and globalization. He exposes the theology of the women of El Agustino, showing how theology, like God, never stays the same. For Powers all theology emanates from the critique of, and struggle against, the sources of oppression. God is defined and redefined in the midst of this struggle. The struggle of these women is fearful, but the fear has not paralyzed themThis is a must reading for any student of Liberation Theology, for those that have an interest in women and their struggle in the world and especially for anyone that is going to live in Peru. Strongly recommend"},{"Title":"The Call of God: Women Doing Theology in Peru","review":"Tom Powers has done his homework...and in doing so has done us (those who want to know more about Peru) an enormous service. &quot;The Call of God; Women Doing Theology in Peru,&quot; is based on his work on the ground in Lima and offers a powerful view of how dedicated women use faith as a means to combat poverty. This book is inspirational and demonstrates how the women of El Agustino work hand and hand with the church to break the chains of poverty and to &quot;take control&quot; of the direction of their lives.Powers patiently explores the oft-mentioned, &quot;llamada de Dios&quot; or &quot;call of God&quot; that the women of El Augustino report and he carefully defines. The author also documents the dangers of promoting change in the barrios of Peru and how &quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot; or &quot;Shining Path&quot; killed Maria Elena Moyano...one of the extraordinary early leaders of &quot;La Federacion Popular de Mujeres&quot; or &quot;The Popular Federation of Women.&quot; The assasination took place in Lima in February of 1992 and takes place in front of her children. Over 300,000 people attended the funeral of Moyano.This 2003 publication reviews the history of the women's movement, the present course and the path ahead. This book also shows what emerges from hard work and faith. And how women do not depend on the unreliable men in the barrios to provide for them. In conclusion, Powers should be applauded for being interested in what women are doing theoligically in the country that is the birthplace of liberation theology.

Its purpose is, literally, to teach HOW to write Chinese characters. It teaches handwriting, both as a practical skill and for the aesthetic pleasure Chinese calligraphy can give. This book is NOT intended to teach the reader Chinese, or mastery of any great number of characters. It teaches the nuts and bolts, starting with the basic strokes, progressing through a variety of radicals (common character elements) to a collection of basic characters and the experience of writing out (and potentially understanding) one complete Chinese poem.The book assumes a high level of seriousness -- the recommended time spent just learning the basic strokes is measured in weeks, not minutes.In addition to the training, the book includes an outstanding introductory section on the different styles of Chinese writing, its evolution, etc., with a collection of elegant examples.As a bonus, the book includes a short discussion of Chinese pronounciation (tones and pinyin) that is the best I've seen.This is definitely the book to start with if you're setting out to learn how to read and write Chinese, before sinking your teeth into one of the larger character compilations."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"This wonderful book opened the door for me to learn a new interest that I never thought possible - learning to read and write mandarin Chinese!

It is oriented toward pen & ink writers instead of traditional brush writers. HOWEVER:1. The book itself is horribly laid out. Each page consists of huge amounts of wasted white space, with the characters themselves, stroke by stroke, confined to tiny, cramped spaces. That ruins any benefit of being able to closely look at and copy the characters. It's as if some book designer looked at the manuscript and said to him/herself, what's the WORST way to present this information? Coupled with somewhat poor resolution of the line art, some complex characters are almost impossible to decode.2. While it's definitely better to have a book oriented toward pen writing than brush writing, the pens recommended are liquid ink fountain pens. Relatively few Chinese people use them except for formal writing (same as with brush work). Instead, they use disposable ballpoint, rolling-ball, and felt tip pens just like Westerners. That would have been a better orientation."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"This book was quite helpful by helping one to gain a better understanding of the background and make-up of Chinese characters which helps one to better appreciate both their historical and aesthetic value.

Transliterations are in pin-yin. This is far and away the best book I've found for learning to write the characters.

I looked through many listmania and reviews on Amazon.com's site (thank you ALL!) and decided to start with this primer. As a hands-on learner, I know now why it has been recommended so highly by those who teach, speak, or are just learning the Chinese language.I am reminded of the first days in school when we had to practice writing our ABCs on a tablet with pencil. We wrote those damned letters over and over again, didn't we? The teacher stood at the blackboard and showed us the best way to make the lines and the order of the \\"character's strokes.\\"This book is the Mrs. Hatfield of my first grade class in Chinese. Each stroke is shown carefully. Each stroke is also shown when it is not written correctly and gives the \\"name\\" of the error (eg. \\"fish hook, etc.)Tao only knows how a Swedish author conceived of and wrote such a wonderful primer to the language. It makes sense, however, that a person whose first language is NOT Chinese would be so specific about the right and wrong way to hold the pen, use the correct posture and table angle, and keep \\"between the lines.\\"I don't get too hard on myself when I can't make a character look the way they does in the book. I look back at how I wrote my name in first grade and now understand the true meaning of \\"penmanship\\". The author urges the learner to practice each stroke at least one hundred times until you go on to the next stroke. Add them together and you get a beautiful character. Don't practice each stroke individually over the course of days and many sheets of paper, and the character resemble the rough letters I wrote in my first grade homeworlk.DO NOT attempt to do this at home (learn to write Chinese characters) without this very important primer. It is invaluable, extraordinary, and shows a great deal of thought and study by the author and those who assisted him in compiling this material. I do my 100 + strokes a day. I don't jump ahead and do what I thought I could do -- \\"Oh that character looks easy, it's just an upside down Y.\\"I know this edition will get dog eared and I will probably buy another to replace this text. It has no equal. Aside from the friends in China who supported me and applaud me for learning their language, this small text tells me that I CAN learn a language and fulfill a longtime dream.

It is a short manual of just 122 pages which, after a brief account of the history and structure of characters, some instruction on how to look them up in a dictionary, and a little about their aesthetics, goes on to teach the user all of the main strokes by using the radicals as models. The book ends with a short list of suggested readings, and a brief guide to Chinese pronunciation. Unlike most other manuals of Chinese Calligraphy, which teach the student how to write with the traditional brush, this teaches the art of writing with a pen, and the models Bjorksten provides for copying, unlike those in many other manuals written for Westerners, are excellent. A book perfect in its kind, and not to be missed."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"I like _Learn to Write Chinese Characters_ a lot, though I think the title is deceptive--it isn't a textbook that will teach you stroke order and meaning of a full range of characters, it's a guide to writing Chinese elegantly. If you've never written characters before, this book is intimidating. Most students of Chinese want to write legibly without doing calligraphy. That said, I've still found the book very useful. It's difficult to write characters that look at all acceptable without paying attention to at least some of the principles set forth in it. Author and translator manage to give you a sense of what's distinctive about Chinese characters that tends to be lacking in textbooks. A fun book for learners, but I'd advise that one start writing with textbook aid and then look at the book for help."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"I'm learning Chinese as part of my major and wanted a good book on characters, specifically for things like stroke order, and picked this up expecting it to be a practical tutorial on how to write basic Chinese characters. What it actually is is more of a guidebook for calligraphy. Now, as that, it is very good. The author definitely conveys the mindset one needs to be a skilled calligrapher, and gives great step by step instructions on how to write well. For that, I don't regret picking this up. However, if you, like myself, are more concerned with learning how to write the 2000 or so most used characters towards the end of being functionally literate in Chinese, this is not the book to purchase. It would be something like teaching calligraphy to kindergarten students. Also, the stroke order illustrations for the characters towards the end of the book, while representing commonly used characters, are really small, and presume that you've gone through the prior half of the book as recommended, that is practicing each stroke for a half hour a day until mastered. If you're learning calligraphy for it's own sake, or just have lots of time, this is great. If however you need to develop a functional writing ability in Chinese relatively quickly, I would personally recommend buying another book first and coming back to this."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"First, I have now been studying Chinese for about 4 years, and this was an early book I got cheap from a used book store. I have changed my mind about it several times over the years. The discouraging part of the book is indicating how many times you would need to practice a character to get good at it. In the beginning, this was definitely true becasue a newbie simply cannot understand the important parts of a character and the relative alignment of strokes. As you acquire more characters, it becomes clearer what is important within the character.In the beginning, this is tough. You need to write them again and again until your hand moves fluidly, not haltingly. This book gives you directions to achieve this, and key pieces (or parts) of strokes that will distinguish your writing from a first grader. There a fixed number of actual strokes, the difficulty is this relative positioning that's the killer.The book is short, but gets to the point. I would have preferred larger and more examples, but he nevertheless gives you what you need.The issue of stroke order has arisen. In my Chinese class, the native-born instructor says we should not obsess on stroke order. BUT it is important. I find that it is easy to correct an order, less easy to recognize characters in beautiful balance. This book helps.So, do I write well. My teacher says I need more work. A ball point pen or pencil does not emulate a brush very well. The book focusses on that. I still think the book in less focussed on \\"calligraphy\\" vs. good character writing. Calligraphy is much more than writing characters accurately: it's an art form usually deviating from a standard printed/written character. This book focusses less on the art form, and more on the appearance and quality of a character. A western analogy: the book improves printing, not cursive script.I really like the book. Before you can do calligraphy, you must be able to write characters in the regular way.

Yet the book still deserves credit on the principle that in remote lands, a poor map made by a foreigner is better than no map at all. In fact, there is an apparent gap in the literature in English on this subject: a perusal of copious material available at Shanghai Foreign Language Bookstore on Fuzhou Rd reveals nothing any better. There is simply no authoritative English reference.In any case, there are numerous points of contention within this book, concerning the presentation of basic strokes, composite strokes, stroke ordering rules, etc. The author presents the \`basic' strokes as follows:heng2, shu4, pie3, na4, tiao3, dian3, gou1, zhe2The author presents tiao3 as a basic stroke. The stroke he is evidently describing is referred to elsewhere in the literature as ti2: \`an upwards diagonal character stroke, rising from left to right; or a lifting brush stroke in painting'. In no other reference can I find this stroke named as tiao3.The author presents gou1, \`a hook stroke appended to other strokes', as a basic stroke with four variants. A hook stroke can definitely be appended to the basic strokes heng2, shu4, pie3, such that these strokes exist in \`unhooked' and \`hooked' variants. But as noted in other references, gou1 can also be be used to create wan1 gou1 \`bent hooked', xie2 gou1 \`slanting hooked', and wo4 gou1 \`crouching hooked' as valid composite strokes, as well as heng2 zhe2 gou1, heng2 zhe2 wan1 gou1, heng2 zhe2 zhe2 gou1, shu4 wan1 gou1, shu4 zhe2 zhe2 gou1, heng2 zhe2 xie2 gou1, etc, which brings the number of variations to a dozen or more.The author presents zhe2 \`to fold, to turn' as a basic stroke with two variants. The author ignores wan1 \`bend, bent', and xie2 \`slanting', which are also used to describe direction or directional changes in composite characters, but with an obvious visual difference from zhe2. A useful visual comparison of the composite strokes (a) heng2 zhe2 heng2, (b) heng2 zhe2 heng2 wan1, (c) heng2 zhe2 heng2 zhe2, and (d) heng2 zh2 heng2 zhe2 should make the differences obvious. In fact, the two variants the author discusses are heng2 zhe2 and shu4 zhe2. These are only two of numerous uses of zhe2 in composite strokes. Other \`variants' of zhe2 include: heng2 zhe2 ti2, heng2 zhe2 heng2, heng2 zhe2 heng2 wan1, heng2 zhe2 heng2 zhe2, heng2 zhe2 gou1, heng2 zhe2 zhe2 pie3, heng2 zhe2 wan1 gou1, heng2 zhe2 zhe2 gou1, heng2 zhe2 xie2 gou1, shu4 zhe2 zhe2 gou1, etc.The author dismisses the study of composite strokes as unnecessary:\\"These composite strokes can be seen as combinations of the eight basic strokes, and it is not really necessary to practice them separately.\\"This is nonsense.The models or example characters the author provides for his basic strokes consistently use basic strokes not yet studied, and composite strokes, which the author dismisses as unworthy of study. For example, like every other book on Chinese calligraphy, the author presents the character yong3, meaning \`forever', as a model for studying the basic strokes, but glosses over the composite strokes used in yong3.In fairness, the literature in English on Chinese calligraphy is inconsistent, contradictory, confusing; and Bjorksten's book is a cut above the sorry lot. But it's discouraging to think that by following Bjorksten's method of practicing basic strokes over and over again, with no feedback from a teacher, that one may be ingraining incorrect knowledge and technique."},{"Title":"Learn to Write Chinese Characters","review":"This is an excellent book for anybody who didn't grow up writing characters to learn how to write them better. sit down with it conscientiously every day for a month, and your character writing (efficiency, speed, grace, memorization) will improve significantly."},{"Title":"The Chalk Doll","review":"I live in the Caribbean and am starting a Caribbean book collection for my kids.

How wrong this would be!They when read in their full context of the Magdeburg Confession of 1550 are rather in the train of Luther. They follow the two kingdoms and the warnings of Luther written in his documents regarding when resistance is not only not sinful, but expected by Christians. The discernment to call such into play is major and significant for both Luther and Magdeburg pastors and is to be sure a last resort that hopefully, prayerfully would never be called into action. However, as in the case of Magdeburg it was.These brave souls stood against the Emperor and his threatening forces in the seige of their city over nothing other than their right to preach the Gospel as they sought to.Whitford's insights into this significant historical event for our time and others is well worth this short but provocative read. One will gain much about not only Magdeburg's Confession but about Luther and Muntzer and Reformation times.Additionally this is well written with excellent footnotes, and bibliography which stretches over forteen pages."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"My only comment is to read Hugh Nibley's &quot;No Ma'am, That's Not History.&quot; This will answer any questions about the remarks in Brodie's book"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"For a more accurate and more complete biography about Joseph Smith, I recommend Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling by Richard Bushman. This book is highly biased and was written by someone who did not know the facts."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am writing now some two years after I read No Man Knows My History. I have been a fool. I thought I could prove whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was true by reading a history book and I am not even a professional historian. I have learned that real historians know that anything more than the facts is bias. The vast majority of facts are unknown by everyone on Earth. Without the facts we cannot draw solid conclusions. We must be careful because what we desire can cause us to make unfair judgments. Do you desire that Joseph Smith was a fraud? Or do you really hope that He told the truth?Apparently, the author of No Man Knows My History also wrote a biography about Thomas Jefferson. This work was largely criticized for being unprofessional. The author, seemingly ignorantly, projects her speculation into the subject of the biography, and presents as fact, intimate psychological analyses, that as a historian, she could not reasonably know. It is interesting that initially, No Man Knows My History mostly received praise from critics. I wonder if these contrary responses have anything to do with the fact that, in general, Thomas Jefferson is well respected while Joseph Smith is not?More importantly, I wish to express the pain I brought upon myself through my casual rejection of goodness, by reading this book, just so I could think of myself as more clever then everyone else. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before I joined the church I had no self-esteem, I blamed everyone but myself for my problems particularly my mum and dad. I had given up hope of ever being in a relationship. I only cared about myself. I was addicted to dwelling on unchaste thoughts, self abuse and looking at pornography. But when I begun to receive the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ my life began to change. Through faith, I gained the power to exercise self-control. The sense of purity this virtue gave me felt much sweeter then the momentary pleasure of masturbation etc. I also began to understand how to love other people better. I started to love my mum and dad and desire to be theirs' for ever. I gained confidence and felt happier then I ever had before. I even started entertaining the idea that one day I would get married. But, unfortunately I insidiously abandoned my faith in God so that I could gratify my desire for intellectual superiority and other lusts. I read No Man Knows My History and spent many hours pontificating about ultimately insignificant facts. Meanwhile I was careless about more important things in life like being loyal, treating people with respect, developing faith in God etc. Because of my bad attitude I got hurt badly. (This is to do with non-member and anti-Mormon friends but is another story). I found myself alone and on my knees with no one to turn to except God. Miraculously, He was still willing to show me love even though I had offensively ignored Him and created problems for others.I love the church founded by Joseph Smith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There I am taught how to do good and love others. The gospel of Jesus Christ as received by Joseph Smith is very precious to me. No Man Knows My History led me to doubt Joseph Smith and my decision to join the church he started. Ultimately, these doubts were injurious to me. I pray that you will appraise your values before you choose to read this book. Instead, read a biography of Joseph Smith that is kinder to the subject e.g. Rough Stone Rolling by Richard Bushman. Avoid making the same mistakes I have.Let me quote from The Book of Proverbs 3:5 \\"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\\" My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, knows I am ignorant like a little child. I do not believe He would lead me to progress in righteousness by trusting Joseph Smith, as He has, if Joseph Smith really was not a prophet of God."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Is this tired old book still around?

Mr. Smith was merely a con artist and like a good con artist he was able to convince others to follow him. Unlike, as other have point out in the reviews; he is nothing close to a profit or a preacher. Yes, he was human, but he chose to manipulate others in his \\"quest\\" to be perfect. The fact that he was human clearly says that he was never perfect and now that he has died shows that he will never be perfect in any stretch of the imagination. I have read book upon books about the Mormon cult (both for and against) and this is not a book that I would recommend to someone. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who would like to be apart of the cult as it is more one sided. A great book to read would be The Kingdom of the Cults By Walter Martin. Not only does this book tell the complete store of Smith but it also tells the changing history of the Mormons."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I find it amazing that so many praise atheist Fawn M. Brodie's anti-Mormon screed and assume that it is well-researched and well-documented. A reader (not even an historian) cannot know how well-researched and documented a book is without, first, doing his/her own research and carefully checking the documentation. Brodie picked and chose her sources, which means that her book was highly slanted. In 1946, BYU professor, Hugh Nibley, briefly critiqued Brodie in a booklet, \\"No, Ma'am, That's Not History.\\" He wrote, \\"Brodie begins her study with the observation that though there is no lack of documents for the history of Joseph Smith, these documents are 'fiercely contradictory.' In that case, it is necessary for a writer to pick and choose his evidence. Now, by the simple process of picking and choosing one's evidence, one may prove absolutely anything. For which reason it is important to ask what principle Mrs. Brodie follows in making her choice. This is not hard to discover. [She] first makes up her mind about Joseph Smith and then proceeds to accept any and all evidence, from whatever source, that supports her theory. The uncritical acceptance of evidence from all sources gives her work at first glance an air of great impartiality. At the same time, she rejects any and all evidence, from whatever source, that refutes her settled ideas.\\"In other words, the lady was 'out to get' Joseph Smith. Nibley's critique is very brief, not the book-long review that Brodie's book deserved. Years later, Nibley provided this update referring to his original pamphlet:\\"When the writer [referring to himself] first read Mrs. Brodie's book 13 years ago he was struck by the brazen inconsistencies that swarm in its pages, and so wrote this hasty review. At that time he had no means of knowing that inconsistency was the least of the author's vices, and assumed with other reviewers that when she cited a work in her footnotes, she had actually read it, that when she quoted she was quoting correctly, and that she was familiar with the works in her bibliography. Only when other investigations led the reviewer to the same sources in ensuing years did the extent of Mrs. Brodie's irresponsibility become apparent. While a large book could (and probably should) be devoted to this remarkable monument of biographical mendacity . . . more than a decade of research abetted by correspondence with Mrs. Brodie's defenders has failed to discredit a single observation made in our 1946 review. . . .\\"Most readers probably won't realize that Fawn M. Brodie's book, published in 1945, is very much outdated. The more recent book, \\"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling,\\" written by historian Richard L. Bushman and published in 2005, is vastly superior to hers, both in research and comprehensiveness, and uses the scholarship accrued since her publication. Bushman's book is available on Amazon.com.Actually, Brodie's book didn't need but one page. All she needed to write was that she was an avowed atheist and therefore Joseph Smith could not possibly have been a prophet of God, because there is no God. Therefore he was a fraud - an impostor. Her atheist glasses colored every page of her book.It is unfortunate that she didn't take the time to write a book about Moses who also claimed to have talked with God, and Jesus who claimed to be the Son of God. She could have exposed them, both, proving them to be charlatans and frauds by reading their minds.On the positive side, Brodie was an interesting writer with truly excellent writing skills."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When reviewing a critical biography, it helps to know who the author is.

Don't waste your time because there are other sources out there that one can find something about Joseph Smith that is more fair. If this was meant as an agenda to discredit the Prophet and the Church then the word objective shouldn't even be used.

Watch the excellent documentary &quot;American Prophet&quot; or read Truman G. Madsen's book on the life of Joseph Smith. Sure Joseph Smith had faults but I know for a fact that he did not make up the Book of Mormon and that it was divinely inspired of God. He was a simple farm boy who had a fantastic experience. He was not a mythmaker and no fake but probably one of the most fascinating individuals ever to grace History. He was faithful to one woman and that was Emma Hale.

This is a lot of beefed up bigotry disguised as objective reasoning - chucked full of conundrums that go unnoticed by those who love a lazy argument. It seems there is more history written on Joseph Smith's \\"scandals\\" than there is on all the scandals of all the presidents of the U.S. combined. I sincerely hope that those who are making the choice to criticize Joseph are enjoying themselves, and having a lot of fun while they can. Or, maybe it's just a perverted attempt to alleviate whatever cognitive dissonance they harbor inside of them. I don't know why they do it.Truthfully, I could destory every other religion I've come across with a five-second question, but I choose not to. To bash other's reasons to believe is neither productive, nor is it what the Savior taught. Shame Shame (especially if you are an author esteemed as a \\"former member\\". Were you truly a member, or only one in name?)"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I have been intrested in Mormanism (not being one or ever wanting to become one) so I read this as background. I was amazed to see how manipulitive Joseph was and just how far people will go when they &quot;believe&quot; even when there is no evidence! The names, places and events in the pre-civil war era were fascinating"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Well I finally finished this book. This is not a book a reader will finish in a short time. Overall the book is extraordinary and certainly was revolutionary in its time.Joseph Smith was a very deceitful con artist but at the same time a very fascinating historical figure to study. It takes quite a charismatic man to have such power over other men, that men willingly let Joseph Smith \\"marry\\" their wives, and then they themseleves take the wives back again after they've had sex with their \\"prophet.\\"And poor little teen-age girls became plural wives to Joseph Smith because Smith convinced them it was their only guarantee to eternal salvation for them and their families. And of course the list of other facts about Joseph Smith that the Mormon church wishes no one knew about is extensive!Surely the Mormon church only made themselves look rediculous when they ex-communicated Brodie, as well as other authors whose only crime was telling the truth about history. Joseph Smith was an American who ran for president of the United States and who started an American born religion - he is a man who will be researched and history books will be written about him, regardless of how much the Mormon church dislikes this.And as American and patriotic and politically correct the Mormon church tries to be, they are very un-American to practice excommunication on its members who are only exercising their freedom of speech. But I'm sure Brodie and all the others didn't care about getting ex-communicated from an organization that is so weird and false. It's just a shame that the Mormon religion is so entrapping and makes it so difficult for its brain-washed members to discover the truth.Fascinating book!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's book is fantastic, and I can't believe it's taken me so many years to get around to reading it. I've read so much heavily edited history--produced by the church. Even when reading it, you can tell there are major omissions. No Man Knows My History fills in the gaps and stands as an excellent, well researched biography of Joseph Smith. The Mormon church is shown to be founded by an uneducated, charismatic loafer.The book starts by demonstrating that Joseph Smith and his father never wanted to really work hard for a living. Joseph ran around telling other people where to dig for buried treasure, even after his supposed first vision. Even though this was ridiculous and deceitful, Joe learned that people were drawn to his magnetic personality--he realized he could make things up and not have to work for a living. He invented a largely boring adventure story so he could have a nidus for his new religion; and hopefully, the proceeds might help his father get out of debt.Joseph would get adulation, money, land, unearned respect, and sexual gratification from many people over his short career before being gunned down by an angry mob. Fawn Brodie does a wonderful job of scrupulously citing her many sources! Those who wring their hands at the truth her biography brings to light should also note that many, if not most, of her quotes are from History of the Church.Leaders of the LDS church exhort its members not to read anything that speaks against doctrines or major members of the church. Though much of what disenfranchised or anti-Mormons say must be taken with a grain of salt, not all of it should be discarded.There are so, so many anti-Mormon writers--and even in Smith's day, books were being written against him, the Book of Mormon, and his church. There is a simple reason for this--he was a fraud. While subtracting some of the venom from these documents, it is clear that Joseph Smith didn't pay his debts (and probably never intended to), seduced teens, lied about fantastical visions and translating abilities, and belittled his wife. No one can read this accurate biography of Smith and believe in the church he founded. He took from others to make his life rich and fun--it caught up with him in tarrings and featherings, jailings and arrests, but these were small pains indeed when a bevy of women were anxiously hoping he'd choose their house to spend the night.Brodie should have won a Pulitzer for No Man Knows My History. Over time, and as more information has become available from historical research, none of Brodie's major conclusions can be tarnished. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is highly readable, compelling, and fascinating. It takes a subject--Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church--that has been written about by countless different people with countless different viewpoints, and makes it into a gripping narrative that will make you turn its pages as fast as you can read them.But this is hardly a history book. While it may profess to untangle the mess of contradictory literature produced by Mormons, Non-Mormons, and \\"Anti-Mormons,\\" all it really does is tangle that mess up a little more.The book is well researched and contains extensive footnotes and easy-to-read appendices, but the conclusions drawn by that research use a very, very questionable methodology. Where Fawn Brodie has a historical Point A and a Point B, she feels no qualms creatively filling in the spaces between them.For instance, she writes that as Joseph Smith concluded writing the Mormon scripture \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" he became troubled that the book dealt only with the ancient \\"Nephite\\" people from 600 B.C. to A.D. 400, and wanted to pay some attention to the then-contemporary speculation that people had immigrated to the Americas after the fall of the biblical Tower of Babel and then dispersed there into different tribes. \\"At any rate,\\" she says, \\"he was impressed with the probability of the 'dispersionist' thesis, for in the last weeks of writing he dictated a terse little history of a people called the Jaredites, which he appended to the Nephite record.\\"Here she has Point A--that there was speculation about the origin of America's early people--and Point B--that the last chapter of the Book of Mormon professes to be about a group of America's earlier inhabitants--but everything in the middle is total conjecture. A complete guess. A theory. It would be fine if she presented it all as such, but here it's presented matter-of-factly, as history. As undeniable truth. Stephen Ambrose, a real historian, would have probably laughed in her face about this sort of thing.The book has a lot of problems like this. It makes a ton of suppositions, and often considers a source valid when it supports her ideas of the way things were, but then renounces those exact same sources when they say something she disagrees with. It's not a perfect read, but still, things do make themselves evident that will probably make most Mormons uncomfortable, but that are hard to deny due to how many different sources back them up. I think every Mormon should read it, just to counter the neutered faith-promoting histories that are generally accepted without question within their faith, but it should still be read with a shaker full of salt. And I think anyone else that reads it should read something else to counterbalance this--either Hugh Nibley's imperfect but insightful \\"No Ma'am That's Not History,\\" or the more recent \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.\\"...Because this is certainly NOT the last word on the subject."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Having been raised to see Joseph Smith as something just short of a God, many members of the LDS church are quite surprised to read the realities of the Joseph Smith story; the natural reaction is, as has been demonstrated in previous reviews, to lump Brodie in the &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; author category and defend the foundations of their faith. Interestingly enough, Brodie was still in full fellowship with the Church at the time of the book's publication, seriously dampening the &quot;anti-mo&quot; theory.Proven time and again in the decades since the publication of &quot;No Man Knows...&quot; is the veracity of Brodie's sources and research. One simply has to thumb through the pages of sources at the end of the book to appreciate how exhaustive Ms. Brodie's research was. Not only does she utilize and cite &quot;objective,&quot; non-mormon sources, but there are a number of quotes taken from church sponsored writings, i.e. _History of the Church_.As a former missionary for the church, I appreciated Ms. Brodie's own objectivity in her writing of _No Man..._. So often the material members of the LDS Church are presented with is so slanted and negative. Ms. Brodie frequently points out Joseph's intelligence, passion, and creativity. Ultimately, Ms. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith feels sympathetic towards the prophet's weaknesses and his sincere desire and urge to be a prophetic holy man.Ms. Brodie makes sense of questions that have long troubled members of the Mormon church, such as polygamy, the causes of Joseph's final incarceration at Carthage, and the continual rotation of early church leaders. In fact, I found Ms. Brodie's hypothesis on the foundations of polygamy far more satisfactory and sensible than any I have ever heard in my 23 years in the church.Though certainly not recommended for the conservative, nonquestioning member of the LDS church, this book will provide an invaluable look at the most prominent character in all Mormonism for those with an interest in the Prophet and his vision."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Wanting to know more about the history of Mormonism, I thought the obvious place to start was at the source - Joseph Smith. There are several bios, but I wanted to avoid hagiography, and so shied away from ones by church members.This bio dates from the 1940s, with a later revision in the '60's, I think. The author was a U Cal historian of good reputation. I appreciate most that she is scrupulous in not taking sides despite the problematic nature of her subject. That's especially important, I think, since Joseph Smith appears to have relished being difficult to describe.I have not finished reading but am pleased with the first few chapters, and will add to this when I've done."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I picked up No Man Knows My History because I like Fawn Brodie's work. It's not an attack on Mormonism. It's not an attack on Joseph Smith. If anything I was struck by the sympathetic portrayal of Smith and his followers. Fawn Brodie doesn't appear to enjoy writing unsavory things about her subject. I'd say the book is a fair and accurate one. The writing is so enjoyable. Brodie wrote nonfiction with a fiction author's flair. I picked it up at nine in the morning and kept coming back to it until I'd finnished it at around midnight."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to pick this book up, as biographies tend to put me to sleep. However, Ms. Brodie's work is without doubt the best biograpy I have read. Her subject, the Mormon founder Joseph Smith, is presented from his infancy up to the time of his death, with the social and political background also covered, and it makes fascinating reading.Ms. Brodie leaves the reader with the impresison that Smith was a con-artist of the highest order, who dreamt up supposed \\"revelatons\\" (\\"thus saith the Lord\\") at will, and I found myself saying \\"this guy can't have had the nerve to do what he did\\". In spite of his deception, the reader can't dislike the character. But it is also made quite clear that Joseph Smith, with all his personal charisma, was certainly no \\"prophet of God\\". He was a first-rate deceiver. The story Fawn Brodie writes reads as an adventure tale of a colorful conman who, sadly, met his end before he mended his ways.Verdict: don't be put off by the fact it's a biography. It's an enthraling read. Especially recommended to LDS readers, who will find out a bit about Smith they won't have known before."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is the definative Joseph Smith autobiography, Brodie is famous for the portraits of men of power and Joseph Smith is far more interesting then Richard Nixon. Brodie really is viewed as an absolute evil in the Mormon church, there is no doubt about that, I remember hearing her name sworn at long before I ever heard of the book. Arguing about religion is a long and no-way street, one can only enjoy the book as a great introduction to the most interesting part of American history. The book reads like a charm and is really entertaining, and regardless of that entertainment value- Brodie has you wondering what is to be believed from her sources, and she certainly succeeded in luring me in to Mormon History, after four years of continual reading, still not able to reach conclusions about Polygamy and the nature of the early Mormon church. These questions Brodie raises throughout her book. I didn't give the book a five star rating simply because I am really annoyed when the author tells us what Joseph Smith was thinking, on the basis of her Freudian analysis. I really don't buy it, and honestly don't know what place that technique has in legitimate history.I recommend this book to those who are willing to keep reading."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Wow! I was really impressed with this book. I only THOUGHT I understood Mormonism!This book traces the beginnings of Joseph Smiths creation, from his beginnings in upstate New York, to his lynching in Carthage, Illinois. The author has researched her subject meticulously, as evident by the bibliography. Many early Mormon writings are quoted, including letters from Joseph Smith himself.After reading this book, I can better understand how people could be deceived into believing the Book of Mormon and other Mormon writings. It is clearer now how Mormonism got a foothold in America--it was birthed into a sub-culture filled with people who, while professing Christianity, really had little understanding of the Word of God, thus could be duped quite easliy. (This by the way, is how Mormonism maintains its grasp today.)I don't care how many other books you've read on Mormonism, or how much you think you know about the subject; you need to read this book.By the way, the author does not &quot;slam&quot; Joseph Smith (or his followers). On the contrary, she seems to have quite a bit of respect for him and what he became."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is appropriately titled because it give a side of the story that is seldom heard within the Mormon religion. Unfortunately, that is also it's only drawback. Brody gives much of the \\"negative\\" information while minimizing the many characteristics that made Joseph Smith such a charismatic and popular figure. It is good that people have a place to learn about Joseph's deceitful living as a youth, the real history behind the Book of Mormon, and his philandering with married women while prophet; but the biography would be much more powerful if it included a more balanced presentation of his strengths, also.Despite the slant against Joseph Smith, this book is excellent. Brody has done thorough and well-documented research and has written in a style that makes this book a pleasureable read. It is a must for anyone interested in American, Western, or Mormon history. However, this is probably not the book that a practicing Mormon who is happy with their faith should read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Without question, Fawn Brodie has produced a masterwork of religious history with this volume. I have been passionately interested in Latter-day Saint history and theology for several years, and feel it would be improper to formulate an opinion of Joseph Smith without consulting this work. Her conclusions will, of course, be attacked by members of the Latter-day Saint faith, but I would hope you would read it and form your own opinion.It's well-written, using a style that is both authoritative and approachable, well-paced and well-thought out. Please don't number me as an opponent of the Saints; I simply investigated their theology as part of a personal quest and found difficulties with it. Certainly, you should read more than one work dealing with subject, and make up your mind accordingly.Make sure, however, that this is a cornerstone of your search-I believe you will find it well worth your efforts."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's work is the starting point for scholars who want to understand the evolution of thinking about Jos Smith. Even the latest work by Bushman owes her a debt of gratitude. Two excellent and carefully crafted refutations of parts of her work were written by Hugh Nibley and Marvin Hill both BYU professors at one time or another. Although a polemic, she does exonerate the Mormon prophet from an age old controversy. Smith had been accused of plagiarizing the Book of Mormon from a manuscript of Samuel Spaulding. Brodie is the first to demolish such an assertion. For that alone it is worth a read.Nevertheless, Brodie, who took a psychoanalytical approach to her biographical subjects often stretched her sources beyond the breaking point. Yet, although psychoanalytic (psycho-history) approaches to biography are out of favor among mainstream historians, she cannot simply be discounted because of her controversial methods. Brodie demonstrates the best and worst of the approach. You can dislike her methodology, but her works cannot be ignored. Some absolutely hated her work on Jefferson and Nixon for taking such an approach.There is a lesson for true believerss who feel threatened by Smith's biography--History is not a discipline one bases his or faith upon."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read this book while living in Idaho in the 60s. Returning to Idaho in 1999 and being confronted more then ever with Mormon society I felt it necessary to start reading the controversial history of the Mormon movement.

A prophet for profit."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie has helped expose the LDS Church as a cult that deserves the attention of both state and federal authorities.

What a tremendous researcher and writer!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When Fawn Brodie began her research for this book she was an active, believing Mormon with no ax to grind. She simply wanted to write a book of the history of the Mormon church.With blessings from the church hierarch including all the apostles and prophets she was given full access to all official church history and records in the church owned vault at their headquarters in Salt Lake City.During her research of the church archives she made a shocking discovery that all Mormonism was based on a lie began by the founder Joseph Smith and his 1st vision which included the Golden Plates, the Book of Mormon, polygamy on and on.As she was about to publish her book and make public the factual findings and history of her church she was threatned with excommunication from her faith if she followed through with publication of the book.Upon publication of the book the Mormon church made good on their threat of excommunication and she was dishonorably kicked out of the church and declared persona-non-grata.Since its publication in the mid 1940's it remains one of the most definitive and accurate accounts of the actual beginnings and history of the Mormon church. Although she is now deceased her book is still used as source material in modern day independent church history publications.Try to find a copy of a recently deceased Mormon apologist's book (Hugh Nibley), where he unsuccessfully tried to discredit her and you will have extreme difficulty in locating one.Her book on the other hand is still widely available even after more than 50 years since it's 1st printing. I think that pretty much says it all.This was one of the 1st books I read which led to my de-conversion from the Mormon cult dogma. It is high on my list of recommended books documenting the real and factual history of the Mormon Church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Read this book 30 years ago and it kept disappearing from local libraries.

She is not like those anti-mormon books where they only say bad things and they only say bad things and look for every bad thing they can find. sometimes the writing gets a little slow and dull."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith is still the best book ever written about him that has been published. In a way, that's a shame. &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was published in 1945, so historians have had 56 years to write a better book. For some reason, that hasn't occurred. Other books written about Smith, such as Donna Hill's &quot;Joseph Smith, the First Mormon&quot; are not nearly as critical and insightful as they need to be.Legitimate criticisms of the book include the fact that it is written more to be interesting than a strictly scholarly work. Brodie does use interesting language and sometimes draws too much on the flamboyant and theatrical parts of Joseph Smith's personality. Additionally, while its been proven Brodie reached a pretty accurate conclusion, in the first edition of her book she relies too much on the so-called &quot;Pearsall transcript&quot; of Smith's 1826 trial for money-digging in Bainbridge, NY. Although, subsequent research bears out most of the conclusions.&quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is not without a number of weaknesses. It is clear that Fawn views Smith as a fraud and an impostor. Perhaps, she didn't look hard enough to find some &quot;middle ground&quot; between &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;. Maybe, Smith really believed he was transcribing ancient scripture and had been annointed by God to be Prophet, when in fact he did not. Some people do suffer hallucinations. In fact, a number of people who are terribly rational most of the time claim to have dreams or revelations occasionally which can only be described as &quot;supernatural&quot;. Another possibility is he really believed he was inspired to lead people to Christ, but invented the Book of Mormon to get the attention of people.Brodie does not adequately take into the account the following in my estimation:1. The sincerity expressed in the writings in Joseph Smith's own journals which have been published and are available to read.2. The fact that the three witnesses to the Golden Plates, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris, never retracted their statements about the Plates and the Book of Mormon, even on their death beds. (although they admitted they saw the Plates with their &quot;spiritual eyes&quot;, as opposed to their &quot;physical eyes&quot;).3. The fact that Smith was willing to face being persecuted, tarred and feathered, and killed rather than give up what he was preaching.There is a puzzle to Smith claiming to be a &quot;prophet&quot; that has never been adequately explained by anyone. Although, there is plenty of evidence refuting Smith's claims and those of his church.The weaknesses, though, are more than offset by the research she did and the material she found. She documents the fact that Smith's father had a dream which later appeared in its entirety in First Nephi in the Book of Mormon, that Smith was tried for being an impostor and moneydigger in an 1826 court proceeding in Bainbridge, New York, that Smith routinely used to seer stones and claimed that with these stones he could see buried treasure underground, and in her 1971 edition, reported the three conflicting accounts that have been given of Smith's First Vision. Finally, she talks about the fact that Smith did not translate other scripture, the Book of Abraham, from Egyptian Papyri as claimed.However, Brodie's greatest contribution is in establishing the context and background in which the Book of Mormon was produced. She talks about the many millenial religious movements where Smith grew up, the commonly held views that Indians were really descendants of Hebrew tribes, anti-catholic prejudice, anti-free masonry prejudice, and prejudice against people with darker skins. One can find elements of all of these in the Book of Mormon if one looks closely enough at it. One who wants too, can see how the Mormon religion and the Book of Mormon arose from this context.No Man Knows My History is a classic. While it would be a mistake to read nothing else about Joseph Smith, skipping the book is missing the best biography that currently exists about him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mormonism, described by Fawn Brodie as &quot;a potpourri of American religious thinking spiced with the fundamental ideal of inevitable progress,&quot; is a religion that couldn't have planted roots anywhere other than America. Its founder Joseph Smith grew up in the eclectic religious stew of early 19th-century Vermont and New York, fertile ground for what Brodie calls the &quot;flotsam of the godly.&quot; Religious eccentrics of every stripe were springing up in his day: Ann Lee's Shakers, Jemima Wilkinson (the &quot;Universal Friend,&quot; who thought she was Christ), John Humphrey Noyes' Oneida community (who practiced free love and communal living), William Miller's Adventists, Joseph Dylks (the &quot;Leatherwood God&quot;), and many other assorted faith healers, &quot;prophets,&quot; circuit evangelists, millenialists and revivalists of varying degrees of eccentricity and ability. Most were short-lived, but the influence of this atmosphere of religious enthusiasm and innovation on Joseph Smith and the religion he invented is unmistakeable. Fawn Brodie's biography of Smith remains a classic, penetrating study even after over half a century. This book is indispensible for an understanding of this peculiar, gifted man and the peculiar religion he created.Joseph Smith was no sideshow preacher, as Brodie convincingly demonstrates against those Mormons who unjustly emphasize his lack of education to give his achievements a more divine appearance. Far from being a simpleton, Smith was a talented man. His exceptional gifts and likeable nature &quot;made the ordinary frontier evangelist seem by comparison all sound and fury.&quot; His theology, &quot;a patchwork of ideas and rituals drawn from every quarter, became in his hands a thing of color, warmth and originality,&quot; though spiritually barren at its core. Brodie rightly remarks that &quot;within the dogma of the church there is no new Sermon on the Mount, no new saga of redemption, nothing for which Joseph himself might stand.&quot; The appeal of Mormonism was then and remains today something not altogether connected with Smith himself. His was an optimistic theology tied to material success, a blend of various Protestant and other doctrines woven together and so heavily injected with Smith's own fantasies and the frontier mythology of his day that its Christianity became only a surface veneer. There is little resemblance between Smith and the religion Jesus founded.In recounting how Smith evolved from a small-time treasure-hunter and magician into a &quot;prophet of God,&quot; Brodie details his many fabrications. There's the &quot;First Vision,&quot; which changed at least three times as Smith built upon it in later years and was almost certainly a late invention to explain earlier events. There's the familiar Mormon albatross of polygamy, initially denied by Smith with great vigor but then promoted as a commandment of God with equal vigor before being conveniently abandoned (also by revelation) by his successors just when Utah was trying to win statehood. Less familiar, perhaps, is Smith's adaptation of the local theories of his day to identify the many American Indian mounds in Western New York and Ohio as the remnants of an advanced North American civilization predating Christ (not an original idea, I was surprised to learn -- many people in Smith's day refused to believe that &quot;savages&quot; were capable of building such things, similar to the modern belief of some that only aliens could have built the pyramids). And of course there are the famous &quot;golden plates&quot; from which Smith allegedly translated the Book of Mormon (seen only &quot;with the eye of faith&quot; by a few friends and family members), and the fragments of the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; later shown to be ordinary Egyptian funereal documents. Smith's embarrassing linguistic innovations got him into a lot of trouble, particularly after Champollion solved the mystery of ancient Egyptian writing by deciphering the Rosetta Stone in Smith's lifetime; fortunately for him, many of his followers were astonishingly forgiving and readily believed him over &quot;Gentile scholars.&quot; Brodie discusses all of this and much more. It's remarkable that Mormonism survived such discoveries, and that many continue to look beyond the powerful proofs of its human invention. One wonders whether Mormonism would have gone the way of so many other 19th-century sects had the early Mormons not been so savagely persecuted and had Smith himself not been &quot;martyred.&quot; Even in Smith's own lifetime the evidence against the divine origins of his religion was devastating, but as Brodie indicates, &quot;There was a great hunger in his people, and they accepted him for what he set himself up to be.&quot; The legend of Joseph Smith long ago outpaced the reality that Brodie presents, and the religion he invented ultimately got along well without him thanks to persecution and the leadership of able men like Brigham Young. Clearly Mormonism has never depended on Smith's personal credibility -- in many ways its origins are unimportant to its adherents, I've discovered. Smith's life is a remarkable tale, captivatingly told by Brodie.Given that Fawn Brodie was excommunicated by the church, one might expect this to be a venomous anti-Mormon book. Instead she produced a thoughtful, fair and balanced biography that demonstrates no small degree of admiration for Smith. Her exhaustive research made extensive use of court records, county histories, newspapers, and Smith's own writings (particularly his lengthy History of the Church, based largely on his own journals). The results are solid and convincing. Many have accused Brodie of excessive psychological speculation, but I found her conclusions sensible and balanced given the evidence; only in the Supplement added to the book in 1970 does she tend a bit toward the psychoanalytical musings in vogue at that time, but mostly she presented further evidence to support the conclusions she drew in 1945. The appendices are especially useful, further exploring the &quot;First Vision,&quot; Smith's many wives, the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; and other topics. Above all, Brodie's fluid and lively writing style makes this a superb biography of a remarkable man."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It took me a long time to finish, but I've finally turned the last page of the book the Mormon church would prefer never be read. I won't pretend to know the Church Of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints' official position on Brodie's work, nor that of the Reformed Church of the same birth; but based on discussions I've shared with Salt Lake Mormons, it's obvious that No Man Knows My History is in direct conflict with the sanitized history the LDS church and its members accept and worship.I picked up No Man Knows My History, first, because I wanted to learn more about Mormon history; and second, because Brodie is a large source of information for many other books on Mormonism, including Under the Banner of Heaven by John Krakauer.Fawn M. Brodie's writing style is dry and academic. Nearly every page features a citation in the footnotes. Most of her sources, in fact, come from church documents like History of the Church, or the published journals and letters of the characters themselves. Joseph Smith created a religion in the time of the printing press, and Brodie built a book on the evidence of the printers.She approaches Joseph Smith as a man, rather than the perfect mouthpiece of God as many Mormons view him. In some ways, this is an unfair approach. Abraham (of the Biblical Old Testament) looks like a crazy person if the reader doesn't accept that Abraham believes he hears the voice of God and acts on His words. On the other hand, Joseph wasn't a perfect man; he wasn't God. Brodie outlines mistakes and failures as well as successes, and this makes Joseph look a little more human that Mormons wish. It makes him more human, which should be a bad thing. Paul (of the New Testament) knew he was a retched sinner, but he's revered almost next to Jesus in the Christian faith (but not quite).I learned some interesting things while wading through this book. Joseph Smith was an interesting man, strange, but still interesting. He ran for President of the United States. I never knew that. He sent Parley P. Pratt, an elder in his church, on a mission to England and then married the man's wife while he was away. He was a Mason and adopted many Masonic practices and rituals into his religion. He was arrested many times, and fraud was often the charge; but on one occasion, warrants were written on the charge of murder. Joe was the mayor of Nauvoo and wrote his own laws, outside the scope of common law, his city charters, or the Constitution of the United States. Although Nauvoo was a dry community, Porter Rockwell (Smith's burly bodyguard and \\"Destroying Angel\\") ran a saloon in Smith's home and hotel until Emma (Joseph Smith's first wife of nearly fifty wives) put an abrupt stop to it. Smith had a love of the finer things in life and lusted after adventure, power, and the ladies (married or not, church members or otherwise). His death was tragic, but his actions in life may have predicted his earthly demise.Fawn M. Brodie's No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is an interesting book. Her work, no matter how controversial is worth consideration. Although it crashes against the re-crafted history of the Mormon church, I recommend it to anybody interested in LDS history--especially present members of the LDS church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Long reviled by Latter-day Saints, Fawn Brodie's life ofJoseph Smith is still impressive for its depth, itsthoughtfulness, and its struggle with the exact nature ofSmith's calling. Her respect for the man is undeniable;what stung when the book was released in 1945 (and must stillhurt today) are her religious naturalism and her conclusionthat Smith's spiritual legacy was &quot;barren&quot;. Yet the book isfar from an anti-Mormon tract or an exercise in debunking;one finishes it with a sense of Smith's extraordinary giftsand a great appreciation for the complexity and confusionof American life in his time, a psychological and religiousferment of which Mormonism is both a product and a legacy."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I first read this when it first came out based on Ms. Brodie's reputation as a researcher and biographer and a historian. As much as the LDS church has tried to discredit her and others who write truthful albeit unflattering books about them and their faith, one has to wonder if having an objective quest is to be avoided at all costs?! This book will open many readers' eyes as to the unvarnished portrait of a very charismatic man. There is no Joseph Smith bashing here: the author lets contemporary, eyewitness accounts stand on their own. One person who knew Joseph Smith might give a rancourous version of something, but Ms. Brodie found many accounts of the same events by various people, including those adherents to theis new religion, even from his wife. If you want to see what this man was all about, where archeological and historical facts bolster or diminish this intriguing person, read this book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A well-researched and documented book. Ms. Brodie did much of her research in the Mormon Church's archives and library, and because David O McKay (a former president of the Mormon Church) was her uncle, she had access to documents that other researchers did not. This biography portrays Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) as a fraud, a con-man, and a seducer of women. For instance, Brodie documents how Joseph Smith defrauded his church members in the Kirtland Anti-Banking scandal, swindling them of their money and their land. Brodie also documents how he sent various men on church missions and seduced their wives while they were away. These are just two examples of frauds Smith perpetrated. The book is controversial because many Mormons feel that the book is an attack on their church founder, and they claim that it is bad history. Ms. Brodie attempted to enter the mind of her subject and explain what motivated Joseph Smith, in this regard she crosses the line between history and psycho-analysis. An excellent read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I grew up 20 miles from Palmyra NY and thought I knew about the Mormon Church, having written reports on it. Then in the '50's I lived 5 years in Salt Lake and knew Mrs Brodie's sister and brother-in-law. These girls were neices of David O MacKay, President of the Mormon Church, and after they served their &quot;missions&quot; in Switzerland, Fawn and Louise each married and Fawn attended the University of Chicage. We were told that Fawn had written the book as a disertation for the University of Chicago and her uncle had allowed her to use the church records for research. (Records not on display for the public.) As a result of her research, she lost her faith in the church and she and her sister and their husbands were what I would call excommunicated. I finally found the book to read in Rochester NY in 1960 by special order because it was not available in Utah and was out of print in other places. I'm happy it has been reprinted but I'll bet it isn't on bookstore shelves in Salt Lake City!!!!! Fawn Brodie has since died. She was a thourough researcher. Her Jefferson biography was well received and reviewed."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie, former history professor at UCLA and former Latter Day Saint, in her above-titled book gives a fair and honest history of the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Joseph Smith. From his early days using folk magic as a \\"treasure hunter\\" to his first vision and beyond, Dr. Brodie tries to present all sides of the enigmatic founder of Mormonism (which isn't always done in books about Joseph Smith). Court transcripts, afadavits of former neighbors, testimonies of faithful followers, witnesses to the golden plates, Joseph Smith's own version of events - Dr. Brodie allows all these voices to speak in this biography. Her writing is interesting, entertaining, informative, and she isn't afraid to draw conclusions based on the evidence at hand. Perhaps she reaches a bit too far in psychoanalysis of J.S., but that's part of what makes this book the page-turner that it is. One doesn't have to agree with all her conclusions to enjoy this book. Overall I would rate this book as \\"excellent.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith. I was surprised to find that it wasn't. Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so this book is written from that perspective. But I found that she was very simpathetic and offered some interesting insight into his life. I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I owe a debt of gratitude to the late Fawn M Brodie. It is largely through this book that many of my questions about Mormonism were answered. It is largely due to her that I left Mormonism.My feelings towards Mormonism are fairly neutral. I certainly do not wish any ill towards Mormons. I continue to hold many of them in very high esteem.However, this does not change the fact that there are very serious historical questions regarding the founding of early Mormonism. I've not yet seen a reasonable, balanced, and scholarly (as opposed to polemical, and Dr Nibley's work on this topic does fit in this category) response to Mrs Brodie's pioneering work."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's book was a landmark book in Mormon studies that forced Mormon historians to write their history a little different than how it was traditionally written. Brodie is a very gifted writer. The book is well written and is very readable. No one interested in the life of Joseph Smith can help but read this book. However the book does have many problems and limitations. Brodie depends on books like E.D. Howe's book \\"Mormonism Unveiled\\" and John C. Bennett's book \\"History of the Saints.\\" These are two primary historical documents but Brodie does not use them with caution as other biographers of Smith. Howe's book was suppose to be statements by the Smith's neighbors and others who knew Smith and his family written in the 1830s, but many historians believe that a lot of Howe's book are forgeries written by the same person. Bennett's book was written to expose Joseph Smith's evil doings in Illinois. The document is clearly written by a very angry fanatic anxious to destroy Joseph Smith. Most every historian knows this type of document needs to be used with caution, something Brodie does not do. Bennett was also a very shady character (see Bennett's biography \\"The Saintly Scoundrel\\" by Andrew Smith).Brodie sometimes does not give good documentation. On page 32 she says Emma probably noticed as Smith's other followers that when Smith spoke with intense feeling the \\"blood drained from his face, leaving a frightening, almost luminous pallor.\\" There is not document or any evidence that Emma ever noticed such a trait.Brodie also goes too far with the amount of wives Joseph had. She should be commended for being the first person to attempt such a thing, but recent scholarship has shown her numbers to be erroneous. She says 48, but it was likely much less, anywhere from 29 to 33 (see \\"In Sacred Loneliness\\" by Todd Compton and \\"Farms[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies] Review of Books\\" Volume 10, Number 2, 1998).When dealing with the witnesses that claimed to have seen the plates the Book of Mormon came from Brodie gets a little stupid. 3 witnesses claimed to have seen both the angel that gave Smith the plates along with the plates. 8 others claimed to have seen the plates. Over half of these 11 witnesses later became angry at Joseph Smith and left his church. But none of them during this time tried to expose Joseph as a fraud (see \\"Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses\\" by Richard L. Anderson). With this fact Brodie does reject the idea of the witnesses being co-conspirators, but the men became victims of \\"Joseph's unconscious but positive talent at hypnosis\\" (page 77). That has got to be the most ludicrous idea I have ever heard! I challenge anyone in the world to unconsciously or consciously to make me see a vision. She has got to do better then that. I understand that when doing secular history (the history I personally prefer) that it is difficult to deal with the witnesses. But the idea that Smith could have put 11 people, many at the same time, under hypnosis sounds stupid to anyone with a brain.A long with reading Brodie's book I would suggest also reading \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\" edited by Newell G. Bringhurst. The essays in this book both praise the book and deal with the books problems. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith: the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill which is much more well balanced biography than Brodie's. Brodie tries to get inside the mind of Joseph Smith too much, something Donna Hill does not do. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism\\" by Richard Bushman. This book is only about Joseph's early life but is very scholarly written. Bushman is currently writing a full biography about Joseph which will likely be better than any others written before. Bushman is a historian on a much higher level than Fawn Brodie or Donna Hill. I would also suggest reading a more recent biography of Joseph Smith by Robert V. Remini"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I'm not a Mormon, but I am fascinated by Joseph Smith, Jr. And if you want to know more about the man there is no better book than Fawn Brodie's outstanding biography. Filled with relevant and damaging facts, interesting quotes, and information the Mormon church would probably like to keep hidden, it's the book you need to read if you want to know more about the Mormon prophet. Even though it can get bogged down in detail it's still a great read. She has certainly done her research on the man and it shows on every page."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie is a scholar with no ax to grind in this fairly accurate reconstruction of the life of Joseph Smith, the star-crossed founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. For Mormons, the book has always been considered a reproach to official church biographies about Smith, but recent historical findings weigh heavily in Brodie's favor in assessing the actual motives and activities behind the polygamist prophet of Mormonism who said &quot;No man knows my history.&quot; Brodie's other tomes on historic figures constitute scholarly, careful analyses of their lives, as is also the case with this effort. The style is pedantic,and could benefit from updating, but the book is well organized and paced. For the serious investigator of Mormonism, Brodie's book is important because the story of Joseph Smith is told in an era before the current visibility and church-line biographies of Smith combined to obfuscate embarrassing or conflicting details in the life of this controversial and charismatic Mormon prophet. For anyone interested in a biography of Joseph Smith that does not have the approval of the LDS Church, yet remains respected among scholars and biographers,No Man Knows My History is a definitive, quotable, and invaluable resource."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mrs. Brodie, a highly respected historian, has written what must still be the definitive book on this charismatic and controversial American figure. Since she was raised a Mormon and had access to documents that the Church normally forbids to outsiders, she is able to separate out aspects of the &quot;official&quot; biographies of Smith from the realities of his life and times. I was struck by how admiring, in many ways, she is of him: unlike the Church's view, which paints him as completely unlearned (thereby strengthening the argument that the Book of Mormon had to be the word of God), she celebrates his energetic inventiveness, the facility with words and ideas that might have made him a novelist had he had a more conventional education. She also has meticulously researched the trends and climate of the times which inform practically every word of the Book of Mormon. A fair and admirable piece of history writing."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Picked this up at my local library after having an interesting discussion with my grandparents. One of my great grandfathers escaped from a Mormon family in Idaho. He had a very rough family life. Back in the day, the Mormons were notoriously anti non Mormon. His mother was a real witch from the accounts of my grandmother. Nevertheless, this interesting piece of family history led me to realize I know absolutely nothing about mormonism. Being a non mormon, there is no reason for me to know anything, but I was hoping this book would go over all the things I never really understood about mormonism especially the history and the rise of Joseph Smith.As a non Mormon, the book only confirms what I heard about Joseph Smith: a total crank. It gets worse or better depending on your view. Joe Smith used \\"seer stones\\" to look for ancient artifacts. He was a well known rebel rouser in the community. Joe Smith, a trouble maker, born into a life destined for farm drudgery was desperate to be somebody. That is at least how I interpret his life. Mormons may be put off by this work despite the author combining the hard facts of his early life. From my perspective, seer stones and necromancy (activities Joe Smith was routinely criticized for engaging in) spell lunatic. Now, Smith was actually a bright guy. Unfortunately, he did not have access to formal schooling. He educated himself much later on life after he could establish schools for his settlements. The fascinating part is how much help he needed to write the book of mormon. However, he routinely jumped the gun and flat guessed on some things, including trying to quote languages he did not quite understand.Every page of this book is filled with dense facts coming together as a long historical narrative. I got dizzy imagining the author combing over all the sources, looking to write a narrative without jumping over the place. I would imagine there is still facts left out. The book moves at a fairly brisk pace, despite how dense it really is. There were a few sections I thought got boring. This could just depend on personal preference, but you really need to pay attention early on. Brodie does not repeat herself. There are some sections I found confusing because I was not entirely sure who she was talking about. This was true in the beginning when she is explaining the Smiths and his family. His Father was named Joe as well as Smiths own son. She jumps from one to the other without notifying. There are also a lot of important side characters who can be hard to remember as the book goes on. There are several aids to Joe Smith, his wife, alleged mistress and side lovers, enemies, right hand men, family members, a college professor who tries to decipher egyptian documents, generals, politicians, and plenty of other people. New people are introduced throughout who are just as important as earlier ones who fade off and then feature prominently later.Overall, this is a masterful work. It's truly impressive how much research went into this. I read the original from 1963. There were some photos in that one. They don't particularly help that much but they are interesting to see. I would definitely recommend reading this."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie was light years ahead of her time. She was by no means some whacked out disgruntled female liberal rebel without a cause, as the Mormon Church would like to paint her. She was a credible scholar, Ph.D from UCLA. A master of history and a person who had the mega courage to expose the Mormon Church as a Fraud! As an EX Mormon of over 46 years, a former High Priest and former Mormon Temple worker, I thank God that I finally had the courage/curiosity to read this landmark book on Mormonism. Written over 60 years ago in the 1940's, Fawn Brodie NAILS Mormonism founder Joe Smith to the cross of truth. The Mormon apologists can only make desperate agonal jabs of ignorance in an attempt to counter punch the world class fighter arguments of Fawn Brodie as she systematically dismantles Joe Smith and his fraudulent Cult."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie wrote the definitive biography of Smith in \\"No Man Knows My History\\".. extensively researched, with a complete set of annotations and bibliographies.

A must read for those interested in the subject."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I just finished reading this poignant, rich and riveting look into the life of a man who was driven by his ego. A very talented story teller and a masterful charmer, he converted thousands in his day to following his church. The self proclaimed \\"one and only church\\". Brodie does her research thoroughly and completely, giving us a look at Joseph Smith the Man. Not a diluted form of history - or a sculpted version, but the facts. It's a must read. From a boy's curiosity about the Indian mounds and treasure seeking, to a man who marries over 50 women and runs for President of the United States. Whether you are a historian buff or just have an inquisitive mind regarding the mormon roots, this book is by far the best book I've read yet. Brodie was consequently ex-communicated from the church for NOT leaving out key components that the church wanted her to - thus giving us a true account of this historical man. A bright, eager, greedy and fallible man."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Outstanding book, and one that's caused a fair bit of consternation among the Mormon faithful. I'd take their criticisms with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I found this to be an excellent review of the life of Joseph Smith and a great read. It was written with candor and let the chips fall where they may. I do not believe that the Mormon church would agree with the many unflattering comments made about their prophet but it seems to be very well researched with supporting documents for each chapter. It also discounts many of the detractors of Joseph Smith as their comments were viewed as possibly coached by his enemies or unreliable due to the passage of time. This only adds credibility to the facts that were included. While this generally paints a very damaging picture of the prophet it does not seem to be a deliberate attempt to smear him or the Mormon church. It appears to be a straight forward well documented historical account. The author was also very sympathetic to the followers for the hostile treatment they suffered in Missouri and Illinois. The author also alludes to the numerous other prophets of the early 1800's. This is a fascinating treatment of an often overlooked aspect of American History. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Sixty and more years have passed since its publication, and \\"Know Man Knows My History\\" remains the best of the biographies of Joseph Smith, founder of THE quintessential American sect, predating Scientology in its (wildly) successful exploitation of human credulity.

Timely reading."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie gained international renown for her landmark work on the life and teachings of Joseph Smith.

Some of the negatives include his \\"revelations\\" compelling women to marry him lest they incur the wrath of God as well as numerous \\"prophesies\\" that didn't come to pass. Her sources are firmly documented and she provides excellent footnotes, which allow the reader the opportunity to conduct further research. As is so often the case, when one lifts the veil on the early history of the Church of Latter Day Saints, one cannot avoid a convoluted, confused, and sordid picture. Like many other impartial scholars before and after her, her sincerity earned her excommunication from the church, which does not feel historic truth should be pronounced unless it is \\"faith-promoting.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This was an extremely well researched and interesting to read book. It is the best biography of Joseph Smith that I've come across."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am an active LDS member and proud to be called a Mormon. I read this book quite a few times, and I am glad I did. After reading this book, I still believe Josepth Smith was called of God to be a prophet, and my opinion of him has not changed. I encourage other faithful Mormons to read it because it tells the story of Joseph from the historical point of view and from a non-believers perspective. Although I question some of the historical facts that Mrs. Brodie used to state Joseph Smith's psychoanalysis, I think she does a good job with most of the historical data and resources she used.I am not embarrased by the origins of our church. I am not embarrassed by the life of Joseph Smith. I think we should embrace our past, the history of our religion, and it will help us understand the times and epoch under which Joseph lived his life in Missouri, Ohio, New York, and Illinois. Yes it is a little odd that Joseph Smith was crowned \\"King\\" in the Kingdom of God by the Council of Fifty, but they are opinions of people who said it many years later. The reader needs to know and understand what is real historical data and what is not. There are a lot of statements and affidavits signed by people. The question remains, did they hate Joseph? Of course, all is understandable, and the reader needs to read this book with an open mind intellectually, and be a scholar in its thorough analysis.I personally liked Brodie's book. I have read other books critical of Mormonism and I think its very healthy to know the church's true origins, past, and the conditions from which it arose.Everything in this life is carried out by FAITH. Where you believe in God or not, whether you are Christian or Muslim, Catholic or Mormon, or Protestant, FAITH is not necessarily based on facts. How can we prove God exists? How can we prove Christ existed or that He was the Messiah? How do we prove the Holy Ghost exists? How do we believe what's in the bible? How do we believe God? ......It's all FAITH. We walk by FAITH. You are either secular or spiritual. You either believe in God or you don't. We all have the freedom to choose, to believe. I for one believe Josepth Smith to be a prophet. I believe Jesus was the Messiah. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. Could I be wrong? Of course! But yet, I have FAITH and I choose to believe, and that settles it.But the book is a great read. I recommend you read it together with (and compare) to Bushman's \\"Rough Stone Rolling.\\" Both are very intellectually stimulating.

I didn't find this to be a \\"bash Mormons\\" book at all. In general, it was interesting to see how a very charismatic, creative, and charming poor kid built an empire.From this book, you get not only specific and detailed information (as much as there is available) but also a pretty balanced look at how the LDS Church began, but more specifically, what was it about this man, and this time, that created the powerful entity that is the LDS church today? Why did HIS church succeed when so many failed?It made me wonder about the founding of other churches. Would we call them \\"cult leaders\\" today, if they hadn't been a product of such recent history, and so much easier to document?So, for me this was a thought-provoking book, and I learned much more than I thought I would when I purchased it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Having been born and reared in the Church, it was not merely a \\"church,\\" but it was \\"The Only True Church on the Face of the Earth.\\" It was my identity, I served a misson, Branch President, H.P., Stake Mission President, sending my son on his mission next week, so imagine my sense of betrayal, and the helplessness and confusion I felt after reading this book. My three (3) pillars were: (1) a young man may spawn a lie, for personal motivations, but he can still be a Prophet, and nobody would carry a lie so far as to be killed for it; (2) No man could have written the Book of Mormon; and (3) the Temple Ceremony is so sacred and unusual that it could not have been imagined or contrived. Well, this most carefully documented, carefully written, carefully researched book, has all but destroyed my pillars. Fawn Brodie, Niece of the Prophet, David O. McKay, has done meticulous research and I have searched for but never found or read an official LDS Church response or debunking of it; I've searched the BYU F.A.R.M.S. site hoping for an academic, honest review of her evidence and hoping to find that Ms. Brodie's research was flawed or dishonest. But despite my motivations and wide-spread search, I have never read a criticism of her sources, or documented proof that her research is false, or that her conclusions are false, only that she had an agenda and some of her conclusions are specious and not well supported. Well, that is simply disengenuous criticism. To say that Ms. Brodie can only prove \\"A, B, C, and D,\\" but \\"jumps\\" to a conclusion that \\"E\\" exists, is simply blind faith ignorance and dishonest academia. This book constitutes the \\"mysteries,\\" that the Church teaches its members to stay away from. But it is hardly a mystery. This book explains with a clarity and insight never-before heard by an LDS member, how Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, how he practiced polygamy before receiving the alleged revelation; why he was tarred and feathered; exactly where the Temple signs and symbols came from; the extent Joseph would go to protect his power and authority, and many more \\"mysteries.\\" No active member of the Church should read this book lest their eyes be opened. It hurts! Truth is not pleasant sometimes, why should it be. I just wanted it \\"straight,\\" I didn't want to be lied to any longer. If the Church simply said, \\"we're a good church, doing good deeds, helping the poor, please give your tithes to help us, I would most certainly go. But the Church says, \\"we are the only true and living church on the face of the earth.\\" To me, that's a challenge to find out for myself, which I did. Now, I am a \\"mormon in recovery.\\" My entire belief system, every single word I've ever been taught, is a lie. I am undone.

McKay, who reprimanded her for using primary source LDS documents to write a less than favorable review of the founding prophet's life. Brodie later became a history professor at UCLA.Published in 1945, yet still a classic, her psychobiography was the first work to hint that Smith was a narcissist who used his vivid imagination to create the Mormon religion. Her book remains the best analysis of the facts giving birth to Mormonism and of the key events that took place in its founding prophet's life.Kay Burningham, Author of \\"An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I don't have a problem with Mormons. Unlike other proselytizers, they're polite, not condescending, and they don't ask you if you think you're saved. One also can't help but be impressed by Salt Lake City, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, their willingness to spend a year as missionaries and their elaborate social structure.However, I do have a small problem with Joseph Smith's claim that an angel told him where to find the golden plates on which the Book of Mormon was inscribed. I wanted to know what there was that tempted Smith's followers to embrace this sort of fantasy. Brodie, who was raised as a Mormon and was eventually excommunicated because of this work, does an excellent job answering that question. I thought she bent over backwards trying to be fair. Smith was born of a very poor family in Vermont and spent much of his youth in Palmyra, New York, where he became a treasure hunter, something like a \\"diviner.\\" People were willing to pay him to hunt for treasure because of the rumors about gold and sliver being buried in the Indian mounds native to the area. Smith used a stone to help him \\"see\\" where the treasure was buried. Eventually this idea morphed into the discovery of the golden plates which became the Book of Mormon. Naturally, no one else could see the plates under threat of death if they tried (Eventually he did find three men to testify they'd seen them, but it took some \\"persuading.\\" Even Smith's parents believed the plates were real, and he knew he was on to something. Here's where the fairness comes in. Brodie credits Smith with amazing talent in respect to improvisation and persuasiveness. Brodie credits Ethan Smith's VIEW OF THE HEBREWS; OR THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN AMERICA as an \\"inspiration,\\" for the Book of Mormon, but she also shows him dictating it to his secretaries, so, either he had an amazing memory or he wasn't faking. She also dispels some of exposes regarding Mormonism, namely The Spaulding-Rigdon Theory.Once Smith accumulated a wide following he moved his flock to Kirkland, Ohio, where he built his first temple. This was also where he received his first \\"revelation\\" regarding polygamy. Apparently the more wives you had, the more credit you received in heaven. His wife, Emma, however, was not convinced. She caught him with the poetess Eliza Roxey Snow, one of his first plural wives, and \\"flung her down the stairs and drove her out into the street.\\"In some respects Smith was his own worst enemy. He antagonized the Missouri settlers, where some of his followers set up Zion, by forming a militia, and he took to calling himself Lieutenant General Joseph Smith. Smith was also unable to control a number of apostates who turned against him, publicizing the polygamy as well as some suspicious land deals.Brodie never does use the term megalomania, but there was no doubt Smith had a high opinion of himself. When the otherwise trustworthy William Law left the church and formed his own newspaper which was critical of Smith's dillydallying (This was in Nauvoo, Illinois, where Smith and his followers went after being driven out of Missouri), Smith had the press destroyed. Once again the settlers were outraged. They also weren't that fond of Smith's militia which he claimed was 100,000 strong and which he bragged would help him form a theocracy.Brodie has been accused of being one of the first psycho-biographers, but she doesn't do a whole lot of that until the Supplement, where she refers to something called \\"pseudologia fantastica.\\" From this she infers that Smith was not necessarily a fraud, but a very conflicted man. In other words, Smith had sort of a split personality. On the surface he was a supremely confidant man, \\"focused and strongly assertive,\\" underneath he was still the crude diviner who preyed on people's naivet&eacute;."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book may be considered &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; by some. I can't say that I agree with everything that was written in the book, but most of it, yes. Contrary to the belief of many LDS church members, Joseph Smith was not a 100% perfect man. He was human, this is something that sould be realized. This is what the book talks about, it is the very, very human, imperfect side of Joseph Smith. And I appreciate Ms. Brodie for having enough courage to write the book. She doesn't seem bitter at anything. I think she did excellent research, she has many quotes from Mormons and Non-Mormons in the book, journal entries etc... from the people who were alive and knew Joseph or knew about him during his time. I recommend this book to people who want to see the church from both sides of the fence."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Although published in 1946, this book remains the definitive biography of the Mormon &#34;prophet&#34; Joseph Smith, Jr. Fawn Brodie's research and detailed footnotes make this an excellent reference book. Ms. Brodie was the grand-daughter of the president of Brigham Young University and niece of the &#34;prophet&#34; David McKay. This gave her unprecidented access to Mormon documents unavailable to nonMormon writers and historians. This is a book for those interested in history. It is absolutely facinating and makes history fun to read. Sadly, Ms. Brodie,s honest exploration of the life of Joseph Smith, Jr. led to her being excommunicated from the Mormon church. However, she has preserved historical truth for future generations. This a a must book for every student of American history or religion."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"With Romney's political ascendancy, I decided to revisit my former and late professor's career-making biography of Smith, who founded Mormonism. Brodie, a disaffected Mormon herself, was criticized for grinding an axe, especially as she concentrates heavily on what she easily exposes as Smith's long history of fraud and irrational thinking. But first and foremost, Brodie was a meticulous historian who built a national academic reputation of unqualified integrity. In this early work she is no less thorough, letting the facts speak for themselves."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Written originally in 1945, this book survives the test of time in it's relevance to Joseph Smith's history. Mormon authors still cite it as a counterpoint to their conclusions, \\"Brodie concluded Smith had 49 wives, but it is better to err on the side of caution,\\" and antagonists like to quote it to challenge the missionaries who just knocked on their door, \\"Have you heard of that book by Fawn Brodie?\\" Though some have attempted to cast this under the \\"anti\\" bus by stating that Brodie was on her way out of Mormonism when she wrote it, Brodie offers a significant challenge to the view of Smith's character and motives that can't be flippantly brushed aside. Brodie is well-known for five other biographies, most notably for Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History. While she does provide the more antagonistic view of Joseph, she provides good balance to Bushman's positive-leaning Rough Stone Rolling."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This account of Joseph Smith provides an interesting historical account with a multitude of footnotes and references which show the painstaking effort of a real detail-oriented historian. I think Brodie's efforts have produced a wonderful objective view of the man, his Mormon church, and an understanding of American society during the early to mid 1800's. It is written in such a manner that it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book has been around a long time. It is one of the most quoted books on Mormon history. Some of the assumptions and some of the conjectures made have since been found to be a little off, the history that was written was a wonderfully accurate look at the man Joseph Smith Jr. Fawn Brodie is a noted historian and author. In the beginning of the book it seemed that Ms. Brodie was sympathetic to Joseph Smith and the Mormons. As her research and the book progressed, the tone became more negative, just as mine did through the research I did."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"At the time of its release, Brodies work was either either a masterpiece or muckraking depending upon the vested interest one brought to the review. Time has not been kind to all of the books details or to the methods of psychological inquiry used by Brodie. Indeed Smith has proven to be far too complex a character for the biographer. Still if one is to engage in a serious study of early Mormonism or the life of America's prophet, Brodie is a foundation work if for no other reason than to set the parameters for what follows. The life of Joseph may never fully be realized in print and Donna Hill's work is actually much closer to reviving the man than is Brodies'. Still this work will hold its place in Mormon history for no other reason than that it motivated many others of all religous persuasions and scholastic ability to look seriously at the latter-day movement and attempt to explain its significance."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"To be certain I had a balanced picture of Joseph Smith, undoubtedly an American original, I bought and read a short biography sold by Deseret Press. In the 160 pages, there was so little substance for so historical figure, I caught myself thinking \\"get on with it\\".That didn't happen. So, back to Fawn Brodie. Her volume gave me at least, starting places to research. This did not happen in the Deseret volume. Although Brodie could be accused of being biased, I believe she let the historical evidence take her where it would."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am more than happy to have read this book in the middle of my LDS-philic book hysteria and during the bicentennial celebration of Joseph's year of birth. As you can see from my other reviews, I have read Signature books a lot and would like to recommend theirs \\"The prophet puzzle\\" and \\"Making of a prophet\\". In these books several new aspects of Joseph Smith Jr are described and his rather multifaceted profile is acknowledged.Fawn can easily be misunderstood depending on the ideological stand of the reader. I for example found Hugh Nibley review/criticism of her book disgusting. Hugh Nibely, whose scholarship I admire and find amazing, has written an awful attacking review, \\"No ma'm, that's not history\\". In some way, critics (mostly conservative LDS but also scholars in autobiography) has seen her book as an effort to prove her own understanding of Joseph. If she wanted to prove that he was false, than she was subjective enough to chose the sources she wanred. Of course, every biographer has to do some filling in of details. When Fawn writes about how Joseph thought or felt in some situations, she guesses of course, but there is always a novellist in the historian and especially in Fawn, with her beautiful literary style. The book should be read as a historical novel, rather than a footnote-stuffed diary encyclopedia - by the way, it has footnotes.!I believe, from what I have read about Joseph and from Joseph, that Fawn hasn't at all exagerated her sources or manipulated them. What she has done, is not believing that Joseph wanted to be a prophet. She clearly shows a knowledge of how to handle different sources. The way she has gathered all the newspaper articles or read all the affadivits, good or bad, shows that she has wanted to give an optimally correct picture of Joseph. Many scholars have agreed about her evolutionary view of Joseph and that Joseph was a child of his time.I believe - being a scholar myself - that Joseph full heartedly wanted to be a prophet and he also became one, for himself and for others! He wanted a united Christianity, a more powerful Christianity. I don't agree with Fawn about him wanting to magnifying himself thru religion, no, he could have managed well, by becoming a politician - which he also tried. I see in Joseph a boy with a spiritual mind.At the same time, she is right about Joseph being the one behind the revelation. He was sure about the fact that his feelings were the same as god's. Brodie managed to refute the Spauldig theory about the origins of Book of Mormon and also the epilepsy diagnosis of Joseph. She introduced the View of the Hebrew as a plausbile source to Book of Mormon, something which BH Robert, the great LDS historian, also had noticed some 10 years before (1930s). She has managed to create a whole person - but too paradoxal, I had a difficulty to understand Joseph thru her.Joseph becomes the one that smoked and drank, but also the one who healed, who cried and suffered with his people. The one who went from woman to woman, but kept in the centre of his heart, Emma, his first wife. The one who was afraid of dying, but who knew that the end was near. Capturing this personality is not easy and Fawn has done an excellent job. But there are answers still to come about this remarkable man.Fawn shows thru her book, that Joseph was a human, not a prophet, but a strategic master in folklore, religion and charistamic leadership. For her, he was a strategic deciever - still in 1971 she couldn't udnerstand why Joseph chose religion for achieving his leadership dreams.Even though Fawn wanted to see an irreligious Joseph behind the \\"Thus saith the Lord\\", she has for me confirmed my picture of a highly spriritual Joseph."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"An outstanding and at times exhaustive history of Joseph Smith, founder of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, the Mormons...Very detailed and excellently researched, but it is obvious--too obvious at times--that the author, Fawn Brodie, has a very low opinion, perhaps even detests, the man she is writing about and the the church he established.One wonders if she, like Scott McClellan's book on the Bush administration, is not getting her \\"pound of (vindictive) flesh,\\" though there may be some truth is what is said.There is a feeling, a strong feeling, that balance and objectivity may be missing from this work, but even so, it is a good, worthwhile read.This much is certain: The church Joseph Smith established could never have grown and become it the church it is today until he passed from the scene. It then no longer had to defend him and his wilding gyrating ideas and visions.It makes one wonder if the Mormon Church has become the church it is today--has found its way--in spite of Joesph Smith rather than because of him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book helps the reader to know the truth about Joseph Smith, and how his story has changed over the years, revised as the LDS church sees fit. Anybody investigating the church should read this book in order to find the truth about the first prophet of the LDS church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If you are LDS you will most likely see the book as \\"anti-Mormon\\". It would be difficult for anybody who is LDS to believe anything in this book that puts Joseph Smith in a bad light. After all, he is revered as the prophet of the LDS church, and a negative reaction to this book would be expected from any believing member of the faith.Catholics do not want to read bad things about their popes, and LDS do not want to read bad things about their prophet.One does wonder what type of man Joseph Smith was. Whether Fawn Brodie was completely wrong in everything she wrote about him or not, this is a fascinating read.Another interesting read is Losing a Lost Tribe and By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus.By the way, don't waste your time on idiotic drivel from Hugh Nibley. He is merely an apologist for the Mormon cult, and his book, No Ma'am, That's Not History is as dull and unresearched a book as you will ever find."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"In studying Mormons as part of a look at some of my ancestors, I hoped to find that this book would be a purely historical account of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. While I found the information on his plural marriages accurate with other sources, some of the arguments on how the Book of Mormon was a reflection of Joseph Smith's life were bent to match the author's stance. Brodie refers to Nephi's family as a carbon copy of Smith's, but she changed the birth order of Nephi to mimic that of Smith. Brodie also claims that Smith was so concerned with the ideal world of the Book of Mormon, that he didn't include harlots or prostitutes. Funny- one of only a handful of women mentioned by name in the Book of Mormon, was a harlot named Isabel in the Alma chapter!Brodie also makes some weird conclusions and doesn't seem to focus on things contrary to her view. For example, Prof. Charles Anthon was visited by Smith's financial patron Martin Harris, and supposedly told him that the hieroglyphics of the record Smith was tranlating the Book of Mormon from were bunk. Yet Harris claimed that before he mentioned where the writings came from Anthon wrote a letter verifing their ancient origins. The letter was then ripped up when Smith was mentioned. Either way, Harris went on to mortgage his farm to help Smith finish translating the book. I think Anthon must have told him something positive, because would Harris financially ruin himself he was told by an expert that Smith was a sham? Brodie doesn't even dwell on this point, she quickly changes the subject.Another point Brodie doesn't look at is why the other men who saw the Book of Mormon (the witnesses) never recanted their statements. Most of them left the Mormon church at one time or another, but none of them ever took back what they said. Many of them called Smith a 'fallen prophet'- meaning that he was a prophet to them, just he did wrong in their eyes later. Brodie's only explanation for any of this is that Smith hypontized these men. If Smith had hypnotized these men, why did they leave his church and ridicule him eventually? Had the hypnotism been broken, don't you think they would realize that the golden plates were part of the trickery too? Again Brodie doesn't go in this direction.With these and other discrepancies, it was very hard to take anything Brodie wrote about seriously. When I later learned that she herself was once Mormon (related to Mormon President David McKay), I was not surprised at her obvious negative bias. There has got to be better books out there on Joseph Smith- more factual and less conjecture."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" was first published in 1945. On various points of detail, it has been superseded by more recent research. Also, one can debate whether or not Brodie's psychological and hypercritical take on Joseph Smith is correct or methodologically meaningful. Still, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" remains the classical biography of the Mormon prophet. Everyone who is interested in Mormonism from a non-Mormon (\\"non-faith promoting\\") perspective must read and come to terms with this book. Brodie herself was expelled from the Mormon (LDS) Church after the book's publication. Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley responded with a piece bearing the sexist title \\"No, Ma'm, that's not history\\". I'm not sure whether it's still available, or whether anyone really cares. As for Brodie, she eventually became a successful history professor and wrote biographies of Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Burton, Thomas Jefferson and Richard Nixon. I haven't read them, but apparently they are heavily dependent on Freud and psychoanalysis, which strikes me as somewhat problematic. (Many American scholars seem to have a very reverential attitude to Freud. Perhaps patricide is in order?)What makes Brodie's biography controversial is her forthright description of Joseph Smith as a fanatic and deliberate con man. In a later edition, she dubs him a megalomaniac. To Brodie, it seems obvious that if somebody makes claims that are patently absurd from an atheist viewpoint, that person must be a conscious liar. In the same manner, she writes off Joseph Smith's earliest followers as easily fooled, manipulated or hypnotized. Today, it's considered bad politic among anthropologists or comparative religion scholars to take matters quite this far. (Richard Dawkins is another case again. But then, he's a biologist.) However, I must admit that I feel a certain sympathy for Fawn Brodie's position. Smith, after all, made some pretty extreme claims!Regular prophets claim to have visions, hear voices or meet supernatural personages. The visionary might be honestly reporting a subjective, psychological experience. He may even be (honestly) delusional. But Joseph Smith claimed to have found, seen and handled an actual material artefact, the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon were \\"translated\\" through the aid of an equally material artefact, the Urim and the Thummim (apparently, some kind of spectacles). Moreover, the Three Witnesses claimed to have had a collective vision of an angel showing them the golden plates, while the Eight Witnesses claimed to have both seen and handled the plates in a strictly down-to-earth fashion. The problem, of course, is that the entire story is absurd: there never were any golden plates, no Urim and Thummim, etc. It's therefore difficult not to charge Joseph Smith with conscious fraud, and his followers with extreme gullibility.The same basic story applies to the Book of Abraham, where Smith did have access to an actual document, but where the \\"translation\\" is fraudulent. Add to this Smith's personal character, which included secret polygamy (while the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy), joining the Freemasons and copying their rituals (while the Book of Mormon condemns Masonry), revisions after the fact of published church material, etc. And what about prohibiting alcohol in Nauvoo while still running a saloon in the main building? Smith's disciples don't inspire much confidence either. The Three Witnesses all left the Mormon Church, yet insisted that their testimony about the golden plates was true. Smith's estranged wife Emma Hale Smith joined a monogamous breakaway group after her husband's death, taking revenge on Smith's polygamous successor Brigham Young by claiming that Smith had never been a polygamist.If this is how religions are usually conceived, I rather stay agnostic!Readers of \\"No Man Knows My History\\" should also consult \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\", a critical reappraisal of Brodie's book edited by Newell Bringhurst.

No real scholars outside the Mormon Church ever took him seriously. As for the people who really want to find out a little more about the Mormon corporation, I recommend the book \\"Leaving the Saints\\" by Hugh Nibley's daughter.

At the time I found the subject intensely fascinating, but the writing struck me as highly fictionalized, with lengthy asides describing Joseph Smith's inner motives and thinking processes -- not biography but psycho-biography. The bottom line was that Brodie pegged Joseph Smith as a deliberate and evil-minded fraud.I recently reread Brodie at the age of 43, now much older and slightly wiser, and also having read a thing or two in my day. On my second reading I wonder if this book might really have more to do with Brodie herself -- a disenchanted and deeply bitter Mormon -- than with Joseph Smith.There is no doubt that \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has a wide influence in the world. I would caution the reader, however, to read at least one other biography of Joseph Smith along with Brodie's -- I recommend Donna Hill's unstintingly honest but affectionate \\"Joseph Smith: The First Mormon\\" (Doubleday 1977).

But . . .1) Brodie's style is readable, which is more of a criticism of everyone else. It flows and is quite readable, which is a rare thing.2) The tone of the book is quite unusual. It is almost a fictional narrative or a speech where the heartstrings are played like a violin. She builds up suspense (which is not quite scholarly), ask questions that she never answers, and peers into the mind and motives of Joseph Smith. She, therefore, is getting beyond the manuscripts and primary sources, and becomes a &quot;scholarly outlaw.&quot; How does she know what Joseph Smith felt and thought unless Joseph Smith tells her? And if there is no journal entry, where is the data? Ascholarship!3) Many of the conclusions about the book are really conclusions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and not about what Ms. Brodie says, inasmuch as people who dislike the Church will agree with her. This is called &quot;multiplying the mirrors, but not increasing the light.&quot;4) Ms. Brodie asserts a &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; interpretation of Joseph Smith: &quot;You don't know how you got there/You just know you want out/believing in yourself/as much as you doubt.&quot; But confidence is the one thing we see with Joseph Smith. Two Temples, several cities planned and founded, three-star general in the Militia, mayor, presidential candidate, prophet, seer, revelator, and father to boot! All this in forty-four years!
