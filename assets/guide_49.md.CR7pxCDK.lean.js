Some are flaps to lift with the character underneath. Some are characters or items that are tucked in and can be pulled out. Some are hidden by velcro pictures that the child can easily pull off and some slide to reveal the character. My grandson loves peek-a-boo, so this book really enthralls him. He is crazy about it. He never seems to get tired of it. And the variety of ways to reveal the characters is very educational for the child.

When it thunders, we do \\"land\\" activities since we are unable to go into the pool. It is hard to keep the attention of 3-6 year olds who came expecting a swim lesson, especially since our \\"thunder kits\\" are geared to older children. I set out to find 3 or 4 books to use specifically for this purpose. I immediately added this one to my cart when I saw it. It is adorable and has a great message. It is quick enough to read to the kids and leaves enough room for safety discussion. It goes along beautifully with the safety pieces we have built into our water lessons also.I put the CD on in my car for my 2 young sons to listen to and they loved it as well. My 6 year old asked why they kept playing the song over and over again, while the 3 year old sang the song over and over again. I told my older son that that was the point.

The main ideas of the story are repeated several times throughout the book and set to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. The song goes \\"Don't jump in 'til you learn to swim, cover your chest with a safe life vest. A grown up must watch you in the pool. You'll be safe if you learn these rules.\\"The book includes a CD that includes reading the of the story as well as different children singing the same song about five times. I did not give this book a five star rating because the children singing on the cd cannot sing and will make the hair on your back stand up if you are any bit musically inclined. There is one track on the cd that has all the kids singing together and is bearable to listen too.Nonetheless, this book and cd are a favorite of my 2 and 4 year old girls (I would not recommend this book for anyone over six). I keep the cd in the kitchen all summer long and I play it while I get breakfast ready, especially on days that we go to the pool or beach. The girls especially love it because the book shows Stewie learning to swim at the YMCA where my girls are also taking swimming lessons.Please note that this book only teaches safety rules and does not provide any instruction for swimming.I will also mention that the author, Stew Leonard, the supermarket entrepeneur, got involved in water safety for children after his son drowned.

However, I really wish I had previewed the included cd before I played it for her, because while she likes to listen to it, the condescending speech of the voice-over actors and the off-key singing of the children are like nails scraping across a blackboard to me.

Asimov traces words like alcohol, isosceles, monosaccharide and yttrium to their Greek, Latin, Arabic and vernacular roots. Discoveries and inventions, both great and obscure, as well as the men and women behind them, are presented in 250 entries of about a page each. We read of the German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen who, in 1895, applied the mathematical variable X to the mysterious rays whose properties he was exploring. Later, the rays were renamed 'Roentgen rays' in his honor, but because their discoverer's surname was so difficult to pronounce by English speaking scientists, the term 'X-rays' stuck. The superstitions and serendipity that comprise so much of scientific history are related with clarity and wit. For example, the Romans considered a freak birth or deformity to be an omen from the gods; hence, from the Latin word 'monere' (a warning) we get the word 'monster'. 'Words of Science' is a handy reference for any library and makes good bathroom reading."},{"Title":"Words of science: And the history behind them (Cadmus books)","review":"Isaac Asimov is a favorite writer because of his prodigious output of books before his death. In fact, he published over 500 works in science, language, Biblical history, in fact, nine out of ten of the Dewey Decimal categories (all except philosophy). During his lifetime he was one of the Big Three of science fiction writers (the other two were Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein).\\"Words of Science\\" is one of his works that crosses two genres: science and etymology (language). Asimov's own use of language is clear and easily processed. He states that one reason science is considered a \\"hard\\" subject is the scientific vocabulary. As he explains, Latin and Greek are international languages and still the language of science today. Because scientific words have the same meanings today as yesterday, any nationality can comprehend the meaning of science words. Since we no longer study Latin and Greek in school, actually discovering the meanings of words is still an exciting process of discovery.For example, we take the meaning of telephone for granted, but consider the etymology. \\"Tele\\" means \\"far off\\" and \\"phone\\" means \\"voice,\\" so when we pick up the receiver, we expect to hear \\"a far off voice.\\" He says that exploring the meaning of scientific vocabulary is really an adventure and \\"one of the most powerful attractions of science\\" (introduction)In \\"Words of Science\\" Asimov begins with \\"Absolute Zero.\\" He explains \\"zero longitude\\" (see Meridian) and \\"zero Celsius\\" (see Centigrade) at the point that ice melts. However, William Thomson extended the idea of this limit to cold. He treated temperature as \\"an expression of the velocity of movement of molecules in a substance\\" (1). The colder a substance, the slower the motion until motion ceases at -273.18 degrees C. Now this is a real zero with \\"absolute\\" as \\"freed from all restraint\\" or \\"absolute zero.\\"Fruit juices, which stand, ferment and become wine and, standing further, become sour. The expression \\"sour wine\\" in Old French is \\"vin egre\\" and later, vinegar. All this leads into the etymology of \\"acid\\" which is related to sourness. Asimov uses a page to explain each word's etymology and usually along the way several other words.Are you ready for \\"ammonia\\" and \\"amino acids\\" because the etymology of these related words is quite interesting and amusing. The Greeks not only spread their culture, but they also adapted the cultures of others into their own. An example is Amen or Amun, one of Egypt's gods. The Greeks built a temple to Zeus-Ammon (Amen) in the North African desert. As fuel was scarce and camel dung was plentiful, it was used in lighting the interior of the temple. The soot that settled contained salt-like crystals, called \\"sal ammoniac,\\" \\"sal\\" for \\"salt,\\" thus \\"salt of Ammon.\\" I'm skipping the long explanation, but \\"amino acids,\\" the most important substances in our bodies carry \\"a reference to the great god Amen of Egypt\\" (11).With the etymology of \\"erosion,\\" Asimov tells a whole history of geological terms. The movement of water from sky to earth and across land to the sea, dragging soil and pieces of rock with it, creating a new bed in the sea, is called erosion (\\"e-\\" \\"away, off, out\\" and \\"rodere,\\" \\"to gnaw,\\" so a \\"gnawing away\\" at the soil. Other related words include \\"gradient\\" or \\"steps\\" in the flowing, \\"cascade\\" from \\"cascare,\\" \\"to fall.\\" Then there is \\"meandering\\" from the Meander River in Asia Minor, and \\"canyon\\" from \\"canna\\" a reed, so Grand Canyon comes from a \\"grande\\" or large reed-like shape.The etymology for gravity is almost philosophical. First, he discusses \\"centrifugal\\" force from \\"centrum\\" or center and \\"fugere\\" \\"to flee\\" with the balancing force, \\"centripetal\\" from \\"petere\\" to move toward. All this leads to \\"gravis\\" or \\"heavy.\\" \\"[T]he attraction of one body for another is gravity and that is the centripetal force that holds the solar system together and everything on earth in place\\" (107). Don't you love it?There are 250 pages in \\"Words of Science,\\" meaning 250 words with one word per page. Other interesting words include hemophilia, hieroglyphic, duodenum, dynamo, meter, parsec, polymer, science, thermonuclear reaction, tide, trypsin, ungulate, virus, and lastly, zero. So we begin with absolute zero and end with zero. Oops, one last word, zodiac. Seven of the twelve constellations are animals. The Greek word for animal is \\"zoon\\" and the diminutive is \\"zodion.\\" In talking of the constellations, you are talking of the animals, so this whole thing is referred to \\"zodiac\\" today.In his inimitable way, Asimov makes words of science both fun and informative. You could keep his book on your bedside table, read a word and related words per day, and have a extended scientific vocabulary in two-thirds of a year."},{"Title":"Speaking Mom-ese: Moments of Peace & Inspiration in the Mother Tongue from One Mom's Heart to Yours","review":"Great little devotional book.

I was watching a movie \\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\" (1956), about a blind man (Van Johnson) overhearing a kidnap and murder plot. The credits said based on a story by Philip MacDonald. The story turns out to be Warrant for X.With a few differences, the story was going paralleling the film then I recognized the name of Anthony Gethryn. It turns out that this book is part of a series that includes Colonel Gethryn. I have even seen another movie with him in it that was totally different from 23 paces but matched the book to a tee. \\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\" (1963) where George C. Scott plays Anthony Gethryn.Naturally the book s more complex than the movie. And just incase you come in the middle of the series as I did; there is sufficient references to earlier novels to keep you from getting lost.

Taylor shares her heartfelt, insightful, thoughtful, painful journey as she searches for and is finally reunited with her adult daughter."},{"Title":"The Turkey Prince","review":"According to the inner flap of this children's book, the story of \\"The Turkey Prince\\" is based on \\"an old Hasidic tale\\" but gives no other source info. However, the tale does have a known author: Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, known as the Breslover Rebbe, who first told it to his disciples in the early 1800s. It was later published in a collection edited by his chief disciple, Reb Noson of Nemirov, and can be found in English translation in \\"Rabbi Nachman's Stories\\" by Aryeh Kaplan (see pp. 479-480).The tale itself is in the common domain, and appears in a number of other collections as \\"The Rooster Prince.\\" (There is some debate as to exactly which barnyard bird \\"truthahn\\" originally referred to in Yiddish.) When I was a child I heard it told as \\"The Rooster Prince,\\" and thought of the prince as being \\"chicken.\\" The switch to \\"turkey\\" is more recent and might be because of modern English slang. In this book, the prince \\"knew he was a turkey\\" in the sense that he did not feel competent to one day become king and lead the people like his father did.Like many classic fairy tales, the original version of the Turkey Prince was not intended to be a children's story. It was a parable that Rebbe Nachman told to his disciples about how to bring non-religious Jews back to Judaism, and/or how to become more Torah-observant onesself. A Jew who has left Judaism has forgotten who he truly is and, like the Prince, is sitting \\"naked\\" -- without the proper \\"garments\\" to clothe the soul. In recent years, Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum wrote an entire Hasidic self-help book based on this story, entitled \\"Under the Table and How to Get Up\\" (available here on Amazon.)The original is quite short (only a page or so) and the prince is already crazy at the beginning of the tale. In this book, we go back and learn that this happened because he got stage fright at a royal banquet. This is followed by a detailed description (with cute illustrations) of how he took off his clothes. In the original, he sits stark naked under the table, but here he keeps his shorts on, which makes it appropriate for everyone in terms of modesty. After that, the book follows the original pretty closely, right down to the dialogue about how a turkey can wear clothes, eat good food, etc.As in the original, various people come to the palace and try to cure the Turkey Prince. In the illustrations here, they are dressed in all sorts of costumes and silly hats, presumably to tempt him to wear clothes. But only the \\"unknown healer\\" knows the secret cure -- to pretend that he, too, is a turkey, make friends with the prince, and convince him that a turkey can do everything a normal person does. The original story ends here, but this book adds a follow-up about what happened to the prince when he grew up.The School Library Journal review rather disparagingly called this a \\"psychological\\" story about \\"self-esteem\\", with a \\"psychiatric\\" cure that \\"may appeal more to adults who espouse its values than to children\\" (word in quotes are the Journal reviewer's). I disagree. This negative opinion is based more on the description from the inside flap (presumably aimed at parents who buy the book) than the story itself, which is no more \\"psychiatric\\" than any other parable. Hasidic children and adults were enjoying this story long before Sigmund Freud. Like many fairy tales, it is a teaching story with a moral, true. But it is also great fun, with just the right amount of silliness to get the point across without being preachy. And, like any good parable, it is a story that grows deeper with every telling.

The characters were exotic and familiar at the same time. The storyline was unusual and touching. The illustrations were so detailed and fun that we spent hours scanning the pages.

We can all learn valuable lessons from this book. My grandchildren loved it."},{"Title":"The Turkey Prince","review":"I'd not heard this story growing up and was pleasantly surprised with it.However -- I had bought this to read to my 3 year old grandchild and I think the concepts are a bit beyond her. Even so, I'm not sure a 4 year old would get it either.The story is very short with only a few lines on each page. The illustrations are odd in a few cases, such as the \\"Par Avion\\" sticker on one page (seems out of place and/or wrong for a story that takes place in the past and not during the time of air mail letters)."},{"Title":"Let's Be Kind","review":"My 20 month old daughter loves this book. She fills in the rhyming words. I love the positive messages in Hallinan's books. The \\"Let's be Polite\\" book is what helped me teach my daughter to say thank you, please, excuse me, and God bless you when she ought. I can only assume that this is going to help her begin to understand the need for and rewards of kindness. The \\"helpful\\" book has been a gem as well!"},{"Title":"Let's Be Kind","review":"P.K. Hallinan is a prolific children's author and illustrator, and Let's Be Kind is just one of several offerings by the author that attempts to teach good behavior. \\"God hands me chances to simply be kind,\\" the text says, then shows a young boy sharing with a little girl, helping an elderly woman carry her groceries, putting his toys away, going outside to make lots of noise, taking care of a sick sister, playing kindly with friends, always saying \\"hi\\" to strangers \\"when Mommy's nearby,\\" bringing a neighbor some food, and gently petting a dog and a cat because the care of \\"God's animals...is entrusted to me and to you.\\"What I Like: Young children aren't necessarily kind or polite by nature; they need to be shown how to care for others. While watching their parents show kindness may be the best way for them to learn this, a book pointing out specific ways a young child can show kindness is a good idea, too. Hallinan's illustrations are, as always, bright and fun, and the text is written in catchy rhyme. It's difficult to write this kind of book without sounding preachy, but Hallinan mostly manages to avoid this by writing in first person, from the child's point of view: \\"I like to be kind; it's a nice thing to be. When I reach out to others, they reach out to me.\\"What I Dislike: Sometimes the text seems a bit forced and once or twice the rhythm is awkward or the rhyming isn't exact. In addition, toward the end, the author states that \\"God blesses kindness in so many ways, that the kindness I give out is always repaid.\\" This may be true, but expecting someone to do a kindness back to you (as is implied by the accompanying illustration) is much too simplistic. Nevertheless, this may provide a great opportunity for parents to talk to their little ones about doing what's right in God's eyes just for the sake of obeying God.Overall Rating: (On the lower end of) good.Age Appeal: The publisher says infant to preschool, but toddlers and preschoolers are more likely to find interest in this title.KristinaEditor at \\"Christian Children's Book Review\\""},{"Title":"Let's Be Kind","review":"this is my husbands favorite book to read to our kids. he loves the message that its important to be kind to everyone and to do it without expecting anything in return. except, of course, for God blessing you with a kind heart."},{"Title":"Let's Be Kind","review":"I love this book and the message in it, but the book was all dented in when we received it....."},{"Title":"A.J.

This book is far more original and entertaining, thouhg some parts of it fall a little flat.In the land of Middle Terra Firma (to avoid copyright infringements I imagine *wink*) &quot;only the very wise and very foolish dared travel the black highway [...] that along this highway a mighty dragon called Smof plied its evil trade.&quot; (Opposite page, an enormous eighteen-wheeler with teeth and flames is about to mow down a wizard, Randolf Shortshanks, who &quot;had long since swapped sorcery for saucery&quot;) Smog is driven by the Dark Rider (think a Black Rider with a roadmap) and mows down anything in front of it.But from the Shyer come the Halfwits (ha!) and a team is sent out to save... whatever: A wizard, a dwarf, four Halfwits, an Elf and a Warrior were chosen. &quot;Badly were they equipped, for there was a mighty shortage of useful things like magic cloaks and broken swords...&quot;Footnoted more heavily than a Terry Pratchett book, this book has a lot of wit and cuteness. It's far more effective than the dated, we-wanna-shock-you &quot;Bored of the Ring&quot;. Names like &quot;Borrownomore&quot; and &quot;Halfwits&quot; are hilarious!The problems? Well, some of the pages fall flat; I also was a bit surprised that after several prose-y pages, we get the ending in poetry. And the numerous illustrations are not the best that one could have hoped for. They would have fit better in a humorous children's book -- realistic caricatures would have worked better for this book, like the hilarious cover. It's also quite short.It's hardly flawless. Nevertheless, if you're a Tolkien fan you may want to pick up this cute little book and get some honest laughs."},{"Title":"Japan (Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East, Vol. 13) (Sacred Books & Early Literature of the East)","review":"It might not be as flashy as other books, but when it comes to raw content this is THE book. It has what anyone would need for an uninfluenced read of the major shinto and Japanese texts. Good for study, but a hard read. Some people like that (I do) so I'm not saying it as a bad thing. Buy this one."},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"I went on a limb here to buy David Sosnowski's Rapture, not caring that there were no sample excerpts to read from because I was so impressed with his Vamped novel. Save your money on this one. All you'll get is a boring, tired storyline that holds no interesting twists, adventure, and the \\"romance\\" part of it was plain disappointing. I think the main points of this story could have been so much more. I donated this one to the library when I was done reading it. Also, it took me a while to even get through it because it was \\"forced\\" reading for me."},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"Seriously - Snosnowski doesn't make a mistake. I read this after I read Vamped: A Novel, cautiously hopeful that it was 1/2 as good - and it was JUST as good. The chances you won't like this book are slim to none. Clever, fascinating, fast-paced and fatly fleshed out. My only problem is that you have to wait so long for the good writers to put out something new, while the bad ones can churn out new stuff every couple of months. Celebrate excellence! Buy this book AND Vamped: A Novel!(And Amazon - put this on Kindle, please - my copy is worn out from so many readers!)"},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"The author's style reminded me of no-one so much as the late, lamented Philip K. Dick. It's dark, it's satirical, it's ever so slightly bitter, and it will stay with you for the rest of your life.It's not the prostelytizing rag the title might imply -- thank Bob for that. This is modern sci-fi at its best; the kind with unreal situations, but very real characters. If there _were_ a disease that made people sprout wings, this is how society would react. And no, it's not always pretty."},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"I read David Sosnowski's novel VAMPIRE before I read this, his first book. I liked it so well, that I looked for and purchased this one also.It is not a story for anyone who is looking for sweet, heavenly beings.

Funny, irreverant, and thoroughly enjoyable.I can only hope that he will be writing more stories - and soon!"},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The angel virus was an innovative and fresh idea. I felt this book was more about being different; whether it be as an angel, a schizophrenic, or physically handi-capped. It's about coming to terms with what your are and moving forward. The romance near the end, said to me, when you accept yourself good things come your way.I also enjoyed the commentaries on prejudice and how a cause and political correctness can be carried to far. Creating a whole new set of problems and discomfort. This is a great read!"},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"I picked this book up while waiting for a dinner reservation one night, and was enraptured (no pun intended) by the lyricism of the opening chapter. After two pages, I knew I had to read this book and immediately purchased it. Exploring an AIDS-like virus which turns humans into winged creatures, and consequently how society deals with the transformation both as individual victims and witnesses, Sosnowski's observation on today's culture, including pop psychiatry, television talk shows, evangelicism, and more, is a sharp commentary on life in the 1990s."},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"This novel starts out with a wonderful idea: what if there were a communicable disease out there that, instead of ravaging your body and killing you, gave you the gift of flight? This is the best of fantasy: take something we fear and escape it by defeating it and giving it a happy outcome.The book begins with what I must admit is my favorite fantasy story ever; who doesn't want to fly? But it departs from this with a half-hearted romantic theme. I think the subject would have been better served by further exploring the social, political, personal, and simple daily living ramifications of a person suddenly sprouting wings.Just because I love to read sci-fi/fantasy doesn't mean that I need the token romantic element, and I'm sure many readers will agree with me - I felt that theme in this book was a bit out of place.Still, the book is well worth a read!!!!"},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"What I liked most about this book is \\"the what if factor\\". As you read it you can't help thinking what if I had wings? The story is simple. One day people get sick and develop wings. With the wings comes flight of course. However, most modern technology doesn't work well around you. So you're asked. Would you give up television, video games, etc. for flight? The characters are very interesting. We watch as they go through this change and how it affects them. This a very good story that begs for further visits to this world."},{"Title":"Rapture","review":"The concept of this story is amazing: an AIDS-like disease causes otherwise-normal folks to turn into modern, living and breathing angels.

The sleeve of the book gives the history of how the song came about as well as a brief history of Gene Autry and Bruce Whatley.

Well crafted from beginning to end, it draws together all the elements of the universe the author has created for the Gallowglass clan, including an encore performance by our favorite villainess, Diane Finister, whose everchanging appearance has managed to confuse the family so far, and whose determined malevolance certainly keeps a plot moving. Quicksilver is a terriffic character, &quot;cut from whole cloth&quot; so to speak, as Stasheff manages to not only make her a very real person, but manages to enlist us in her cause. Even a novice in Granmarye can follow the storyline, and as usual, the fast paced action is a tremendous aid in suspending our disbelief.

This is a coming-of-age novel that is a delight. It fits in well with his sister Cordelia's story, M'Lady Witch, and is much easier reading than his brother Magnus' equivalent tale, Warlock and Son."},{"Title":"Quicksilver's Knight (Ace SF, 00229)","review":"This book was a huge disappointment.

I mean, it felt that Christopher stasheff was trying to pull stuff out of his butt to make it into a working story like the prior Warlock books, but i just didn't buy it. It didn't feel right to me. Currently i am awaiting the book about Gregory, my personal Gallowglass fave, and i'm hoping it'll be up to Stasheff's old standards."},{"Title":"Quicksilver's Knight (Ace SF, 00229)","review":"If you're looking for a read that is not heavy going - this is the book for you.

His writing was just amazing as usual. I loved the fact that in this book he put in a few new twists from his usual writing. I just couldn't put the book down. Every fight was discribe so well. When Stasheff discribed the feelings between Quicksilver and Geffory it just made my heart feel for them as no other book has. It has so many feelings that people can relate to and gives others things to think about. This book gives you every reason not to put it down till the very end, you never know what will happen next!

Elysium, the elders half of the book, provides rules for creating elders (including new elder-specific backgrounds, merits and flaws), ideas on plotlines for elders games, secret &quot;Gehenna Cults&quot;, and tips on how to run a chronicle that lasts for centuries.

He is indeed a great writer."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is a worthy read. Many books start out great but lose their zest after only a few chapters. Not this book, all 239 chapters keep and peak your interests througout his journey. The story is about a man who had everything and lost it all overnight because of being betrayed by his true love. His heart is pierced by her unfaithfulness and his mind by her memories. He travels back and forth across America doing odd jobs and experiencing life as never before. He is robbed, mugged, stabbed, beaten many times, snake bit, sleeps in a little MG for 30 days at a time and still maintains a sense of humor. His travelogue gives the reader a sense of adventure that comes when traveling to strange and far out of the way places many of us will never travel. The most important thing this author gives to the reader is hope, no matter how bad any situation may become. The storytelling of the writer is unbelievable. He speaks the truth to each of us in many different ways. The book is a story of romance and redemption of a lost soul.

This is Jack Vink's autobiography and it reads like a true novel of self-discovery, so sensitive and unnerving at times, a story of trust, and betrayal, and redemption. This story is written in such a universally appealing manner, that it will surely touch the heart of all readers who are blessed with the opportunity to read it, male or female, from all walks of life. This is a story of a man named Jack who dares to love, and trust and believe in a woman so undeserving of his love that she truly becomes the \\"wicked witch of the west\\". The authors commitment and devotion to this woman is so difficult to understand at times that you just want to grab his shoulders, shake him and say \\"Snap out of it!\\". Still, one simply cannot be human without the possibility of hope, and therein lies the strength of his resistance. Mr. Vink is a tremendously powerful writer who speaks with a voice that is fresh, filled with wit, often raw and wholly his own.

BANISHED TO THE RIBBONS OF CONCRETE...an autobiography by Jack Vink...is one of those special gems of literature. In my busy everyday life, finding time to read (which I so enjoy) is a minor miracle. Taking the time to write a review of something that so moves me is a MAJOR miracle! I have never written a book review before but am so compelled to do so now. This is a story of one ordinary, but yet very extraordinary man's travels from hell and back because of circumstances so unexpectedly out of his control. It is written in such a manner that the average reader cannot help but feel they are with this amazing man every step of the way during his ordeal. You will laugh, and cry, and worry, and rejoice, and hurt, and pray for him. You will most definitely fall in love with his soul and wish he finds the \\"true love\\" of his life for which he searches. Perhaps, she may be just a heartbeat away....

A better title would be Memoirs of a Narcissistic Sociopath. No wonder he hate's therapists. He left his wife and children for a stranger because of \\"love at first sight\\". He had unscrupulous illegal dealings in his business life (don't the rest of us wish we didn't have to pay taxes on large earnings!).He made his bed and now he wants us all to join his band wagon and feel sorry for him as he lays in it.He has abused the medium of publishing to get revenge and pity.Note to self: Don't hire an attorney out of the yellow pages.Yes, however, he does have a gift for story telling.Beware ladies, he is now using \\"on line dating\\" to sell his book. Keep your eyes wide open!"},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"For weeks I read Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete snugguled up in bed. The author Jack Vink and I became very close as I went along with him on his ride into hell. I liked his writing style as it is so descriptive you can't help but get tangeled up in his web of despair.This true story starts in San Diego where he is a stockbroker and then overnight he is on the road without a penny in his pocket. It reminded me a little of the movie, Down and Out in Beverly Hills. He his put upon the road when his lover Diane betrays him and the love he possessed within his heart for her. As you read the pain and suffering this woman caused him you cannot help but wonder why he stills feels a very close bond to her even when hungry and no place to sleep. For three years he drives around the country with no destination in mind. He contacts no one and is on a journey that will change his destiny forever. The book does have some tongue in cheek humor but for the most part it is a very sad tale of this man's struggle to survive a very angry world he did not know existed. The book is broken down into three parts, The Journey Begins, Lost in America and The Aftermath. Perhaps the saddest of all is the last part when the FBI indicts him for Obstruction of Justice. You will not believe why they did this to an innocent man. It really does make you wonder about our inept legal system.The book is very long but worth the read. Even though this writer is down and out you feel his strength and wonderful insight through his eyes many of us ignore or are blind to. You feel the pain in his heart yet the hope he dearly holds knowing all women are not as vicious as his lost love Diane.There are so many beautiful stories he tells and experiences you become trapped within his words.It was a wonderful book to get involved in and I do recommend it!"},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete was a very enjoyable read. I didn't think I would like it but my wife insisted. It was so very sad throghout the entire book. My heart went out to this author as he traveled for years across America on his great quest. There were scores of different stories that he tells and my favorite was Brigadoon. I guess I picked that chapter because I to am a romantic at heart. He is a good man but with terrible luck with the women that he seems to be drawn to. There were times of merriment in his travels but for the most part he had the whole world on his back. His writing style always kept you intrigued and guessing what was going to happen nex. Part Three of the book was probably the most interesting, at least for me. This is not a Clancy or Grisham type book but it is just as good. For a true story those writers could not have written it any better. My hat is off to you Mr. Vink, it was a terrific read."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Like most of the others who have reviewed Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete I also throughly enjoyed this true story. I saw it through very similar eyes. I too was betrayed by my special love. Maybe because of this I felt the author's pain throughout the entire book. This story is centered around one woman named Diane who betrayed his love for another. The author Jack Vink tells of his deepest feelings towards this person with tongue in cheek short chapters. Although he had rants and raves about her betrayal and even wishes she runs into a powerline one Halloween night when she was riding her broom it is easy to see he still is madly in love with this woman. I guess it is like that with such a special man. He could not see what was in plain sight to all others he speaks about in this story. His soul is still attached to this tall brunette woman who he still loves. I cried for this man on more than one occasion. I loved his book, his story, but did not like the way the book ended. I though fairytales always ended in happiness, well, not in this case. He is still out there searching for a most perfect love to replace the one he lost. Hopefully he will find it. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete was a great book to read. My only complaint is the sad ending. Look forward to more writing from this author."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"It's hard not to fall in love with Jack Vink. He's a man of conviction, values and yes perhaps one of the last true romantics. I found myself laughing, crying, feeling every emotion he was. In so many ways i saw myself and my life through his words which became very theraputic for me. I hope since this incredible book has come out that you are healed, and still the hopeless romantic at heart. We are not on this earth for eternity we must watch each sunrise..and sunset.. I can not wait to read more from Jack Vink.. Banished is a must read! Their is a part of Jack Vink in all of us.

He wants us all to understand, through his own experiences, that each and every person has the power to choose between good and evil.This book was like an amazing movie that you can actually visualize each chapter as it unfolds.

Mr. Vink gets high marks for marketing!The first thing I noticed when I started reading was that the writing was very Freshman English 101, and yet, ironically, I liked that the book had pictures! So, I figured, who am I to judge? But, judge I did, and not just his misuse of tense. This was once a silly man, who lived a life better than most, complete with large homes and horses,and apparently believed that he was untouchable when it came to his finances and lifestyle. After being \\"betrayed\\" by a woman he dumped his wife and kids for, he ends up in a relationship with a woman he refers to throughout the book as his \\"red-haired angel,\\" in spite of the fact she also consistently didn't do right by him. Made me start to wonder what he was really like to inspire such nasty behavior in his women? The obvious answer was that he was a man who could buy the shallow women he was attracted to, but, couldn't keep them, because in spite of what he might have convinced himself, he was never actually in an honest, true-love, reciprical relationship with either one of them. He was just too busy going on vacations and living the high life with them to notice! Regarding what he had to go on the road for: Jack manages to elude the reader as to the true nature of the business, criminal at best, at the least, unethical. Still, I admit that by the time I was reading about his time in jail, I felt genuinely sorry for him.This is a book written by a man who at what was allegedly the worst time of his life managed to have the presence of mind to tape record his words and take photographs of his travels in banishment. And yes, I am sure he suffered tremendous pain, playing on the good of everyday people to get by, suffering physical ailments, and sleeping in his car (a very nice car, by the way). But, Jack, I've been through a lot worse!Still, I can't not recommend this book, because by the time you're finished, you gotta like this guy, writing warts, bad judgement, self-pity party and all. He's a smart guy! And darn it, he's nice!For those of us who presently remain wannabe authors, the novel weighs in at about 3 lbs. of inspiration: Mr. Vink can finish a book, and so can we!"},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"THE JOURNEY OF THE SOUL OF A MANS BETRAYAL BY HIS LOVEDonna J.

First it is too large to carry around with you like a paperback. Too heavy to take on a plane and too big to sit in bed with or to carry in a briefcase. It is also very expensive. Those are the only two negative things I can say about Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete. There are thousands of good thing to say about this book. This autobiography moved me to tears more than once. This author makes you part of his story if you want to be or not. I loved his writing style, a storyteller's storyteller. Not many authors have the ability to describe in such detail you see and hear everything this author does as he drives back and forth across America completely lost within himself. Like most great and dramatic stories there is a woman at the center of it. One good, and one so evil, he describes her as the wicked witch of the west. Funny, I also went with a wicked lady who was also named Diane. This is a book for not the weak of heart as there is much pain and suffering by this man with nightmares so horrible they leave a lasting impression on you for several days. Jack Vink, the author, is a man I would like to meet and discuss this most eye-opening book on so many taboo subjects. I do recommend it to all guys, because although this writer was destroyed by a woman he shows all of us how to love them unconditionally. I loved every page of it."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"I read Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete every night for the last several weeks. It was a very long book about the life of author Jack Vink. It was his pain and suffering he went through because of love. His betrayed loved who betrayed him, his faded love from an angel and his new love for himself. It is amazing how his writings make you feel his inner-most feelings. I got the book after hearing him talk on public radio. His dialogue on true love was so eloquent I knew I would fall in love with his book. This writer touches your soul and tugs at your heart. I am a young woman and wish to find such a man to live my life with and be together forever. His story is told against the back drop on the backroads of America. It certainly is the most expensive book I have ever bought but was worth every penny. I wish the author well and hope he has found what he seeks. I certainly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This is the very special account of one man.He is no ordinary man...Through circumstances far beyond his control and comprehension, Jack Vink has been forced to live what has become... an exceptional and most extraordinary life...As this truly remarkable story has unfolded before my eyes, my thoughts... my feelings and emotions have been many, and tumultuous...My heart has been filled to bursting for you, Jack, and for your experiences... for your emotional pain... and for your frustrations... for your turmoil and your despair... for your unceasing hope... and for your steadfast devotion to Love, and to nurturing Love... for your joys, both small and large... and for your occasional moments of ecstasy... for each and every vulnerable moment, as you experienced them, during this heart wrenching and gut wrenching time in your life.We have all been so very privileged to be invited into Jack's world.

You can take this trip with Jack and see everything he sees and feel everything he feels as the narration is so well done.

Remember when you both laid in each others arms looking into each others eyes thinking love was perfect? Remember when you broke each others hearts? That's what this book is about, broken love! This author is a man who most definitely has lost his soulmate. Other reviewers have said that this man writes from his heart and he certainly does. I thought it was a great book. Banished to the ribbons of concrete is an autobiography with a few problems but the story overwhelms you. The book is well written and the author is able to get his story out in such a stylish way, you feel the excitement of the chase and the pain of his quite suffering that comes from lost love. The story opens in San Diego where he is a stockbroker living with a lady named Rebecca living in his beautiful home. Immediatly he is forced to leave and ordered to stay on the road for one month so he cannot testify against some crime bosses who work in Las Vegas, people he has dealt with for over twenty-five years. The edict comes down and he leaves everything behind him without telling anyone except his Redheaded angel Rebecca. His first thiry days on the road were terrible with many awful things happening to the man. Beatings become a common thing as he stays on the road always yearning to return home. The people in Vegas who he refers to as \\"The Group\\", keep extending his time until three months have elapsed. By this time he has lost Rebecca, his house, his job, been beaten several times, stabbed, snakebitten, robbed and mugged. When he does return to San Diego, it is no longer his home. It has now become a place of hostility from old friends, past lovers, and even Rebecca. More trouble is on the horizon with the start of the FBI investigation initiated by some one very close to him. This puts him back on the road for another four years with scores of new adventures and heartache awaiting him. You get the feeling as you continue to read, that things like this should not happen to such a nice guy, but like the author Jack Vink points out, \\"NEVER say NEVER\\",anything can happen and usually does to this lost soul. This book is a true story full of adventure and love but I feel the real story is the guts it took for this writer to share his most inner feelings with us the reader. He hides nothing and lets us look into his heart and soul as he survives his trials and tribulation and then is able to put them on paper. This autobiography was never boring and was a page turner from beginning to the end. I think it is one of the better books out there on the subject of lost or rejected love. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This is one of the best \\"can't put down\\" books I've encountered in all myyears of reading.

The author is able to pull the reader into his incredibly painful, soul-searching journey that takes place while traveling the back roads of America. He somehow survives ultimate betrayal and the loss of everything he holds dear in his life. A true American hero and survivor. My thanks to this gifted author for reminding us to never stop loving. It is our only salvation and our only hope of finding true peace. I suspect the next two books of this trilogy will be just as remarkable."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"At first glance this journey appears to be an attempt to protect the author and his clients/investors from potential exposure to certain government agencies. As it evolves it becomes the story of love (lost, found and sometimes shared) and betrayal. Jack's love for Diane and the cost of that love respected no boundaries. Her only unforgiveable sin was leaving him for another man - and taking with her the house they had built as partners. As the miles accumulated, Jack's anger and hate for Diane becomes more intense - followed by remembered moments of passion and tenderness. The important women in his life all seem to be Diane - in one form or another. The other love of his life, Rebecca, ultimately betrays him as well. The most stable and faithful female in his life was Chelsea, the cat. That speaks volumes! As the story unfolds and Jack crisscrosses the country, his descriptions of the backroads and cities are so vivid this reader felt as though she was in the car with him, feeling the breeze while driving down the palm tree lined Victory Drive in Savannah, watching the sun reflect off the golden dome in Lincoln, marveling at Old Towne of Sacramento, whispering as we passed St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans. The angels in those cities(and others along the way) were the saving grace that helped Jack maintain his sanity. Ultimately, the story became one of survival and the discovery of the strength from within to live. The perception of good and evil are definitely influenced by circumstance and presentation (and who pays taxes on the money gained)! I can barely wait to read Mr. Vink's next work."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"There is only ONE word to describe this wonderful storey - ULTIMATE PIECE OF WORK!!Get ready to experience a fresh breath of air folliwing this authour's journey of banishment and his will to survive. Get ready to be surprised with every twist and turn; you will never want to put the bood down....infact I have read it front to back 3 times. If this work was a movie, Jack would be in line for an Oscar!! He has a wonderful gift of captivation his reader and pulling you into his heart and soul! I have never bungee jumped, but I think this would be a great comparisom of what to expect of your emotions....better have a box of Kleenex handy. The betrayal, for the woman he loved, haunts him in mortifying forms of creatures beyond imagination and your skin will crawl as you too will dream of them. During his banishment I felt that Jack would buckle and give up, but he is a very strong man. This book will definitely humble you as you follow Jack through his ups and downs. During ready of how he just made it day to day while living out of a car - I hope I never have to but would at least use some of his survival tricks. One thing is for sure, Jack found the REAL JACK which traveling the backroads to survive. One of the most important lessons learned was, \\"material things do not make a person happy\\". Your heart will feel the love and hatred he acquied for his \\"Red Headed Angel - Rebecca!

When I finished reading it I knew I had found a diamond buried among all those books. The thing that struck me about his book was the picture of the author on the back cover with a few paragraphs he had written. I knew just from those short passages this author was a true romantic at heart. Sort of every girl's dream of her white knight coming to take her away to paradise.Well, after reading this rather large autobiography, (Over 200 chapters) I found out something about myself. I do not often cry but did several times while reading about another person's misfortune in this book. The author Jack Vink has a gift at telling a story so clearly it is like knowing the man himself. Many nights it was only him and I, together trying to get through one trying ordeal after another.He sought true love but found out a beautiful package on the outside does not guarantee a beautiful person inside. He was betrayed by a lady he fell in love with at first sight but was just too blind to see it. This lady is the person that put him on the road to despair and ruin and yet in his heart he never stopped loving her. The story will take the reader many places they have never visited or will never see but thanks to the storytelling ability of Jack Vink they see it through his eyes as if standing next to him.This was indeed a wonderful read and I could not turn the pages fast enough. When I came to the conclusion I gasped out loud and said a silent prayer for this author. \\"G-d Bless you Jack Vink wherever you are, and may your quest of true love be found.\\"Jack, you are the diamond hidden away.......to be found by the angel that mentally desires and craves the gentleman that you are with knowledge of the four basic truths.

He is one of only a few who is not afraid to show his inner most feelings. God, how I love to read his story. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is more than just an autobiography, it is a happening of literary excellence. It is very easy for me to give it a five star reading.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Banished to Ribbons of Concrete is far more than a chronological story of tragic events in the life of the author; it is the story of his metamorphosis from a prideful man to one who changed forever, having learned the only thing in life we can control is our own soul and our own actions.The day-to-day experiences of Jack on the road will certainly captivate and intrigue you, but the deeper story is one of the awesome goodness of some people he meets along his journey as well as the inherent evil unleashed by others. It is the story of betrayal, faith, survival, and hope. As Jack hits unfathomable lows, goodness appears in strange and miraculous forms. It is a story of a man who discovers Providence and karma do exist.Masterfully written with incredible attention to detail, the author takes you through on the back roads of the country and of life. You will share his emotions of outrage, disappoint, gratitude, and despair.Jack's regret for actions taken, decisions made, and the aftermath caused by them consumes him as he searches his very soul. The reader will realize we each have the ability to create our own hell. I see his writing of this book as the redemption of a lost soul seeking solace and perhaps forgiveness.Although this book is large, it should be noted that the chapters are short and there are many half-empty pages. It is not nearly as intimidating once you start accompanying the author on his journey.

It is a poorly-written rant about his x-girlfriend, his tax-evasion and his \\"Oh poor me\\" experiences.

Brother! Then the author uses the book to woo women on match.com?? Is he insane?? Who would want to date him? And he even lies about this age on his singles profile.

I am happy to say it kept me glued to every page as it did the first time. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is neither filtered nor synthesized but is told in the words of this most caring author. He writes from his heart what his eyes see with no consideration to make his autobiography more palatable to the common reader or more commercial for the mass media. It is his truth that traps the reader when they open up his book. What do you choose in a lover? Character or intelligence? This author points out choose character, for intelligence without chaacter is dangerous, but character without intelligence only slows down a good results. It is obvious Jack Vink the author did not listen to his own advice when picking the women in his life. They lacked these traits and he paid the ultimate price for choosing several ladies who were pretty on the outside but so very ugly on the inside. Seldom does one come across a book that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. This one also make you angry at the world we live in that treats him so badly. I had forgotten how truly sad his story is and only wish now that his life is better. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is a book of a self-fulfilling prophecy this author thought about and then lived. I think the moral of this story is, \\"Give up the quest for perfection and shoot for five good minutes in a row.\\" The many stories he tell are universal that we have all experienced but were unable to put down on paper, he does it for us with candor, charm and wit."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"A splendid definitive story of Jack Vink, full bodied and vividly written account of this author's life.

Vink does a stunning job in painting his quest of true love and all the pitfalls one must cross to achieve this most noblest of causes. This will be for a long time to come, the definitive autobiography of one of the most compelling storys of a man's fight for life so he may attain his dream of finding \\"true love.\\" Every chapter kept me glued to the page. Some chapters may me cry, some may me laugh but all were entertaining. This book has everything: wealth, privilege, politics, love, and clandestine love affairs---the golden dance of goddesses and the slow, inexorable decline into tragedy. Vink has written a psychological masterpiece....(He) has, with consummate artistry, constructed a work that is witty and sad, affectionate but just. It is impossible to put down. One wishes it would never end. It is a book I shall not forget and recommend it."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Jack's book is a great geography and history lesson, as well as a story about loving and losing it all, but most of all, it's about hope. Throughout the book, this man goes through hell, yet manages to keep his sense of humor. The writing evokes all emotions -- you will laugh, cry, feel anger and elation as you go through the writer's journey with him. As the story ends, he emerges as quite a different man than when the story began. Just when you think there are no \\"good\\" ones left, Jack proves you wrong. Do yourself a favor... read this book... you won't be sorry... you'll want to thank Mr. Vink for writing it!"},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This is a masterpiece of a book!! I was crying, applauding, angry, hopefuland the full range of human emotions as I shared the life and journey of this man. It is intimate and earthy..touching your soul. It causes one'sown personal reflection on one's own life and the importance of it in thisworld...Mr. Vink is correct that the \\"Noblest cause on earth is to find true love.\\" May you find it Jack, may we all find it..."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete was a very hard book for me to put down. I was astonished that so much evil, and tragedy could prevail in one person's life, time after time. I so much enjoyed hearing Jack's story, and following his travels around our country. One truely has to believe in angels, after reading this book. Not all the events are bad in this book, there are many heart warming situations. I would highly recommend this book, it is very well written."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete was a great read. I found it impossible to put down. What I liked most about this true story of Jack Vink were the many adventures he took and survived, where many of us would have perished. He certainly is a traveler of the world and also a lady's man. While he enthalled me with his stories he made my heart very sad knowing he is till out there somewhere, on some lonely road all by himself. Wish I could give him a big hug and say everything will be alright. I intend to read it again in about a month once I have had to time digest it the first time. Best autobiography I have every read and I do recommend this book to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Great book to get lost in. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is more than just an autobiography, it is a happening. So many delightful and frightful stories of the struggle for this author to survive what was thrown upon him. Many outstanding messages sent to the reader by this dear author. Hope someday to meet him and have my book inscribed. Loved the way he writes to your heart. Hard to explain the way one feels when you complete this huge volume of work. Sort of going out into the desert after a rainstorm and smelling mother nature at her best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"It took me just about 4 weeks to read all six hundred something pages. Although it took me a few chapters to really get into the story, once I did, It was hard not to stay up too late each night to read more. The most seductive thing about this book for me was the brutally honast way it was written. It was interesting to get into this mans head and be able to understand how he was feeling about what he was experiencing. It is an autobigraphy however it is a spiritual journey. He shares his growth and it becomes an inspritional story and will give hope to those who read it no matter what circumstance they may find themselves in. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"I could not put this extraordinary book down. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is so much more than an ordinary autobiography. The author Jack Vink takes us beyond our normal consciousness on the quest for the most holy of causes, \\"true love.\\" With his impeccable style, Vink introduces us to our own evil subconscious. He scares us to death with his nightmares about revenge and then calms us with his endless insights into the beauty that lays abundantly at our feet. He then talks about the pure love or the \\"golden grace\\" we all possess within our own hearts and what it means. What a trip! What a great book this really is and the rollercoaster ride of emotions he pulls out of us.His quest of quests is to find the rarest of rare treasure, that of true love. He takes the reader into such places as a cloistered canyon in Arizona where he talks to the spirits from the past, hoping they can guide him to his final destination......to remote areas, high in the Rocky Mountains, with his hands outstretched to the heavens above asking for divine intervention..........sitting by himself in the middle of a endless prairie in Texas, then lying on his back, looking at the stars in the night sky with tears streaming down his face feeling the loss of a love one................to making love in a teepee in Cody, Wyoming to a beautiful woman that looks like his lost and betrayed love Diane...........................and scores of other recollections and memories that will grab your heart and not let go.Jack Vink's storytelling is truly intoxicating if not right down spellbinding. This author could sell snake oil at a doctor's convention. I could not get enough of his views of nature and this great country in which we live. If you liked Jack Kerouac's \\"On The Road,\\" written over 50 years ago, you will definitely like this masterpiece and epic of traveling on the backroads of America. If there are flaws with this book they are too small to mention. This book is a mystery until the very last page where the reader finally gets, \\"IT.\\" That is probably what makes it a great read! In short, this book is about a man who came to realize, even though it was extremely painful and changed his life forever, \\"Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.\\" This is indeed a true love story for all those star-crossed lovers out there.......for the young and old...........for the down and out.................and especially for those who have not yet healed from the betrayal of their true loves."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This book is a MUST read for those who like non fiction and fiction! How amazing!The author weaves an honest tale of beautiful sunrises and some very grim sunsets. I saw this as a journey both physically and metaphysically. It is a road trip through the colorful back roads of America, the cigar smoke filled rooms of our government, and the darkest depths of our hearts. It is filled with wonderous historical facts and insightful views of what America is all about. In his search for \\"true love\\" he never really questions why he feels this need. It may be a metaphor for trust, reality, and where his life is destined to be at peace."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"As Jack was driving down his ribbons of concrete, I seemed to be trailing with ribbons of emotion. I mean that as a compliment to the author's ability to bring you into his experiences by his writing. The book itself is as large as a textbook, and I wondered as I began if I would ever get through it. However, it was an easy read and one of which I had a hard time putting down. Actually, I did throw it down at one point, mad at the author for his, what I thought, grave stupidity with certain women. But I got over it and read on. I found myself laughing and crying, especially at the end where he ties everything together so beautifully. It is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Masterfully written, Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete is a true story of love, betrayal and everlasting faith.Betrayed by his once true love who turns him in to the IRS, and fearful of an IRS probe into his investment group, the author is banished for months to a road trip across America in his decades old MG Roadster. This book is so riveting and heartfelt that the reader relives his incredible journey; from the unbelievable hardships he endures and wonderful people he meets to the horror that he faces upon his return. Compelling and heartbreaking, it is a true story of love, faith, morality and deceit, reaching deep into your very soul. A must read.Suzanne Berglind"},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This book was exciting, exhausting and exhilirating. The writing wasinteresting and compelling. I could not sometimes believe the exigent,menacing situations that drove this man to his journey and yet hemaintained his optimism and skills to continue towards his successin spite of all his setbacks. I did get frustrated towards the endbut knew that I had to continue just as he had to do it. It is a truestory and yet a metaphor for us all. I felt inspired by this bookand glad that a person such as Jack Zink has managed. I wished himwell and still do. I have heard that Part 3 of this book is beingmade into a movie. I think that it could also be a great television seriesin the FX or HBO Genre. It is thrilling and human."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"This is how an autobiography should read, exciting and full of detail that is pleasing to the mind. The author Jack Vink has a keen eye when it comes to what is happening in America. He weaves his most extraordinary story around some serious issues in this country. He is a common man but does uncommon and incredible things during a very dark period in his life. He is a man of honor, valor and undying courage to endure all that was thrown upon him. Out of all the things on this earth that are important to all of us, he values his word as his one most sacred possession. His story of the betrayal from a woman named Diane is one for the books. It is not a boring autobiography like many others, you actually don't want the story to end. I found myself caught up in his plight more than once. Sometimes I yelled outloud, \\"Don't do it, you fool\\" and after he did, sometimes had to shut the book for a day but I always returned to it, ready for his next adventure. I can see why it was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Did it ever win that most coveted award? Anyway, just wanted to say I enjoyed it immensley and recommend it to anyone who wants to read about a real man who shares everything with his readers. Quite a journey Mr. Vink. I hope women are treating you much better than the black-widow that crossed your path in San Diego."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"I loved the story and the writing style of this author. He took me places I have never been and will never see but through his eyes I experienced it anyway. A wild book to read with all the ups and downs Jack Vink went through. He has become my favorite writer. Hope to read more of his works."},{"Title":"Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete","review":"Read the book in only two days, that means I stayed up one of those nights. I could not put it down. Would love to meet this author and tell him I am his other perfect half in which he searches for and look very much like the one who betrayed him. The book was a splendid read. I had to keep reminding myself, it is a true story, his story of survival. I also looked him up on the net and there is much more biographical material on this truly amazing, romantic, and one of a kind man. Banished to the Ribbons of Concrete was a delight!"},{"Title":"Pinocho","review":"This book, Pinocho, is terrific for Hispanic kids, ages 4 to 8, or even American kids who want to learn Spanish. The illustrations are good and the text is just the right level of difficulty. There is also an accompanying CD which contains games and an oral presentation of the story - perfect for improving one's oral comprehension. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the text in the book and the oral presentation are not perfectly in sync. They are the same for the most part, but contain several differences. Nevertheless, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pinocho","review":"Our family speaks Spanish at home so we naturally wanted fairy tales in Spanish as well. They are close to the true stories including that Pinocho was smoking in the the island. I chose to read the story the way it is written, but my mother in law thought I was nuts. Anyways, the illustrations are nice and it is traditional Castillian Spanish.

With so many books available on natural horsemanship, horse behavior and training it's easy to accummulate a whole equestrian library rather quickly. There are really only two books you can't go without though:Gincy Bucklin's What Your Horse Wants You to Know and Sarah Blanchard's The Power of Positive Horse Training.Not only are both books full of great suggestions but more importantly they help bridge the language barrier between horse and human.

I have done and read a significant amount of natural training methods so some of the ground work stuff was fairly elementary and sometimes not as 'natural' as I would like - found it to be a little incongruent with the 'positive' and 'saying yes' part of the title.None-the-less the under saddle training suggestions - especially teaching the half halt and circle work - were invaluable and made this book a worthwhile purchase.

Ms. Blanchard is a keen observer of horse language and behavior and writes this book with an eye toward truly establishing leadership in your relationship with your horse thru the things that are most improtant to your horse: security and comfort. The book discusses the horse's needs in comparison to human needs and what this all means in every aspect of your training. It details not only the rewards you should have in your &#34;rewards toolbox&#34; but also the very nature of these rewards and what they mean to your horse. She talks about progressive exercises for you and your horse with the inclusion of the purpose of the exercise, what rewards are in your toolbox for that exercise, and follows with step-by-step instructions for the exercise.

Also, I found a couple of really big factual errors.So I'd say, if you are new to Active directory, get this book, and read it quickly once over to get the concepts, but then put it down and find something else to really dig into the details of AD - Something such as the Distributed Systems Guide from the resource kit.One other thing, the binding on my copy broke and now the book is physically falling apart.

Unfortunately, it didn't.I don't really understand what the author had in mind when writing this book - it's obviously targeted at the beginner/novice, but doesn't have nearly enough info in some areas to get a beginner going, and at the same time has lots of extraneous info that's of absolutely no use to a beginner.Specifically, the section on casting is woefully insufficient for someone who's never cast a flyrod before (just a few pages) and there's absolutely no information at all on what to do after you're got your fly out there. Do you cast upstream or down? let it drift or retrieve it? how fast? How to fish dries vs. wets vs. streamers vs. nymphs? Nothing. Nada. Zero.At the same time, the author devotes 60 pages to fly tying. Now I suppose that folks who get involved in flyfishing may want to start tying their own flies at some point, but is it really appropriate to have 60 pages of step-by-step instructions on how to tie 12 different flies in a book targeted towards folks who've never fly fished before?Overall, I can't recommend this book to anyone - if you're a beginner it won't tell you what you need to know to get started, and if you're more experienced you already know 90% of what's in here."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I'm a big fan of the Dummies series but found this one very disappointing. The author goes into excruciating detail about some peripheral parts of fly fishing, while completely glancing over some of the essentials.Much of the content is anecdotal at best, to the point that it feels like the author is just trying to fill up pages. For instance, he devotes two entire pages to what kind of vest he thinks you should have, and the section on sunglasses is almost laughable. The chapter on \\"Great Rivers for Trout\\" across the US belongs in a niche guide and feels hopelessly out of place in a beginner book.In the mean time, Kaminsky completely skims over the essentials. While there are plenty of lectures about why you should get a case for your rod, the section on casting feels like an afterthought. I find it difficult to believe that the author has ever tried to teach a beginner to cast, nor could any beginner (like myself) learn to cast from his brief explanation. Other areas that left we with a lot of questions include fly selection, how fly fishing is affected by the seasons, and actual fishing strategies and techniques."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"When I first started to flyfish back in the day, this was the only guide I had to get me started.

Peter also went out of his way to give warmwater flyfishing and saltwater flyfishing the space they deserve--so this book isn't just about trout and salmon.

Because some are just too good to pass up. I am currently working through the &quot;heavy&quot; section of &quot;Science Without Numbers&quot;, wherein Hartry Field shows how to do Newtonian gravitational physics without abstracta. This book is a brilliant and *highly* unorthodox defence of mathematical nominalism, the view that there are no abstract mathematical objects. While subtle in execution, the basic ideas behind Field's approach are straightforward (though probably his gifts of exposition make them seem simpler than they are).The traditional problem of the nominalist, or would-be nominalist, is to account for the truth of mathematical statements, apparently about abstract objects like numbers and sets, without supposing that there really are any such objects. Not so for Field; he sidesteps that issue entirely by showing that it makes no difference, so far as *applications* of mathematics are concerned, whether mathematical theories are true or false--what is really necessary is that they be consistent and satisfy a few other weak conditions. If consistency (plus these other conditions) are satisfied, then the mathematical theory will be *conservative* whether or not it is true. This means that any inferences made from nominalistic claims--claims that don't entail that there are abstracta--to other nominalistic claims with the aid of the theory are such that the conclusion is formally entailed by the nominalistic premises *alone*. So, if your concern is to make inferences about the concrete world from premises about the concrete world, you can use any math you like (all good mathematical theories are conservative, as Field demonstrates), because the ultimate *conclusions* you draw will in fact be entailed by nominalistic claims alone. Thus, whether the math used for the inferences is true or not, your conclusions will always be right--so long as your nominalistic premises are. All you need to do in order to *use* mathematics, then, is to take care that your *physical theory* is formulated nominalistically. This can always be done, at least provided that your theory could be expressed in (possibly higher-order) predicate calculus, because of a logical theorem which allows us to re-axiomatize the nominalistic consequences of *any* such theory from purely nominalistic axioms. One might however wonder whether such an axiomatization would be usable--whether there are any *interesting* nominalistic physical theories. It turns out that there are; Euclidean geometry as axiomatized by Hilbert, for instance, is a nominalistic theory. The heart of Field's book, which I'm now reading, is to show that there are interesting nominalistic formulations of typical scientific theories, like Newtonian physics. (He says that his approach here could be easily extended to classical electrodynamics with special relativity. I believe him.) Given such a formulation, abstract mathematics becomes merely a useful tool, making essentially nominalistic inferences easier--as natural scientists have always thought. If there are good reasons for adopting Platonism in mathematics, Field has at any rate shown that the use of mathematics in science (and everyday life) is not one of them."},{"Title":"The healthy cat and dog cook book: Natural recipes using nutritious, economical foods and good advice for happier, healthier and more beautiful pets","review":"I have followed a natural diet with my 5 dogs for a year now, and I have seen SO MUCH improvement in all of them; even the 12 year old with his awfull allergies.

It was a quick read and seemed to be easily guessed. Good for a airplane trip or something."},{"Title":"Kiss Of The Beast (Secret Fantasies) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"I bought this book for 99 cents and I have to say I overpaid. It started out extremely slow and then it started to drag even more. I didn't have very high expectations but I was just looking for an evening's quiet entertainment. I didn't like the main characters. I thought the premise was sort of silly. The Heroines efforts to create an invention that to me was not so ground-shaking as they were trying to infer. The 'hero' kept going on and on like a really boring and trite motivational speaker. The romance started to be hot but dragged so much I lost the little interest I had. The ending was totally unbelieveable with the sudden changing of the antagonist, who after less than a hour starts spouting slang and cliches and acting totally out of character.It took me several days to just finish it and I found myself checking frequently so see just how much more I had to go before I was done.I will not be buying any more of these books."},{"Title":"Kiss Of The Beast (Secret Fantasies) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"I wasn't expecting this to be a paranormal, with a other worldly hero. While it was an entertaining story, somehow it didn't flow right for me and I found myself struggling with it. Eva is a woman whose psyche gets a boost when Urich shows her the inner strength and passion she possesses. Urich learns about love and what it means to commit completely to someone. Their HEA was doomed but of course, Eva wouldn't stand for that and her courage and love prevailed.Kiss of the Beast by Mallory Rush~ Harlequin Temptation #558 ~ October 1995Secret Fantasies themed seriesFrom the back cover...DO YOU HAVE A SECRET FANTASY?Scientist Eve Campbell does. Smart but vulnerable, she wants the perfect man -- a man programmed to fulfill her every desire.Urich, however, is more man than she'd bargained for.

From their first touch, their first kiss, Eva is his.But Urich isn't real, she tells herself.Except Eva's fantasy lover is much more real than she could ever imagine."},{"Title":"Kiss Of The Beast (Secret Fantasies) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"I gave this book a three because it promised a red hot read and that was what Rush delivered. However, it also tended to make me go Eeeeuuuuwwwwww too often. I have a pretty high tolerance for nontraditional sex. I've enjoyed books where humans and nonhumans have relationships, even explicitly described sexual relationships, but this was a little too close to the bestiality edge for me to be completely comfortable with it. Which is odd because the hero is obviously sentient, and not an animal in the zoological sense at all. However, he certainly doesn't use his intelligence when it comes to sex-- apparently none of his species does.As for the science fiction-- well, it's pretty hackneyed. Aliens who are last of their species and looking to propagate by kidnapping earthwomen used to be standard drive-in fare. Rush does not do anything to improve on that plot.This book did not remind me of Beauty and the Beast-- not even-- (shudder) the Disney version. It reminded me more of the 3rd film of a triple feature in 1979 or maybe something that the MST3K cast would have enjoyed riffing on."},{"Title":"Kiss Of The Beast (Secret Fantasies) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"OK, I've got a confession to make. I started this book with really low expectations. I was expecting to hate it or at least to dislike it. Why? I read this author's previous book LOVE GAME which was supposed to be erotic, hot and something special. I found it to be thin in plot and characterization and I didn't much care about the love scenes. I think I was expecting too much because it was so highly touted. I put off reading this one for a year and almost traded it in unread on the basis of that one disappointment. I am so glad I didn't!Eva Campbell, a lonely virtual reality whiz, conjures up her perfect dream man. A man who lives to fulfill her every fantasy (whew, great premise, huh! ) She's been hurt deeply by her cheating snake of an ex-hubby and has very little self esteem. Her gorgeous creation, Urich, gives it back to her. But she fears he only worships her and thinks her beautiful because she's programmed him to think that way. Little does she know that he is not at all what he seems and his feelings come straight from the heart. He has secrets and an agenda all his own that could tear their fragile and forbidden love apart at the seams . . .This book was a little hard to get into at first. The premise is a bit bizarre but once I got into the story and got to know the characters I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I can't lie. There were a few things that bugged me a little bit; the heroine's personality went through a drastic change in a real short span of time, she changes from an insecure workaholic into a strong, woman confident of her sexuality in what seemed like a matter of days, she also acts immaturely in spots (especially when she's mad) and the hero holds a secret for too long. Usually these things will turn me off in a book but somehow they didn't bother me all that much and I know why. I absolutely loved the hero in this story. I don't want to say too much and spoil his secret but he was really original and loving, sweet, sensitive, not to mention beautiful, faithful, and best of all he shed tears! He really made the book for me.I don't think this is a book for everyone though, it was a bit on the bizarre side and you really need to suspend disbelief to thoroughly enjoy it. Although the sexual tension was steamy with a capital S and the love scene really worked for me I don't think those who dislike paranormals would appreciate the oddness of it. But if you like your books hot, love sensitive heroes and are looking for a very different type of storyline this book should hit the spot.KISS OF THE BEAST is a major fantasy and I recommend it but only for other weirdos like myself *g*."},{"Title":"Kiss Of The Beast (Secret Fantasies) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Definitely holds your interest, causes you to use your imagination in order to visualize the &#34;beast&#34;, before and after his transformation.

It didn't seem evenly paced and some of the scenes seemed to be vaguely described.**********SPOILER ALERT******** warning, warning!!!!!Overall, I liked the story because it was (for me) very romantic.

Catholic theologian Michael Barber has done an excellent job explaining what each on of these (and more) mean along with there implications in our life time. I highly recommend this book along with Dr. Scott Hahn's Lamb Supper. CATHOLICS: \\"ALWAYS BE READY TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION TO ANYONE WHO ASKS YOU FOR A REASON FOR YOUR HOPE ...1 Peter 3:15-17"},{"Title":"Coming Soon: Unlocking the Book of Revelation and Applying Its Lessons Today","review":"This is an engaging book, and one aimed at the general reader. Even if you do not have an extensive background in biblical studies, you will find this book easy to understand.In order to grasp what is going on in Revelation, it is necessary to know a little historical background. In the gospels, Jesus says very clearly that an apocalypse would occur and that those listening to him, \\"this generation will not pass away till all these things take place\\" (Mt 24). Yet the end time of the world did not occur within, say, the lifetime of John. So was Jesus mistaken? Other biblical scholars, such as Renan and Schweitzer, have indeed argued this.However, Barber offers an alternative view--a modified preterist view, in fact, and one which points to an end of one covenant and the beginning of a new one. He explains that Jesus was correct. The generation who was warned that the temple would fall within their lifetimes, did, indeed, see the temple fall. First in the body of Jesus Christ, who was crucified, and then, in the temple, when it was burned to the ground by the Romans in 70 AD.The destruction of the temple ended so much of what had been the old covenant forever with Israel. Gone forever was the Levitical priesthood, for in the temple were the documents proving the lineage of every priest. Gone forever were the sacrificial rites that the priests performed. Gone was the very center, the heart of Jewish worship.These would be replaced by a new chief priest, the pope, a new priesthood, now open to the gentiles, and a new system for the forgiveness of sin. As Barber explains, \\"This brings us to the image of the Church as the Bride of Christ. Christ truly reproduces His life in the Church, so that the Church is the Mystical Body of Christ...as...in Ephesians 5 the Apostle Paul...writes, \\"Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are members of hiss body'\\" (p 229)."},{"Title":"Coming Soon: Unlocking the Book of Revelation and Applying Its Lessons Today","review":"I am a cradle Catholic that drifted away and later got involved in several Protestant denominations before feeling led to investigate Caholicism afresh and coming back. This book is very insightful and refreshing compared to all the protestant books I've read on the subject. Nice to get the perspective of the first 1500 years of Christianity instead of just the last 500. Makes it much more balanced and in my opinion much more logical sense than what protestants are putting out there."},{"Title":"Coming Soon: Unlocking the Book of Revelation and Applying Its Lessons Today","review":"The book is an excellent study of the book of revelations.

Particular care for the liturgical elements in the book and their relation with the Divine Liturgy (the Roman Rite Mass) is developed and applied, showing the biblical basis for the New Testament Church's Liturgy.My only criticism of this book is that Mr. Barber sometimes doesn't develope the relationship between some things as strongly as I think the text indicates. For exmaple the releationship between Jerusalem and Rome in Revelation 17 is connected much stronger in my view than in Michael's."},{"Title":"Coming Soon: Unlocking the Book of Revelation and Applying Its Lessons Today","review":"Finally a concise explanation of an often feared book of the Bible.

I feel I needed to highlight the entire book!"},{"Title":"Coming Soon: Unlocking the Book of Revelation and Applying Its Lessons Today","review":"Very good treatment on Revelations. Book professionally done by a Catholic (who has corroborated on publications with Scott Hahn before) with great understanding of all the undertones, overtones and symbolism of Revelations. The text of Revelaton is continually compared to Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel where the phrases,language and ideas are comparable. The author uses history primarily by Josephus and some others to corroborate meanings of the text.The book covers Revelations chapter by chapter, verse by verse making this book an excellent shelf reference for Revelation once the book has been read.Very illuminating ,thorough and painstakingly Catholic treatment. Nothing to fault this book on. Excellent, read and learn!I will say this book makes reading the other prophets(Isaiah, Jeremiah, Baruch, Daniel etc) and the rest of the bible so much smoother. The symbolism and phrases overlap and your comprehension of them just sails as high as the eagle in mid-heaven.666, THE ANTI-CHRIST:--------------------Of course, the name Nero adds up to '666' in Greek.But there is more[Dt 17:15-17] \\"He whom you set over you as king must be your kinsman....But he shall not have a great number of horses;nor shall he make his people go aback again to Egypt to acquire them, against the Lords' warning that you must never goback that way again. Neither shall he have a great number of wives, lest his heart be estranged, nor shall he accumulatea vast amount of silver and gold.\\"So there are at least 3 major things a king must never do:1) great number of horses -------------war chariots/large army.2) great number of wives -------------worship false idols/gods3) accumulate vast amt. gold/silver----gold/silver--> greed;King Solomon was a prototype of a great King who had gone bad of which the entirety of 1 Kgs Chps 10&11 detail very nicely:[1Kgs Chps 10 &11]GREAT # HORSES: LARGE ARMY[1 Kgs 10:26] \\"Solomon collected chariots and drivers; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand drivers.\\"GREAT # WIVES: WORSHIP FALSE IDOLS/GODS[1 Kgs 11:1] \\"King Solomon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of Pharaoh, from nations which the Lord had forbiddenthe Israelites to intermarry, \\"because\\" he said \\"they will turn your hearts to their gods\\". But Solomon fell in lovewith them. He had several hundred wives of princely rank and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart.\\"ACCUMULATE VAST AMT. GOLD/SILVER: GREED[1 Kgs 10:14] \\"The gold that Solomon had received each year weighed six hundred and sixty-six gold talents.\\" (666 and listed first within 1 Kings 10&11)666 WITHIN REVELATION-----------------[Rev 13: 17-18]\\"so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark , that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, itsnumber is six hundred sixty-six.\\"Look at the above quote, 'this calls for wisdom'. 'WISDOM' is a reference to Solomon(Solomon was renowned for and prayed for wisdom) in [1Kgs Chps 10 &11] whowas a prototype for a king who went bad and whom in [1 Kgs 10:14] taxed his people 666 talents of gold per year. So it would seem that the beast or Anti-Christis typically a national or even a larger world stage figure(through conquest) with large armies, vast amt. of gold/silver or greed, and who is against(anti) Christianityand/or worships false gods. This certainly applies to Nero. Moreover, this figures within the 20th century with Hitler, Stalin , Pol-Pot, and Mao.Which are all anti-christs leading up to the final anti-christ of the end times. So thus, the general and precise meaning of what John and Revelation are getting at.What John wrote about in Revelations and 666 is not really about counting up letters in a name, that is rather an insignificant part."},{"Title":"Capricorn: Sun, Star, & Love Signs Secrets (Linda Goodman's Sun, Star and Love Signs Secrets)","review":"I'm not an astrology freak, but I find Linda Goodman's stuff of interest because it seems so incredibly accurate.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"East Lynne","review":"Some popular fiction manages to stand the test of time, and EAST LYNNE falls into that category. For its contemporary readers, EAST LYNNE was one of the exemplars of that emerging genre, the sensation novel: its plot incorporates, among other things, murder, mistaken identity, bigamy, and adultery. Sitting awkwardly in this wild stew of criminal activity are the narrator's pious moral observations and the novel's didactic (and sometimes ponderously satirical) pronouncements on contemporary mores. The characters are mainly cardboard, with the possible exception of the termagant Cornelia Carlyle. The story remains highly readable, largely because the plot moves at a reasonably fast pace, but no-one should approach this book looking for high literature. Mrs. Wood wrote plain--some might say \\"simplistic\\"--prose with a minimum of stylistic embellishment, but most readers should find her writing tolerable. In other words, this novel exists in the upper reaches of Danielle Steele-land. It is, nevertheless, an essential text for understanding trends in Victorian popular culture during the 1860s and after.This new edition, probably intended to replace the poorly edited Everyman version, contains a number of \\"extras.\\" These include letters from Mrs. Wood, the report from publisher's reader Geraldine Jewsbury (herself a popular novelist), data on the novel's publication and serialization, contemporary reviews, contextual material, and selections from one of the many theatrical adaptations of the novel. Like most Broadview publications, this edition is obviously designed for classroom use, although casual readers should also find the additional material helpful.Unfortunately, this edition has something in common with the Everyman version: the editing and proofreading. The text is rife with bizarre word substitutions, as if the MS had been run through a spellchecker without a second reading; typos; and improper accidentals (e.g., semi-colons for apostrophes and commas for periods). The often scattershot footnotes did not help: they were sometimes repetitive (e.g., annotating \\"Turk\\" more than once) and often too terse to be of much use. Many notes glossed old sayings whose meanings remain obvious even to today's students. To make matters worse, my own copy was badly printed. Instructors may want to keep these problems in mind."},{"Title":"East Lynne","review":"I loved the novel \\"East Lynne\\" and am now reading it for the 2nd time. I could not put the book down and kept reading and reading. I recommended it to my mother and she also read it and loved it. It is Mrs. Henry Wood's greatest triumph. The reader feels so greatly for Lady Isabel, one wishes the ending were happier for her. The deaths of little William and finally Lady Isabel bring many tears. No wonder it was such a success in the Victorian era and it should be printed again in this time, to counter so much trash and vulgarity that is written.I certainly can believe how successful it must have been when it was first printed in 1861. I also believe anyone who reads it wishes Lady Isabel back in her ex-husband's life and Barbara Hare out! Wonderful!!"},{"Title":"East Lynne","review":"I read the free public domain version of this book.Its strength is its storyline. For modern readers, you may feel its weakness is in the context of its Victorian era, with the way it characterizes the actions, looks, and language of the people in it.Children who say \\"hark\\", women who are constantly turning as pale as their clothes, men who shiver in horror, etc.If you can get beyond this, you will find an enjoyable book with a fairly complex number of main characters with an increasingly twisty plot that solves a murder and at the same time adds a tale of love gone upside down. Mistaken identities, facts, motivations rule the plots.A man is shot inside his house. The apparent murderer says he didn't do it but the one he accuses seems innocent, mostly because he couldn't be placed at the scene. On another front, a man and woman marry and start a family in happy circumstances. Then the man appears to fall for another woman, putting the wife in deep despair. She goes off with another man, later to regret abandoning her husband and children. Thinking her dead, the husband remarries only to have the first wife reappear in disguise to be the governess to their children.The book sucked me in for hours at a time wondering what was going to happen next.

This makes it a very interesting study, not just on women of the Colonial period but also a study on how women are viewed in the early 20th Century. The book tries to answer the question what was life like for women in the colonies? The book compares their lives to the life of modern women, at least those modern women of the 1920s. Studying letters, diaries and other sources the book gets into marriages, day-to-day life, social issues, religion, education, home life and even touches on romance. Sometimes harsh, always hard, but also full of hope and passion, the book allows us to peek into the lives of such great women as Dolly Madison, Martha Washington, and Eliza Pinckney, along with the thousands of women who lived in Boston, Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York. From Quakers to Puritans, from Mothers to charming hostess, this book allows us to see the many sides of the women of colonial America."},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days","review":"A Woman's Life in Colonial Days was written by Carl Holliday, and first published in 1922. My quick research did not turn up much on Mr. Holliday except that he seems to have been a literature professor -- at first Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Professor of English University of Toledo; and later a professor in California. But wherever he resided, his focus was on early American history. And he quotes easily from both primary and secondary sources.His writing style, as might be expected of a Professor of English, is very good. The book, though academic, has an easy style and flow.The subject, of course, is 'women in the colonial period': the various aspects of their lives: religion, education, at home, social life and dress, etc.Here is the TOC:I -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND RELIGIONII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND EDUCATIONIII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND THE HOMEIV -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND DRESSV -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND SOCIAL LIFEVI -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND MARRIAGEVII -- COLONIAL WOMAN AND THE INITIATIVEBIBLIOGRAPHYINDEXWhat surprised -- and dare I say delighted me -- about the book, besides Holliday's vast knowledge, was the fact that he was so 'progressive' in most of his outlook. Although there is certainly some parts of his work we can be offended by, for the most part Holliday presents his knowledge supported by the original sources; he neither rants against the harsh ways of the past, neither is he an apologist for them.Instead he smartly leads the reader through some pretty horrendous days in our nation's (USA's) history. And I must say that I will never look upon the Puritans in the same way again. It's not that Prof. Holliday condemns them as much as he lets their own words do the talking.I'm not usually the sort of reader that seeks out the opinions of others for 'what happened'. I tend to like to read what people at the time wrote for themselves. BUT I greatly enjoyed this book. Prof. Holliday gave me the benefit of his superior knowledge, and at the same time used so many original sources that I did not feel deprived.Recommend this to readers who want to learn more about our early history and how our forebearers lived and thought.Pam Tpageinhistory"},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days","review":"This book is a photocopied volume of an out of print book.

He is an internationally recognised air historian, has over 20 books published and contributes to \\"Jane's All the World's Aircraft.\\" In this book he has concentrated on all those aircraft employed by the Axis Powers of WW2 and, in short, he has made an excellent job of it too.Laid out in strict alphabetical order by make, each aircraft commences with a text headed \\"History and Notes\\" in which all the relevant history is covered and the numerous variations of different aircraft explained. To this is added plans and the occasional photograph. Most interestingly, instead of treating the reader to an artist's impression of a single profile example, we get several different profiles of each aircraft showing their numerous variations and livery. In the case of the F-Wulf Fw 190, for example, there are 10 such profiles.In my own work I frequently find myself researching whatever aircraft was involved with the sinking of a particular ship and this book gives me all the historical and technical details I could ever want.An excellent choice for those with a deeper interest in the subject.NM"},{"Title":"Polymer Clay Mosaics","review":"Krista's work is well known and much admired, not the least by yours truly. So it was with ill-concealed impatience I awaited her Mosaic book once I heard it was in the offing, expecting her usual top-notch standards and high calibre expertise. I wasn't disappointed. She exceeded my lofty expectations and then some. This book's a proper touch of class: mouth watering eye candy with the lid off, clear and concise instructions, and enough variety of projects to keep me out of the malls and off the Shopping Channel for quite some time to come. Smashing stuff, beautifully executed; I'd recommend this superb volume of work to anyone."},{"Title":"Polymer Clay Mosaics","review":"An excellent all round book on the subject of polymer clay mosaics. Good clearly illustrated introductory chapters and a wide variety of projects. Apart from the sample project, all the other projects in the book only have a finished picture, the step by step instructions just being in writing. This may put off some 'visual' readers, who like to see step by step photos for the making of a project.

Both stories were very good (I normally don't like sci-fi books with cyborg/human hybrids). The only thing I didn't like was how there wasn't a lot a sisterly dialouge between the women when they were reunited."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"Oh, boy. This book grabbed me from page 1. I love, love, love the premise: sisters Celeste and Corinne are writers--Corinne writes paranormal romance, and Celeste writes science fiction. Two characters, one from each of their series, get together to bring Celeste and Corinne into their fictional worlds, and they're after revenge. If you've read Angela Knight &/or Diane Whiteside before, you won't be surprised to discover that said revenge takes a decidedly sexual bent.**** \\"Bound by the Dragon\\" by Diane Whiteside.This is Corinne's story. Mykhayl has been an ongoing character in her fantasy romance series, and she's found HEAs for all his siblings, but hasn't been able to imagine the perfect woman for him. She's also rendered him sterile to prevent any accidental pregnancies and he's really not happy about that.Unfortunately, the fate of the entire kingdom hangs on Mykhayl producing an heir. Corinne, as a sorceress in this world, may have the power to cure his sterility, but getting him to trust a sorceress, after what she put him through with the Gray Sorceress, may be even more difficult. And meanwhile, Corinne is worrying about Celeste.***** \\"Bound by the Dream\\" by Angela Knight.Celeste's story. This one's a little darker. Celeste is divorced from an abusive husband who liked to tie her up, so the bondage Jarred, the hero from her science fiction series, puts her through is more difficult for her. And Jarred is not inclined to go easy on her, because she killed his best friend, and if that's not bad enough, in the last conversation he overheard between the sisters, Celeste was discussing how to kill him off.Jarred's plan is to tame Celeste, to train her as a sexsub, then give her to his friend, the alien slaver De'Lar. He didn't plan on falling for her, and he fights it every inch of the way. There's a nice twist at the end.The two stories are linked by a common prologue and epilogue, and by the explicit and very steamy sex scenes. Both authors are skilled at writing sex scenes--there was no awkwardness or coyness to them, and they actually advanced the plots. Most tellingly, for me, anyway: I wasn't tempted to skim them.I've probably given each story an extra half star because I enjoyed the premise so much, but then my ratings are all about how much I enjoyed the stories, not anything objective, so I'm okay with that."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"Erotic. I liked how the two authors combined a story into one. Each author told their own tale, but linked the stories in the beginning and end. The story of two sisters, both writers, whose characters really exist. The writers have no idea and assumed their characters were figments of their imaginations, when in actuality, they were beings from other dimensions, whose lives have been manipulated by the sisters. They exact their revenge when they find a spell to enter into the sister's world, kidnapped them, and bring them back to their own separate dimensions.Of course, sex slave, is on their mind, but the girls have a way of turning the tables on them. Very satisfying book. Not meant for the prude at heart."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"I'm giving this book a five because the sex in both stories was deliciously hot. However, I thought Angela Knight's story was by far the stronger of the two. The first story, by Diane Whiteside, was weak on the sci fi aspects of this tale, which made it confusing. It made no attempt to explain why the world and characters they wrote about in their novels were real. I also kept wondering why Corrine never defended herself against Mykh, by pointing out that she can hardly be blamed for harming him when she had no idea she was doing so. Also, Corrine accepts, without wondering or explaining why, that even though she supposedly created Mykh's world, there's so much she doesn't know about it. Also, the way the author described Mykh's world was boring. Nothing happened except ceremony after ceremony, pomp and circumstance after pomp and circumstance.Angela Knight's story made up for these shortcoming. She is clearly the stronger thinker and writer. Right from the beginning, Celeste behaved as I would expect a woman in her position to behave. Unlike Corrine, she defended herself against Jarred, getting him to admit that holding her responsible didn't make sense since she didn't know the world she was writing about was real. Also, this story spent the necessary time exploring how Celeste and Corrine wound up writing about and manipulating worlds that actually existed (essentially, mental telepathy).Overall, though, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"Diane Whiteside and Angela Knight have really gotten this difficult blend right. The worldbuilding is good, and the sex scenes are hot and imaginative. For fans of the Secrets anthologies, and lovers of fantasy and science fiction romance looking for something a little - well, a lot - spicier, this is an absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"I've loved Angela Knight since discovering Secrets books by Red Sage several years ago. It also introduced me to a new author with Ms. Whiteside's tale.And this book is beyond.... yummy. It's got the hot steamy portions, and an amazing tale. Two seriously hot men, and two fiesty, wonderful heroines.I loved it."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"I loved the way this book started out with the two sisters meeting the heros they had created in their books. The first story, Bound by the Dragon, written by Diane Whiteside, bored me to tears. It was a real struggle to get through it. But, the second story, Bound by the Dream, by Angela Knight, made my earlier struggle well worth it. I just wish Bound by a Dream was the longer of the two stories, and the first one to be read."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"By TT reviewer Amy L. TurpinCeleste and Corinne Carson are writers of science and romantic fiction, respectively. Both have created alpha type male heroes and both feel a special connection to their characters. What they don't realize is that their writings are coming true in their hero's universes, a fact they are about to find out in a most alarming way . . .Jarred Varrain and Mykhayl Rhodyonovich are the tormented characters of the sisters' fantasies. Trapped in a kind of limbo when the girls are brainstorming, and then helpless to change the eventual outcome once back in their own lives, the men have had enough! For ten long years they have had to watch as their lives are plotted and executed with malicious precision, and now the men finally have a chance to take revenge on their tormentors by kidnapping the women and whisking them off to their individual universes.Mykhayl's dimension is one of magic and fantasy. As he spirits Corinne away from her home, he can think of nothing other than punishing her for his years of suffering. After completely consuming her, he finds she has possession of him as well, a fact that does not sit well with him. He knows her for the sorceress she is, and after the things done to him by another sorceress, he can not trust her--especially with his heart. Corinne knows he can never love her, but the least she can do is to use her newfound skills to reverse the damage she caused in one of her stories. But will her courage and determination be enough to give this mighty king the queen he needs and the son he deserves?Jarred's universe is one of science and technology. When Celeste finds herself face to face with the gadgets she invented, the reality is more alarming than she could have ever imagined. Especially her ultimate creation--the brawny, sexy, cyborg/human glaring down at her with malice. She knows him as well as he knows himself and when the look she has described a thousand times, the one associated with that of the executioner-Jarred, she is more terrified than she can ever remember being. His intentions, however, are not as grim as her impending death, but he will use her then throw her away . . . so to speak. The sex they share is unlike either of them has ever experienced. Just when it seems Jarred's icy exterior is melting in Celeste's favor, her special powers are revealed to him. He realizes then that she has kept this secret from him for almost the entire time of her stay with him. Knowing Jarred's life will soon be jeopardized, Celeste is determined to keep him from harm--knowing he will never love her. But the danger comes from the most unexpected source and it's up to Celeste to neutralize the threat before it's too late.Two fabulously written tales, two fabulously written romances! This anthology is written with humor, imagination and a generous amount of love. The beginning grasps the reader's attention immediately and the ending is in no way predictable, but perfectly logical.

I usually read a romance book in a day or two but I'm still chewing on this one after a week and getting indigestion all the way. The plot!?! There is none beyond the authors being kidnapped and whisked off to fantasy lands for never ending sex. And very boring sex at that. I wouldn't label this book a romance story. It's definitely pointless porn ..... neverending pointless porn. 95% is this so called erotica that is very boring after the first page and 5% very weak effort at storyline. The heros are laughable and the heroines are stupid because they don't take themselves out of this nightmare. I'm sorry I spent my money on this book.

The whole sisters who were writers both being sucked into 2 very different imaginary worlds by their leading male characters that they both had created intrigued me.Once I opened the book and started to read about the first sister Celeste ...the intrigue was gone. The plot is easy enough to follow, there wasn't one. Ms.Whiteside tried to shove so much detail about a mystical world into a 60-page story that I have already forgotten what the mystical world was called. This story was one far-fetched bedroom romp after another. The dialogue is so weak that the author might has well wrote \\"Me Tarzan... You Jane\\" and have been done with it. It was definitely a let down. Actually I wouldn't even say a let down, it was just plain ol' bad.As for the second story by Angela Knight written about the other sister Corinne, while it was better written than the first, it too was another Alpha-alpha male trying to bend the helpless female to his will. Although I liked Jarred better and thought Corinne had some substance to her, I was waiting for that substance to come out. But it never did. However, given the first story of the book I wasn't surprised.All in all...I have no clue what the other reviewers where thinking about giving this book 4 and 5 stars. If I could I would rank it with 0 stars...but the Amazon ranking system apparently doesn't let you go that low.

It involves two sisters who are also writers whose protagonists come to life and bring them to their respective worlds.

The novel is funny and full of plush scenery, magic, dragons, and the like, but the characters felt so one dimensional as to be paper thin. The story was good and much superior to the 2nd novelette in the book.Favorite Quote:\\"The first step of my revenge is to eat you until you beg me to cease, unable to endure any more.\\"I enjoyed it, but understand that it is mostly erotic scenes wrapped around a scrap of a story.Bound by the Dream by Angela KnightSet in outer space, Jarred immediately takes Celeste to a torture chamber rack and proceeds to bleep her for the next ninety percent of the book. This book looks and feels more like a scene than a novelette. It involves a strong submissive theme, where Jarred forces Celeste and is really in my opinion, loaded with way too many sex scenes.I did not like Jarred and kinda feel the author didn't either. He is mean and self centered, and threatens Celeste with terrible sexual servitude or death. When she develops telekinetic skills, I thought the story line might pick up, but sorry no dice. I'd characterize this novelette as 98% erotic scenes sandwiched in a minuscule story line.The ending was strange. I think the author hit her required word count and said \\"oh, bleep, I have to finish it\\", so Jarred flipped inside of 2 seconds from wanting nothing to do with Celeste to asking her to marry him and be his business partner. Ugh. A little transition please?Sample Line:\\"Celeste felt only a kind of profound despair. Handsome as he was, she didn't want him. She wanted dark, tormented, arrogant Jarred, sadistic streak and all. Well, you're not going to get him, she told herself grimly.

Corrine writes historical fantasy romances featuring Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, and his family, while Celeste is the author of a futuristic/sci-fi series starring Jarred Varrain, an enforcement officer. Mykhayl and Jarred have each gone on many dangerous adventures through the sisters' books. What Corrine and Celeste don't know is that somehow, some way, what they've written has become reality in two alternate universes. Worse yet, Jarred and Mykhayl know about them and plan to take their revenge. In a bold move, Jarred and Mykhayl penetrate our dimension and kidnap the sisters (while they're in the middle of trying out lingerie, no less). Now it's payback time for Corrine and Celeste as they each face a furious and handsome (not to mention well-endowed) warrior.In Diane Whiteside's BOUND BY THE DRAGON, Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, has brought back his tormentor for punishment. Thanks to Corrine, Mykhayl has been imprisoned and tortured numerous times by his enemies. Worst of all, she caused an ice serpent to bite him and render him sterile. An intolerable situation for a king. Mykhayl intends to make sure that this sorceress will no longer be able to make his life hell, even if he has to shackle her to his bed.Bewildered, bemused and definitely aroused (after all, she's very familiar with every inch of that physique) Corrine finds herself accused of being a sorceress and being eyed as a tasty snack both my Mykhayl and the imperial dragon, Khyber! Wanting to make amends for all that she unknowingly put him through, Corrine is determined to cure his sterility and help him fight his enemies, even if it means being stuck in this universe forever.In Angela Knight's BOUND BY THE DREAM, Jarred Varrain finally has his chance to avenge himself on Celeste. Because of her he'd been betrayed by the woman he loved, tortured by alien reptiles and, worst of all, had watched her plot his best friend's death but was powerless to stop it. Yet for all she's put him through, Celeste has also been his obsession for years. To ensure she will wreak no more havoc in his world, Jarred plans to give Celeste to his friend De'Lar as a new sexsub. But first, Jarred is going to torture her slowly, exquisitely, on his specially made pleasure rack. He was going to rid himself of his fixation once and for all.Once she realizes that everything she's written has truly come to pass, Celeste expects Jarred to kill her. Instead, she's tortured with pleasure and Celeste slowly realizes a truth she's hidden for a long time. She's never been able to have a real relationship because a part of her has always been in love with her hero, Jarred. Now he's real, but her days with him are numbered unless he can forgive her and she can convince him they belong together.CAPTIVE DREAMS wraps itself around that eternal question \\"What if?\\" and the result is raunchy and a lot of fun. Corrine and Celeste make fabulous heroines who, after learning to believe in the improbable, immerse themselves in their new worlds and find a way to adapt and relish their new roles. Mykhayl and Jarred evolve from men bent on vengeance to heroes worthy of their unusual heroines. Erotically charged, lushly romantic, and yes, slightly kinky, this delicious anthology may not be for everyone but it's a Perfect 10 in my book.TheSchemer"},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"Celeste and Corinne Carson are sisters and both are writers who are having problems with their characters: Corianne with Mykh the King of an alternate Earth and avatar of the dragon Khyber one of the kingdoms two protective deities; Celeste is having problems with Jarred and interstellar law enforcer from the far future. The book is in 4 sections a prologue then Bound by the Dragon dealing with Corianne with Mykh and their problems and then Bound by the Dream dealing with Celeste and Jarreed. Then finished with an Epilogue.In Bound by the Dragon Diane Whiteside does an excellent job of writing erotic fantasy. Character development is largely limited to the principals with the others being largely spear carriers except for the huge black leopard Mazur who is overjoyed to have someone to talk to (Corianne is the only living sorceress and so can talk to animals) but this is the major stalling point as Mykh was held captive and tortured by the Gray Sorceress so he hates and fears any sorceress. The plot is nicely convoluted and well done and there is some humor as when Corianne realizes that Khyber is real and when Mazur dumps Mykh in the pond. The erotic scenes are very well done with some BD but mostly Ds and over all an outstanding job.In the second half Angela Knight does an outstanding job of dealing with the conflict between Celeste and Jarreed. Jarred is very attracted but also annoyed that she has killed off his best friend. Some humor along with the erotic as with the Rekan Torment Rack as modified by the Kirystari to be a sex toy, and then there is an innovative use of VR as well. More humor in the case where Celeste is dressed as a sexsub (sexual submissive) at De'Lars palace on Kirystari and uses her telekinesis to dump an offensive palace guard. Over all nice characters, well written BDSM and Ds erotica with a good threesome as well. The plot is a little light but overall outstanding.Not a 5 star home run but a truly great read."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"The Plot: Two sisters who both happen to be writers are kidnapped by the characters they created. It's a really interesting premise.Bound by The Dragon by Diane WhitesideThe good points: The author pulls you into a fully developed world rich in history and color. Her hero was most attractive really tall and handsome with waist length red hair. And he's a king! The characters were likable and honorable. By the end, I felt liked they truly knew each other and loved one another.The negative points: This book is so steeped in magic, spells, talismans, etc. that many times I felt like I was reading a sequel and I badly needed the first novel to explain what was going on. After a while, I just didn't care and only wanted to finish it so that I could move on to the next novel.Bound by the Dream by Angela KnightThe good points: This one is more straightforward and crisply written than the first novel. The love scenes are hot. I breezed through this one.The negative points: I would have liked to know more about his world than just a vague description of his ship and a trip to one planet. Jared's form of revenge is turn Celeste over to his friend so that she might become a submissive. Can't say that that endeared him to me very much. Even when he realizes that he cares for her, he sticks to this plan. He doesn't want her getting hurt by staying by his side. Evidently in the future, there are very few job options for women since he couldn't come up with any better alternatives. My main complaint is about a sex scene between the heroine, the hero, and his friend. It's something I would have liked to know about before I purchased this book. I probably would not have bought it especially from amazon since I wouldn't want them recommending this type of book to me again.I gave this book 4 stars because despite my complaints, I really did enjoy both adventures."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"If you like fantasy romantica with a warrior then this book is for you. And if you like science fiction romantica with a military hero this book is for you. Throw in a cocksure dragon and two fiesty heroines and what do you have ... a book you don't want to put down. Each of the heroines is quickwitted and strong - neither of them are passive and take on both of the heros-with many quick verbal parries thrusts and counter thrusts. Not to mention very well written sex scenes-that are guaranteed to bring the characters and you to a quick boil. this is a book that is readable not once, not twice but many times."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"Captive Dreams by Diane Whiteside and Angela Knight starts with two sisters, both authors, discussing how they are going to end their respective series. Corinne and Celeste Carson are trying to get their creative juices flowing by trying on sexy lingerie, when two towering barbarians appear before them, spitting mad. What the....? Is that the characters from their books? The two men each drag away their AGs (author goddess) and jump back to their worlds, determined to get their revenge.Diane Whiteside: Bound By The DragonWell, this is my first by this author....and I didn't like it. It was boring I thought. The sex was boring. The hero was boring. He was one of those He-Man's who can't get past his own prejudices, and doesn't want to want the heroine. Diane Whiteside rambled on and on about the world and the war and since I knew nothing about it, I didn't care. Just...didn't like it.Angela Knight: Bound By The DreamDamn, I think I'm still blushing. This story was hot. The hero, Jarred, has been hurt terribly over the decade, all because of his Author Goddess and her stories. He's got quite a bit of anger bottled up and he can't wait to start once he's got her. He's part cyborg? and as such has implants in his brain which can tell him when he's causing her pleasure or pain, an advantage he uses to the fullest. He plans to train her to be a submissive sex slave and pass her on to a friend of his. In doing so, he begins to realizes how much he enjoys being with her and in her (grin) and doesn't know how he's going to let her go. They make it to his friend's home, a place Celeste is convinced is housing an assassin, to present Celeste as the newest sexsub. There the three of them engage in a menage a trois and Jarred has to make his decision on whether to keep Celeste or leave her behind.If this short story by Angela Knight was this good, count me in for more! Her story was hot. It was erotic, full of sexual tension and some inventive scenarios that add to the fun factor. Her world building was also seamlessly created, I didn't feel like I was getting exposition like I was with Diane Whiteside's short story. I highly recommend this anthology for Angela Knight and can't wait to read more from this wildly talented and inventive author!"},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"I am a big fan of Angela Knight's and was a little disappointed when it came to her story.As for Diane Whiteside, I was very impressed with her story in the beginning more so than Angela's.Great read none-the-less. Stayed up all night reading the first story.."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"This book was entertaining and memorable. If you are looking for a turn on this book will do it. I consider this book to be an erotic fantasy."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"I bought this book because I like Angela Knight. But, I couldn't get over some of the phrasing the author of 'Bound by the Dragon used...'woman's jewel', 'yoni's petals'. AAagh! It drove me nuts. And Angela Knight's contribution to this book is about 1/4 the length of the other author's. Boooooo!!! This book did have a really neat concept & plot line though."},{"Title":"Captive Dreams","review":"This is a really spicy read from two favourite authors - Angela Knight being a star of Secrets and Diane Whiteside featuring at Ellora's Cave...The story centres on two sisters who write fantasy/futuristic best-sellers without realizing their heroes are actually having to live the convoluted plots arising from their twisted imaginations.Both heroes are to die for yummy - Diane's Mykhael being the more obviously a nice guy, with Jarred having a really dark, dark side...The clue (er broad hint) to the theme lies in the &quot;captive&quot; part of the title - but the fine characterisation, plotting and basic decency of the two guys are the elements that make this a romantic as well as a racy read. I loved it...&amp; yeah I'm a fan anyway - but I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who likes fantasy or futuristic romance - or even just something a little different - if you like your romance with a sizzle then this is for you!"},{"Title":"The History of Christianity (A Lion Handbook)","review":"The Handbook of the History of Christianity is a wonderful book. Much easier to read than I thought this subject matter would be. It was easy to follow the various changes throughout Early Church History. The pictures were fabulous. The content was very thorough and detailed, yet the writers style made it easy to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Early Church History."},{"Title":"The History of Christianity (A Lion Handbook)","review":"There are numerous boring Christian history books on the marketplace--enough to make anyone fall asleep at night. For some reason, my seminary professors always seemed to pick this kind of book for us to read in the church history classes. When I came across this 700-page book several years ago, I was more than happy to add it to my personal library on church history (a topic on which I own a dozen volumes). Beginning in the time period of Josephus and moving through the 20th century, the book's articles are crisp and well-written by a variety of authors. In addition, sidebar stories make turning each page an adventure. Numerous drawings and pictures are printed throughout, making it very layout friendly. I would ask the publisher to consider republishing this book. It's worthy of ownership, even if you have to find it on the used market."},{"Title":"The History of Christianity (A Lion Handbook)","review":"Somebody famous once said that anyone who refuses to learn the lessons of history is doomed to repeat its mistakes. This is particularly true of the church, and given the colossal scale of some of its mistakes (think Spanish Inquisition, for example), it comes as a relief that church history is part of every worthwhile Christian leadership program.The trouble is, taught the wrong way, church history can be the most tedious topic in the syllabus. Fortunately my tutor, in a fit of generosity, has allowed us to use this delightful book as an alternative to the homicidally dry Comby. It makes all the difference. There is an astonishing wealth of information here, all compartmentalised so that you can get at what you want. It is readable without ever being simplistic, crammed with attractive and useful photographs and artwork, and the enormous authoring team includes a number of the world's leading evangelical teachers.Thus I cannot praise this book too highly. It makes a great text book, but (like almost all the Lion handbooks I have seen) it is so attractively presented and well written that it would appeal to anyone with an interest in the subject. In fact, it would make a first class gift, prize or presentation.Unfortunately (and inexplicably), you may have to resort to a special order to get it. However, it is not out of print as it is definitely available at the time of writing on Amazon's UK website (Amazon.co.uk). Lobby for this book to be put back on the US lists - it is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"Unlike many books concerning true crime, Williams' account of the Moors Murders is neither sensationalistic, nor cold in its recounting of the facts. By weaving fact with some fictional (yet highly believable) dialogue to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; of what is known, Williams gives the reader an astonishing glimpse into the private world of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. It is simply one of the best books I've ever read. The story itself is fascinating, both as a psychological study, and for the incredible detective work that led to the couple's arraignment. Absolutely un-put-downable. Incidentally, passages from the book are woven into a song called &quot;Suffer The Children&quot; by Mancunian band, The Smiths."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"The Moors Murders probably shocked Britain more than any other crime of recent years. Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, two twenty-something lovers from the Manchester suburbs, were convicted of murdering a twelve-year-old boy, a ten-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old youth between 1963 and 1965. (We now know that they also murdered two other young persons during this period). The name \\"Moors Murders\\" derives from the fact that they buried their victims on the desolate moorland outside the city. What made these crimes so shocking, apart from the youth of the victims, was that Brady and Hindley were an outwardly respectable young couple and that they had no motive for killing their victims, all of whom were complete strangers to them, other than a Sadistic delight in killing for its own sake. (I spell the word with a capital letter because Brady was a devotee of the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade). The nation was particularly shocked to learn that they had made a series of photographs and tape recordings documenting the sufferings of some of their victims.\\"True Crime\\" books are normally written either by journalists or by academics specialising in criminology or psychology. Whether the author's interest is journalistic or academic, however, the books tend to be dry and factual in style. Emlyn Williams's book, however, is very different. He was neither a journalist nor an academic, but an actor and playwright, and \\"Beyond Belief\\" shows the clear hallmarks of the creative writer.Whereas most \\"True Crime\\" writers stick to fact and the interpretation of fact, Williams, as he states in his introduction, adds a third element, \\"surmise\\". By this he means that it is his intention to write an imaginative recreation of the crimes, speculating on the thoughts and feelings of the two murderers and on conversations that they might have had with each other and with third parties. Williams believed that this method would enable him to tell the story with what he called \\"dual accuracy\\"- the accuracy of history and the accuracy of imaginative understanding. The result is that the book reads more like a novel, with Ian and Myra as the principal characters, than it does the traditional non-fiction book.This method certainly allows Williams to create a vivid picture of the two murderers. The portrait of Brady is particularly memorable. The illegitimate son of a Glasgow waitress, he was fostered by a local couple as a young boy and moved to Manchester as a teenager to live with his birth mother and her new husband. He had three names; Ian Stewart (his mother's maiden name), Ian Sloan (the name of his foster-parents) and Ian Brady (the name of his stepfather). Williams suggests that these changes and the lack of a stable background might have led to him suffering an identity crisis. He was a strange, obsessive loner, whose main interests were cinema going (mostly watching violent crime thrillers) and reading about sado-masochistic sex and Nazi atrocities. He had neo-Nazi political sympathies, but never joined any organised political party. He was involved in petty crime during his teens, with the result that he spent time in Borstal, but by his late twenties, when the murders were committed, he was, to the outside world, a reformed character, holding down a white-collar job with a respectable firm.Myra Hindley, who worked for the same company as Brady, was, before she met him, even more ordinary, with little to mark her out from thousands of other working-class girls. Williams suggests that she may have been deeply influenced by an incident in her teenage years, when a childhood friend died in a drowning accident, and that this left her with a deep sense of grievance against the world. As a result, she may have been an easy convert to the nihilistic philosophy of Brady, particularly as she had fallen obsessively in love with him.The book was originally published in 1967, the year after the trial. As a result it gives not only a vivid picture of its main characters but also a vivid picture of the era in which it is set, a decade in which trams still ran through the streets, LPs were the latest in musical technology, tower-blocks were still trumpeted as the solution to the nation's housing problems and \\"Bonanza\\" was one of the most popular programmes on television. There were, of course, other books published about these crimes, but Williams's is, I believe, the only one still in print, forty years after the events it describes and nearly twenty after the author's own death. The reason is probably his aim of pursuing \\"accuracy of imaginative understanding\\"; his imaginative technique means the book reads much more easily than do many dry, factual accounts of true crimes.The exact motive for these murders was probably never known to anyone except Brady, Hindley and their Maker, and now that Hindley is dead and Brady is confined in a hospital for the criminally insane, it is unlikely ever to come to light. No doubt the reason lay somewhere in their psychological makeup, but we will never know what psychological factor led them to become vicious killers when thousands of others from similar backgrounds became law-abiding citizens or, at worst, only minor criminals. We cannot, therefore, ever be sure whether Williams achieved his aim. Nevertheless, his theories are never implausible; if we can never be sure that this is how it was, we can at least think that this is how it might have been. If this were a work of crime fiction, Williams's Ian and Myra would be psychologically believable, if monstrous, characters. The book is, of course, a work of non-fiction, but nevertheless highly readable."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"This book portrays a variety of emotions -- anger, confusion, heartbreak, nostalgia. Williams did a great job of trying to fathom the crimes of Hindley and Brady. I've written about the case myself, in fictional form, and this was not only an outstanding research source but one of the saddest, most elegiac books I've ever read. I hope the name Emlyn Williams is not too obscure these days; he was apparently a gifted actor as well as writer and playwright."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"A superb book. Can be read time and time again. Truly 'beyond belief' that such horrors can live inside seemingly outwardly normal people. Ian Brady's increasingly bizarre erotic displays suck Myra Hindley into his parallel world, and she is completely absorbed into a nightmare which will never end."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"Millions of words have been written about the horrendous Moors Murders, which took place in England in the early to mid 1960's. Only this book, 'Beyond Belief ' by Emlyn Williams, uses poetry and wry humour to elevate the pathos already induced by the subject.We will probably never know the true total of lives taken by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. When Emlyn Williams wrote Beyond Belief in 1967 there were three known victims: 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey, 12-year-old John Kilbride and 17-year-old Edward Evans. Emlyn Williams accurately predicted in the book that 16-year-old Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, 12, were also victims of Brady and Hindley. This is now an established fact although the body of Keith Bennett has yet to be found.Other children are known to have almost fallen prey to the evil pair but had the good fortune to slip through their net.Williams gives a brief account about the death of Michael Higgins, a shy and fragile 13 year old boy who drowned in a reservoir when Myra was 15. The pair had been inseparable. Hindley was devastated and became inconsolable. She dressed in black and went to the church nightly to pray and to light a candle for Michael. She was burdened with a huge sense of guilt because she had turned down his request for her to go swimming with him that day. Myra was a strong swimmer and believed that had she been there she could have saved him. But if the two were so inseparable later events make you wonder if she really wasn't there when the boy drowned. If she was not and her grief was genuine, the incident is a poignant reminder that our prayers are sometimes answered in mysterious ways.Brady, whom Hindley had yet to meet, was at that time taking his pleasure in burying cats alive and chopping the legs off live frogs. His heroes were Hitler and the Marquis de Sade. He read Nietzsche and listened to Wagner.Beyond Belief charts the ebbing away of a nations innocence and records the beginning of a downward spiral in Englands morality. It leads you on a journey over Saddleworth Moors inside the minds of two of the most perverted and subsequently reviled people in England, and alongside the dedicated officers of The Greater Manchester Police Force who located the victim's remains.The almost lyrical writing style and the use of northern dialects are juxtaposed to the dark events so you are constantly reminded that the apparently ordinary couple-next-door didn't have the word 'monster' tattooed on their foreheads.Myra Hindley died of a chest infection in November 2002. The name 'Myra' quickly went out of fashion in the Christening records of England after 1966.Ian Brady is in a mental institution and has repeatedly said he does not want to be released - his only wish is to be allowed to die. When you have read Beyond Belief you will hope his wish is granted."},{"Title":"Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in a Post-Traditional World","review":"Emlyn Williams was creatively gifted as a playwright and actor. His two enduring plays were \\"Night Must Fall\\" and \\"The Corn Is Green.\\" A man who spent his writing life in the fictional realm provided himself a challenge and turned his prodigious talents to true crime. The result is a merger of true crime with the poetry of a true creative artist in \\"Beyond Belief.\\"Ian Brady grew up living with guardians in a lower middle class section of Glasgow. When his mother, who bore him out of wedlock, marries, he goes to live with her for the first time. His move to the English Midlands finds him leading a solitary life in which he lives for the cinema. Williams shows us how a dangerous pattern is established early on when he yens for films of violence, identifies closely with the villain Harry Lime played brilliantly by Orson Welles in \\"The Third Man,\\" and abhors love story-musicals such as those with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, which he ridicules.When he is working in a factory as a stock clerk in Gorton, a suburb of Manchester, he meets Myra Hindley for the first time. In many ways the large, voluptuous woman is more masculine than Brady. Williams brilliantly delineates a perceived identity crisis that he believes could have turned them both in the wrong direction.William does an excellent job of showing us the lower middle class despair of young people growing up in sixties' England. He uses the dialect of the young, uneducated working class to evoke the kind of atmosphere associated with the best of novel writing. The cast of characters rings true throughout.Eventually the couple turns to crime in a big way. Brady abducts children and perpetrates murders while Myra, who appears hypnotized by Ian, terminates her assertiveness in his case and becomes his subservient accomplice.The author makes his sociological points without ever being preachy. His page-turning style is riveting as readers learn little by little about these two young people whose lives become living hells for themselves and those they encounter."},{"Title":"Kudzu in America","review":"I found &quot;KUDZU in America&quot; to be a delightful, fun and fast read. The challenge is that Kudzu is here, available, and above all is useful for making many products should not be ignored. That this plant can (and should) be viewed as an abundant potential *resource* -Not- simply as a pest, will be difficult for most to see. There is no 'silver bullet' quick fix, and it appears that utilizing Kudzu to it's fullest extent is fairly labor intensive. But I agree with the author that *harvesting* and using Kudzu (Many examples are listed) makes so much more sense, and since other countries do, Americans should be able to as well."},{"Title":"Kudzu in America","review":"All the pictures in this book are in color, much to my surprise. They are so vivid it is like taking a trip to a kudzu field but lots less trouble. I did not know kudzu bloomed until I read this book.I'm a storyteller and artist, and I give this book high marks in both categories."},{"Title":"The Visual History of Costume: The Sixteenth Century","review":"The books that I have from this series are some of the most informative costume histories that I have ever seen. Although they are not particularly long, they are carefully and clearly written. They should be models for other writers. Rather than simply throwing a lot of terms at the reader and leaving them to match them up to the details of the pictures, the author very carefully describes what each shows.The descriptions are wonderfully detailed, including comments on class and details of fashion at particular times. The author, for example, distinguishes between the two types of French hoods, one worn in the 1530s and the other in the 1540s. (Now you too can wince when you see Anne Boleyn shown wearing the wrong style.) I usually prefer line drawings of fashions rather than photographs of contemporary portrayals, but these photographs are clear and well annotated.The one thing that I would have liked to seen is a little more of the clothing of middle- and lower-class people, but there are some illustrations, which is more than many books provide.There are a number of books in the series (A Visual History of Costume ... ) covering the whole history of Western fashion, as well as one \\"condensed\\" volume that includes samples from all periods.Ashelford also did a book, separate from this series, calledDress in the Age of Elizabeth I. This is about the same size as this volume. but naturally focusses on clothing from 1558-1603, examining the social significance of aristocratic and courtier fashions."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"My 10 month old daughter loves this book.

My son still enjoys reading it every night before we go to bed. We add sound effects and kisses as we read.Personally, I am not a big fan of books that have very little written text (few words). I find that it makes the story different during each reading since the reader is left to comment and fill in her own words.

It is lovely! The little house just glows and makes you feel cozy just looking at it! Five stars for illustrations, no question.I had to deduct a star, though, for the text. I find it stilted and awkward in places -- like it could use another round of editing. I love the sound effects \\"splat!\\" of the rain and \\"woooo\\" of the wind. I love the kisses. I struggle with some of the longer bedtime routine paragraphs. I am inclined to rephrase them, but don't want to confuse my daughter when she grows old enough to read the words herself. For instance, I always trip over this one: \\"Afterward, Mrs. Bear pulled one side of the blanket way up high under Sam's chin, and the blanket was red.\\" And this one: Mrs. Bear poured milk in two glasses and they both drank milk and it was warm sliding down. Afterward, Mrs. Bear yawned.\\" I want to make the first excerpt two distinct sentences, simplify the second considerably, and eliminate both \\"afterwards\\" entirely.I know this is nit-picky, and it shouldn't stop you from buying the book! The story is delightful and sweet. Some pages, the text flows beautifully. Hest makes nice use of repetition, which is fitting in a bedtime ritual story. I just wish I could hack at a few of these paragraphs and pare them down!

I bought this book a few months ago since I loved the illustrations (I'm an artist). I've been reading it off and on since. Well, last week while unsuccessfully trying to read her a story, my daughter spied \\"Kiss Good Night\\" on the table and reached over grabbed it, and promptly started turning the pages. She settled right down after that. Now, every time it's story time, she picks up this book and hands it to me! A clear winner! I'm relieved to discover there are more Sam books out there, we'll be buying those as well!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I've been reading this to my son for the last couple of months. He loves it and I enjoy it too. He starts to ask for kisses again, just like in the story, and it makes for fond memories."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"We've read this at bedtime every night for 6 months, it's such a great story and my son loves it! We now have to buy the hardbacked book so he can treasure it for a long time!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is the sweetest book! My 2.5 year-old has memorized it in just two weeks ... She'll pick it up off of her bookshelf, saying \\"I like this one, Mommy!!!\\" It is an adorable story - lyrical lines that ease her into sleepytime-mode ... In fact, I even catch myself saying, \\"let's read this one again!\\""},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I bought this book for my daughter's birthday (she turned 2). After just one reading at bedtime, it has become a favorite, with me reading it several times to her. Like Sam, she always says &quot;Again!&quot;...On occassion, she's even said &quot;Night Night Sam.&quot; The text is fun to read (and re-read), the pictures are very rich and easy to look at."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This book is yet another triumph for Anita Jeram. Her other well known work is Guess How Much I Love You, which contains some of the most beautiful children's images ever. Jeram's latest work doesn't disappoint. Although the style is remarkably different, the pictures are colorful and beautiful to look at. Of course, the story is quite good too as mother bear puts baby bear to sleep and baby bear keeps mother bear guessing as to why he won't go to sleep yet. The ending is predictable but touches you nonetheless. A must-buy!!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"Got this for my son for Christmas. Though he's only 8 months old, he loves this book, it holds his attention better than most of the other books we read at bedtime. I like the kisses that mama bear gives Sam at the end, because I kiss my son once, then twice and then twice again when we read it in the book. The read isn't as smooth as other books, but my son seems to love it, so that makes me love it too! Looking forward to trying other Sam books."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This book is everything you're looking for when it comes to iconic children's books. Sam and his Mama are such lovable characters and our almost 2 year old asks to read it at least once a day. Even when this book doesn't make our bedtime book stack for the evening (which is rare) \\"Once, twice, and then twice more\\" is a staple in our bedtime ritual now :)"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK AND I LOVE IT.

There is nothing sweeter than to hear him say... \\"It was a dark and stormy night on Plum Street.\\" He is 2 years, 5 months, and he has memorized all of the pages. It is a fantastic bedtime book about Mrs. Bear putting Sam, the baby bear, to bed. They read a book, tucked him in, had warm milk, etc. - but something was missing - Mama Bear's kiss goodnight!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This book is so sweet. Only a few sentences on each page, so it's perfect for babies and young kids. When Sam gets kisses, so does my son."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"Every Mom I know relies on 'Goodnight Moon' as part of their pre-bed routine. When my son was 4 or 5 months old I discovered this book that had been gifted to him. I read through it and it was immediately clear that this was the perfect pre-bed smiles. He has definitely learned it means bedtime, and its the perfect length to keep him interested, and has built in parts to give kisses. It is a very sweet story and a nice alternative to Goodnight Moon. :)"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"We already had \\"You can do it, Sam\\" and I love the illustrations. I bought this for my daughter's upcoming 5th birthday. Anita Jeram's illustrations are so beautiful and sweet."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"Love to read this one to my 15 month old daughter before bed. She loves the kisses part. She has me reread that part so she gets extra kisses. Very cute story."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This a great book for your child's bedtime story. I already had this book but I wanted the hardcover version.

It's one we both enjoy."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"When I discovered this book, I was shopping for my neice. But, I liked it so much, I bought a copy for my 13 month old son as well. It tells the story of a bear and her young son, going through the nightly rituals of reading, tucking in, setling in with the stuffed animals and drinking warm milk. It has now become a part of our nightly ritual.The illustrations are warm and rich. The text is rythmic and fun to read. And the back and forth conversation between Sam and his Mom reminds me of the days when my daughter was that age. I think this book simple enough for a baby, and engaging enough for a toddler. My young son always smiles and looks at me when we get to the page where Mrs. Bear reads Sam a book, and \\"they both knew all the words.\\"As an aside to single Moms,the book and it's sequel, 'Don't you feel well Sam?' do show a warm and wonderful relationship between a Mother and a son. A super gift book. All my new Mom friends will be recieving one! Don't miss out on this one."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is a very sweet book and a very comforting night time story. The routine that the mother and baby bear go through before he goes to sleep is very similar to the routine I think most kids go through, only sweeter. After reading it to my 4 year old son the first time he wanted to act out the last part and he actually wanted his \\"kiss goodnight\\", and he is not a very kissy/huggy little boy. It is not his most frequently requested book but he really enjoys it when I do read it to him at night. The pictures have a certain warmth to them too that just gives you a cozy feeling."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"My 2-year old can't get enough. We have read this wonderful book ten times a day since Christmas and she carries it everywhere. The sounds of the wind and the rain are wonderful and the pictures are absolutely gorgeous! A definite must have for the pre-school bookshelf."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is a great book I read to my boys at night, and I kiss them each time the mama bear kisses Sam. They giggle and squirm and think it's so much fun. I love this message and sweet story."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"Really a wonderful celebration of the mother-child bond. The deep, swirling illustrations of the storm outside contrast the warmth inside little bear's bedroom. My 2-year-old requests to &quot;sit closer&quot; for extra cuddles as the story progresses to little bear's favorite part of the bedtime ritual, his good-night kisses. Sharing books like this with my son is a joy of parenting."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"My 17 month old loves this book. It is a charming story with cute illustrations. We read books every night before bed and this is the book my son will pick up first. We have the sweetest moments with this book. There are lines in the book about wind blowing, and when we get to those lines, my son will blow on his stuffed teddy bear and giggle. His Daddy also reads it to him and I love just popping my head in to the nursery and watching him read this story to our son."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I can't stand it that this book doesn't follow the rules of grammar.

This is a less scary version of Bedtime for Francis."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This story of a mom putting her boy to sleep rings so true and is so sweet (without being treacly) and provides so many opportunities to kiss my own kids during the telling, that I just couldn't improve on it. I give it as a baby gift on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I have been reading this book to my son Noah since he was just two months old. Amoung several other books including \\"Guess how much I love you\\" and the classic \\"Corduroy\\" this is certainly his favorite. He likes the extra kisses he gets when Mrs Bear kisses Sam \\"...once and twice and then twice more...\\". This is definetly a great book for reading to baby. The illustations from Anita Jerum are fantastic. Noah rates this book with five stars at the top of his list!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is among my 15 month old son's favorite books. He loves the suspense of Mrs. Bear \\"forgetting\\" Sam's much-anticipated good night kiss, and squirms with delight when she finally remembers.

But the book is still delicious -- the art as well as the writing."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is such a beautiful book. My 19 month old daughter loves Sam and will ask me to read it to her before going to bed. It is bedtime and Mama Bear is putting Sam to bed. They have a bedtime ritual and Mama Bear goes through it with Sam. Before turning off the light, Mama Bear 'forgets' to give Sam a kiss goodnight. He is so happy when she kisses him goodnight, and is able to fall asleep. I think this book is a wonderful way to end the day for a child."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is my toddler son's favorite book. He loves to say Sam's lines, blow like the wind, touch his chin & toes and act out the book.But he especially loves the good night kisses, and he squeals with delight in anticipation.This book never fails to bring a huge smile to my little boy's face, and it makes bedtime a lot easier."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"What a charming book! This book arrived on my doorstep when I failed to return a book-of-the-month club refusal card. Am I ever glad I didn't turn this one down! My three-year-old son and I absolutely love this adorable story of nightly bedtime rituals. He relates to it so well, and loves to mimick the way the wind blows through the trees on the dark and stormy night on Plum Street....whooo, whooooo. I don't think we ever outgrow these heartwarming stories of the love shared between parents and their children. And I haven't even mentioned the beautiful illustrations!

First class, all the way."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"Snoopy wasn't the only author to begin with that phrase!Despite the stormy weather outside, inside the house, the child's routine is the same with TLC from his mother.My 2 year old loves this book, and I do too."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"My daughter is only 4.5 months old, but I have started reading this book to her at bedtime as the pictures are beautiful as well as the story. I am sure she will grow to love this book as she gets older"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I ordered a child's book thinking it was the chunky, cardboard kind for little ones. But it was, instead, a flimsy paperback not at all suitable for a baby. With the price of the book plus shipping - not at all worth it!"},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"The story in itself is very good, with excellent acrylic paintings to illustrate it. The trouble comes with the writing: there are times when the choice of words makes the reader stumble ( the fragment 'the blanket that was red' just gets stuck in the middle of a couple sentences, making it awkward). I wondered if English was the author's native language.The illustrations, although brilliant, don't always match up the story: for instance, scenes alternate between being rainy and not rainy... even though it's been raining on the windows and the roof, it's dry on the ground and trees.My daughter likes it, but I don't know if she'd like reading it to her daughter when she grows up."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"This is a great book, except that I wish the author would have substituted a glass of water for the milk.

First, they read a book together. She tucks Sam in, head to toe, with his red blanket and arranges his stuffed animal friends. Then they share a glass of milk. And still Sam tells her, &quot;I'm waiting&quot; What could Mrs Bear have forgotten. She thinks and goes back over her bedtime chores and then remembers. &quot;Kiss goodnight, Sam.&quot; And she kisses him once, twice and then twice more..... Amy Hest has written a lovely bedtime story that's cozy and comforting and just perfect for pre-schoolers.

Sam can't get to sleep and his mother has to figure out what she's forgotten in the bedtime routine. My toddler loves the kissing part (he gets kisses at the same time) but the story is a bit complicated for him yet (he gets bored with the longer sentences). But he will happily point out Sam and looks forward to the ending (usually flips the pages to the parts he likes). This is a great series for a childs library and I've bought them for my children & nieces as well. Would make a nice baby gift or 1st birthday present. I would recommend anything by this illustrator as well - you really get the feel of the weather, the warmth of the house, the smells of his mother's baking and the taste of the warm milk."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"I LOVE the artwork in this book. The storyline is a little weak. I would have liked a little more descriptors about what's happening when Sam says \\"Again!\\" because it's awkward reading this part... just one word to the page. And I'm not crazy about the text on page 13. I just can't relate to the Mommy bear walking out and saying \\"kiss good night\\" in a mantra. But hey, that's just me. You get to decide for yourself because I've typed all the words out for you. I typed out the text because I'm going to read this to my daughter while I am away on business. (I picked this one because it was relatively short compared to her other books & quick to type!)Kiss Good Night [text]1. It was a dark and story night on Plum Street.2. In the little white house Mrs. Bear was putting Sam to bed. \\"Ready now, Sam?\\" \\"Oh, no,\\" said Sam. \\"I'm waiting.\\"3. Mrs. Bear sat on the bed beside Sam and they read his favorite book and they both knew all the words.4. Afterward, Mrs. Bear pulled one side of the blanket way up high under Sam's chin, and the blanket was red. She pulled the other side, too, tucking it under his toes like a nest. Outside, the wind blew. Whoo, whoooo. \\"Ready now, Sam?\\" \\"Oh, no,\\" said Sam. \\"I'm waiting.\\"5. Mrs. Bear arranged Sam's friends in the bed and they all snuggled close in the blanket that was red. Outside, the rain came down. Splat! On the roof. Splat! Splat! On the windows. The wind blew. Whoo, whoooo. \\"Ready now, Sam?\\" \\"Oh, no,\\" said Sam. \\"I'm waiting.\\"6. Mrs. Bear poured milk in two glasses and they both drank milk and it was warm sliding down. Afterward, Mrs. Bear yawned. \\"You must be ready now,\\" she said. But Sam shook his head. \\"I'm waiting,\\" he said.7. \\"Hmmmm,\\" said Mrs. Bear, \\"let me think. We've read a book and made a nest, arranged your friends, and had warm milk. Sam,\\" she said, \\"what did I forget?\\" \\"You know,\\" said Sam.8. \\"Hmmmm,\\" said Mrs. Bear. \\"Book, blanket, friends, milk...Book, blanket, friends, milk...\\" Sam waited. He waited and waited.9. And then, at last, Mrs. Bear said, \\"Oh, I know! Kiss good night, Sam!\\" And she bent way down, kissing Sam once and twice and then twice more.10. \\"Again!\\" cried Sam.11. And she bent way down kissing Sam once and twice and then twice more.12. Outside, the wind blew and the rain came down.13. In the little white house, Mrs. Bear was taking out the light, whispering, \\"Kiss good night, Sam... kiss good night...\\"14. And Sam went to sleep. On a dark and stormy night on Plum Street."},{"Title":"Kiss Good Night, Sam","review":"The wind is howling and the rain is slamming down, but Mama Bear is getting Sam all cozy and warm and tucked into bed. The story is sweet, but the illustrations, in my opinion, make this book better than your average good-night story. The warmth and coziness jump off the pages, making the reader almost envious of Sam and his comfy, soft bed. My daughter (4 months old) is still too young to understand this book (I'm sure she's too young to even understand what's going on when I read to her!) but she will stare, mesmerized, at every page.

When she's ready to settle down in my lap she brings it over and starts reciting the lines, \\"Book, blanket, friends, milk...\\" over and over. It's one of the few books we both know by heart that I don't want to throw out the window, and has even surpassed Goodnight Moon on our list of keepers.

His autobiography, &quot;Models of My Life,&quot; discusses the single thread that underlined all of his intellectual conquests in artificial intelligence, sociology, cognitive science, psychology and economics. This one thread, animated by philosophical positivism and ripe scientific thirst, was his deep obsession with modeling and researching decision-theoretic behavior.It's interesting to note that even though decision theory (how intelligent agents percieve and act upon choices amid various modalities) serves as the impetus for Simons work, he uses &quot;Models&quot; instead of &quot;Model&quot; in the book's title. This is no accident. For you see, beautifully fitting of his memoir, this book delves into how Simon's one passion was his &quot;heuristic&quot; in choosing which of many paths he could have taken througout his life. The upshot: Simon's own life emulated the heuristic search (in AI) that he helped invent! Consequently, this lead him all over the globe, from Wisconsin to UChicago to Berkeley to Carnegie Mellon to China.This book is also about the times of Simon: the positivistic turn in social sciences, the scientific fermet of the 1950's, the cultural tumult of the 60's, the death of behaviorism and the rise of cognitivism -- all along, peppered with intrigue of the politics of academia. Although the writing can get quite dry at times, his book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Models of My Life","review":"Herbert Simon's research contributes to human knowledge in many different areas, including economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and organizational behavior. In each of the mentioned areas, his contributions are ranked among the most important and influential that even a scientist who focuses solely in one area finds hard to achieve. The testimony is the top awards that the community in each discipline bestowed upon him--the Nobel prize is only one of which.The secret of this interdisciplinary success is that he is, in his own word, a \\"monomaniac\\", studying only one thing--human decision process--for fifty years. The field of his own choosing is not bounded by usual academic disciplines, however, and he did study it from many different aspects, from the levels of individual cognition to organizational decisions, using tools as varied as mathematics, computer simulations, and human subjects.This book detailed his own account of the various aspects of his life, personal and professional, in a sincere and direct prose. From the childhood that undoubtedly helped set the tone for his later accomplishments, the way he managed and nurtured new academic thoughts that later grown into full-fledged disciplines (artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and, less prominently, bounded rationality), to the philosophy of working and living including brief exposures to familial life, we can learn tremendously from hise xperience, decisions, and actions.How could he achieve as much as he did? We can glean several lessons from his stories. He collaborated extensively. He learned a great deal from the outstanding individuals he respected. He had a love for truth and rigor in reasoning. An empiricist who firmly believed that any valid theory must be based on empirical facts, he did not hesitate to fight against widely held beliefs conflicting with facts. His work on bounded rationality which helped earn him the Nobel Prize is an outstanding case which his stubborn, and valid, arguments against mainstream theories brought a valuable alternative viewpoint to the world. Strong passion and the ability to break out of the mold and stand tall under storms are important characteristics exemplified by many past giants, including Galileo, Columbus, and Einstein.Not just a normal autobiography, but the story of a distinguished life we all can learn from."},{"Title":"Models of My Life","review":"Herbert Simon is an amazing figure in the world of science.

It is a wonderful opportunity to obtain a coherent overview of the views and contributions of one of the twentieth century's great thinkers. Simon - political scientist with his Ph.D. from University of Chicago, founder of the new and emerging area of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychologist, Cargegie-Mellon faculty member, Nobel laureate for economics (1978), and contributing philosopher of science - was no dilitante. This book, which is written is a very accessible style, reveals the integrity and evolution of his thinking, which can be extracted only with relative difficulty from his large and diverse literary corpus. It is also an inspiring book for any person with an active intellectual life in science or philosophy.Thomas J. Hickey, www.philsci.com"},{"Title":"Models of My Life","review":"Satisficing as in searching for \\"good enough\\" actions rather than the optimal ones is one of the many contributions Herbert Simon is most famous for, in addition to being one of the parents of Artificial Intelligence. Whether the topic is management decision making, economics, traveling, teaching, or computer programs, this Renaissance Man had a life that many or most would envy.Herbert Simon is a true example to exemplify the benefits of multi-discipline efforts as one subject does not always know the answers. If anyone is interested in building their own latticework of mental models then the life of Mr. Simon is one to emulate. As this is not your average biography, expect to be challenged as the reading may take you to subjects that you are unaware of or have been exposed to. However, this is what makes the experience worth the trip as my many notes and earmarks attest to.As his life was about scientific discovery to quote, \\"I have sketched the theory of scientific discovery to which my study of these problems has led me. It is not a theory of global rationality but one of human limited computation in the face of complexity\\".

Born in Belgium in 1903, Simenon turned out hundreds of novels. Simenon's obsession with writing caused him to break off an affair (he was prolific in this area of his life as well) with the celebrated Josephine Baker in Paris when he could only write twelve novels in the twelve month period in which they were involved. Although best known for his Inspector Maigret detective novels, Simenon also wrote over a hundred novels that he referred to as \`romans durs' (literally \\"hard novels\\"). NYRB Books is reissuing Simenon's hard novels. \\"The Widow\\" is their latest release. NYRB chooses its Simenons wisely. \\"The Widow\\" is a fine book.I've sometimes thought of the arc of a person's life as one that consists of a series of narrowing options. On the day we are born the options available to us seem limitless. But the decisions made for us and the decisions we make every day serve to winnow out our options. It struck me, as I read \\"The Widow\\" that a typical Simenon story presents us with characters whose options seem so constrained to them that their actions, often desperate and violent, appear inevitable. \\"The Widow\\" is no exception. Tati is a middle-aged widow, living in a small village in a house owned by her aged father-in-law. She has clawed her way up to this not quite middle-class existence and will endure hard work and the infrequent sexual demands of the father-in-law to maintain her rightful place in this home. Jean, is a murderer, recently-released from a French prison. Unlike Tati, he comes from a solid, relatively wealthy local family. They meet on a bus and Tati decides without hesitation that Jean will provide her with help around the farm. Jean sees Tati as someone who can provide him with food, shelter, and a bedtime companion. This mutually beneficial relationship works out fine for a while, until Jean discovers the attractive young girl (Tati's niece) that lives on the adjacent property. From that point on the relationship between Jean and Tati takes a turn for the worse and continues to deteriorate. In a very real sense the options available to Jean and Tati are so dramatically narrowed in such a short span of time that each feels that his/her actions are inevitable, almost commanded by fate. The conclusion, while predictable, is powerful not because of the actions that bring about that conclusion but because of the overpowering sense of fate that drives the actions. Reading \\"The Widow\\" was like watching a storm at sea. You can see it a long ways off, you know it is coming, yet when it arrives it still manages to knock the wind out of you.Paul Theroux's \\"Introduction\\" was interesting and on point. Theoroux points out the comparisons often made between Simenon and his contemporary, Albert Camus. Their writing shares much in terms of the sense of alienation and despair that infuses their characters. Theroux notes that Simenon never seemed to suffer the agony of the writer and believed that the ease with which words spilled out of him and on to paper were held against him by the literary establishment. He didn't suffer enough for his writing to be accorded the highest accolade. I tend to agree with that point. I don't believe, however, that Simenon's writing surpassed that of Camus. I do think that the comparison itself is valid and that each is good enough to be discussed in the company of the other.\\"The Widow\\" is a fine example of the craft of Georges Simenon. Highly recommended. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"The Widow","review":"NYRB is reissuing many of the so-called, \\"romans durs\\" (\\"hard novels\\") written in haste but with great aplomb by the immensely prolific (400 plus novels) Georges Simenion. Obvious parallels exist between this novel and it's contemporary, \\"The Stranger\\", written by Albert Camus. In fact, Andre Gide found it the better of the two novels, which (to the chagrin of Simenon) despite that endorsement, failed to win the Nobel Prize in Literature for him.This brief novel is beautifully written. For example, \\"...the summer was spoiled. Every two days, every three days at most, a storm rumbled in the distance without even bringing a cooling shower. It could be felt far off in the air, somewhere in the direction of Morvan. The atmosphere was heavy. The rays of the sun, suddenly, seemed painted in oils.\\" It also has the air of objective detachment that permeates, \\"The Stranger\\". As in that book, the protagonist of this one, Jean Passerat-Monnoyeur, commits a crime (in the closing pages, he murders \\"the widow\\", Mrs Couderc), but has little apparent motive; he, in essence, just \\"felt like it\\", in a phrase. The murder could not even pass as an impulse. There are implications of \\"predestination\\" throughout the book which become grating, as if Simenon was attempting to interject psychoanalytic elements into the otherwise spare story.Unlike Camus' novel, however, the denouement seems clumsy and unexplained. Simeonon drops portentious hints of forthcoming violence, such as Jean repeatedly mentally reviewing elements of the French criminal code on murder; he's been there before, having killed a man over gaming loses. The second crime, the murder of Madame Couderc, could be construed as having been vaguely provoked by her jealousy over his dalliance with a neighbor girl. Because it is abrupt and therefore hard to fathom and given that it is not the culmination of a series of events, but rather a tenuous extension from them (beforehand, the jealous nagging was received with equanimity), the reader is left with the impression that Simenon was ready to move to another novel and simply chose to end this one with a jarring crime.In summary, this is a good novel, certainly on par with his others in NYRB. Unlike Gide, I did not consider it first rank."},{"Title":"The Widow","review":"This novel, published the same year as The Stranger and eerily similar, is more psychologically astute and more worthy of reading twice. Simenon creates a pastoral idyll with subtle hints of deep dischord, then builds effects until you know something terrible is going to happen, and sustains and builds this suspense until at last there is murder... on the next to last page."},{"Title":"The Widow","review":"Totally drew me into the characters and setting.

Score card:10/10: An exemplary novel that covers the same thematic territory as mystery/thrillers but is probably not even considered a genre work (start with Crime and Punishment and work your way down...).9/10: A worthy novel which may not rate a 10, but is still an excellent, re-readable novel. A 9 may also not be considered within the genre. Think Brighton Rock or Dog Soldiers.8/10: Re-readable, perhaps a classic of the genre or something at the top of the genre. Think Chandler, Hammett, much of Elmore Leonard. (Many would rate the classics of the genre higher than an 8).7/10: Re-readable if you're in the mood. Solid genre work (think lesser Chandler, Hammett and Leonard).6/10: A very good, well-crafted and enjoyable genre work, but essentially not re-readable (think Michael Connelly, John Sandford, Lee Childs).5/10: Decent genre work, but certainly not re-readable, and possibly something you may not even finish if something better comes along.4/10: A flawed piece of genre work with possibly some good parts.

This promised to go the limit.\\" -Joe Gillis character in Sunset BoulevardAmazon stars: divide score by 2 and then round up, to soften this tough scale. In some cases (especially for a 6), add an extra star to put the review on the same basis as other reviews.*** *** ***Simenon underrated? Well, shouldn't writers be judged by their best work? Read Simenon's best novels and you may not be so sure that you've placed him correctly. If Simenon had published only a select 40 novels (and no Maigret's), his reputation would be much higher. In this harrowing tale, which is often compared with The Stranger, published the same year, the rendering of a provincial French town and its denizens is close to flawless.Is the ending justified and inevitable? Do we really know Jean and what drives him? Yes and no, although I would lean toward yes. The character of Jean is revealed by indirection, carefully revealed memories which provide glimpses into the chaos at his center. Outwardly easygoing and tractable, there is a deep strain of irrationality and impulsiveness within him. Rational types may accuse Simenon as playing writerly games, but I think the portrait of Jean is rather good. You can rarely fault Simenon for what he puts into his stories - only for what he leaves out or the shortcuts he takes. The other central portrait, Tati, in her provincial surroundings is brilliant. In her own way, Tati is as obsessive as Jean. In combination with Jean and catalyzed by Tati's bete noire, the girl, an explosive situation is created. If Simenon cut any corners, it's in the plot device that puts Tati out of commission, accelerating the shift in her personality that pushes the story to its violent conclusion. No spoiler there - the dust jacket and Paul Theroux's introduction pretty much give the game away.Although everyone notes the comparison with The Stranger, I thought the most astute statement Theroux made in the introduction was \\"...at first glance he seems easily classified and on second thought (after you've read 50 or 60 of his books) unclassifiable.\\"9/10, Amazon 5 stars"},{"Title":"Practical Plastic Surgery for Nonsurgeons","review":"This book is really very nicely done.

Being a Libertarian --the whole philosophy behind the Open-Source Movement really appeales to me. . . much the way freedom and our Founding Father's vision of America appeals to me. If source code were freely available, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of programmers the world over could constantly fix bugs and improve, not only the LINUX operating system (OS) as is happening now, but all other applications (APPs) that exist, or that will come into existence. An entire new world of software would bloom under new licensing protocols (known in part as copyleft) if source code were open to all. The reliability, robustness and quality of LINUX (not to mention that about 50% of the Internet and many super-computers now run on it), is living proof that this is a wave of the future.In fact, Microsoft, in their argument to the Justice Department, may actually be accurate when they said that in no way do they have a monopoly on anything, especially an OS, when one considers that LINUX may end up out-competing with corporate-originated software, such as Windows 95, 98, NT, ME and 2000. This book goes into the politics and technology behind this.Easily understood, the book invites one's imagination go wild . . . what if OPEN SOURCE, and the idea that software created this way and disseminated over the Internet, is Humanity's way of working together and, through free-enterprise competition, finally giving birth to AI. . . maybe even a friendly-version of Vernor Vinge's SINGULARITY!One of the important books: VERY well-written, with a lot of spunk and creativity."},{"Title":"Lesbians Are So Chic (Listen Up!)","review":"Written in response to the mid 1990s \\"lesbian chic\\" phenomenon, this slim 60-page volume discusses lesbian representation in the mainstream media.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, hw wrote numerous books on religious and political issues, as well as articles for LOOK, THE ATLANTIC, and THE NEW REPUBLIC among many other magazines. One of his lesser known works (&quot;God grant me the strength to change the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I cannot and the wisdom to know the difference&quot;) still adorns the bric-a-brac sold in Christian bookstores. And, not far from his old office at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, a street is named after him. Richard Wightman Fox argues that beginning in the 1930s, Niebuhr became disenchanted with the &quot;social gospel&quot; theology that had come to dominate the so-called &quot;mainline&quot; Protestant churches. Niebuhr concluded that man is an inherently imperfect creature (and therefore all attempts to create a perfect society are futile), but that Christians still have to try to Christianize the social order. Such efforts are doomed to fail if their ultimate goal is the perfectability of man, but they can succeed if they have more limited goals. In other words, the world could be made better but it could not be re-made. In this way, Niebuhr reconciled in his own mind two opposing groups: the social gospel liberals and the conservative theologians who believed in sin. Niebuhr's belief in the reality of sin combined with his quest for social justice is generally called &quot;neo-orthodoxy,&quot; though Fox uses this term only a few times. Fox does an excellent job of demonstrating how well Niebuhr's ideas fit with the assumptions of American liberals from the 1940s through the 1960s. Cold War liberals prided themselves on being both idealistic and realistic. To borrow one of Niebuhr's own phrases, American liberals were the optimistic &quot;children of light&quot; when it came to wiping out poverty and racial discrimination at home, but they were the pessimistic &quot;children of darkness&quot; when they dealt with Soviet Communism. No wonder Reinhold Niebuhr was the intelligentsia's favorite theologian. If Fox fails to capture anything about Niebuhr, it is just how un-spiritual (non-religious?)so much of Niebuhr's writings now seem. Niebuhr focused on four topics: God, Sin, Man, and the Social Order. But somehow Sin, Man, and the Social Order frequently crowd God out of the picture, and we're left wondering if we're dealing with a theologian or a social theorist or the Democratic Party's leading intellectual. To put it only slightly unfairly, Niebuhr was a brilliant and profound theologian, but he was the kind of theologian who maybe spent too much time wondering about who the next President ought to be."},{"Title":"Reinhold Niebuhr: A Biography, with a New Introduction","review":"I have not read this book, so this is really just a comment, but I have recently read the excellent work Why Niebuhr Now? by the late historian John Patrick Diggins.Why Niebuhr Now?I recently read The Pragmatic God - On the Nihilism of Reinhold Niebuhr, by Professor Harry J. Ausmus,The Pragmatic God (American University Studies. Series VII. Theology and Religion), a book that, strangely, has been universally ignored by scholars in history, philosophy, and religion. Ausmus contends that the logical consequence of Niebuhr's thought is nihilism, a rather serious charge to lodge against a Christian theologian and preacher.Why has this work, published in 1990, been ignored?I suspect that Niebuhr scholars and others fear that accepting the challenge to examine Ausmus' thesis may just disclose some nihilism in their thought."},{"Title":"Reinhold Niebuhr: A Biography, with a New Introduction","review":"For those interested in ONLY the historical Neibuhr, this book might fit the bill. There is almost no attention given to his theology, so I do not recommend it to readers who have no prior knowledge of Niebuhr.

When these two children were quite young, their parents died while cruising on a boat. Gwendolen cannot drown because she's a witch. With Cat knowing this, he grabbed on to her. They were one of the few people who survived the disaster. Funds were started for the people who survived. The other people that survived took the money in their funds and went to go live somewhere else. Only Gwendolen and Cat stayed. They both decided to live with Mrs. Sharp, an old witch that lived nearby. Before they moved in with her, they went back home to collect their belongings. At Mrs. Sharp's, they all started looking for any belongings that were valuable to trade in for witch lessons for Gwendolen from Mr. Nostrum, a necromancer. They found Gwendolen and Cat's mother's diamond earrings, but Gwendolen snatched them out of Mrs. Sharp's hands. Besides that, they found three letters all with the same signature. The letters were all signed by Chrestomanci. Not knowing who this person was, they traded in the three letters for witch lessons from Mr. Nostrum. As Gwendolen became a proud student by Mr. Nostrum, Cat didn't. Cat was not a witch nor a warlock or any sort of magic-doer of any sort, at least that's what everyone thought. Mrs. Sharp decided to have him take violin lessons. One day while Cat was practicing, Gwendolen came storming in from next door and turned Cat's violin into a cat. The cat yowled and hissed just like a bad-playing violin would sound. They named the cat Fiddle. A couple days later, Gwendolen came in very happy. She said they were going to live with Chrestomanci. When they got to Chrestomanci Castle, they unpacked and got their rooms assigned to them. The next day, Gwendolen and Cat started their first lessons from Mr. Saunders, their magic teacher. Gwendolen soon found that not only was witchcraft about magic, it was also about the history of it. Since she was not allowed to do magic without an adult's supervision, she thought she would try and show Chrestomanci how great her magical abilities were. After having gone too far, Gwendolen got her witchcraft taken away by Mr. Saunders. The next day, they found that she was gone and instead another girl was in her place. Her name was Janet. She looked extremely similar to Gwendolen. Cat soon also found that he was an enchanter, just like Chrestomanci. He also had 9 lives to spare like Chrestomanci as well. These kinds of people were extremely rare. Janet decided to stay at Chrestomanci Castle, while Gwendolen was off being queen in another world."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Charmed Life is a great book.

I'm a little late) and I'll openly admit I came to her work through Miyazaki's amazing film \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\". Imagine how stupid I felt when I realized that I had been missing out on one of the best writers of our age. While it starts off slowly, Jones's first Chrestomanci book is still a grand, magical, yet simple adventure that sweeps the reader off their feet into a quirky yet solid world that readers will enjoy again and again.Eric, a.k.a., Cat Chant, is a small and passive boy who thinks that he has no magical powers unlike his sister Gwendolen. Gwendolen is an ambitious, spoiled, and powerful girl who dreams of controlling the world. One day, when their parents die in a tragic boat accident, Gwendolen's powers attract the attention of the dapper and eccentric Chrestomanci. Chrestomanci is an enchanter, and a nine lived one at that, so that means he controls and governs all magic in the twelve related worlds. Chrestomanci seems to take an interest in Gwendolen, so he invites her and Cat to live in his castle.When they arrive at the castle, both children dislike it at first. But Cat, being the passive boy that he is, quickly makes friends with Chrestomanci's two children even though he's absolutely frightened to death of their father. But Gwendolen has other ideas. She hates the fact that she has to learn maths and history instead of magic in school, and she is absolutely appaled that Chrestomanci doesn't take notice in her powers. Soon, Gwendolen sets out on a war of wills and magic against Chrestomanci and his castle, and Cat is unbeknowingly caught up in the whirlwinds of his sister's dangerous ambitions.Jones is brilliant in her prose and writing. She easily writes with a sense of whimsy, while at the same time fleshing out realistic characters and villains. Cat is passive at first, but he soon grows a spine and stands up against the one thing that holds him back (I won't ruin the surprise). Jones' magic is an everyday and casual part of life for the characters, but it comes in second to their emotions and the overall story. The story takes so many surprising twists that shocked and surprised me, I was literally biting my nails towards the end wondering what would happen next.\\"Charmed Life\\" is a delightful and charming surprise. While not a grand and sweeping epic, it will still sweep readers off their feet with the simple and quiet humor, magic, and sheer enjoyment that Jones so evidently finds and puts into her work. This book is not to be missed, and I can only end with saying how foolish I feel now that I didn't find Diana sooner."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This story and the next (\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\") are easily the most complex and interesting stories in the Chrestomanci series, and really the ones that the rest hang upon, because they really explain who and what the \\"Chrestomanci\\" is, and the role he plays in the fascinating universe Diana Wynne Jones has created. This is fantasy at its best, well written and very inventive, with characters that seem both familiar and bizarrely unique. It is, I suppose, not life-changing fiction but it keeps you there and makes you care and gives an opportunity to wonder. (It is no accident that Hayao Miyazaki based his latest film - Howl's Moving Castle -- on one of Jones' novels: they seem to have imaginations that operate on the same wavelength; like him, she is endlessly inventive and capable of a sublime blending of the supernatural and the ordinary, and loves finding magic in machines, and has an obsession with cats.)The basic premise of the \\"Chrestomanci multiverse\\" is that every time there is a major event that \\"changes\\" the world, the world actually divides into two alternate realities, one in which the event occurs and one in which it doesn't. Somehow, though, while the possibilities might seem infinite there are a limited number of possibilities that resemble the one Chrestomanci inhabits enough to warrant his general attention and concern. Within each major world variation, there are nine alternates (don't ask why just nine) that are apparently unified because they have the \\"same\\" people doing different things in them. It sometimes happens, though, that an individual within one of those realities has no parallel in the others, and so the \\"lives\\" that would belong to the other realities actually belong to him or her. Such a nine-lived individual has powerful magic and becomes a likely candidate for taking over the position of the British-hired Chrestomanci (think a mixture of Rowling's Minister of Magic for an indication of his range of responsibilities, with Head of Hogwarts for his overall competency).Speaking of Rowling, some have compared Jones to Rowling and there are some interesting parallels -- so many that it is hard not to think that Rowling had at least read some of Diane Wynne Jones' stories. Still, I don't agree with others who say Jones is a better writer than Rowling. There is a way in which she is: for her elegance of prose, her compactness of style, for the overall simplicity and completeness of her stories. Still, I think that Rowling is superior because what Jones doesn't try to do Rowling does very well. Jones creates another world whose basic features are similar to ours, but is different in specifiable ways. In that sense it is pure fantasy, a work of the imagination that she can tinker with and alter in various stories but is basically self-contained and organized in such a way that each story can be really complete. Rowling fits her story of another world into THIS world and sets herself with what seems to me a much more difficult task of accommodating her fantasy to the unknown and improbable and strange and unfinished character of any story set in this real world. The edges in any such story are unwieldy and it is a real tribute to Rowling (though in no way a criticism of Jones who has other aims) that she can wield them so well."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"In Charmed Life Eric -nicknamed Cat- is always being pushed aside by his much more magically able sister Gwendolen who is the only remaining member of his family.

Since Cat can't do magic to save his life she is far less interested in him. After a few years of Gwendolen taking magic lessons Chrestomanci, who is the most powerful enchanter in the world, takes an interest in the siblings and sends for them to come and live with him at his castle. But there is something strange about this castle and it inhabitants. Gwendolen claims that this castle is ruining her witchcraft abilities.

Wynne Jones (who has never, to my knowledge, written a bad book) expertly blends magic into the more everyday concerns of losing parents, sibling rivalry, and apparent talentlessness. Her &quot;message&quot; comes through with a light touch and her deadpan treatment of the domestic use of magic (like objects that shout for help when they're stolen) is terrific. I just wish Wynne Jones would get the kind of attention accorded to the Harry Potter series, because children are losing out.

The frustrating part is why poor Cat should be so loyal to his rotten sibling!The characters are delightful, the humor is lighthearted and down-to-earth, the magic is entertaining, and the story itself is the perfect fantasy: the day to day battles of an ordinary kid set in a world that is thoroughly extraordinary. We can all identify with poor Cat, and struggle with him as the more he tries to get out of hot water, the hotter it gets.Plus, you have to feel bad for a poor gingerbread man whose maker's magic was too weak to enable him to do anything more than feebly wave his arms.

Besides suffering from the same dullness as everyone else, he didn't really push the story along; he was dragged along. I kept reading to see what amazing conclusion Jones' had set up at the end, as she usually does. But the ending did not at all deliver. She did tie up all of the loose ends and revealed all the mysteries she carefully sprinkled throughout the book, but it was hardly a satisfying conclusion. Frankly, the book was boring!In all fairness, maybe I had high expectations after reading Howl's Moving Castle, but I was most dissatisfied with the lackluster cast of characters.

Cat and his sister, Gwendolyn, are now living in a vast and immense Castle, Chrestomanci Castle. Gwendolyn herself is a witch, and though she's quite a good one, she gets angry quite easily -- a darkness brews inside her that she can't control, and her spells are powerfully dangerous. When she is angry over the rules she has to put up with in Chrestomanci's Castle, she begins to conjure up many schemes to get rid of Chrestomanci himself once after all. Cat doesn't know how to stop his devious , stronger sister -- already she's gaining to much power, and goodness knows what she can do with her witchcraft ! Cat needs to somehow be brave , but he doesn't have magic in his own blood. That's why it would take more then human powers to stop Gwendolyn's evil ! From magical schemes to destroy everything Gwendolyn despises to a talking upset Dragon who's blood is wanted to a charmed pair of diamond earings that can never get lost by constantly screaming, 'I belong to Caroline Chant!' , Charmed Life is a hilarious and delightfully enjoyable novel that sparks an excellent written expression and humor, never failing to amuse but offer a good scare just as well. Dianna Wynne Jones has written a very charming novel."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Eric Chant, better known as Cat, is an orphan. He and his sister Gwendolen, who is a powerful witch, live with Mrs. Sharp until Chrestomanci comes to take them away. Cat and Gwendolen have a hard time settling into the Chrestomanci Castle, but soon, Cat finds that Julia and Roger, Chrestomanci's children, are rather quite fun to play with. He also discovers that Millie, their mother, is a splendidly nice person. However, Gwendolen feels miffed that no one in Chrestomanci Castle bends to her every whim or praises her as the most powerful person alive. So she sets out to prove that she is a witch to be reckoned with. Playing a number of tricks on Chrestomanci Castle, including turning the stained glass windows of the church to life, Gwendolen finally goes too far and gets her magic taken away. Imagine Cat's surprise, when, the next morning, he finds a Gwendolen look-a-like in Gwendolen's room who knows as little about the switch as Cat does himself. Cat, trying to avoid the trouble that he knows would be caused if Chrestomanci found that Gwendolen had bewitched herself to another world (which is what she had done), is in for a bumpy ride trying to handle the multitude of messes that Gwendolen has left him to deal with. I suggest you jump on in and join him! This book is well-written, and interesting. I have read it several times, and enjoy it more with each read."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Charmed Life is one of Diana Wynne Jone's best books. It's funny, exciting, intriguing and filled with those characters that are so easy to fall in love with. This was the first Diana Wynne Jones book that I ever read at the age of 12 and at 25 I'm re-reading them all and finding them as refreshingly imaginative as the first read. I recently read the Harry Potter books and while they are good it just made me want more from Diana Wynne Jones."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"If I were Diana Wynne Jones's publisher, I'd long ago have reissued the Christopher Chant books with that tease on the cover.While I'm usually suspicious of hyped books and movies, thinking that the hype was necessary because they're not really very good, in the case of Harry Potter I think they really are as good as everyone says they are. And yet, from the hype one would imagine that they were unique, that Rawling had done something that hadn't been done before. My own reaction when reading the HP books was that I was immediately reminded of the Chant books, and was using those as the standard against which I judged the HP books. And in my opinion the HP books come out quite well against that standard - they're very nearly as good...So if you know anyone who has read and liked HP, and isn't familiar with CC, buy this for them..."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I loved it as a kid, I love it now, and my daughter (8 y.o.) is thrilled with it. Fun."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Absolutely charming and delightful. I imagine this book to be something akin to if Roald Dahl had written a Harry Potter type book for teens. The old English made me laugh. Reminiscent of James and the Giant Peach/ Willy Wonka, but having to do with witches, enchantors, all sorts of magic, spells, and of course, family. This book was full of family-fun adventure; nothing too dark or violent. Pure magic."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This is truly a great fantasy book. I was instantly hooked on the characters of Cat and Chrestomanci, and couldn't put this book down. I went right out and picked up all the other books in the series that were available at the time, and have since picked up any new ones as soon as they came out. This is by far my favorite fantasy series!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I don't think there's a children's author living today that has as great a grasp on twist endings as Ms. Diana Wynne Jones. Jones has the dubious honor of being my current favorite fantasy writer for children and teens (aside from J.K. Rowling, I suppose). Her collected stories contain more whimsy and wit in a single paragraph than 98% of the adult books on the market today, let alone those for the kiddies. \\"Charmed Life\\" is the first in the collected Chrestomanci novel series. A witty tale of a brother and is magical sister, the book is pure Jones and as fresh as if it was written yesterday.Cat and his sister Gwendolen were the only survivors of the fatal boat crash that drowned both their parents and a host of innocent civilians. Now on their own, Gwendolen is turning out to be an incredibly competent young witch. Cat, for his part, isn't magical in the least and is perfectly content to stick by Gwendolen at all times. When a mysterious relative by the name of Chrestomanci comes to take the two to his home, Gwendolen (spoiled with a nasty sense of entitlement) thinks she's about to be realized as the genius sorceress she truly is. She's in for a nasty surprise as Chrestomanci and his large extended family treat her as normally as possible. When Gwendolen's pranks for attention go too far, Cat finds that her schemes might well upset the balance of magic in the world. Worse, she may not be the beloved sister he really needs.This story has all sorts of tiny magical details and sly spots throughout it. In many ways it's a book more similar to Harry Potter than most. Of course, \\"Charmed Life\\" originally was published in 1977 so there's little question of who may have influenced whom. The characters are, of course, great. Jones has always excelled at writing truly awful children. Real remarkably spoiled brats. Gwendolen is a perfect example of this. She's stuck-up, cruel, and not a very good sister. Cat, for his part, is completely passive. He lets Gwendolen do whatever she wants whenever she wants it, and even goes so far as to miss her when she unexpectedly disappears halfway through the book. Chrestomanci himself is a huge departure from the stereotypical wise wizard. He has a very nice wife and two slightly overweight (but likable once you get to know them) children. He's a spiffy dresser and not particularly old. I doubt that there are many like him in the fantasy wizard world.If there's a flaw with the book, it's that the reader has a hard time suspending disbelief at times. Once Cat finds himself in terrible trouble, he refuses to consult with Chrestomanci. The reasons for this are weak and somewhat confusing. Also, Chrestomanci himself is also prone to not explaining himself. He has a particularly weak reason for this as he explains at the end of the novel, making many of the plot points somewhat hard to believe at times.Otherwise, the book's a pip. If you've already discovered Diana Wynne Jones, this one should certainly not disappoint. If you've never encountered her before, this is an excellent place to start. It's witty and well-written and full of particularly enjoyable characters and situations. There's enough imagination in this puppy to tide you over for quite some time. A true Jones creation."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This is a great book! When my friend requested the Year of the Griffin, I loved it and saw in the library there was millions of books by the same author. It's about shy Cat Chant and his sister. Their parents die and they first get sent to this old lady. Cat's sister, Gwendolen, takes magic lessons.And to pay for the lessons they found letters with the signiture Chretomanci. Later he adopts them, but they don't know why. Oh yes, and Gwendolen hates Chrestomanci and does these bad things to him. Find out more if you read it! Great read!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"An alternate world where history is not quite the same, and wizards and witches are common occupations. A young boy, Cat, and his older sister, Gwendolen, are left orphans at an early age, and become wards of the town. Gwendolen becomes a student of an unscrupulous hedge wizard with his own agenda, before she and Cat are adopted by the mysterious Chrestomanci and taken to live in an even more mysterious castle where the staff have hidden talents.Rivalries between the children and their new found cousins, and a tendency to play magical pranks, keep the story interesting. To say more would reveal the secrets, but power is not always where you think it is, and some people don't know their own talents. In spite of evil intentions of the villains, or maybe because of them, some people end up better off then when they started.Overall, this is a good novel for pre-teen to teenage readers, but adults may also enjoy the story. I thought it was very good. It is an earlier novel by the author, introducing characters in later novels, and should probably be read before many of the other novels."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I read this book 12 years ago, when I was a teenager.

The story is fasinating and draws you in leaving you with the urge to continue. Diana is a wonderful story teller and deserves all the praise she gets. I am currently reading some of her other novels wich i encourage you to do,(novels like &quot;Witch Week&quot; and &quot;Howls moving Castle&quot;) if you like Charmed life, because they are also filled with amusment that will keep you reading for hours."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I nicked this book from a friend in 6th grade. I read it eight times that semester. Cathy was ever so cross when I finally gave it back, and refused to ever lend it to me again. Its an awesome book. I was mesmerised by the story.

I like it MUCH better than Witch Week."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I'm known to read a lot, but this book is incredible! It's humorous, has a good plot, and it makes you want to learn more.

Just read this book carefully, and you'll never put it down!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Diana Wynne Jones has been turning out first rate children's fantasy for years, and this is one of her best. I'm still amazed that more Harry Potter starved fans aren't demanding instant reprints of her works. Here too a boy discovers that he appears to have more talent than he thought. He also discovers that his sister's talents are quite what they seem either, as both of them are taken to live with Chrestomanci (a top public official) to learn more about the world of high magic. This is a quirky, well-written, very entertaining book with more than one surprise before the end. Now that adult readers are discovering how much fun children's books can be, they should be beating a path to Diana Wynne Jones' door, begging for more."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I've always been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, and I was thrilled when I came upon an audio cassette version of one of my favorite books &quot;Charmed Life&quot; It's read by Tony Robinson, who has a wonderful voice and I can honestly say that it does justice to the original"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"First read this book maybe 15 years ago and never forgot it. It sticks out in my mind as one of the best children's books ever, but it's got amazing ideas and details and sub-plots that you think about again, even when you're older -- I still enjoy reading this book every so often. It's got everything - magic, adventure, philosophy, sibling rivalry, and just all around excellent story-telling. There are other books now that play on the theme of magic and have become v. popular but I haven't yet read one to equal this. Also liked the prequel a lot."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Diana Wynne Jones has totally surpassed herself in this book. I couldn't put it down, as the tension built up towards the end as Cat began to find out about Gwendolen. I consider it a classic, and one which everyone should read. I tried to read all the rest of her &quot;Chrestomanci&quot; series - and I have! I love this book!!!!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I bought this book some ten years or so ago. It was my favourite book for about five years until I leant it to a &quot;friend&quot; who liked it so much that she never gave it back. I'm so happy that this book is back in print because I still yearn to read it. Which goes to show just what an absolutely amazing book this is and this isn't even my favourite DWJ book. That, incidentally is Dogsbody which was also stolen. Anyway back to the review, this book has everthing for lovers of fantasy and magic alike:- parallel worlds, extra lives, spoilt megalomaniac children and of course lots and lots of magic. It is one of the Chrestomanci books and I recommend that anybody who reads and loves this book, should also try reading The Lives of Christopher Chant, Witch Week and The Magicians of Caprona by the same author. I have read the other reviews and what has struck me is that every reviewer seems to have read all of her other books, as have I. Diana Wynne-Jones has a knack of creating such warm, real characters and writes with a lot of humour. She is the kind of author who inspires such loyalty from her readers. Go on-read this book. We can't all be wrong!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"In my opinion, Diana Wynne Jones is simply one of the best YA fantasy writers out there. She ranks right up there with Lloyd Alexander and Philip Pullman. The intelligence and creativity of her work is consistently remarkable, and Charmed Life is a wonderful example of the scope of her imagination and plots.Charmed Life, an entry in the Chrestomanci series (which can be read in any order without any knowledge of the others--others include Witch Week, The Lives of Christopher Chant, The Magicians of Caprona), is a charming British YA fantasy that far predates the Harry Potter mania. Fans of Harry Potter might like this; it has a similar enough plot--young orphaned boy with awful relatives is taken to a place where his talents can begin to expand. Young Eric, familiarly known as Cat, even slides around on magic mirrors (as opposed to magic broomsticks). However, Charmed Life is in every way superior to the Harry Potter books. For instance, the world's concept is much more profound and interesting. The world Cat inhabits is one in which magic abounds and technology is a bit backward-- not this world as we have known it at any point in time. Rather, it's a version of our world had key events been changed. (For example, a possible alternate world would be if Napoleon had succeeded in his campaigns. We would probably live in a world with a primary language of French.) Secondly, again unlike the HP books, there are no completely evil characters. Diana Wynne Jones has a talent for creating idiosyncratic, realistic people, and even those who are...less than wonderful, have their moments of niceness. And even the 'nice' people have their faults. Good doesn't always automatically win, and Cat is hardly a faultless protagonist.Diana Wynne Jones takes common themes and imbues them with so much life and color and humor that the result-- Charmed Life (among many others) is compulsively likable. Who else could successfully mix enchanters, shrieking furniture, violin-turned-cats, maid-turned-frogs, silverware, family mysteries, alternate worlds, adventure and wit save a master magician such as Diana Wynne Jones? If you haven't read anything by her but like your fantasies good and British with dizzyingly intricate plots, do try her work. I particularly recommend Howl's Moving Castle, Hexwood, and, of course, Charmed Life. These are books that deserve to be read...and reread...and reread...Ailanna"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I read Charmed Life when I was in fourth or fifth grade, and immediately bought a copy of my own to read again and again. I loved all Diana Jones's books, but this one was my first and my favorite. Fifteen years later I still feel fond of Cat and resentful of his hellion sister Gwendolyn, and I still wince at the hilarious atrocities she perpetrted at Chrestomanci castle. A children's book that doesn't patronize children, but instead indulges their sophisticated sense of humor and appreciation of the travails of a bildungsroman hero is a rare treat indeed. I still keep my old copy so that some day my children can learn to love Jones's wonderful books too."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I first read Charmed Life many years ago (I was probably about 8). I have no idea where I got it, but I got this and &quot;A Tale of Time City&quot; at around the same time, and devoured them both. Since then I have read many of her books, finding them when I can, rereading them, lending them and borrowing them. Though I've loved them all (some of my favorites being &quot;The Power of Three&quot;, &quot;A Tale of Time City&quot; and &quot;The Lives of Christopher Chant&quot;) the only one I still have in my hands now, 8 years later, is this one (guess I never trusted anyone enough to lend it to them). I love it more and more each time I read it, and I love Cat more and more as well. I've read novels with more complicated plots, and larger words, but nothing pulled off as well as her books are... If only she had more (and all of my copies hadn't dissapeared!) Oh well - guess I have to read &quot;Charmed Life&quot; again... Shucks :)"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I remember when I was 20 years old and discovered The Chronicles of Narnia for the first time. Now, 23 years later, I can look back at hours and hours of great fun. First reading the books myself, then reading them over and over for my four kids. A little later I discovered The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but for about 20 years those were to only fantasy books I had read.Then, three years ago the Harry Potter era started in our family. And now we live in a Harry Potter world here. But, in spite of all the pages a Harry Potter book doesn't last forever. It was with great pleasure that we some time ago opened my daughter's birthday gift and found the series The Worlds of Chrestomanci. They are perfect while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come, and perfect when you want something to read :-)The first book in the series is Charmed life. It tells the story of Eric Chant, known as Cat, and his older sister Gwendolen. Cat and Gwendolen's parents dies in a boat accident, and all Cat have is his older sister. She is a witch, and Cat adores her. They first live with an old woman in the town, but it soon shows that Gwendolen has a very special talent for witchcraft, and to their joy they are asked for to come and live with the great Chrestomanci in his castle. Their life in his castle is not like the two kids expected, and Gwendolen, the witch, takes the easy way out and runs off to another world, Cat has to stay and fight his way through the days.The novel is filled with fantasy and unexpected events. And it never let you get bored. The book is meant for young readers, and any booklover between 9-12 will love it. I even think any book lover between 9 and 99 will. Try the book, and you will be so charmed by it you just need the others in the series as well.Is it magic? Who knows......Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"First things first. I love fantasy. I read everything fantasy that I can get my hands on. I search libraries high and low for good fantasy novels. I discovered Diana Wynne Jones long before Harry Potter came out and was entranced by the world of Chrestomanci. Then the Harry Potter books came out and I read them. I enjoyed them very much, but they are not in any way comparable to the Chrestomanci or Dalemark quartets by Diana Wynne Jones. I have read articles in newspapers saying that Diana's books are good to read while waiting for thhe next Harry Potter book to come out or that her books are ALMOST as good as Harry Potter. Diana is not getting the credit she deserves. Maybe I am biased because I am annoyed with Harry Potter Mania, but I have read Diana's books over and over, enjoying them every time, and that is more than I can say about Harry Potter. No offense to J.K. Rowlings. Anyway, Charmed Life is a spectacular book. It is not my favorite in the series(I'm not sure what the best book in the series is),but it is a wonderful example of Diana's spectacular writing skills. Cat's parent's died in a tragic boating accident when he was very young and his older sister Gwendolen and he are given into the care of a witch named Mrs. Sharp. Then a mysterious and elegant man called Chrestomanci who may or may not be an enchanter takes them to live with him and his children, Julia and Roger. Cat looks up enormously Gwendolen and is extremely loyal to her, so when she takes dislike to Chrestomanci after he forbids her to do witchcraft and begins plotting nasty things to do to him, Cat just watches. Cat feels betrayed and is devastated when Gwendolen leaves his world in a fit of rage and drags a girl from another world to replace her. What happens then is for you to find out when you read the book."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"When I was a kid Diana Wynne Jones was my favorite author, and &quot;Charmed Life&quot; and &quot;The Lives of Christopher Chant&quot; were my favorite books of hers. They are just so inventive, exciting ... a great read. Nowadays I recommend them to all fans of Harry Potter, from my youngest brother on up."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Just as she has done in many of her novels, Jones cleverly animates the life of the young hero in Charmed Life. In all her stories, she demonstates the ability to take the reader around many obvious turns before they know the real truth. She does this in the life of young Cat, a unsuspecting magician in the making. She paints the average life of an unaverage boy. And she kept me going throughout the book, oblivious to the dark aspects of several of the other characters, and what the eventual outcome of the story would be. The presence of the patriarcal hero Crestomanci should indicate to anyone familiar with Jones' work that this one is another great read. I began reading Jones in junior high school, and continue to do so now that I am past college. Charmed Life is another of her books that I pick up and reread when I am between books. I have read all the Harry Potter books and loved each one. But in the back of my mind, I know that it was Diana Wynne Jones that originally inspired within me all the reasons that I all love Harry. Anyone will agree with me if they give Jones a chance. I also highly reccomend Howl's moving Castle, The Lives of Christopher Chant(especially for Harry Potter fans), Dogsbody, and Eight days of Luke (my personal favorite)."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Out of all of Diana Wynne Jones's novels, \\"Charmed Life\\" is possibly her most famous, and her most read. It is the first published of her Chrestomanci novels, and it stars many of her most famous characters with her requisite twisting plot and quirky sense of humour. Set in a parallel world ripe with magic, wizards and magical creatures, DWJ's \\"Chrestomanci\\" quartet were clearly inspirational to J. K. Rowling in her creation of Hogwarts and her wizarding world - a lot of comparisons can be made between the two. Ultimately \\"Harry Potter\\" is the deeper and more intricate series, but DWJ's novels are stand-alone, can be read out of order, and are rich in detail and cleverness.Gwendolyn Chant is an extraordinarily gifted witch, despite the fact that her little brother Cat has no magical ability at all. After their parents' deaths, the two orphans are taken in by Mrs Sharp amongst a neighbourhood of magical folk - but Gwendolyn has bigger plans for herself that concern nothing less than the conquering of the world. When the two of them are taken to Chrestomanci Castle, Gwendolyn is delighted - Chrestomanci is a powerful enchanter that she feels sure will teach and guide her on her way to world domination.But things are not quite as she expected - Chrestomanci has no desire whatsoever to make this young witch even more powerful before she gains a little self-control. With the added restrictions of their tutor Mr Saunders and Chrestomanci's family watching her every move, Gwendolyn has had quite enough - she begins to wage war on Chrestomanci.From there things only begin to get uglier, as Chrestomanci gets more and more stubborn and Gwendolyn becomes more and more frustrated. Stuck in the middle is Cat, desperately loyal to his sister but just as eager to fit in with his new family. Gwendolyn's plans are even deeper than expected, with secret trips to dodgy black marketeers and a hidden source of magic that even Cat is unaware of...Funny, heartfelt, realistic, imaginative and sometimes even a little grotesque, \\"Charmed Life\\" is one of a work of true children's literature. The characters are vivid, the storyline intriguing, and the morals sincere without being too heavy-handed. Some components are a little complicated: DWJ sprinkles hints and clues throughout the book and some of these are hard to remember - but all of that simply justifies a second reading to pick up the things you missed!Chrestomanci himself is a gem - think for a moment of all the famous wizards in literature. You're almost certainly thinking: Merlin, Gandalf, Dumbledore (and if you're rather well-read, Dallben, Merriman Lyon and Cadellin) What do all these wizards have in common? - they're old, wizened, sage-like and immensely wise. Chrestomanci turns this tired stereotype around on its head - he's handsome, well-dressed, reasonably young and quite infuriating at times! Plus, if you've already read \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\", the name of Chrestomanci's wife may make you smile...In typical DWJ fashion, the story does not end on a perfectly upbeat note - in fact it's rather sad, with only a trembling sort of hopefulness in our main character that will induce readers to seek out other Chrestomanci books: \\"Witch Week\\", \\"The Magicians of Caprona\\", \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" and \\"Mixed Magics\\" - an anthology of short stories."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Older than and superior to Harry Potter is: Chrestomanci, the tales of the world's most powerful enchanter, and the magical worlds that he goes through. This particular tale starts off very slow, but rapidly turns into a magical adventure at Chrestomanci's castle.Gwendolen and Cat Chant lose their parents in a tragic paddleboat accident, and end up having to live with a mildly talented local witch. But it soon becomes evident that though Cat has no magical powers, Gwendolen has enough for several people. She's so powerful and skilled, in fact, that she attracts the interest of Chrestomanci, who has her and Cat brought to his castle. But then things start to deteriorate. Gwendolen is an arrogant, spoiled girl who seems to think that since she has magic, she isn't restricted by the same rules as the others. She isn't allowed to do magic, pick the plants, mouth off to Chrestomanci's kids or the teachers, she has to do math and ordinary lessons. Gwendolen finds that Chrestomanci, not her, is the ruler of the castle -- and she doesn't like that at all. (Oh yeah -- she also wants to rule the world) Cat likes being at the castle, is intimidated by Chrestomanci, and likes hanging out with Chrestomanci's two kids.So she starts off on a one-witch campaign to make Chrestomanci notice and respect her: She infests the lawn with moles, causes apparitions in the windows, giant earthworms, fighting stained glass windows -- and then propels herself into another world, leaving her double with Cat. Cat must learn more about himself, his hidden power, and gain Chrestomanci's help before things get even worse.This book starts off slowly -- the first twenty pages are pretty dull, chronicling the background of Cat and Gwendolen and how they came to live with Mrs. Sharp. Not very magical. But things pick up as soon as Chrestomanci comes into the picture, and the magical goings-on are sprightly and delightful.As always, Jones shows great insight into kids' minds: Though Cat seems a little too passive at first, kids will like him, as they will the calm Roger and Julia. People who've read \\"Lives of Christopher Chant\\" will also see a familiar face in Chrestomanci's wife Milly. Chrestomanci is, as always, dapper and intelligent and cool-headed and thoroughly enjoyable.Though this book is compared to Harry Potter, it's superior in every way. Jones never tries to dazzle us with wow-isn't-that-amazing? magic, and her jokes never descend to low humor -- for example, the dueling stained glass windows, and the earrings that scream \\"I BELONG TO CAROLINE CHANT!\\" so they'll never get lost. As this is another world where magic is prevalent over science (due to different events long ago), the magic is more casual. There is also respect for authority figures (Chrestomanci); kids who don't save the world entirely on their own, but do play a pivotal part in it; and her villains aren't bad just because they ARE: Gwendolen is merely a brat with magical powers.This is a delightful fantasy book for all ages, especially for kids who feel oppressed by their siblings. (Read the rest of the series too!)"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Charmed Life was a wonderful book. It was exciting and, in my opinion, better than Harry Potter. I stumbled across it and bought it because it had a cat, my favorite animal, on the front cover.In this fantasy, Gwendolyn, a powerful witch, and her younger brother Cat are forced to go and live with a man called the Chrestomanci at his castle. Gwendolyn is angered at Chrestomanci for ignoring her and not letting perform magic, so she casts many mean spells on him. He refuses to budge his authority.Along with a surprise ending, this novel is one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Harry Potter or books involving magic. It has three other books in the series, all as good as the first. It provides many hours of good reading, even for people who don't like to read."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorite writers, and I think I've read her entire ouevre. I really admire and enjoy the skewed way she mixes references to contemporary British society with whacked-out fantasy, bad puns and truly numinous mythic resonances...I've found her novels to be caught in the netherworld between Intermediate Fiction and YA Fiction, but I consider that a good place to be---it's like she writes the book that needs writing instead of worrying about its ultimate age-appropriate audience, and this may be why she's not more widely-known in the US... Too many folks insist on easy-to-categorize books for younger readers, and hers are anything but easily categorized.Charmed Life was one of the first Jones novels I read, and it remains one of my favorites. In a Britain very close to our world's Britain, but with the rather important difference of magic-users being commonplace rather than legendary, a mild-mannered young boy named Cat is coping with his aggressively-talented sister, his orphan state, his left-handedness...and his process of self-discovery is a wild ride and a wonderful read. Highly-recommended."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I love all the Chrestomanci books, but this one was the best!!!! The detail of the characters are amazing! Cat's personality is really funny, I even kinda like Gwendolyn.

To date, I still believe that this is her best work because not only is the plot highly involving, but the timing and pacing of the novel is such that the reader is carried along effortlessly right to the very end. Its constantly surprising quality is how normal the fantastic appears to be. Her magical realism has a flavour that is all her own: a sensible mix of sorcery and teatime. Without a doubt, this book is a definite 'read'."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This book has been a favorite of mine since it was first published - I seem to reread it every two years or so. The characters are both charming and well described. One of the best books of its kind!"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This book is a wonderfully imaginative tale of an alternate England, mixing Victorian society with the practice of magic. I first read the book when it was marketed to adults, and loved it then. The characters of Cat, his sister Gwendolyn, Janet, and of course Chrestomanci, are all vividly drawn and come wonderfully to life.Don't be put off by the YA cover, this book can be enjoyed by fantasy lovers of any age."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"This is one of the best books that I've ever read, and trust me, I've read lots of books. I highly reccomend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"I am constantly on the lookout for new fantasy reads, because not only is it difficult to find a truly lasting (and by \\"lasting\\" I mean you think about it all the time, read it again and again, and gulp down every one of the author's other books) fantasy story, but if you do that author is usually what they call A Lofty One-Piece Wonder who writes one astonishingly beautiful story, gives it to the world...then settles into retirement and ignores all letters posted to them begging for a sequel.Ah, not so with Diana Wynne Jones.Hearing about her was actually an accident. I had picked up the book \\"Inkspell\\", the sequel to a book I'd enjoyed very much (Inkheart) and saw, on the back, that there was a quote on the back from \\"Diana Wynne Jones, author\\". For fun, I wandered over to the J's. Only a few Diana books were there -- THE MERLIN CONSPIRACY, ARCHER'S GOON, and -- the book that forever endeared me to this amazingly talented author -- EIGHT DAYS OF LUKE.Having five dollars just aching to be spent and about that many minutes left till we had to go, I bought it on a whim.And inhaled it that night.I was going through withdrawls. NEED -- MORE -- DIANA -- WYNNE -- JONES -- BOOKS!!!I got back to Borders and began to scrounge the shelves. Hmmm. \\"Chronicles of Chrestomanci\\". Looked okay -- not as good as I'd thought \\"Eight Days of Luke\\" was, but -- what was?I read a little, put it down. Read a little more, and -- couldn't stop.I am now on Book II, \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\".I think you understand what I'm trying to say. Buy this book -- and while you're at it get \\"Eight days of Luke\\", too.Rating: Very Good"},{"Title":"CHARMED LIFE","review":"Young Eric \\"Cat\\" Chant, doesn't mind the fact that he must live within the shadow of his older sister, Gwendolen, who is known as the most promising young witch on Coven Street. After all, she was the one who stuck by him when their parents were killed in a boating accident, and if it weren't for Gwendolen, Cat surely would have died. But he grabbed onto his loving sister, and due to the fact that witches can float, he floated away with her. However, the young orphans are soon summoned by Chrestomanci. A powerful sorcerer, who wants them to live within the walls of Chrestomanci Castle. Gwendolen, frustrated at the fact that Chrestomanci pays no attention whatsoever to the powers that she possesses, she decides to conjure of a tremendous scheme. One that has the power to destroy all the worlds of Chrestomanci.In this first book in the wonderful CHRESTOMANCI series, Diane Wynne Jones proves the point that she can write absolutely amazing fantasy for children/teens. Her characters, are in-depth, and enchanting, and carry themselves wonderfully throughout the entire novel. Cat is somewhat of a shy character, who is easily taken advantage of by his older, bossier sister, Gwendolen; while Gwendolen is spoiled, and conceited, and filled with tons of rage that shines through at many times throughout CHARMED LIFE; Chrestomanci is portrayed as a scary human being, but at times can also reveal a softer side. All the characters combined create one non-stop joy ride that will have the reader trying to figure out what will happen next. Filled with wonderful surprises contained on every page, this is sure to be a hit with all.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"A Translation of the New Testament (3 Vol. Set)","review":"As a collector this book was a horrible disappointment. Instead of photo-reproducing Wakefield's translation they apparently attempted to OCR the text. The text is a total mess. Besides an enormous amount of misprints there are 'weird' section headings that have little rhyme or reason. The book is near useless. You'd be much better off using the Google books website or printing it off that sight yourself. Wakefield's beautiful notes in the back are ruined and the Greek readings end up as misprinted garbled messes with English characters that in no way represent the Greek. It is beyond me as to why they would've even attempted such a piece of trash. A blind man could've typed a better job.

Jimmy eye-witnessed the killing of MLK and it is not the guy confessing from a prison cell. Unable to tell who is friend from foe because a police uniform means nothing, Smokey and Jimmy have changed identities in order to remain incognito.To support the two of them, Smokey cannot obtain a formal but traceable sleuth license even under his alias of Bill Grimshaw. Instead he does whatever comes his way to include some under the table inquiries. While dealing with Jimmy and the gangs, and his lover/employer relationship with a wealthy white woman, \\"Bill\\" agrees to investigate the death of a Black dentist. Rather quickly, \\"Bill\\" finds himself in the middle of the very thing he needs to avoid: the FBI and other police officials investigating a potential serial killer.The third Dalton historical mystery, THIN WALLS, is a fabulous tale that brings to life the turbulent sixties through the frustrations of various groups. This technique could have proven fatally stereotyped, but instead Kris Nelscott makes each group distinct in their rage at their inability to truly matter. The mystery is first class and Smokey's efforts to keep Jimmy clean feel genuine and makes him humanly like most caring parents. The series is as big a winner as the Detroit Tiger's World Series (Jets Superbowl was still a few weeks a way) victory.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Thin Walls: A Smokey Dalton Novel","review":"A respectable dentist is found dead in a Chicago park, his body posed in a manner that connects to crimes that were introduced in Smoke Filled Rooms, a series of murders of African-Americans. Young Jimmy Bailey is facing a new danger as he becomes susceptible to the romance of black power and prey to youthful street gangs who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. Not to worry, the Black Panthers are nearby. Smokey Dalton confronts the gang issue in the only way he knows how, head on, while dealing with the ever escalating complications of the case on which he is working. How complicated is it? The trail to the killer of Dr. Foster leads into blue collar Chicago and the inner cogs of the Daley machine. White Chicago is in flight and Dr. Foster wanted to buy a house."},{"Title":"Thin Walls: A Smokey Dalton Novel","review":"It's December 1968, eight months after the Democratic Convention and the riots that accompanied it, the setting of SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS. Smokey Dalton and his adopted son Jimmy are still hiding out after fleeing Memphis (and the FBI). Smokey is now working unofficially as a private detective, the same sort of job he had in Memphis and is only now beginning to feel comfortable in the new city.Smokey is hired by a woman to investigate the murder of her husband after she was dissatisfied with the job the police did. She felt that because he was a black man the police made poor assumptions and gave the case a low priority without bothering to look too hard. In fact they attributed the death as a gang murder, even though the man was a respected dentist. The case is the catalyst to an investigation that leads him to uncover crimes on an unimagined magnitude. But because the crimes have been perpetrated on blacks, the solution is not as simple as just identifying the murderer.Smokey has to juggle his time working on the case with getting Jimmy to and from school. A local gang, the Blackstone Rangers are attempting to recruit Jimmy, which would most likely lead to an inevitable life of crime. Smokey is determined to come up with a solution to put them off for good.A further responsibility is heaped on Smokey's shoulders when Laura Hathaway asks him to act as her security for some hostile business negotiations in which she is involved. It is this sub-plot that highlights a second form of prejudice, that of sexual discrimination.The story flows smoothly from crisis to crisis as Smokey handles each situation with his usual common sense and decency. Although he is challenged more regularly with the need to quell the impotent rage and frustration that he is filled with as he deals with bigotry and racism on a daily basis.There is so much more to the Smokey Dalton books than just a mystery to be solved, although the mystery in this case is very interesting, cleverly constructed and relevant. Each of the books are also surrounded by turmoil often with a simmering feeling of unrest, echoed by the increasingly vocal Civil Rights movement and the backlash that it caused.The mood of the book as seen through Smokey himself ranges from resignation to barely controlled fury. The portrayal of the racism that was prevalent at the time created some poignant moments and some tension-charged moments as the humiliation felt by Smokey emanated from the pages.Two examples of this kind of racism stayed with me long after I finished the book. The first took place in a supermarket in a white neighbourhood that Smokey was passing through. He had decided to pick up some groceries and was pleasantly surprised to find the prices were much cheaper and the fruit and vegetables were much fresher than those found in his own neighbourhood. When he came to the checkout, the cashier simply refused to serve him, closing her checkout. The manager then confronted Smokey in front of everyone in the shop and advised him to leave the groceries and go.Later that night while he was still seething, Smokey was to make the following observation about the incident.\\"I hadn't encountered that kind of overt racism since I'd come to Chicago. Usually in Chicago, people smiled at you and then denied your rental application......I'd once said to Franklin that I'd preferred overt racism. At least then you knew where you stood.I now regretted those words. Either kind of discrimination felt bad. Even now I felt nauseous, a sense of helplessness filling me.\\"The second example was much more shocking in it's brutality. A white man and his black girlfriend were bashed and raped by a couple of white men, outraged by the white man kissing \\"that monkey\\" in a park. The assault itself was shocking to start with, but then the assumptions made by the police when they arrived were even worse.I found the issues that were raised very sobering and found myself being outraged by the unfairness of the treatment, knowing that scenes like these happened every day in real life.This is another superb story that continues a terrific series set right in the middle of a time of great turmoil, occasionally touched by events that followed the Civil Rights Movement. In this book, Smokey crosses paths with the fledgling Black Panthers; serving as a reminder of the difficult times he was living in.Once again, Kris Nelscott has produced an outstanding thriller and set it in a difficult place and time in history. I found it compelling reading, both for the tense thriller and for the thought it promoted by raising such strong issues."},{"Title":"Thin Walls: A Smokey Dalton Novel","review":"When Alice Foster asks Smokey Dalton to find who killed her husband, Smokey knows that the police will be little help. In Chicago in 1968, racial lines are drawn tight, and no one in power is especially concerned over a few black deaths. But Smokey recognizes the pattern--it's one that has happened before. Somewhere, a serial killer is systematically murdering blacks. And Smokey intends to find out who--and put a stop to it.Through THIN WALLS, Smokey deals with racism, black gangs who offer 'protection' at a horrible price, and cops who either don't care, or who believe that they can lose everything they believe in if they buck the way things are done. A subplot with Smokey's white love interest adds a level of personal depth to the character--and provides continuity from earlier novels in the series.Author Kris Nelscott delivers a riveting historical mystery. Nelscott makes America's racism come alive, yet offers a hint of promise that it can be overcome. The conflict between African-American cop Johnson and white cop Sinkovich adds both depth and authenticity to the novel. Smokey himself, with his concern for his 'son' Jimmy, drives the plot forward.THIN WALLS grabbed me early and kept me turning the pages. Nelscott's writing is authentic and compelling, with just enough name-dropping of real characters to spice the story.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Pictorial Encyclopedia of Japanese Life and Events","review":"This book details the festivals and holidays by month and where to go to view and participate. As a gaijin (foreigner) to Japan it has allowed us to experience Japan as a local and enjoy the wonderful customs and culture"},{"Title":"Pictorial Encyclopedia of Japanese Life and Events","review":"This little book is filled with large, high quality color pictures of Japanese festivals and holidays, and supplemented by small descriptions (usually 1-3 paragraphs). This book is great for a quick overview of how many of the traditional Japanese festivals are being celebrated today in modern Japan. The descriptions are concise and only briefly discuss the origin or significance. Despite how small the descriptions are, they are great for getting a general idea of what goes on during the events. The biggest selling point of this book, however, are the hundreds of full color photos that augment these descriptions. Even if you bought a scholarly book about the same holidays and topics, you wouldn't actually see what is like. This book puts pictures everywhere to see how the festivals actually look.If you want a concise and easy to understand overview of Japanese holidays and events, look no further. The pictures and descriptions should be more than enough to satisfy your curiosity (or set the foundation for future research). You could probably flip through the entire book in an hour or two, but you really should just read it a bit at a time and take it all in."},{"Title":"Mcsweeney's Issues One Through Three","review":"This is an incredible buy to get the first three issues. They are now on issue 33. Even as reprints, you get to read and see them just as they were, warts and all. There are 1.7 lbs and 500 pages of paper. It's not all going to be great. Less than a penny a page. And McSweeney's has always been for readers, even if they are reading facsimile advertisements as one issue was.I have \\"The Better of the First Ten Issues\\" and now I get to read the dross. Hooray for McSweeney\\"s. Mistaking these as the first three actual issues is a moot issue. It never crossed my mind that these were reprints.I'm just going to start at page one with a bookmark and read until I get to page 500.

This book just feels wonderful in the hand."},{"Title":"Mcsweeney's Issues One Through Three","review":"It's McSweeneys and to some extent it's what I would expect: a mix of very good and interesting (and occasionally not) pieces of writing. I have heard that the earliest volumes were more uneven than the later. But my problem is not with the writing but that fact that these are reprints and nowhere in the advertisement for these did I see that mentioned (clearly or otherwise) so I bought two.I love my McSweeneys but I don't love how Amazon have advertised this particular set of mags. As soon as I have the time to work out how to get a refund I intend to pursue one."},{"Title":"Children of the Night: A Gallery of Characters for Vampire, the Masquerade","review":"This book contains detailed backgrounds and portraits of some of the most powerful cainites around. While some of the vampires such as caine and the regent along with the inner council aren't here (for obvious reasons) it is still very uselful for playing politics and when your players start killing everything they see just have a justicar roll on in and whoop his arse. If they can take the justicar then just spruce him up a bit so he can &quot;compete&quot;. The information in this book is not meant for players and they should probably not read it if you plan on incorporating any of these power forces into a chronicle."},{"Title":"Children of the Night: A Gallery of Characters for Vampire, the Masquerade","review":"This is a wonderful gallery of important storyteller run characters, with full stats and background histories that give a good feel for the characters' personality and outlook. There are exquisite portraits of each character by artist Christopher Shy (which earned this book another whole star from me.)The book still does maintain mystery about powerful figures like Caine (of course) or the Regent of the Sabbat (no more information about her or her predecessor either, apparently) but they have some really well detailed Sabbat cardinals as well as the current crop of Camarilla justicars and their archons. Some of these are characters who have been mentioned in past source books but never detailed. (The Gangrel Xaviar, for example, or Cardinal Strathcona.) There is also an independents section with examples of the Inconnu monitors for various cities. They assume that you can fiddle with these as needed and provide a basic formula for calculating the typical level of abilities for ancient vampires so that storytellers can make their own.My main nit to pick with this book is the fact that the selection of the characters listed seems arbitrary. Some are favorites culled existing source books and fleshed out or updated here. Others seem to have been made up just for this book, perhaps because there are future plans for them in or because they would seem to make interesting story hooks or because they are examples of a bloodline or character type. There seems to be a disproportionate number of Assamites- even a Methusalah whose stats are supposed to be mere suggestions of what it can do. (I guess they have plans....) Omissions are curious, too. Theo Bell is here, for example, (he's an archon) but Jan Pieterzoon is not. There are Setites but not Hesha. Or how about this- three of the four figures on the cover are Anatole, Lucita and Beckett. Their stats are NOT GIVEN in the book (? ) but those for Lucita's friend Fatima are given (she's an Assamite, right?) And these are just examples.So go figure. But don't worry. You'll find lots of uses for what's here."},{"Title":"Children of the Night: A Gallery of Characters for Vampire, the Masquerade","review":"This sourcebook is definately a useful tool for any Vampire Storyteller.

But sometimes it is good to have the help of a few pre-created characters too, especially lower gen ones. A very helpful section of this book gives guidelines for designing low-gen characters which I wished I'd had sooner. The book is divided into three sections: Sabbat, Camarilla, and Independent important/powerful figures. But it could really use an index so you can find clans or roles more easily. I'm intergrating into our game this summer in fact."},{"Title":"Children of the Night: A Gallery of Characters for Vampire, the Masquerade","review":"This is an excellent resource, but, as stated in the book itself, if your players characters are powerful veterans, these archtypes don't have a chance against a PC with a Shotgun and Level 7 Celerity, but if you're players are mature, which they should be if they've played long enough to achieve Level 7 Anything, its wonderful to roleplay politics within the World of Darkness and this book helps a lot with the key NPC's."},{"Title":"Children of the Night: A Gallery of Characters for Vampire, the Masquerade","review":"This is a WONDERFUL book for storytellers who need powerful NPC's or antagonists!

Surprised and extreemly pleased as the collection is one of the best published. It is difficult for non-residents to understand just how difficult it can be to get any information about Hawaiian quilts, as families frequently are reluctant to be specific to &quot;outsiders&quot;. This inhibition has relaxed over time, and the addition of the modern quilts, the inclusion of the biographies is especially wonderful, as some of these women are known to myself.The colours in the photography and the details included make this book a must have for anyone interested in this art form. It was in 1979 that my Mother-in-law took me to the American Art Museum in NY City, and we were thrilled at the exhibit. I had not since then seen such a collection of Hawaiian quilts displayed to such advantage. I only wish this was available in an hardbound edition, as mine is getting somewhat dogeard, much to my dismay, but also my delight, as my children are picking the one's they want."},{"Title":"Should Britain Leave the Eu?; an Economic Analysis of a Troubled Relationship.","review":"The authors rightly conclude that Britain should leave the EU, because the EU's costs to Britain are unacceptably high, particularly the CAP's costs on our food and farming. But unfortunately, the authors appear to oppose the EU on the grounds that it prevents the freedom of movement of capital, labour, services and goods.However, the \`Constitution for Europe' actually enshrines these four freedoms. It makes the basic principle of laissez-faire - free competition across national borders on the basis of free movement of capital, labour, services and goods - into a constitutional obligation (Articles I-3 and 4, Articles III-130, 166 and 167).Under the Constitution, the European Central Bank's sole brief is monetarist - to ensure price stability, not to rebuild industry, achieve economic growth or create full employment (Article III-185). Its Article III-147 allows the EU to enforce \`liberalisation' of public services like health, education and social services. Article II-88 provides that workers have rights only \`in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices'.The authors back the worst aspects of the EU - deregulation, the single market, cutting down the unions, the Bolkestein Services Directive. They support the Thatcherism of \`free trade, non-interventionism and competition'.They acknowledge that their preferred policies would destroy our manufacturing industry: \\"competition under free trade largely eliminates manufacture.\\" They praise government policy: \\"In our economy we have largely let market forces take effect, with generally favourable results for employment and growth (!); as a result we have let manufacturing go where it was essentially uneconomic.\\"The authors support the government approach of using cheap foreign labour to produce our manufactured goods and using cheap immigrant labour to provide our services. This is a new imperialism.They don't explain how we in Britain could assert and keep our sovereignty and independence if we no longer produced anything, if we depended on other countries for all our goods and food."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire","review":"An essential, well-produced and rich resource for anyone interested in his/her Jewish (Ashkenazi) roots. Well-documented with excellent chapters on different kind of surnames.Suitable for 19th century Jewish historians as well. A treasure."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire","review":"Russian born, with a PhD., living in France, writing in English, Beider is a bona fide genius -- an intellectual athlete on the scale of a William Dembski. If you think he is wasting his time with such a topic as the origin of Jewish surnames, read the introduction to this book. The project is fascinating and immensely complicated. In German speaking countries Christian civil authorities were generally responsible for the surnaming process in the late 18th century. In Pale of Settlement within the Russian Empire, Jewish authorities were responsible for the adoption of surnames. Some names came from German, Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew words, or occupations, or personality traits. Some names came from localities. Some could come from Jewish given names. Some were patrynomics. Some were of compound or highly ambiguous orgins. Most were fluid. The complexities are staggering, and it took someone with the care and analytic skills of Beider to start to sort this all out.To get a picture of the debates see Beider's recent review of Lars Menk and Heinrich and Eva Guggenheimer's books, in Avotaynu journal XXI: 2 (summer 2005), pp.35ff. Beider shows Menk to be a qualified success, and Guggenheimer to be a muddled trainwreck. I don't think most of us would be equipped to navigate through the issues involved without Beider.The book consists of two massive works -- 1. a huge introduction that charts out all the debates and argues for his approach. And 2. an enormous dictionary of zillions of surnames. This book, while staggering in detail, is not yet comprehensive. For example, only 2 of the 10 surnames I am most interested in from Elizavetgrad (Kirovograd) central Ukraine (Kherson oblast) were listed at all.In any case, it is indispensible for anyone with interest in 18th and 19th century Jewish Russia."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire","review":"However extensive is the list of Jewish surnames in this book, the interpretation of these names by the author should be always taken with a grain of salt.

I was dealing with some very disturbing emotions recently, and was beginning to feel overwhelmed, when my eyes became drawn to the shelf where I had laid this book aside for future readings. Acting on impulse, I took it and, as sometimes happens, opened it to a chapter that dealt exactly with my dilemna, and in words that were so simple, yet so inspired and so beautifully expressed. This may not be a very profound intellectual evaluation, but I had no intention of writing one.I'm not here to debate or criticize anyone else's views on Molinos or religion in general, but I found a true sense of inspiration just when I needed it most. Others may not find it so inspirational, and it may not satisfy all who read it, but I will always treasure this book and what it taught me."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Guide of Miguel Molinos","review":"Molinos's Spiritual Guide may be the first Western discussion of the technique known in Hindu teachings as \\"Raja Yoga.\\" For teaching that to know God, one must empty one's mind, quieting all other thoughts, and God will fill your mind and soul. This approached Gnosticism and thus caused Molinos to be branded a heretic.This edition of Molinos is the first print edition to appear in years. It's a reprint of a 1688 translation of the original Italian; thus the language seems rather King James-like, although by no means inaccessible.Gerald del Campo's introduction shows the high level of scholarship expected by this serious scholar of Scientific Illuminism. My only (slight) regret is that there is no modern translation of the work. Perhaps with the publication of this volume, other scholars will be inspired to do so.This is an indispensible addition to the library of any student of mysticism, esoterics, or gnosticism."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Guide of Miguel Molinos","review":"I am unsure how this book could be taken as substance other than a deeper Christian walk with Jesus Messiah.There is what's referred to as the beholding principle; meaning, you become what you behold. One can never, NEVER, improve oneself by looking inward. It is impossible. If you want to become more patient, you look at the One who is most patient. If you want to become more loving, you look upon the fountain of love Himself, Jesus.As Molinos puts it, \\"One of the healthiest things you can do in order to learn to walk in the inward way (and to lose yourself) is to look up on reason and \\"sound logic\\" as something that is created. The most reasonable conduct you can perform is to discard a great deal of your reasoning. Believe God.\\"And, further, \\"You will know that you are far from perfection if you do not find everything in God. Know that pure, perfect love consists of these elements: the Cross and denial of yourself. These elements are totally voluntary...There is a great difference between doing and of suffering and dying. Doing is delightful. It belongs to beginners in Christ. Suffering belongs to those who are seeking. Dying - dying to the self - belongs to those who are being completed in Christ.\\"Oh, if only I had more room to quote from this man. Only with the correct paradigm of the God-man Jesus who is Bridegroom, King, and Judge will this book make sense. Is it Gospel? No, but Molinos received and lived revelation about Jesus that speaks volumes even today.Without this worldview, you are left merely to look at oneself and that is a hapless place to be...Lastly, after 'searching inside this book', there appear to be updated versions available.

The overall story of the separated siblings and how they found their way back together was pretty interesting. Each book focused on a sister and although there were some flaws in the logic, I found the stories interesting.This final book kept me reading even though the villain was revealed a little too soon. My biggest quibble with this book is that when the siblings are finally reunited, we don't get a scene of that instant when they are all together at last. Instead, Steven King seems to have hijacked the chapter and we get a few pages of the point of view from the cemetery/twilight zone instead!

Easy reading and the plot kept you wanting to keep reading. Finished the book in two days. Can't wait til the next release"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"To be honest, I didn't even realize this book was related to the previous two, until I was about half way through. It is not written at the skill level that Ms. Dodd's earlier books were. I found the writing to be trite. Here's an example:'She opened the door and walked into his home. She looked up at him.He looked down at her.'This was a scene of 'high drama'. It kept getting worse! I had a hard time reading the book because my eyes kept rolling!In previous books, you would feel what the heroine was feeling, without word by word descriptions of what she is feeling!Don't waste your money.And this, from someone who loves all Christina Dodd's previous books!"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Marilyn and Skeeter Montgomery are elated to adopt the ten month old Caitlin. However, both have doubts about the man handling the deal, Pastor Wright and his adoption agency. Still Marilyn calls her new daughter Kate so as not to confuse the toddler and she is nurtured in love.Twenty-three years later Kate Montgomery reports on the air from Galveston on a hurricane when Evelyn, wife of State Senator George Oberlin, recognizes her as Lana Prescott dead for over two decades. Not long afterward the TV reporter gets a job at KTTV in Austin where she meets George, who is very nice to her. When someone tries to run her off the road, her station hires Teague Ramos to keep her safe. As they become acquainted with each other, they fall in love even while her biological siblings, Hope (see JUST THE WAY YOU ARE), Pepper (see ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE), and Gabriel continue to search for baby Caitlin and also try to uncover the identity of the person who murdered their biological parents twenty-three years ago.Christina Dodd closes her delightful Prescott trilogy with a terrific romantic suspense that answers all the questions from the previous two tales. The story line is action-packed and fast-paced as the culprit will not allow Caitlin or her siblings to learn the truth. The reuniting of the Prescott brood adds a touch of sentimentality that is handled deftly and allows the novel to include a touch of a homecoming with the return of Hope, Pepper, and Zack. However, it is the two plus decade old murder mystery with an eerie chance of reoccurring that makes this a strong intrigue.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Despite the Biblical injunction, \\"Vengence is mine,\\" I don't believe I have ever heard of a revenge story that includes God and the hearafter as part of the regenge motif.

Romantic with suspense expertly blended in. If I had to pick a favorite Dodd book, this might just be it."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I liked knowing who the real psychotic villian was before the time that the book characters discover this-Put a new and different twist to these types of books. I really liked the ending where it was not super-sappy, but realistic. Kate never turns away from her adoptive mother-nor should she. The siblings were, in essence, strangers to her. It was a good reunion. The \\"heat\\" was really good. The suspense good. Read this in less than 2 days - But, now, what about Gabriel?"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I as other readers eagerly awaited the finale in the Texas series. However, I truly must say I was disappointed. The whole storyline seemed a bit rushed. The author's mistake was in unveiling the villain so early in the book so by then you had a sense of how the book was going to end. Out of the three books in this series; the first two were the best. Hopefully you will enjoy it more than I could."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I was so blown away by this book. It's the best thing Christina Dodd has ever written! The two lead characters had incredible chemistry, and they were both so smart and compelling. Whenever they were together, I was mesmerized.

Won't make you think too much...."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Christina Dodd continues to surprise me. Her story is well written and progresses logically and then in the middle of the book, she starts a chapter introducing characters that you have no clue as to who they are. It doesn't take long and once you've met them, you have more people to become intrigued with but I still wonder why she does this. It is not the first time and yet I keep returning to her books because they are really good reads. I have to admit however that this is the third book, not all hers, that I have come across grammatical errors and lots of missing prepositions. I think this is interesting as I have read them all on my Kindle. Hmmmmm????"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed this book overall and felt it was better than the second book in the series, but I agree with some of the problems noted by other reviewers. The tension/pacing between the two main characters seemed to be a little off. Although there were a couple of great sizzle scenes, the dilemma that caused the hero to be reluctant to delve wholeheartedly into the relationship was weak. But the plot and action overcame the weaknesses in the book and I enjoyed it overall."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I got this book as soon as I saw it and read it as soon as I finished what I was reading, read it in one day. The first book in this series was my first book by Dodd but not the last. I now have a collection, which this book will be added to.I loved this book. It had the right amount of everything. Tension, suspense, love and laughter. Although the author gives away more to the readers and the readers figure out what is going on way before the characters. Thats the good tension.This was a wonderful third story and I only have one complaint. This story seems to be the end of the series. But I am hoping it is not as we still have the foster brother Gabriel, who really needs his own story. So, this just cant be the last, but the tone says it is. It wraps up most issues in the story, but I am keeping my fingers crossed.I likes most everything else and cant think of anything else to complain about. Wonderful story. 5 stars and highly recommended!! Enjoy"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"This was a really great book, though I was a little disappointed that the villain was revealed early on, and the romantic conflict was a bit weak. Kate's story is the third in a trilogy (?), tracking the fate of four children, orphaned by the death of their parents and scattered to the wind in the wake of their parent's alleged embezzlement.The story begins when Kate lands a new job reporting on Capitol politics in Austin for a local TV news station, but bodyguard Teague Ramos is soon enlisted when a stalker's attention turns violent. The heat between Kate and Teague is immediate and stays strong as the stalker's threat is replaced by a lascivious senator and his ties to the small town where Kate's birth family was divided.Teague was an impressive hero, big, brooding and sexy; he also came across as smart, and fell in love with the standard reluctance Dodd's hero's usually display. Kate was likeable, intelligent, and assertive enough to be admirable without being too aggressive. The villain was appropriately slimy, though he was not developed in any depth.But at times throughout the novel the hero's big brood seemed a little manufactured--he claimed to be hung up on an incident in his past (surprise), and worried revealing it would send Kate running. The incident itself was moderately inventive, but it just didn't seem bad enough to keep the two at odds; and Teague did very little to fuel the separation throughout the book (unlike in Pepper's story where Dan did asinine things throughout the book just to keep it interesting). So the conclusion to the romance was a little anti-climactic.Likewise, while I was glad to finally learn a little more about the mystery surrounding the death of Kate's birth parents, the little glimpses into the villain's mind peppered throughout the book undermined the suspense and the ending was not particularly surprising. Also, the book was written like the end of a trilogy, and I would be a little disappointed if we never get a chance to hear Gabriel's story.Overall, however, it was a very entertaining book with snappy dialogue and loveable characters; a satisfying end to a wonderful series."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Christina Dodd did a great job with CLOSE TO YOU - but then, I love books where the hero is a bodyguard for the heroine. It wasn't a mystery because we know who done it, but the suspense to see if the bad guy gets Kate is riveting and the ending tied up all the loose ends left in the oother two books. That scene in the graveyard is positively spooky - I got chills. Teague was a great hero, a bodyguard with a past. He's intense, handsome and driven, and the love scene during the storm was the hottest I've ever read. I recommend this series. Start with JUST THE WAY YOU ARE, then ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE, then CLOSE TO YOU."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"I thought this book was great! Ms. Dodd combines romance and suspense with a very deft touch, offering the reader the best of both worlds. Teague was a totally hot hero and I loved Kate. I thought her relationship with her adoptive mom was really touching, too. This brings an end to the Prescott siblings and I was thrilled to see them all get the happy endings they deserved. Can't wait for the next Christina Dodd book!"},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"STORY BRIEF:Caitlin's parents are killed in an auto accident when she was a baby. She is adopted by the Montgomerys who are told she was abandoned at the door of a church. Her siblings are sent to foster families. The Montgomerys name her Kate. 22 years later Kate is a TV news reporter. She knows she is adopted but doesn't know anything about her parents or siblings. Someone is stalking her and tries to hit Kate with a car. Teague has a private security company. He stays with Kate as a bodyguard due to the stalker. Although Senator Oberlin is married, he is intensely attracted to Kate.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I really liked the first half, but the second half seemed a little more ordinary to me. I didn't want to stop reading it. I enjoyed the development of the relationship between Kate and Teague, but I did not like the methods used to create conflict between them, described in spoilers below. It was still a good book, but it could have been better.DATA:Story length: 396 pages. Swearing language: moderate. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: 2. Total number of sex scene pages: 17. Setting: current day Austin, Texas. Copyright: 2005. Genre: romantic suspense.OTHER BOOKS:To date, I've read one other book by Christina Dodd. My 4 star review for \\"Danger in a Red Dress\\" copyright 2009 was posted 3/8/09.CAUTION SPOILERS:I was disappointed with the following.Pages 102 and 105: A man attacks, and Teague fights him. At the end of the fight, Kate sees a stark, soulless look in Teague's eyes. Kate and Teague had been drawn to each other previously, but after she saw the look in his eyes, she backs away, is wary and won't touch him. I didn't buy it. He just fought a bad guy. He shouldn't have a warm, fuzzy look in his eyes.Page 180: Kate and Teague are in lust with each other and are on their way to have sex for the first time. They are interrupted by something. During the interruption, Teague decides that they should not have a relationship because she will be happier without him, and he leaves her. Then he avoids her for 3 weeks. This combines two of my pet peeves: denying one's attraction for someone and inaccurate assumptions.Pages 315 and 318: Teague is worried about Kate's safety and asks her boss to assign her to safer assignments for a couple of days. Kate is mad at Teague when she hears this. She had agreed to call him every four hours for security reasons. But because she is mad at him, she doesn't call him, and she turns her cell phone off. She is driving to a dangerous place, the bad guy is on his way to that place, she doesn't tell people providing security where she is going, and she cuts off their ability to communicate with her. I hate it when the heroine does something stupid merely for the sake of the plot. Come on dear author, you can do better than this, just give it a little more thought. You did such a good job on the first half.When Kate's mother sees a famous person on TV, she realizes that he was the mystery person who gave her the baby to adopt. Why didn't she see his face earlier? She's lived in Texas for awhile, and he is a well publicized politician in her area."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Bookshelves were dry, and although I'd previously read a CD historical which I didn't take to, I thought I'd purchase this modern day book... and I'm glad I did.So enjoyed the family atmosphere, and was hoping that there would be a story on Gabriel where we could meet all the family again.Am not one to purchase previous books in a series, and I won't for this one, but it would have been nice to have an Epilogue in Kate's story (perhaps a year on), and this could have introduced Gabriel's story.A good read..."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"good book. very entertaining. have read a bunch of her books lately and have enjoyed them all. recommend this book."},{"Title":"Close to You (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 3)","review":"Great finish to the series.

The recipes are easy to follow and the results are great. I have only good things to say about this cookbook.My only be aware comment is that most Cajun cooking requires such yummy foods as shrimp, crab, tasso etc. While some of these are available at the local grocery store, some ingredients (tasso, andouille) are only available in the South or via special order.Wonderful cookbook.

If you'd like to taste real adventure and feel the cold crispness of life on the Alaskan trail, grab this one! Here, Miki relates the empassioned tales, sometimes hair-raising, sometimes hilarious, that she shares with her twin sister Julie as they embark on their wildest dream (or folly!!), yet : that of utilizing Icelandic Fjord Horses on their remote trapline at the base of Mt. Denali, AK. If you'd like to find out what it takes to convince a bush pilot to fly a horse that would like to join him in the cockpit of his small plane, or want to read true tales of a modern day trapline, ran by two women, huskies and Icelandic Fjord horses, this is the book for you. Humour, respect for the animals, images of human determination and the natural beauty of the alaskan wilderness are the gifts Miki Collins will leave you with. Whether you are a wilderness, adventure or horse lover or dream of the North as the last frontier, you'll love it. It would also make a great gift for teenage girls: the Collins are true models of women becoming all they can be."},{"Title":"Riding the Wild Side of Denali: Adventures with Horses and Huskies","review":"What can you say?? AS always the Collins sisters give a humble yet riveting approach to bush life in Alaska. Unlike so many of the yuppies that take a two week trip somewhere and hurry back to suburbia to write about how they challenged the extremes of nature the Collins sisters simply live it. There is no bravado - just a matter of fact - this is what has to be done so we did it approach - that's what makes their writing so interesting to the common folk like me - it's not about them its about whatever they are doing - and therein lies the big difference between the yuppie on vacation and someone who lives what they are writing about."},{"Title":"Riding the Wild Side of Denali: Adventures with Horses and Huskies","review":"I really enjoyed this book about the Collins sisters and their Icelandic horses in the wilds of Alaska.

There really isn't any way to really teach someone to be a successful investor without intensive training and mentoring so you can't expect much more than that. And while this book isn't any different, the author's obvious experience and valuable insight is tremendously informative on the \\"no money down\\" side of real estate.After reading Conti and Finkel's \\"Buying Real Estate without Cash or Credit\\" I can much more appreciate Wendy Patton's honest style. Rather than lying about fictitious success stories or trying to make the reader feel like a helpless idiot, she explains her path to success, provides lessons she's learned along the way, and lays out a plan that most anyone can follow.If you're looking for a book that has the complete package and will give you all of the necessary tools to become a successful RE investor, give up.

If you've seen those pirate signs on poles that says \\"We buy homes\\" and wondering what that's all about then read this book.Investment by most definitions is a long term commitment, these are short term risky strategies, Which usually is termed Speculation. Note that most of the people giving this book a five star are Real Estate Speculators.The basic strategy layed out in this book is to: Step 1. Find desparate, not so smart, home owners that are willing to give you money (huh?) for an option to buy their property at BELOW market price. Step 2. At the same time find desparate, not so smart, buyers that are willing to give you money to buy a property at ABOVE market price, huh??The Subject To strategy also skirts the gray line between legal and illegal, there are disclaimers throughout the book. Its like buying a book on \\"How to get rich,\\" and finding the statement \\"You can get rich by selling drugs, but selling drugs maybe illigal, consult an attorney\\"If anyone can make this work then good for them. If the sellers and buyers were smart enough they wouldn't need you, they'd find each other. But for those that aren't smart then good for them.

I was willing to give this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor writting style in the first few chapters and simplistic cost/profit worksheets. Overall lease option is well introduced but when it comes to list costs associated with acquiring a lease option property until selling it to a new owner there is no emphasis on major costs like transfer tax and title fees, etc. In other words if you do not do your own research and just thrust the worksheets in Wendy's book you might evaluate an investment as highly profitable while it is not much profit potential after associated transaction costs.

I literally have to turn down some homeowners begging to give their houses to me. I only wish this book had been available to me several years ago.\\"Investing in Real Estate With Lease Options and 'Subject-To' Deals\\" by Wendy Patton is one of the few books you'll find at booksellers like Amazon.com that covers \\"Subject To\\" techniques in any depth at all. She covers everything from how to find them to how to sell them - complete with checklists and valuable tips learned from hardwon experience.I've learned more from this one book than from going to some expensive ($2000+) weekend seminars. Although there are limits to how much one author can cover completely within the pages of just one book, Wendy holds nothing back in my estimation.Although the author includes many advanced strategies for experienced investors, she doesn't leave beginners wondering what in the world she's talking about either.If you're looing for a good, solid, informative, and well written book on creative real estate strategies, this is the first book I would recommend buying.And what's so fun about this business is that this book is only the tip of the iceberg!

I believe this is a great way to help someone build a real estate investment portfolio. Wendy's book also contains check lists (page 111) and phone scripts which are very helpful. The check list alone was worth the price of the book. As an investor, if you enjoy the book and find it helpful, then Wendy Patton's training course is fantastic. I attended the course, and noted very qucikly that it is Wendy that teaches the course not a substitute. Also whenever she spoke about a document of any kind, you were provided a sample which adds to clairity of understanding. Her course also provided hands on time in actual homes. As a licensed builder and real estate agent, also investor, it is my personal opinion that Wendy Patton's class/training was one of the top two classes that I have attended over the last several years."},{"Title":"Investing in Real Estate With Lease Options and \\"Subject-To\\" Deals: Powerful Strategies for Getting More When You Sell, and Paying Less When You Buy","review":"This book is a great one to get you acquainted with lease-options and subject-to's. Wendy takes you step by step through the process, and also gives you checklists to refer to as you put your deal together. She does however make some broad assumptions from time to time about when either type of contract is beneficial and why. For example, she mentions that owners with good credit are more likely to entertain a lease-option than a subject-to. This is not always the case. Sometimes owners with bad credit are looking for a \\"leg up\\", but don't want to surrender title. In that case, they actually might prefer a lease-option. Also in my experience, many owners with good credit prefer a subject-to because they want their name off the title, but don't want to deal with the tax hit of selling the property outright, right now. If they enter a subject-to, they can have their mortgage payments made by the investor, and give them time to have the property reclassified from \\"primary residence\\" to \\"investment property\\". They can then do 1031 exchanges tax free once the investor is ready to close (usually more than 1-2 years down the line.Overall though, this book is a must if you want to learn about the ins and outs of lease-options and subject-tos."},{"Title":"Investing in Real Estate With Lease Options and \\"Subject-To\\" Deals: Powerful Strategies for Getting More When You Sell, and Paying Less When You Buy","review":"Wendy's book provides the perfect blueprint for creating wealth by controlling property, not necessarily owning it.

Does that mean that robbery is OK as long as one gets away with it? There is only one reason to leave the original borrower on the note...and that is because it is one more way to make it unlikely for the lender to realize that the due on sale clause have been violated, because no filed document will find its way back to the lender. Aside for the fact that the original borrower is still legally responsible for a mortgage on a property that they no longer own, their total debt to income is also higher than it should be. And, if the were to disclose what they had done to a new lender for a different property, that lender wouldn't approve them for a loan...they might report them for fraud. You simply can't decide for yourself that you are assigning a mortgage. This goes beyond fraud, in my opinion: Because the original borrower and the buyer are joining together to defraud the original lender, it could be considered conspiracy. For all I know this practice may be a violation of the RICO statute. That will get you a place in a federal facility for a long time!

This is a great book about lease options and S-2. These strategies seem to be good choices for someone starting out or for seasoned investors. The book was well written and easy to understand. I thought it could have went into a bit more detail on some things, but it is a great primer. Any new investor is going to need contacts to get going, so reading a few books like this, join some groups locally and online, and you're on your way.Towards the end of the book she pushes her other products, such as the boot camp and cd's. I think is fine since there is no way all that material could fit into this book.

She also covers how to buy property \\"subject-to\\" the existing financing without using your own money or credit. She reveals how to work with realtors to find these deals and how to sell properties using lease options.The best part of her book is that it includes an action plan to help you get started. Wendy gives you a complete business plan to earn $120,000 in one year from real estate investing using the strategies in her book. She even tells you how to set up your office. Using her plan as a guide I was able to write my own business plan for the first quarter of 2009.

I am really disappointed that she refuses to allow you to download these scripts, contracts and forms she mentions in her book for free off her website. Her book is worthless until you are willing to shell out $700 for her course. I love the content of the book but if you are a broke unemployed salesman you will continue to stay broke because it always takes money to make money. There is no such thing as free anymore. No such thing as compassion for those trying to get a brake here."},{"Title":"Investing in Real Estate With Lease Options and \\"Subject-To\\" Deals: Powerful Strategies for Getting More When You Sell, and Paying Less When You Buy","review":"This book is very well written.

She really knows what she is talking about. In this book, she shows you how to make money in real estate with lease options and subject-tos by acquiring or controlling properties. Some of you might not know that you can actually make money in real estate without ever owning it. For example, the author says that money in real estate is made by controlling property, and owning is just the most obvious way to control it. But you can control it without owning it.

He illustrates this idea through many anecdotes about his career as a healer. His basic concept is that true prayer is a connection, rather than pleading, and is achieved through meditation. In his view meditation creates and nurtures the connection and intuition not only results from this connection but enhances it as well. The result is action, which again enhances the connection.The anecdotes outwiegh the actionable exercises but do illustrate the concepts. There are some very interesting prayer and action steps exercises toward the end. There is also a beautiful meditation to help the listener realize the feminine, nurturing aspect of God.This is 4 stars because I believe that his earlier program, &quot;Prayer and the 5 Stages of Healing&quot; by Hay House is more comprehensive and more actionable. However, this is a nice introduction to Ron's work as a spiritual leader and I recommend it.He's also quite good live, although I think he's cut his schedule back after the stroke."},{"Title":"Emily Dickinson (Berg Women's Series)","review":"The poems of Emily Dickinson, as well as the poet herself, have always been an enigma to me. The few poems that have become popularized have become almost trite (There is no frigate like a book...\\"). The poems seemed to be beyond my understanding. Ms. Dickenson's (no relation) slender book has changed that.The point of the book is to explore what we can of Emily Dickinson's nature though her poetry. She left little else to define her by and it is only by luck and through a sister's love that we have the poems at all. Ms. Dickenson takes the reader through the issues that have developed about Emily Dickinson's life: Was she truly a recluse, perhaps a bit insane? Did she suffer from unrequited love? Was she a holy roller with all her talk of death and God? The book finds answers to these questions through an examination of her poetry and what we know of the world around her, including her letters to others. The end result is a vision of a dynamic, dedicated poet, striving artfully at her craft, self sufficient and far from orthodoxy when it came to her religious beliefs.Ms. Dickenson's conclusions about Emily Dickinson are not universally shared by scholars and some have criticized her research. Nonetheless, the book is a great starting point for those trying to explore Emily Dickinson's poetry seriously. Now, rather than shrinking from the unusual punctuation, the lack of clear meaning, I have come to appreciate it as a kind of verbal jazz, a studied series of riffs on man, God and life. Try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Congratulations","review":"What a neat book. This is currently sitting in the bindery that I work at for a rebind. This is a book that was given, I assume, as local community wedding gifts. It has all kinds of useful tips for newly married couples from what to keep in the medicine cabinet, to basic recipes, how to properly set a table, cooking tips... the ads are neat to look at as well. The book is from the 1930's, so obviously everything is relative to that time."},{"Title":"Fortune's Fools (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Brothers Max and Tristram Darby are facing a huge dilemma: unless they marry heiresses, their father could wind up in debtor's prison. Both brothers journey to London in hopes of finding a rich bride.However, Max is also facing a smaller dilemma. He just lost his racehorse, Thunderlight, to an Irish horse breeder (who happens to be his next door neighbor!) Then he meets the neighbor's daughter, Kate O'Connor, who is penniless but carefree. As they spend more time together, his affections for her start to build. Unfortunately, there's the prospect of marrying a rich girl always dangling over his head.Tristram Darby, Max's brother, is also a central character of the book. He's the focus of a lukewarm secondary romance, which left me pretty disappointed. Even in Ms. Parks' previous novel (&quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot;), romantical Tristram was my favorite brother. In my opinion, he got slighted.In the end, the brothers' behavior started to niggle me. For the longest time, Max insists on marrying an heiress, despite his feelings for Kate. Tristram's willingness to &quot;step aside&quot; was unnerving (I can't say any more than that--I don't want to spoil it for you). The beginning of the novel was so unique and engaging, I was really hoping for something better. Especially for Tristram.I would recommend it, though, especially if you've read &quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot;, a book about the first Darby brother's search for a wife."},{"Title":"when jenny lost her scarf","review":"Of course the illustrations are adorable! But even better, Jenny shows by example what is to sacrifice something for the greater good of all. Even though she does the right thing, it does take a little thinking on her part.

Older readers will just fall in love with Jenny again, or for the first time. What a spunky little cat!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is the best book I've read in years.

I'm not often giving to posting online book reviews, but after reading Jo Ann Beard's Boys of Our Youth (thrice, I might add), I was so taken that I came in search of other books by her, only to find they do not yet exist. I hope she's tucked away somewhere busily creating her next!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"At such a young age, Jo Ann Beard has all but mastered the autobiographical short story. She exemplifies the extraordinary in the ordinary in this collection due out in hardcover in February. Women and men alike can appreciate Beard's blistering honesty. Tangents which remind of Jim Morrison's desert poetry highten the effect of her simple prose. The stories range from the everyday to the heartbreaking to the horrifically surreal and all stay in touch with reality with ease. Beard is truly a remarkable new writer, and certainly one to watch."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Here's the perfect collection of stories for every marginally &quot;good&quot; girl who grew up in the 60's and still doesn't dare tell her mother what was really going on. I read THE BOYS OF MY YOUTH twice in two days, suddenly nostalgic for people I hadn't thought about in years and uncharacteristically ready to confess it all.

It is a tender and very funny reminiscence of childhood in the 1950s and 60s and growing to adulthood. The style and the writing are beautiful, and the author is extraordinarily skillful in weaving in the darker threads of her experiences. Although the boys of the title are often the focus of the stories, it is the girls and the women who shine. I can't wait for Jo Ann Beard's next book"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I couldn't put it down.....I almost stroked out from laughing so hard at &quot;Dirty Barbies.&quot; Can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is the best book I've read in years. Jo Ann Beard writes as if she knows you, shes's in your head, I swear. Her essays on childhood are so painfully, AND hysterically real that I can not believe she did not live my life for me. This book absolutely cracked me up. No matter where I read this, I laughed out loud. People looked at me, and I just held up this wonderful book, and said &quot;Great book, gotta read it&quot; Her chapters are all very different, but her voice is so wonderful, and unique that you will not want this one to end. When is Jo Ann Beard going to write again? It's been too long already."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I feel as though I've made a new friend. I read Boys of My Youth several months ago and immediately made copies of my favorite stories for all of my friends. I am astonished by Ms. Beard's ability to focus in on the minutae of childhood, including those perplexing visits to Grandma's house. Her details may be unique to her but the themes she explores resonate. I'm currently writing autobiographical stories of my dysfunctional childhood and constantly refer back to Ms. Beard's stories for inspiration. I can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I don't typically rate books that I didn't like. Many times, like in this instance, the author has poured their heart and soul into the book, and who I am to negatively judge? However in this case, I feel obligated to do so because the majority of the reviews are so spectacular, and because of that I could not wait to read this book. I WANTED to like this book, I even tried to FORCE myself to enjoy it, but it was downright impossible. I felt like I was reading something that everyone else in the world understood but me. I closed the book and thought \\"what am I missing?\\". I'm glad I read it to the end, despite my brain begging me to move onto the next book, because it has a handful of very redeeming qualities. The second half of the book is infinitely better than the first half and her stories from adulthood are much more compelling and easy to relate to than those from her childhood. Because of that, I can say that there were some stories I was fond of and will keep the book on my bookshelf because of it. However, I just wanted to forewarn those who do as I do and buy dozens of books based solely on reviews and amazon trends because they don't have time to really look into what the book is all about. This is one of those instances that you should use the amazon preview reader and really get a feel for her writing style and subject matter before you make a decision."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I typed in Jo Ann Beard's name hoping to see her latest book. Alas, it doesn't seem that she's published another.I read this a few years ago and gave it to all my friends. It is a truly wonderful book that deserves a wider audience.Someone put it on a list as &quot;nonfiction for people who love fiction&quot;-that's a great way to describe it."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"The Boys of My Youth makes it crystal clear that an ordinary life may be at times overflowing with extraordinary drama. Through Beard's fine writing and descriptive skilly, she shows that the typical days of her life are loaded with drama, humor, and pathos. The book is a loose collection of vignettes spanning the author's 60's childhood and flows into her early adulthood. The title, however (as well as the jacket cover), is misleading. One might expect sexual initiation and experimentation to play a large role. The Boys of My Youth, however, is more about the LACK of boys in her youth - and the importance of having a good friend. Wonderful, wonderful book. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"A sparklingly beautiful collection of essays describing the defining moments in Beard's life. Her writing is brutally honest and magically poetical as she takes the reader along beside her to relive these events. They range from the traumas of an office shooting at the University of Iowa, her dog's slow death, her aunt's stealing her favorite doll, and her divorce, to the everyday scenes of youth and youth adulthood. Her talent lies in taking ordinary pieces from her life and making them extraordinary. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Most comments about this book are 5 star because this is a 5-star book, especially compared to most of the junk that's actually being published. If you're into &quot;chick lit,&quot; drop those books immediately because they pale to Jo Ann's writing, for once a writer here who has something to say. And a note to Jo Ann, your audience is indeed looking forward to seeing more of your work."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"_The Boys of My Youth_ is a two day read (or one day, if the reader has nothing else going on) because of the way it captivates. This book, a collection of autobiographical short stories, weave together and create a beautiful and poetic novel about a woman that I could fully relate to. The vignettes involve her childhood, including pieces about her mother and aunt, her cousin, and her siblings; her teenage years with her best friend and various crushes; and her somewhat depressing adult life with a philandering husband and a tragic work occurence. I feel that my writing a short encapsulated review cannot do Beard's book justice, so I will end here with the recommendation to buy this book and prepare to be astonished."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I stole this book from my teacher by accident. What a good idea. I can't wait to read more. Saying \\"He's the only man I have ever loved\\" suddenly seems so hilarious. You will laugh out loud and remember all those parties where your friends myseteriously disappeared into rooms. I wish she were phoning me while doodling little women in phonebooths. An honest new voice. One of these days I suppose I should return it."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"and that is high praise indeed. This autobiographical collection of essays was so compelling, I marked passages (in pen) and turned down pages - something I almost never do. Beard's memories of her childhood and teenage years made me wish she had been in my class, or lived on my block. When she enters the country roadhouse with her cousin, I could smell the beer and hear the band. I was chilled by &quot;Fourth State of Matter&quot; and incontinent (sort of) during &quot;Dirty Barbies.&quot; Somehow Barbie &amp; Ken will never be the same - wonder what my two grand daughters are thinking when they play with theirs! Have read this book 4 times and it is still fresh."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I give this book to all of my favorite people. It could not be lovelier."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"A beautiful collection of autobiographical essays recalling her childhood, teen years, and the complexity of family life that continues to haunt her as she puts herself back together after her divorce in her mid-thirites. I was continually fascinated with her ability to hold together two different periods of times, juxtaposing two or more stories at the same time to give one an opportunity to see from varying points of view. In 'Cousins'she captures the essence of her relationship with her coursin right along side the relationship of her mother and aunt, and writes eloquently of her mother's dying process that is filled with both humor and poignancy. Beard shows her artistic brilliance in her essay 'Coyote' as she uses metaphor to describe her own life experiences with the life of a coyote. 'Bulldozing the Baby' is Beard's earliest memory of feeling both loss and betrayal. Each essay is rich, bold and forthright as Beard portrays aspects of her life with incredible honesty mingled with much humor and heartfelt emotion. I walk away with a new appreciation for writing and understand that I am but a toddler still crawling on hands and knees as I contemplate the writer that is within me."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"When you're reading this book, you really feel as if you get to know the author. Her warmth just shines through. Being around the same age as Jo Ann, I particularly enjoyed the stories of her growing up (my Barbies and Kens misbehaved the same way!). Yet as fun to read as most of the stories were, they were all tinged with sadness. The standout piece was &quot;The Fourth State of Matter&quot; with the brilliant juxtaposition of the efforts Jo Ann made to make her dying dog comfortable and senseless loss of life at the university. The piece re her drive back from Florida was chilling and unforgettable (and her husband's reaction brilliantly described). At times, I found her metaphors a bit stretched but that would be my main criticism. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"The Boys of the title are wallpaper, background Muzak, peripheral here to the female-female relationships that are the core of this book. Beard's a story teller and in these pages she leisurely recalls her mother, always with a cigarette, cousin, sister and, memorably, best life friend. The writing is smart, direct, sometimes funny and often evocative. This fictionalized memoir includes three particularly strong essays --The Fourth State of Matter, Waiting and the title piece. Out There is a short, creepy scare. Coyotes doesn't go much of anywhere, but the weakest pieces -- Behind the Screen and Bulldozing the Baby -- are from her earliest childhood. Sorry, but even the most sharply observed and drawn writing can't bring much new to the universal material of kid temper tantrums and parental discipline. You may want to skim lightly through some of these pieces, but the book is worth your time. It will be interesting to see where Beard takes her considerable talent next."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This book is not your life or my life. This book is not anyone's life but the author's. But then again, I guess identifying is what makes reading so enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Growing up next door to joann I was flooded with a wealth of memories, Memories which I will cherish for my life. I remember good times and bad but the good times for me far outweigh the bad. I wish Jo the best of luck with all future endeavors."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"While parts of this book were certainly entertaining, it was very disjointed, and the author's efforts at descriptive writing went way overboard. The chapter called COYOTES was painful to read, in that is was 'all over the place' and had NO flow. I see this writer has potential, but she certainly has not reached that point yet. I would not recommend this book-- unless you would like to practice your editorial skills. If you can forgive the author's lack of skills, you might enjoy it. But, isn't reading supposed to be about escaping, not racking your brain to find a flow?"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"It was a bit of a let down. I was more interested with the family/friends then with the author as a character. She didn't come through very well on paper."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"What is selling this book is the essay Fourth State of Matter, which originally appeared in the New Yorker, and which is genuinely quite good. The rest are just sappy personal reflections on girlhood. Or at least they seem like that to me. We need to be ashamed as American readers if in fact this is literture we're claiming is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Has the &quot;we all have stories to tell&quot; phenomenon in America really got as frim a grip around the throat of literature? Say it ain't so. I'm looking over these reviews and it seems like they all refer primarily to the &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;touching&quot;, &quot;stories&quot; this writer tells about girlhood and growing up and feeling out of place. Does anyone one have anything to say about its artistic merits?I dind't think so. That's because it has none."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I usually don't give such low star ratings to books--in fact this is the lowest I've given--but I'm so in awe of the sentimentality in this book with its quirkiness posing as art that I simply need to express my shock that this would be considered great reading. This may sound harsh, but maybe for a bunch of lonely middle-aged women the quaint little anecdotes in this book would seem comforting--the way group therapy feel &quot;comforting&quot; perhaps--but I can't suggest this as true literature, however snobby that sounds."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"It is impossible for me to imagine how this book got published. It seems the only worthwhile essay in it is the essay that sold the book, the New Yorker's &quot;Fouth State of Matter.&quot; It's a shame that so good a writer (read that essay and you WILL fall in love) would allow herself to ride on the laurels of that one essay, and pass off the rest of the book as even worthy to be read (let alone be published). This isn't a horrible book, but it's a book that makes me hope Beard continues writing so that we might get a glimpse of her obviously hidden talents."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"...the rest of this collection is pure self serving sap, the worst example of the &quot;personal essay movement&quot; i've read. find the one good essay (4th state of matter) and photocopy it. save your money."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is a must-read for anyone who wants to write nonfiction essays. It is by no means a page-turner, but Beard does an amazing job painting a portrait of a moment in time. Instead of a typical memoir, she writes all of her essays in present tense and adds tiny, startling details that make the writing different than anything I've ever experienced. You don't have to read every essay to enjoy this book, but I would highly recommend \\"Coyotes,\\" \\"Cousins,\\" and \\"The Family Hour\\" for a great writing education; \\"The Fourth State of Matter\\" for anything and everything else. Reading Jo Ann Beard will make you a better writer."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I rarely do reviews of books, but Beard's \\"The Boys of My Youth\\" has forced me to make an exception; this is a wonderful collection of stories, all of which are beautifully written. She has a style that makes you feel like you're five feet away from the action, and her descriptions of things, even the most inconsequential things, are so well-crafted that it makes one wonder how such a thing like a simple drive can go unnoticed. This is one of the most absorbing books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, and hands-down one of the best written--Jo Ann Beard' s talent is immense, and I can only hope she has more stories to tell."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is what writing means. Gorgeous, pitch-perfect prose. Sensory details that speak for themselves."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"her stories are entertaining. She writes the narratives, weaving in and out, trapping the reader. wonderful."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Just finished this book and thought it was excellent. Really enjoyed the writing style which was new and refreshing. Made me belly laugh in several places and cry in others. Brought back so many memories from my own youth. Had to order it for my best friend and got another friend to order it as well. Will be keeping my own copy to give myself a laugh every now and then. Look forward to seeing more by Jo Ann Beard."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"A series of interrelated memories from a forty-something child of the '70s. Despite the book's title, Jo Ann Beard focuses more on her relationships with the women in her life (mother, sister, cousin, close friend, and, most of all, herself). The boys and men generally are in a haze of pot smoke or alcohol, and/or emotionally distant. Some of it comes across as self-absorbed and pretentious (really, a pre-birth memory?), but plenty is insightful and almost all of is interesting and well worth the reading time."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"No,I'm sorry. There's sap on this page, but it ain't in the book. The book is superb: the writing is utterly wonderful, and every single essay is mesmerizing. It's a sheer and absolute delight."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"&quot;The Boys Of My Youth&quot; was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Jo Ann Beard tells a tale of her life in short stories which are perfect to read in bed. I loved the stories of her childhood the best, especially with her sister Linda. Their mother is a sharp-tongued, beer drinking woman, their father a barroom lush. Her and Linda get into more than their share of trouble. This was a great book!!!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"A haunting, evocative, and funny collection. This book made me a better writer. I disagree with an earlier reviewer who commented that she &quot;stretches her metaphors.&quot; These essays are skillfully interrelated. Their quirkiness reflects the narrator's life: disjointed, alienated, betrayed. And the metaphors she uses to tie it all together with are succinctly appropo to her vision of the universe. This is a gorgeous book, a must-read."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Do yourself a favor and read it. You will cry, you will laugh. A very good and worthwhile book to buy."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Jo Ann Beard's book &quot;The Boys of My Youth&quot; is a thoughful collection of poignant vignette's about her evolution from childhood to adult. As you read, her stories subtlely weave their magic, leaving you wanting more. It's a book that, even in life's most busy moments, calls to you to be read.Jo Ann shares her most difficult and cathartic moments as a child, spouse, friend, and sister. She also finds a way to disclose some of her most personal stories with an objectivity lacking in most work of this kind.Jo Ann's book moves the reader from laughter, through her stories about childhood with her sister Linda and brother Brad, to tears when she losses her mother to cancer.&quot;The Boys of My Youth&quot; is one of the best autobiographies I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"JoAnn Beard has the ability to make you feel you are in the room with her, watching the stories un fold."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This book was hysterical. I cant wait for her next"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It is funny and sad and lyrical and true. I laughed my head off, had to keep stopping to read sections to whomever was closest at the time, and felt hugely melancholy when the book ended. Jo Ann, keep writing. And everyone else, start reading."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I was touched by this book from the first page. The story unfolds in pieces that I enjoyed connecting together. Beard makes me feel like I was one of her best friends that grew up with her and actually experienced all the funny-sad-embarrassing incidents in the stories she tells. She makes you feel like you know each other so well, that you would feel comfortable calling her up right now to talk about all those troublesome &quot;boys of our youth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Beard's book is a breath of fresh air in a stale memoir market. Her style is unique and her stories fantastically emotional. I went from laughing out loud at her childhood antics to crying out loud over her aged dog. She writes the way I think."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is a fabulous book. It took me a while to 'warm up' to the stories - but I ended up going back to a few to just savor the sense of 'place' that Beard puts into her stories. The &quot;Fourth State of Matter&quot; has been given a lot of attention in past reviews, and in my opinion, rightfully so. It is an extremely powerful story - one that will stay with you for sometime. Please, Jo Ann Beard, keep writing. Your voice is fresh and wonderful and mostly HONEST, boy do we need this type of writing now."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"The ability to describe exactly what you are feeling,is a true gift. Jo Ann Beards' descriptions of the simplest details, make this a wonderful book. I felt as if she had read some of my own thoughts, precisely, and put them on paper as I could never do."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"If that sounds like an odd way to describe a book of creative nonfiction, try reading some of what passes for excellent fiction nowdays. Most novels are too long, too rambling and full of improbable occurances. Beard's book is just like life, beautiful, horrible and without reason. It is one of the best books I've read in a long time and I mean to tell my friends about it."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"For those who love dogs, best friends, and times that somehow get shared - this is our book. Read it out of order though. Read &quot;The Fourth State of Matter&quot; first, then start at page one. I am taken time and time again by her ability to state things so simply and so perfectly. I thank her for writing these stories. Please buy the book."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This book is so moving, so painfully touching. I read it over a weekend and could hardly put it down. As I read it, I kept on thinking of friends that I wanted to lend it to afterwards, but the more I read, the more I thought, This book's not leaving my sight; I'll tell my friends they have to buy their OWN copies. Jo Ann Beard is so poetic; she doesn't so much tell stories as offer brilliant vignettes of critical times in her life. She talks to the reader like he or she's a second self; she makes herself extremely vulnerable in this book. Her memories of childhood are so acute and observed so perfectly through a child's eyes--like being at an open-casket funeral and only being able to see the nose and glasses of the deceased from where she sits. I nearly caused a scene on the bus reading the &quot;Dirty Barbies&quot; story, because I was laughing so loud. Being a male, I have never been given so much insight into what it's like to grow up female as I was given in this book. It's a brilliant collection of stories--evocative, faithful in the tiniest but most telling of details. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I had finished it. It's a wonder."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Like a flashback, Jo Ann Beard's collection of short stories takes you back in time. My favorite story is \\"Cousins\\" and is about two best-friend cousins. At an outdoor Eric Clapton concert the girls ingest a mild hallucinogen and discover pieces of their childhood in the quilt spread on the ground. One girl feels her halter top is coming off. When she looks at her cousin she is \\"cupping clouds.\\" Moments later her cousin says, \\"The clouds are cupping me now,\\" and she wants someone to \\"Get them off.\\" Beard writes, \\"A guy on the blanket next to us tries to hand me a joint. I can't take it because I'm holding my chest. He looks at me, looks at Wendell balled up on the ground, and nods knowingly. 'Bummer,' he proclaims.\\"With an exquisite eye for detail and lots of humor, Jo Ann Beard inspires memories of laughter and friendship and the heartache of youth that is never matched in later life. Upon completion of this book, you will find yourself thanking Jo Ann Beard for taking you back to that magical place in time. \\"The Boys of My Youth\\" is worth reading and re-reading and sharing with your best friends."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Not only do I agree with all of the other positive reviews as to Beard's uncanny ability to put us in her present, I have to say that Jo Ann Beard's use of language is some of the best I have ever read. As a writer, I am envious of her ability to be so clear, concise and poignant. I was amazed by this book on many levels. The underlined, highlighted, exclamation-pointed copy I will keep attests to that!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I bought Ms. Beard's The Boys of My Youth, her collection of fictionalized essays, and finished it in short order. It was a delight. Then I went back and read parts of it again. Then I tried another \\"quirky\\" writer a friend had recommended, but soon found myself rereading ALL of The Boys of My Youth. So there you have it. I love this writer. I think \\"Fourth State of Matter\\" is just about the most perfect piece of writing. Ever. So whenever you're ready, Jo Ann, we're out here, like one of your faithful dogs, waiting so hard."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"The essays in this book are amazing--they are funny, laugh out loud funny--and also make you cry in a deep and heartfelt way. Beard is so honest, that I really related to her, and her style of writing almost mimicks the thought process--it flits back and forth in time and we see and feel every thought. Cousins and the Fourth State of Matter are the best essays in this collection. Not every essay is right on, but enough are to make this worth the purchase. I definitely look forward to Beard's future publications."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"And I never re-read books. It's one of my favorites in AT LEAST the last decade. I picked it for my book group and it was voted the favorite of last year.At first I didn't even know this was non-fiction--it's so lyrically written.I just felt extremely connected to the narrator (JoAnn--I guess) and had so many similar experiences from MY youth.It's a great book to buy for your oldest girlfriend or closest sister."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is a terrific book! I read it right after it was published and have recently read it again enjoying it even more the second time. It appears very obvious that the previous glut of &quot;one star&quot; ratings are actually the work of one single individual posing as many. Notice that the reviews are basically the same and they are all from &quot;a reader in...&quot; (fill in the blank), usually from somewhere in New York. Too, they were all written within days and weeks of each other. Certainly, a person is entitled to his/her opinion but to pull a stunt like that shows a sick immaturity and apparent jealousy. It makes me both mad and sad to see this. I want to say, &quot;Grow up already, okay!?&quot;I thoroughly enjoy the writing of Jo Ann Beard and cannot wait for more from her. Keep up the great work!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Jo Ann Beard's collection of autobiographical essays, The Boys of My Youth, is a look at real life events, some seemingly minor and others monumental, that teaches the reader to look back and remember the things that have shaped your life. She writes in a way that, no matter what the situation-tragic, silly, or otherwise-one can relate to what she's talking about. Whether the reader has been through the same thing or not, Beard brings the reader into the moment and makes him or her understand Beard's feelings. Her writing is honest and witty. I found myself laughing outloud and calling friends to read to them a specific section of an essay and end up reading the whole thing and sometimes others. Beard's essays range from devasting experiences to light-hearted memories of her youth, young adulthood, and beyond. Her voice and description bring not only humor and honesty to her essays, but also a vivid image of each scene that she is talking about. Beard's style of sectional writing and tying different scenes together at the end is so effective that as a reader, I never wanted to put the book down. Jo Ann Beard's book shows that every experience, no matter how small or large, can have an immense impact on the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"If you graduated high school in the late 70s, early 80s and were a little on the wild side..... this book has some wonderful memories in store for you. It's when painters pants were big, long hair meant everything and riding in cars with girlfriends was so IT. JoAnn Beard tells it like it was better than any author I've read, even down to sneaking out of the house though we knew better.Put on an old Van Morrison CD, and relive some wonderful memories while reading great book!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Jo Ann Beard's Boys of My Youth is a wonderful journey through the author's turbulent and hilarious childhood- it slows down occasionally, but the presentation is so fresh and witty that it's easy to overlook the minor weaknesses. The true gem of the book is &quot;The Fourth State of Matter&quot;, a New Yorker essay about the murders of her colleagues in the Iowa Department of Physics in 1991. All in all, a great summer read, and an author to look out for."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I bought this book based on the high-profile, very positive blurbs. My expectations assumed another Catcher in the Rye or Portnoy's Complaint. Actually, I found it rather boring, with little tension and a sparkle, a chuckle, a satisfying insight only here and there."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This book is unbelievably good. I highly recommend it; half the time I'm reading it, I'm thinking about how I want to email the author and tell her how much I love it. I don't really have anything else to add that the other reviewers haven't already covered."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"I love this book! LOVE IT. This is the reason why I read.While I though Coyote was a bit slow, I need to go back and look for symbolism. Is it there? Who knows.The Fourth State of Matter - WOW. It's sad that today, I rarely get surprised in reading. This essay packed a punch. In addition, I can relate to the dog peeing on the blanket thing. Oh, I can relate.I highly recommend this book. I will read it again."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"\\"My mother is sewing a button on my father's shirt while he's still wearing it. 'I was having this terrible feeling,' she says, 'that she'd be this forty-year-old woman, going around telling people that we took her d-o-l-l away from her.' She leans down to bite off the thread. My father tests his new button and it works perfectly. 'In three days she won't remember she even knew that d-o-l-l,' he predicts.\\"But of course Beard remembers, and tells, in this 1998 non-linear collection of linked personal essays. They're coming-of-age essays, where growing up is as likely to occur at thirty as at thirteen or three. Each age is rendered perfectly, as are the characters and the 1970s-80s period details of small-town Midwest.Among the boys of Beard's youth are Hal, that beloved d-o-l-l her mother's oldest sister bullies her mother into throwing away; teenage boys who mostly ignore her at backwoods parties; her father who drinks and disappears for weeks at a time; Eric: boyfriend, husband...; and a school-shooter where Beard works in the University of Iowa physics department. There are girls, too -- aunts and cousins; her older, nemesis sister; her mother who smokes on every page; a lifelong best friend she consults while writing these essays.I love these people and their settings; I've read Beard's novel IN ZANESVILLE, and the first half feels exactly like these essays. I love her writing and look so forward to more."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"What a wonderful book. I definitely could relate to the time period and some of the annecdotes related by the author in her essays on life. It was like having a conversation with my best friend; the ups and downs of daily life with all the emotions involved. Some of the stories brought back memories of my own pre-teen and teenage years with my sister, memories I had forgotten."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Beard's intimate prose is unselfconscious and unabashedly focused on the moments in relationships which we rarely realize are the most important ones. The one exception is an essay in the middle of her novel which tells the story of a traumatic event in her adult life. Beard lapses into cliche not because she is incapable of better, but perhaps because all the words to describe such an event have been pre-ordained by the reporters and cops whose mouths form the syllables of murder. Even in the midst of cliche, and starkly plain language, she finds ways to remember details that evoke. A wonderful new book... everyone ought to read it."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"No matter what the others say- It was fantastic! One of the best books I have ever read. Maybe it was the nostalgia...I had several similar lifetime experiences and this book brought back wonderful memories for me."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is hands down, the best book I've read all year. The stories flow effortlessly into each other, mapping out a detailed account of the stories of Ms. Beard's youth. I stongly recomend this one."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"You feel like you are right there with the author. Honest, true, real stories. As another reviewer already stated, you feel like Beard is a long-time friend telling you her deepest emotions and sharing intimate details. I loved it and I can't wait to read more by this author!"},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"Beard was so precise and poetically subtle in describing her world and the imagination that runs along with it. The story about how she would visit her grandparents was an amazingly strong hit right on a mark of catharsis and childhood. I was at the bookstore and just sort of happened to see her book and pick it up. I read the first story and I bought it immediately. It was about a two page, short and so prose like. The style of writing was so lucid and reminiscent of the writers that I admire and have inspired me in my own work. I think she's funny and her sense of humor made me laugh. She has that brillant sense of herself as a deadly serious thought-dweller on life, and the cracks and bits of humor that make her powerful and relatable."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"no, i'm sorry. i can't imagine that readers are responding to the literary merits of this book rather than merely its oh woe is me whines. this is an amazingly poorly written book worth no more than these three sentences."},{"Title":"The Boys of My Youth","review":"This is simply not good writing."},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"We use this book several times a week, mainly for the recipes and great menus it contains.

Great ideas and very interesting information also included."},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"Once I started reading The Great American Heart Hoax, not only could I not put it down and I got angrier by the chapter. A little over a year ago I underwent a corporate cardio evaluation that included radiation scans. Heart Hoax helped me realize why these were needless and made me aware of my increased health risk from radiation; radiation accumulates and never leaves your body. I will think twice before having a virtual colonoscopy or other elective radiation procedure. I was also astounded that a $60 billion cardiovascular intervention industry has proof the majority of heart procedures is no better than bandages on a cut and worse, often leads to a lower quality and significantly more costly life for the patient. Dr. Ozner presents an easy to read and amazing explanation on what is known today about cardiovascular health, and the effects your lifestyle plays in preventing or encouraging heart and other cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis. He then explains how anyone can significantly lower their risk and even reverse encroaching atherosclerosis simply by modifying their diet, which is explained in his 10-Step approach to heart and cardio health. Everyone should read this book, no matter what their age and physical condition. This book will save lives, but could also make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans who take it to heart (literally) and follow his advice. Thank you Dr. Ozner!"},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"Our Dr. suggested that we go on this Medierranean Diet because he doesn't want us to have red meat more than twice a week.

Yes, I said 90% less. Statistics like this have led scientists to spend more than 20 years studying the Mediterranean diet, Dr. Ozner, a cardiologist based in Miami, summarizes the enormous benefits of this lifestyle in his book. He offers many patient tested (& patient suggested) recipes, all delicious. The basic foods in this diet are pasta, fresh vegetables, beans, whole grains, cold-water fish, nuts, olives, tomatoes, olive oil and red wine. Simple, but rarely followed in America. The Mediterranean diet is rich in benefits, inexpensive and there's an added benefit: weight loss. The book is a winner, easy to read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"Written by an experienced Miami cardiologist, the Miami Mediterranean Diet is an excellent introduction to the lifestyle and recipes of the Mediterranean diet, as filtered through an American lens, which, nevertheless, retains all of the heart-healthy benefits of the original Mediterranean diet.Far from being just another fad diet, The Mediteranean diet is the only diet clinically proven, for more than four decades now, to reduce the incidence of heart disease, cancer and stroke, and possibly neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Michael Ozner makes the case for moving away from the pro-inflammatory American diet towards the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet in order to prevent atherosclerosis, heart disease and other inflammation-related ailments that are all-too common in the West.The Miami Mediterranean diet features plenty of low-fat, high-fiber, olive-oil-rich, flavor-packed recipes made with fresh fruits and vegetables, fatty fish, lean dairy, nuts, legumes and whole grains. It will help you lose weight and change your lifestyle for the better, for once and for all. This is a diet that anyone can benefit from, whether you are seeking to lose weight, prevent diabetes, reduce allergy or arthritis symptoms, reverse heart disease, or avoid IBS symptoms. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"This is a great book for a person with any type of heart problems or who wants to lower their risk of heart problems.

Some will really enjoy the great detail in which the book handles this; others will probably skip ahead to the recipes. The book itself is rather dry: no pictures or other graphic details to break up page-after-page of text. I generally loathe such books, but I'll make an exception here because of all the great information that is otherwise included. Nonetheless, a few pictures of finished dishes would have been a real bonus. The book includes over 300 recipes, plenty to keep you from getting bored of repeats as is often the case with other diets."},{"Title":"The Miami Mediterranean Diet: Lose Weight and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease","review":"I bought this book after watching a TV programme which looked at various diets around the world and concluded that the Mediterranean diet was the most healthy. Having a look around I found this book which focused on the healthier Mediterranean foods rather than just any of them so I didn't have to try and figure out which dishes would be best for me to eat.Dr Ozner is (rather obviously) based in Florida, he is a cardiac surgeon who specialises in preventative treatments. he stresses that there are times when medication, stents and bypass surgery are unavoidable but also stresses that if we were to follow a healthier lifestyle then blood pressure and cholesterol could be reduced meaning many people would not need to be on medication for life or to undergo invasive surgeries as a preventative measure.The opening chapters look at the differences between Mediterranean and Western diet and lifestyle, it also goes into detail of a number of studies that have been done into how healthy the Mediterranean diet is - a middle aged Mediterranean man is 90% less likely to have a heart attack than his Western equivalent!!The majority of this book is taken up with recipes and you quickly become aware that there is a great variety of food that you can eat. The recipe section starts with a 14 day meal plan, reading this I sometimes wondered whether it would be possible for me to eat so much! Unlike many conventional diets this does not prohibit you from drinking tea, coffee of (best of all) red wine, it also doesn't cut out any food groups.The recipe sections are:Salads, soups, pizza's, omelettes, pancakes, main dishes, side dishes, wraps and sandwiches, breads, desserts, smoothies, appetisers dips and snacks and sauces marinades and dressings.(The bread section is split into 2 parts for those with/without a bread maker.)Each recipe also states the calories and fat content.The main things that I noticed with this diet is that there is a LOT of garlic, it is eaten at every dinner within the 14 day meal plan and included within a lot of recipes. Also, the main source of protein is fish although there are recipes which include most other meats.I did have 2 problems with this book but neither are enough to deflect from it's 5 star status1 - I had to look up a number of the foods as I'd never heard of them, I'd assumed with it being a MIAMI Mediterranean diet that it wouldn't have more obscure ingredients in and maybe they're not obscure in Miami but I'd never heard of Orzo and can't remember having seen it in my local supermarket - I'll be keeping an eye out for it in future though as the recipes it's in sound lovely! There are a number of ingredients where I had this problem, there was also the fact that a number of things have different names in the UK to what they do in the USA although most of these I could figure out or Google.2 - There are no pictures, it's a small thing but I like to be able to see an example of the dishes that I'm trying to cook.I've only been following this diet for a week but already my partner has commented on my flatter stomach, I'll just have to wait for my next doctors appointment to see if my Blood Pressure has also decreased."},{"Title":"Graffiti from the Narrow Road","review":"This is a great book!

For it's purpose, it's not a bad text. Every page has about 5-10 SAT words interspersed throughout the text with the definitions on the bottom of the page. The writing does come off a bit mechanical and the dialogue is especially unnatural when using SAT words I feel that for the purpose of teaching vocabulary words in context, this is forgivable. It's to be read not as the next great American novel to torn apart for literary criticism but as a fun tool for SAT practice.In general, the writing is very easy to get through and the story in engaging enough.

The only reason i gave it 2 starts instead of one is because the vocab was woven in pretty well most the time. The book is about a teenage girl forced to go to Nigeria over the summer with her mother and ends up working in a labratory in Puerto Marino. Her mother is working with the dolphins while alexa is stuck in the lab. Alexa meets a boy about her age and they hit it off. They find out that some of the dolphins were illegally taken into the marina and try to rescue them.I really didn't like how the mexican boy, Jose, knew all these huge sat words when he was supposed to be not know english too well. It was very unrealistic and cheesy. I also got annoyed very quicky since every page has at least 5 exclamation points. It drove me insane. More importantly, Jose, Alexa's friend is not a likable character. I found him weird and overly excited about everything. If you the reader doesn't fall in love with the boy as well, then it's a lost cause. I spent most the book thinking \\"why would you want to hang out with this guy? what do you see in him?\\" Alexa wasn't a very fun character either.Overall, i consider this book \\"an annoying read.\\" I wanted to finish the book so I could be done with it already- the only reason i kept reading it was for the vocab.If you're looking for an sat book that is at least somewhat entertaining i suggest (in this order)1) Busted2) Sun-Kissed3) Head Ove HealsAll these three books are much better storyline wise and vocab wise. The definitions are only about 1-2 words where as in Marino Mission they were almost all sentences and it became very distractive and harder to remember the words."},{"Title":"The Marino Mission: One Girl, One Mission, One Thousand Words; 1,000 Need-to-Know *SAT Vocabulary Words (WordSavvy Book)","review":"We purchased this book on the strong recommendation of a relative, and can likewise recommend it to others, without a bone of contention...I skim-read the story, and while the artifice used to introduce the vocabulary is a bit much for an adult, it should work well for the target audience. As the heroine is, well, - a heroine, the book might initially appeal more to young women, rather than to boys. But, any young person would probably enjoy the plot and the storyline once immersed in the book. At the risk of dating myself, I'd equate the book to Nancy Drew meets Tom Swift, updated for the 21st century... All in all, an effective and elegant solution for providing young people with a rich vocabulary while preparing them for one of the most significant examinations they must undertake.Significantly, one-third of the book is devoted to exercises which reinforce the meaning and proper use of the myriad words introduced in the story. As repetition is the root of understanding, students would be wise to make use of this added bonus. Teachers and educators should likewise give this book strong consideration for inclusion in their curriculum and SAT-prep courses.With the advent of a re-tooled SAT containing a much-dreaded essay component, Ms. Chapman should put her considerable creativity to work on a new book which addresses this coming challenge. I have no doubt that any such attempt would be as engaging and successful as \\"The Marino Mission.\\"...On a personal note, at last I can use the word \\"perspicacity\\" correctly..."},{"Title":"The Marino Mission: One Girl, One Mission, One Thousand Words; 1,000 Need-to-Know *SAT Vocabulary Words (WordSavvy Book)","review":"Karen B. Chapman, The Marino Mission (Wiley, 2005)An excellent idea for a book-- write a short novel aimed at teens that contains one thousand SAT vocabulary words. Pick a subject that will probably resound with the teen population and run with it. Granted, your language is going to be a bit highbrow, but that's the whole purpose of the thing, right?Chapman comes pretty close to getting it right. The target audience will not be the wiser when she stumbles a bit trying to fit one of the words in (using \\"prototype,\\" for example, to describe the last instance of something, rather than the first, or an early, instance), and the plot gets a bit clunky at times. Still, for what it is, the books succeeds pretty well. Also comes with a good number of vocabulary exercises and the like for students to get the new words they're exposed to here cemented in their heads. ***"},{"Title":"The Marino Mission: One Girl, One Mission, One Thousand Words; 1,000 Need-to-Know *SAT Vocabulary Words (WordSavvy Book)","review":"This book is very, very good.

It was not boring for any of the students, and we learned plenty of words. The class took a test in the beginning to see how many vocab words we knew. It was a list of 300 SAT level words total.

Yet, Jose lives in a very poor spanish speaking country and has an extensive engish vocabulary. I did like that this book did include hispanic characters because most books do not.

Apparently our \\"hero\\" Sate Mcgruder is such a man.He finds the heroine Juliana in a blizzard and takes her back to his cabin to save her life.he gets in bed with her in order to warm her up so that she doesn't get frostbite.He finds her extremely desireable but tries to control his baser urges but ultimately takes advantage when she mistakes him for her husband.The squaw who had been using sexually is in his cabin and seeing all this but he doesn't care.I was disgusted with this aspect of Sate.I thought he could have restrained himself.Having said this I had great hopes for their relationship as Sate had tender feelings for Juliana he wasn't only interested in sex from her and she also liked him.However fate intervenes in the form of Juliana sister in law.Juliana had left to find her brother,Sate later goes to see her and meets her sister in law who tells him lies about Juliana which he believes,as a result when he meets Juliana he treats her badly and she allows another man to court her and then marries him.Sate then realizes what a fool he has been but he believes it is too late and doesn't tell Juliana of his feelings before she marries his friend,if he had told her I don't think she would have married another man. Also I found it hard to believe that Juliana would be so attracted to another man(Roth Adams)while she's so in love with Sate.Maybe we are supposed to think she would be because she was starved for affection and intimacy when she was with her first husband.Anyway Sate decides to leave when Juliana decides to marry Roth.She moves to Roth's isolated cabin where they are together until fate intervenes,unknowingly she is carrying sate's child who she believes is her dead husband's.Sate returns soon after she has her child,she immediately has sex with him although she later refused her husband as she hadn't recovered from the birth as yet.I found this disgusting on both their parts.She should have been angry at his previous treatment of her and he could only think of getting her in bed although she is married to his friend.I found both their behaviours reprehensible because neither one of them felt any guilt about what they had done. Her husband dies soon after this and she discovers that she is pregnant again for Sate.He believes that she and his son have also dies and goes away to mourn.He later learns that she is alive and returns to find her and they make up.I found certain aspects of the hero's character helped to redeem him in my eyes.He constantly thought of Juliana when she was lost to him both times he tried to stay faithful to her refusing to sleep with Doxy when she was married to Roth and when he believes she was dead he didn't sleep with the whores at the post.He eventually slept when a squaw but didn't do this often as the memory of Juliana made him feel guilty.Juliana also admitted she wasn't in love with Roth and she thought of Sate a lot.This could have been a great love story if only the author had not put so many obstacles in the way of the hero and the heroine.Kentucky Bride is a much better read although this is a good story.I personally prefer that the hero and heroine have sex only with each for me to be believe that it is a true romance-I agree with the previous reviewer about this and about his callous treatment of Doxy and Bessie the other women he used sexually when the mood struck.I also don't like the author's treatment of Indians in some of her books.Quite a few of them have a rejected Indian maiden who constantly makes trouble for the hero and heroine(Blaze,Kentucky Bride).I also didn't like the fact that he so easiily believed her sister in law's lies about her."},{"Title":"Forever the Flame","review":"This is one of the WORST romance novels I have ever read. And I've read hundreds!Although the blurb sounds great, the novel kicks off with a scene that portrays the hero as anything but! At times I liked the hero and heroine, but those times were few and far between.Every mistake that could be made in a romance novel was made in this one. It was about nothing but sex - the hero having sex with anything in a skirt and sharing her around with anyone who wanted a go. Even the heroine gave up on the hero, married someone else, and enjoyed having sex with the new husband she'd known only a few days!Sex is vital to a good romance story, however, in my opinion it is a sacred bond that the hero and heroine share ONLY with each other.I had no respect for either the hero or the heroine.

Its also not for casual readers because Lombardi writes about his takes on NFL plays and concepts. This is all about Lombardi doing what he often does better then any NFL coaches before and after him, he teaches and educated. This is an educational book on football. There are many football \\"jargon\\" here and he write a great deal about tactics, responsibilities and so forth about each type of play he's writing about. In a nutshell, its a very technical book on football. The book come with tons of photos, both in black and white and in color. The book also come with hundreds of diagrams of football plays where Lombardi explaining how it work and why. Lombardi covered both sides of the ball in this book that appears to be complied by various notes and other elements left behind by Lombardi.Many of the modern fans will find this book somewhat dated in some ways since NFL have evolved so much since Vince Lombardi days. But the book clearly explained how many of the certain fundamentals of NFL never change and what applied back then, clearly applied to this day. I believed this is one of the great assets of this book is how Lombardi's influence continued to this day.The book is for NFL devotee who wants to learn more. It definitely not for someone who can't tell the difference between a \\"strong side\\" from the \\"weak side\\" of the line. But then, maybe such a fan can learn after reading this book.

Sandy's mother was manic-depressive, and it seems that the saving grace for him was her periods of mania during which she showered him with love. During depressive periods, and because of her brother's suicide at the time of Sandy's birth, the mother believed that children are independant creatures who do not need the love and nurturing of their mother. She, therefore, left him alone to play for many periods of time, taught him to not explore on his own with food and toys and gave him limited cuddling and loving. He was very lucky that he had the love of his &quot;grandparents&quot; and their perserverence to do right by him. They were influenced by the times in that they felt a nanny was necessary, but Sandy fared well in spite of that. Attachment disorder research was in it's infancy then (50's) but maybe because it happened so rarely? After all, everyone *knew* that babies need loving and holding, and there were no &quot;experts&quot; telling them that babies need to &quot;learn to be independent&quot;. Try to ignore the racist and uninformed comments about Down's Syndrome and remember that the author was a product of her times. I suspect she would be a very different person were she writing today.

It is alive and well as told by Franco Antonetti in his memoir, \\"I Wouldn't Die\\".

While reading about his memories, one feels like he's in your home sitting in a lounge chair with his feet up, in a warm comfortable conversation.This child grew up, went through grammar and high school in a same small town in New Jersey. Beginning his career and family was an important facet of his dream to assimilate into being a true \\"American-Italian\\". Franco didn't allow any adversity, tragedy or other near-death experiences to dampen his spirit. Being an optimist, he saw the positive where most could not. Even though Franco Antonetti had impoverished beginnings, he was able to focus and follow through on his career plan, determine how he would best fit into the big picture, while attaining success in the corporate world.All those who are fortunate enough to know Mr. Antonetti, or read his book, \\"I Wouldn't Die\\", can feel his love of life, family and friends.

This is a story of a man who has been blessed with an extraordinary life and it is told with such honesty and passion that you can't help but feel as though you have been with him every step of the way. The tale is told in short, straight forward passages, giving you the opportunity to experience the joys and hardships of his life without the dripping sugary sentiments, pretentious literary subtlties and hidden meanings found in so many memoirs today.

I savored every moment of this wonderful story and, at its end, closed the book with a smile. As I said, there is no hidden message, Franco makes it clear that an individual can achieve many goals in life when life is faced with strength and determination, by not falling victim to circumstances but instead rising above them, and never being afraid to just be who you are.

It reads as if the author is sitting across the dining room table sharing stories over a cup of coffee. Yes, it is inspirational and uplifting, but it is sad at times too. Franco does a wonderful job sharing his journey thus far, his ideas and foundation of life - hard work and dedication. He makes choices in life and goes forward.

Born in poverty stricken Italy, young lad Franco immigrates to America, learns English, becomes a citizen, marries, and with no college education works nonstop to provide a good living for his family. At times I laughed out loud as I read the stories. Other times I wiped away tears wanting to reach out and give this big man a hug. If more people were like Franco Antonetti, unemployment numbers would be much lower in the USA. I don't recall the words 'government' or 'welfare' appearing in the book although I'm sure Franco would have qualified for assistance during his life. I especially connected with the stories of New Jersey, Stone Mountain Georgia, and Franco's son serving with the Marines in the Gulf War. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll meet Franco someday and go for a motorcycle ride."},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Die: A Memoir","review":"Growing up in the 50's and 60's as a first generation American on my mom's side and a second generation American on my dad's side I never thought that our lives were any different than any other American. But after reading Franco Antonetti's book 'I Wouldn't Die' I realized how unique the Italian-Americans of the mid-20th century truly were yet how much alike they were to one another. Franco's story could be the story of any one of us with an Italian Ancestry. With all the problems, there was still much love. With all the poverty, there was still the ambition to succeed.I am grateful to have had the chance to read this wonderful book. As I delved into Franco's life, it brought back so many memories of my own life as one of Italian Ancestry. And it made me much more appreciative of those who came before me and struggled to survive odds unfathomable to most of us.However, even those without Italian in their bloodline should read this little book because it inspires all who read it, that your future lays before you and you make of it what you are willing to put into it.

In a war torn country of Rome, Italy through the gates of Ellis Island and into America.

I got my turn to read it after him and I could not hardly put it down. What a life this man has had. Some good some bad but he came through it well ontop.

Being a Berkeley Heights, New Jersey resident from the early 60s until now I was at first interested in his experiences here. That is what drew me originally to the book, besides the title. I found his references to places and people that I was familiar with bringing back people and places I remember from when I first moved here. As the book went on I was taken by the adventures he had, the way he lived his life and how God seemed to be working in his life for the good of others. Even after he moved from Berkeley Heights I kept reading, wanting to see what else would happen and how he would handle things. I found the book to be engrossing and uplifting and would recommend it to others. I have shared it with my family and they also read it straight through.

It is wonderful to see someone NOT IN THE LIMELIGHT have such an interesting LIFE."},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Die: A Memoir","review":"This book provides a wonderful documentation of one man's journey to the American Dream. Born into difficult circumstances in Italy, the author learned at an early age to work hard and expect little from others. This hardscrabble early life prepared him for success when he arrived in the U.S. via Ellis Island. He learned English, excelled in school sports and worked multiple jobs to support his family while a teenager. Upon graduation, he took this strong work ethic into the business world and was rewarded. This is not to say he became fabulously wealthy, for his success is measured by much more than monetary rewards. He has experienced life as few others have and has forged friendships and memories that we should all aspire to attain more than wealth. The basic writing style gives it a simple, rustic quality that makes it all the more authentic.Reviewed by Ron Lowery"},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Die: A Memoir","review":"I wish everyone with such an interesting life story would publish a book.

It was well worth the purchase.The author tells the story much in the style of my own Italian grandpa. I felt like I was there beside Little Franco as he grew up and beyond. I loved when he talked about how he felt, when he walked past the statue of Mary as he carried the box of money. (A little guilt can be a good thing.)What a wonderful story of making it in America. As a second generation Italian American, I loved hearing similar stories from my parents and grandparents reggarding the family's struggles and accomplishments. God gave this author a special determination he used throughout his life. The book is an inspiration to all who read it...My son-in-law is enjoying the copy I gave him as a Christmas present."},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Die: A Memoir","review":"Just the title of the book will arouse your interest but when you read the first few pages it captures your attention and from then on it holds it throughout the entire book. It's almost impossible to put it down. The author himself gives you his life from the cradle and tells of his miraculous survivals and his coming to the great country of America as a young boy, growing up, working, starting a family and becoming success. When you read it, you will be inspired at the hard work and commitment and desire he had to achieve. The book will put you through a whole range of emotions that you'll experience by reading it, some making you laugh to tears. This book is highly recommended as it will give you inspiration and make you examine your own life as it has mine. It makes you re-live the greatness that America has given people who came over to live a better life and to cheer the author as he works to make his dreams come true and overcome all obstacles that would try to stop him. It will re-inspire the American dream and make you realize with the right attitude, hard-work, dedication and the willingness to succeed you can accomplish what you set out to do.

It was very well written and what I liked the most was that it was written by him and not edited to be what some publishers may have wanted. It was raw, but it was real and that made the book for me.

At times, it is hard to tell the players without a scorecard as Franco led a life full of interesting twists and turns including those of his family and children.... His stories of work ethics, hard work and recognizing an opportunity that most would miss, should be an inspiration to folks of any age, even in today's tough times. Every struggling businessman or employee should note the lessons to be learned by putting forth the dedication and effort to see it through and the \\"all in\\" mentality required...

The story begins in Rome, Italy in 1944 and moves very quickly to his travels to America at age 10. In spite of the many hardships in his young life, he forged ahead with faith and determination to make the most of what America had to offer him.

Franco & I \\"worked\\" at the shoe store, together with Fred, Jr and other friends. It wasn't work; although we got paid for breaking sales records at the store, as \\"part time\\" employees. We had more fun selling, which made it more recreation then \\"work.\\" Maybe that's why we sold so much. The customers enjoyed shopping there, and came back time & time again. We never knew Franco's backround, as we know it now after reading the book. I wouldn't call his backround outside of our relationship sad, I would call it serious; since, it helped make him the man he is today! He was always sincere, loyal & enjoyed people.I have purchased several copies of his book to give as Christmas gifts to my daughters and grand daughter.

This ratio, unsurprisingly enough, is very nearly the same ratio of liberal to conservative professors in America's colleges and universities. Clearly, then, politics and criticism intersect at critical points. In DOES DECONSTRUCTION MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE? Michael Fischer makes this salient point to emphasize that criticism of texts does not operate in some amorphous intellectual vacuum. Rather, the process of subverting, teasing, and undermining texts is one that had been lifted wholesale from leftist European thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man. For this observation, I am indebted to Fischer. However, Fischer does far more than place deconstruction in its historical/literary context, one, I might add, that he accomplishes with a deft hand. He accurately takes to task the misconception that Matthew Arnold was the touchstone against which past and present deconstructionists sought to demonize as the uncrowned king of a logocentric metaphysics of presence. Arnold, surprisingly enough, as Fischer trenchantly notes, merely thought he saw himself as the avatar of western culture under assault by atavistic Philistines and Populace. Fischer also considers the role that Northrop Frye played as a New Critic, another grounded archetypal empiricist who was yet another target for Derrida and those of his ilk who soon followed. Where Fischer goes seriously astray is his ambivalent attitude toward deconstruction. On one hand he criticizes its practitioners by noting that its titular proponent, Jacques Derrida, is more than a little self-contradictory and illogical when Fischer accuses Derrida's frequent lapses as deliberate forays into irony and ludic grammatical faux pas, none of which is convincing. Yet, Fischer also draws back from crossing some nebulous line by insisting that a strong supporter of Derrida (Hartman) \\"PROPERLY (my caps) unsettles our reliance on easy answers and challenges our accommodating literary study to torpid students.\\" Further, he (Hartman) \\"champions a kind of writing that is RIGHTFULLY (again my caps) more 'speculative,' 'enthusiastic,' and 'playful.'\\" It seems that Derrida, Hartman et al are wrong only insofar as they are unduly enthusiastic about the merits of deconstruction. As far as the rhetorical question of the title is concerned, the answer is a fuzzy muddled 'maybe yes.' Fischer's conclusion: \\"Deconstruction does make a difference: it reinforces established political and educational arrangements rather than damaging them or leaving them as they are.\\" Is it just me or is this last line a sterling example of the lack of precision of a theory that Michael Fischer cannot seem to make up his mind about?"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is probably the best known full-length satire of society. In it, Swift mocks what he feels to be the all the iniquities of the 18th century. And of course, it's far from being a children's book.There are four voyages and only the first two are known in the popular imagination. In each voyage, Gulliver goes to a country/countries that are radically different from those known and stays with the court/government learning about the country and sometimes helping out.Part 1 is a voyage to Lilliput. Here, the people are very very small. This is the most well-known part, containing famous satires such as that of the Big-Endians and Little-Endians. The small characters generally satirise the characteristic of pettiness.Part 2 is a voyage to Brobdingnag. Here, the people are very large. As such, they satirise the opposite quality - that of being overbearing. Here, Gulliver is paraded as a pet.Part 3 is a voyage to Laputa (and other islands including Japan). Here, Swift mocks scholarship and science. Each of the several islands has a peculiar trait to do with science. Here, you'll find such classics as the novel-writing machine and the country where the linguists decided that words are too indirect to communicate being signs of signs so everyone carries a large sack of objects to point to in direct communication - which sounds like something from a modern academic, except this is interesting.Part 4 is a voyage to the country of the Huyhnhnms. Here, Swift departs from tongue-and-cheek and becomes biting. The country is a utopia populated by benevolent horses and the humanoids are wild and uncivilised so they're &quot;looked after&quot;. As a result of the horses' brilliance, Gulliver becomes disgusted with the human race after seeing the difference. Obviously like all parts of the satire this is not to be taken literally - that Swift despised people.That's the basic content but nothing can describe the joy, humour, wit and imagination used in the book. It has everything and is an absolute must for anyone who's ever saw something funny/wrong with society (ie. all)."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Swift is by far the most effective satirist I have ever read. Voltaire restrains himself with logic, Rableais occupies too long a space, H.L. Mencken and Bierce wallow in bitterness. But it is Swift that has woven a wonderful tapestry that fully diagrams the human condition and his takes on it. The book is very contradictory because of the fact that he pairs one vice with one virtue in every chapter. His overall theme is that moderation is the only way that we can avoid being so ridiculous as these people.This book has been berated by some as despondent or dated, but Swift was not thinking four hundred years into the future. However, it still packs a punch if you are willing to inform yourself on the times. Part one is a superlative criticism of George I, II, and Anne Stuart of England. All of these leaders were naive and at the disposal of their advisers (like Walpole). Brobdignag is an attack on the pursuit of vanity by people. TO read the description of the mother suckling her baby, will make any person cringe. Laputa, the highlight of the book, is an adequate criticism of science. He charges that they are pure theorists and not pragmatists. I think that this chapter is heavily dedicated to Isaac Newton, who was involved in political committees left and right and was known for being a bitter, ponderous person. After criticizing history, the novel ends with &quot;Hyounhymns&quot; and &quot;Yahoos&quot;. I guess that &quot;Yahoo&quot; derives from the biblical &quot;Jehu&quot;. The end of this one is devoted to mocking the absolute extremes of the human condition-- dystopia and utopia. He comes to the conclusion that both are ridiculous and divorces himself from his family.The key is to read between the lines of his tone and his facts.To end, the book has been berated by scholars as simplistic, but that is the trap, to convince the reader of being absurd and playful, when there are really layers of thought behind them.Finally, he does criticize religion; notice the passages that say &quot;we {debate} whether bread be flesh, flesh bread, blood grape juice, and grape juice blood&quot; Nothing was too sacred for Swift, and that is why I recommend the most penetrating analysis of the human condition to come out of Europe, or most of literature."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Time may not have been on my side with this book, as summer was closing and I was frantically reading this book as well as two others. I feel as though this novel caught me in a way that none other has yet. It seemed to teach more about myself than any novel ever could. It showed me more about foolish pride than any person could ever advise me. I own the Cliffs notes, however I did not need them. This is an easily-read novel, and the Penguin Classics version shows the two-fold meaning of the political and fantasy novel. Because of the footnotes, I learned more about the novel than any teacher could ever even attempt to achieve. If you are required to read this novel, or would just like to give it a try, I strongly recommend it, and I also recommend that the reader tries to purchase a copy of the Penguin Classics version."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I have trouble reading classic literature. I am an avid reader and I want to enjoy the classics, but just find it difficult to understand the meaning in some of the writing.This, however, was a pleasant surprise. Although written in the early 1700s, the story itself was fairly easy to follow. Even towards the end, I began to see the underlying theme of the satire that Swift has been praised for in this work.Being someone who reads primarily science fiction and fantasy novels, I thought this might be an opportunity to culture myself while also enjoying a good story. I was correct in my thinking. Even if you can't pick up on the satire, there is still a good classic fantasy story.Essentially, the book details the travels of Lemuel Gulliver, who by several misfortunes, visits remote and unheard of lands. In each, Gulliver spends enough time to understand the language and culture of each of these land's inhabitants. He also details the difference in culture of his native England to the highest rulers of the visted nations. In his writing of these differences, he is able to show his dislike with the system of government of England. He does this by simply stating how things are in England and then uses the reaction of the strangers as outsiders looking in, showing their lack of respect for what Gulliver describes.I found it very interesting to see that even as early as the 1700s there was a general dislike of government as well as lawyers.I would recommend this book to anyone who reads the fantasy genre. Obviously, it's not an epic saga like so many most fantasy readers enjoy, but it's a nice break. I would also recommend this to high school students who are asked to pick a classic piece for a book report. It reads relatively quick and isn't as difficult to read as some of the others that I've tried to read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"If you feel that the modern era is the worst that man has experienced....if you think that the physical and moral crises we face today are unique and know no parallel in human history....then you must read &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;. Written in 1726, this is much more than the story of some clod who falls into the hands of big people and little people. It is a savage social satire, and it takes on just about every aspect of contemporary society, including the decline of physical and moral character from the earlier &quot;good&quot; eras; the malice and intransigence of bureaucracy and government; the obfuscation of law and justice by lawyers and the legal clique; the rampant advance of science and the resulting misery and pollution and general future shock, man's love of war and cruelty, etc., etc. This may sound strange, but it makes me feel better to know that the intellectuals of every age have perceived their cultures as being in decline and inferior to the grand works of those who came before.Jonathan Swift was a man of great passion and great frustation, and this comes through in his works. The epitaph he wrote for himself reads as follows: &quot;He has gone where savage indignation can lacerate his heart no more.&quot;&quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; is very readable; however an edition with a few footnotes is helpful."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is a great book with many adventures. Gulliver, the main character, takes many trips to different islands, where he learns the viewpoints of other people, on him and his country. He goes to a country of people that are only six inches tall. He begins to think that they can do no wrong. He soon learns that they are very corrupt individuals. He tells them about how his government works and they compare each other's. Gulliver thinks that his is the ideal government after this. The next stop for him is on an island of giants where he finds a better government than his. He is actually kind of embarrassed of his government. This occurs in book two. In book three Gulliver is brought to a floating island. He does not really interact with people like he did in the other books. He is really just Swift's mouthpiece. In book four Gulliver meets the horse like Houyhnhms. He starts to want to be a Houyhnhm. All in all this is a pretty good book and everyone should read it sometime."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is of course one of the great classics of Western Literature.However it is one whose unrelenting satire and ridicule of Humanity are for some of us, difficult to bear.Swift not simply puts Humanity through the microscope and reduces us to Liliputans, he also allows us to achieve our foremost aim and go on living forever, but at the price of continuing to age. In this he might be said to be the ' prophet' of our present nursing home industry.It is said that with twentieth century writers,like Beckett and Ionesco, Mankind at last came to feel the truth about our own fragmented, pathetic, pitiful and often disgusting nature.Yet Swift did all this before in the form of a highly entertaining narrative that to this day fascinates young and old alike."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I really enjoyed reading through Gulliver's Travels, I recommend it to anybody who's trying to get a good grasp on the classics and learn to enjoy some literature, but for those of you who just want to sit down at the beach and relax, this might not be the book for you. Despite the numerous versions of Gulliver's Travels flying around billed as Adventure Stories, you must remember that Swift was a satirist and Gulliver's travels is really just a large allegory. Keep in mind it's a satire from a few hundred years ago. You may find yourself lost in names and connections that would have been obvious (and perhaps very clever) to the original audience but keeps the modern day reader flipping through to the foot and end notes. The most interesting parts are the first, second and fourth parts, while the third gets a little dry. When he gets into the narrative of the story, it is very interesting and again a very important piece in literature."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is a treasure, both for its expressive (if often archaic) language and for the forward-thinking observations of the author on human nature. I had always thought of this story as primarily Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput, but it is so much more as he travels to a land of giants, a sky city where people are so lost in thought they can barely communicate, a land where scientists devote themselves to useless pursuits, a kingdom of magicians where Gulliver talks to the dead, and an island where humans and horses switch roles. In spite of what you might expect from this description, this is not just (or even mostly) a book for kids. It's chock-full of powerful insights into how humans worked then (in the 1700's) and how we still operate, and is sometimes quite saucy and crude, often to hilarious ends. A true classic, which deserves to be read again and again.The Kindle version had just a few minor typos, and no real formatting problems. I loved being able to look up unfamiliar words in the built-in dictionary."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"My first experience of Gulliver's Travels was when I was about 7 or 8. My father had been a part of this subscription service from some publisher (I think it's the Franklin Library) called the \\"100 Greatest Books of All Time.\\" The edition he had was heavy with gilded pages and was something that seemed like one of those medieval illuminated manuscripts. Each few pages had a beautiful, colored illustration of Gulliver struggling.Before I'd go to bed, he'd sit by my dresser on his wooden chair with a glass of water--at least that's what I thought it was--on his knee, and I'd be wrapped in a blanket with my back to the head of my bed frame. When he started reading, his posture would straighten out and he'd hold the gold hardback up to his eyes with one hand, the glass of \\"water\\" held in the other. Every few page turns, he'd sip at the glass and inhale sharply as if he were washing down what he had read. I remember hearing his voice bellow above the reading lamp in a kind of dark monotone. It wasn't like when he read My Father's Dragon or Wonderland. He would describe Gulliver trapped and tied down, and I remember feeling guilty for laughing. The most he would do is invisibly smile in the shadow of the lamplight and snicker.My father died this past summer. About a month after the funeral, I was walking through Border's trying to figure out what books I wanted my students to read (I just started a teaching apprenticeship at a local high school), and I ended up finding this edition. The good thing about it is that the price is so cheap.Upon rereading it this past summer, I suddenly realized what Swift and my Father saw in the text. This was by no means simply a children's book or even a \\"misanthropic\\" novel, but instead, Gulliver's Travels maps perfectly the lifespan of a human being. This novel is clearly a bildungsroman. This occurred to me when I realized that the reader's concept of the author \\"Gulliver\\" is a result of his travels. Each world he visits, he is at first considered an outsider and then becomes, somewhat, a part of the society. Gulliver is an amorphous narrator; he exists only through these worlds and therefore, grows with the text. He is not just a passive observer to these magical places, but the context of his visits shapes him, the narrator, as much as it does change the reader.How he is seen is through the context in which he is put. The Lilliputians are, obviously, a symbol for childhood. Brobbindang is pubescence as in this section, Gulliver sees the ugliness of the human form. The things that were cute in childhood now are these frightening forms. The last world Gulliver visits is a reference to the cynicism of old age. He sees humanity for what it is, a bunch of Yahoos. With this key in mind, you can clearly see how Gulliver's Travels is not misanthropic but an acceptance and analysis of the \\"human life cycle.\\" We all go through these stages during our life, just like how we go through them while reading the text. My father helped me realize this. When he read this novel to me as a child, he was teaching me what to expect from this world.However, this edition is worth \\"four stars\\" because the book is fairly cheap and feels like it will fall apart at any second. It feels as if there is no weight to it and is poorly constructed. Pages would be ripped out as they were turned. My father's stable, gold hardback edition was sold in a garage sale for a few cents four years ago. It's sad to say i don't think you can read it like that hardback tomb anymore."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I am certain that nearly every person in the Western world (and some beyond it) is familiar with the quintessential scene of \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" that of a man tied down to the ground and surrounded by tiny humans. I am equally certain however, that only a very small percentage of these people have actually read Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, first published in 1726. If you consider yourself a serious reader, then \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is essential reading, one of the many classic novels that you simply *have* to read before you die.Divided into four parts, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is presented as the historical memoirs of Lemuel Gulliver who narrates his strange adventures in undiscovered countries. In doing so, Swift explores and satirises almost every conceivable issue important in both his time and in ours: politics, religion, gender, science, progress, government, family and our basic ideas of defining humanity. As well as this, the novel is full of wonder and humour (some of it bordering on the vulgar!) and Swift's exploration of imaginary societies and countries is satire at its peak - no one before or since has reached Swift's mastery of this style.Some of the more direct parodies concern people and events that have long since passed away, and as such an index or extensive background is required in order to fully understand the allusions that Swift is making. However, a far larger portion of the text discusses issues that are still relevant to today's readers, especially in the responsibilities of power and the limits to technological/scientific progression.Part One: \\"A Voyage to Lilliput\\" is the most famous segment of the novel, and the context of the afore-mentioned \\"hostage episode\\". After taking leave of his family and country, Gulliver is washed up on the shores of an island inhabited by humanoid beings not more than six inches tall. Though at first suspicious, Gulliver soon earns the trust of the Lilliputian people who enlist their newfound giant in defending them from their enemies on the bordering island of Blefufeu - who likewise are desperate to use the giant in their war against Lilliput. Hmm, a squabble over what is considered a weapon capable of mass destruction. Sound familiar? This ability to place modern day references over older texts and their meanings is what separates literature from books - universal themes and concerns that do not age with time.In Part Two, Gulliver reaches the polar opposite of Lilliput in \\"A Voyage to Brobdingnag\\", a country of giants where he becomes the helpless victim of a greedy farmer who exploits his diminutive stature to his own advantage. Displayed as a freak of nature, the tiny Gulliver is forced to perform circus tricks till he finally comes into the care of the royal court. Despite being cared for by the gentle farmer's daughter Grildrig, Gulliver has to survive wasp-attacks, hungry cats and a malicious dwarf before he is finally seized by a hunting bird and set adrift at sea.One of the most appealing things about Gulliver's travels in both Lilliput and Brobdingnag is the disorientation he feels on re-entering the company of humans of a normal stature - each time they seem either too small or too big and Gulliver is constantly slouching or tip-toeing in an attempt to reconcile his body to what his mind tells him he should see. The best part is that we share this confusion with him, as we ourselves become accustomed to life in the tiny and giant worlds.Part Three is the least known of the four parts, and for those who have read the novel, the least popular. I consider this unfortunate as it is more full of variety and wonderment than the other segments, contains some of his sharpest parodies and is my personal favourite \`voyage' in the novel. Titled \\"A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Gluggdubdrib and Japan\\", it is easy to see that it this episode is filled with Swift's most creative inventions. It is here that Gulliver discovers a floating island, a race of immortals, a university in which they attempt to discover the answers to all things and an island of spirits who summon historical figures up out of the past. With everything from inward-eyed people to Alexander the Great to exploding dogs, Part Three has it all.Finally, in Part Four, the novel reaches its most critical and thought-provoking statement on humankind in \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms\\". Gulliver reaches a country inhabited by a remarkable race of horses with the intelligence of humans - perhaps with even *more* intelligence than humans. Also living here is a disgusting race of beings known as \\"Yahoos\\" - filthy, greedy, slothful, lecherous creatures who embody every vice known to mankind - and who are suspiciously humanoid in shape and form. Gulliver is faced with a crisis of the soul: does he really come from the race of Yahoos? Will the Houyhnhnms accept him as one of their own or as a Yahoo? And how can he ever return home with the devastating wisdom he has gained? Swift presents a fascinating study on the dark side of humanity and the nobility of animals in the climax of the novel that is the most controversial, the most studied and the most memorable.\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is not an easy book to read; like all older literary novels it requires the attention and patience of the reader, has complicated and contemporary issues to discuss and a tendency to be a bit long-winded at times. But regardless of this, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a fascinating and enjoyable read and one of those books that just *has* to be read during your lifetime - if not for any other reason but to say that you *have* read it. Though the scanty amount of reviews on this page is disheartening, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is a must-read, pure and simple.I also recommend the Hallmark adaptation of Swift's novel - NOT to be watched instead of reading the book, but as a surprisingly faithful and intelligent miniseries that accompanies the novel well."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It's amazing how our perspective changes as we age. What we thought was important as children may now seem completely insignificant, replaced by entirely new priorities, priorities children wouldn't even understand. At the same time, things we used to take for granted, like having dinner on the table, being taken care of when we're ill, or getting toys fixed when they are broken, have become items on adult worry lists.Your perspective on literature can change, too. Reading a story for a second time can give you a completely different view of it. &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark Twain, which I enjoyed as a sort of an adventure story when I was a kid, now reads as a harsh criticism of society in general and the institution of slavery in particular.The same thing is true of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift. The first thing I realized upon opening the cover of this book as a college student was that I probably had never really read it before.I knew the basic plot of Lemuel Gulliver's first two voyages to Lilliput and Brobdingnag, home of the tiny and giant people, respectively, but he had two other voyages of which I was not even aware: to a land of philosophers who are so lost in thought they can't see the simplest practical details, Laputa, and to a land ruled by wise and gentle horses or Houyhnhnms and peopled by wild, beastly human-like creatures called Yahoos.While this book has become famous and even beloved by children, Jonathan Swift was certainly not trying to write a children's book.Swift was well known for his sharp, biting wit, and his bitter criticism of 18th century England and all her ills. This is the man who, to point out how ridiculous English prejudices had become, wrote &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; which suggested that the Irish raise their children as cattle, to be eaten as meat, and thereby solve the problems of poverty and starvation faced in that country. As horrible as that proposal is, it was only an extension of the kinds of solutions being proposed at the time.So, although &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; is entertaining, entertainment was not Swift's primary purpose. Swift used this tale of a guillable traveler exploring strange lands to point out some of the inane and ridiculous elements of his own society.For example, in describing the government of Lilliput, Swift explains that officials are selected based on how well they can play two games, Rope-Dancing and Leaping and Creeping. These two games required great skill in balance, entertained the watching public, and placed the politicians in rather ridiculous positions, perhaps not so differently from elections of leaders in the 18th century and even in modern times.Give this book a look again, or for the first time. Even in cases in which the exact object of Swift's satire has been forgotten, his sweeping social commentary still rings true. Sometimes it really does seem that we are all a bunch of Yahoos."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift is classic work of satire and adventure that hardly needs my recommendation. Instead, let me comment on this edition published by Sterling. It's a nice hardcover with dustjacket and placeholder ribbon. There are a number of illustrations by Scott McKowen and an afterword by Arthur Pober. If you're looking for a inexpensive, but nice edition of Gulliver's Travels, this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"All I remembered about Gulliver's Travels was the Golden Book or other children's versions of the story that I read when I was still a wee young thing. The real story is much more thought provoking, and the style is quite interesting. Swift writes about his travels to various countries where he encounters people and customs far different from what he is used to. Nevertheless, he writes from an objective viewpoint without discussing what is wrong or right about any of the cultures he visits.The last place he visits is a country that is populated by extremely intelligent horses, who after hearing Gulliver's explanation of his own country and government, give their impressions of what is wrong with the English government and monarchy. Very tactful, but it makes the points he wants readers to understand. Many similar ideas to Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" come out in the horses' discussions.A bit long. I thought it might be a bit childish at first. But it was well worth reading from cultural, political and historical points of view."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is an excellent book. In it Swift satirizes what he thought were the foibles of his time, in politics, religion, science, and society. In Part One Lemuel Gulliver is shipwrecked on Lilliput where the inhabitants are only 6 inches tall. The rivalry between Britain and France is there satirized. In Part Two he is marooned on the subcontinent of Brobdingnag where the inhabitants are giants. The insignificance of many of mankind's achievements are there satirized. Next in Part Three Gulliver is taken aboard the floating island of Laputa, where Swift takes the opportunity to satirize medicine and science altogether - incredibly Swift did not make up the crazy experiments he describes; all were sponsored at one time or another by the Royal Society. Finally in Part Four Gulliver is marooned by mutineers on the island of the Houyhnhynms, in which Swift takes his parting shot at human society - presenting them in degraded form as the Yahoos. Most people read no further in the book than Brobdingnag - I urge you to read the rest."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Swift's classic satire of English and European governments, societies, and cultures should be required reading of every college student. (Except for those who appear to be in law school as is the earlier reviewer who referred to Swift as being an &quot;18th century Unabomber.&quot; Swift may have been conservative in his beliefs and not cared much for individuals such as Robert Boyle, who is satirized in the book, but he was not violent. Perhaps our &quot;law student/reviewer&quot; is offended by Swift's biting satire of lawyers and politicians in part four.) The version I read was an annotated edition by Isaac Asimov and contained many passages that had been deleted by previous publishers. Asimov's comments enable the reader to more fully appreciate Swift's satire. In part one of the novel, a ship's surgeon, Lemuel Gulliver, is shipwreaked and finds himself on the island of Lilliput, the inhabitants all being only six inches high. This section is great satire of English politics and wars. Royal ponp, feuds amongst the populace, and wars are made to look rediculous. In the second part, Gulliver finds himself in Brobdingnag in which he is only six &quot;inches&quot; tall (relatively speaking). This part forms another satire of European governments. In part three, Gulliver visits the flying island of Laputa where shades of ancient scholars can be called up. This section is a satire on philosophers and scientists. Scientists are portrayed as men so wrapped up intheir speculations as to be totally useless in practical affairs. Absurd experiments are described (for example, extracting sunlight from cucumbers (but, extracting energy from cucumbers and other plants is no longer so absurd Jonathan)). Also described in this third part are the Struldbergs, men and women who are immortal but who turn out to be miserable and pitiable. In part four, Gulliver travels to the Land of the Houyhnhnms, horses with intelligence but who have no passion or emotion. The word &quot;Yahoo&quot; originates in this part. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels: my first book ever on the Kindle(tm). Well, first about the mechanics of it all. I know, based on some reviews I have read, some versions of stories are poorly formatted or the font is bad or unadjustable or what have you--thankfully none of those issues was present here. It was a joy to be able to glide through the pages, looking words up at the speed of thought, never losing my place, and not having to stare at a backlit display for a change.None of this concerning Mr. Swift, though, who wrote this novel without even knowing of a typewriter or electricity. The book begins with Gulliver, an English gentleman of the early eighteenth century, talking of his love for travel at sea; I was beginning to feel as though I were reading Robinson Crusoe again. Things change quickly though as Gulliver lands on the land of Lilliput where the inhabitants are a mere half of a foot in height.Here begins Swift's parody of human culture that continues throughout Mr. Gulliver's three other tours of duty in the novel. Swift takes a characteristic or two of human nature and satirizes it with each civilization Gulliver encounters. The Lilliputians allow him to poke fun at politics and underhandedness, with every cutting each other's throat to win the king's favor. The Brobdingnagians give note to mankind's frailty, with poor Gulliver fearing for his life at every turn while the giants around him tiptoe to assure his safety.The third voyage lands Gulliver on an island in the middle of nowhere. He is rescued by the flying island of the Laputians, who are stuck with their heads in the clouds. I should say that Swift has a disdain for those who live lives in the stratosphere of philosophy and mathematics; the Laputians seem to be unable to function at all since their thoughts are always elsewhere.The forth, final, and most important voyage made by the narrator is to the land of the Houyhnhnms. The Houyhnhnms are hyperevolved horses who live their lives and run their society by rational means only. In that land there, there is a race of humans called Yahoos who live like wild animals. Swift's uses these two species to dichotomize our conflicting natures: the Houyhnhnms are our cognitive, rational faculties--our divinity--, while the Yahoos are the basal, animal-like natural side of us. Neither of these two polar opposites can be reproved for being what it is. However, it is our rational and refined halves that we wish to see have the upper hand. Unable to reconcile these two, the narrator goes a bit mad, and when he returns to England, becomes reclusive.I was thrilled with this book. Though I found some parts to be a bit slow-moving, the narrator dwelling in picayune details at times, the book truly is a work of art. This definitely opens the doors for Swift as an author to me.Matt Finizio[...]Box off, Life on."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Who would have expected that I would come away from this book liking it so very much? Trying to read it on my own, I failed, but reading it in class helped me to see it in context, and appreciate it as a funny, thoughtful, and sometimes cruel work, a satire that can be real fun and thought-provoking once you get into the right mood for reading it.Jonathan Swift was an Irish-born Tory who possessive of a famous aversion to humantiy in general. (Or so I am apt to classify him. There is something charming about misanthropes, one can really sympathize with them when one is cranky.) His Captain Lemuel Gulliver ends up stranded in various wondrous and edifying lands. I needn't tell you about Lilliput (six inch high people) and Brobdingnag (giants), but you might have forgotten Laputa, the floating island, and the land of the H----'s (don't bother me with the bloody spelling), those uber-intelligent horses. It's that last part, with the H----'s that is pretty shocking even today. You and me are both Yahoos of a kind, and Gulliver sails back to his people in raft with a sail made from Yahoo-skins. With Yahoo meat as provisions.But there are lots of disturbing, warped things in this book. I remember passages in Brobdingnag with the most fondness. There Gulliver, reduced to the status of a plaything, is quite helpless, and delightfully so. He is dropped into a bowl of cream by a dwarf and embarrasingly discommoded by a pet monkey. The ladies at the court take a perverse delight in bouncing him up and down on their breasts. Gulliver, being tiny, is able to note the physical human imperfections of his captors magnified--cancerous lumps, blemishes of the skin, moles and wrinkles appear in all their sordidness. And what interesting things these are to read about, in retrospect. I think that we as modern human beings--I mean as Westerners, swamped in our materialism and complacency--need to sample the muck in our \\"entertainment\\" sometimes, just to get in touch with reality. Tear yourself away from MTV, from the supermodels and the actors, from semi-kiddie porn anime, and admit that the physicality of our human bodies can be pretty disgusting.And also the psychology of Us, when we don't study ourselves and our values--Gulliver himself is a little man, a contemptible nincompoop most of the time. I didn't notice it while I was reading the book, but afterwards, I thought about it, and decided so. When he recommends gunpowder to the King of Brobdingnag, he even comes across as significantly--stupid. (Is there logic in presenting a country of giants with the ability to make gunpowder, when you and the rest of your kind are 1/100th of their size? Derr. Not really. Even if you want to suck up to said king.)But it's Swift on whom I can't quite place my finger... The more I think about him alongside his book, the more ambiguous he seems. Does he really mean to present the values of the H----'s as Good with a capital G in all particulars? (I was struck with their arrogant bitchiness, myself. Perhaps Swift would dislike me.) How about the Lilliuputian way of raising children, is that meant to be construed as desirable? (I do like it better than the cruel Puritanical strain of childraising, all that honor your mother & father ad nauseum beyond the bounds of compassion kind of crap--but the Lilliputian way doesn't seem to allow for that thing called love, either...)I dunno. You tell me.Ahh, but don't tell me Gulliver's Travels is outdated, or boring, 'cause I won't believe you."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"There have been many reviews regarding this classic so I will focus my review on the Kindle version stating: \`with illustrations and maps.'The illustrations did come through but were a little on the small side. Each image was roughly 3 x 3 or smaller. I wish they would have covered the entire screen. There were only a couple maps which weren't very detailed. All in all, I really liked the drawings and feel they added to the enjoyment of the story. I think it is worth the extra $1 to purchase this version.My three-star rating refers to the illustrations in this Kindle version. The person or persons who published this title could very easily go back into the file and enlarge them. I think readers would love to see Milo Winter's work a little clearer.~ Jenna"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can be looked at in at least two different ways. On a stand alone basis, it is a satire written by a misanthrope, but if taken within the context of his overall body of work, it can also be perceived as a satire written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.Part I and Part II satirize Englishmen, their religion, politics, and their government. Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall. They are actually small in both body and mind. English religion and politics are satirized by descriptions of those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels, and by the dispute between those who feel their eggs should be broken at the big end and those whose preference is the small end. Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time on Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Part I. Here, Gulliver is tiny in relation to the inhabitants. Here, too, England, and to some extent all of humankind, are taken to task. After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king comments that &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin . . . . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, historians, and &quot;projectors.&quot; On the flying Island of Laputa, the continent of Lagado, and the Islands of the Sorcerers and Immortals, He meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but can't handle the practical necessities of life, professors who dedicate their lives to extracting sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason. These horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth. In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human race in general, and English politicians in specific, as written by a rather bitter misanthrope. That is a correct reading, but not necessarily the only one. Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that it can be perceived as a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of the human race.As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children. It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"In Jonathan Swift's masterpiece, Gulliver's Travels, he calls in to question the very aspects of human nature, and how he views our character in general. Swift leads the reader on numerous journeys with the protagonist, Gulliver. The way in which he changes our perspective of our lives causes the reader to ask the question, \\"What is my nature?\\" Swift is a satirist whose strong points are made apparent through his excellent writing style. This novel was very enjoyable and caused me to think about what we, as humans, are capable of, whether it be good or bad. This novel takes the reader to four completely different worlds where we begin an investigation into human nature, and all its capabilities. However, Swift does tend to mull over human nature and its weaknesses more than it's strong points. We begin to see a pattern in Swift's tale that leads us to believe that he does not put too much trust in us. Swift makes apparent the corruption that is strong within our government and every day lives. Although we do begin to see our flaws, we realize at the end of the tale that we are also given the precious gift of free will that allows us to make the right decisions. It is a very pleasurable reading experience that allows room to think and analyze the book. I would recommend this book to anyone age fifteen or above. It is truly enjoyable with plot twists and surprises to keep the reader interested to the end!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"In my opinion, Gulliver's Travels is one of the best stories of all time. Jonathan Swift is a very talented writer who knows how to connect with the reader like no other writer does. He, in a way, resembles Andy Kaufman with his humorous criticism and sarcasm. Swift, in many ways, is a comic himself. He uses satire and sarcasm at the right times and always has a quick solution to everything. He is also a ventriloquist by using Gulliver as a puppet to talk through. Swift writes and talks about political immorality and satirization of all governmental aspects of mostly England and the United States. Swift calls on the governmental members to look upon him or her self and review him or her self to think whether he or she got their job as a result not concerning ability. I think Swift makes a great point in including this in his novel. Overall, I believe this book calls for great respect and a slap to the face of any individual who doesn't appreciate it's core memorandum. I strongly urge anyone remotely interested in literature to pick this book up."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"_Gulliver's Travels_ is Jonathan Swift's biting satire of just about everything he thought was wrong with society. Lemuel Gulliver, the main character and narrator, begins his strange and fantastic journey naive and overly praising of his society, and as he continues his travels, becomes increasingly disillusioned to the point of absurdity(as he rejects the company of his wife and children in favor of horses, who are naturally wise and good and better than human beings in every possible way). A witty satire with an interesting plot."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I must agree with the previous reviewer that I found Swift's satire to be very heavyhanded at times (e.g., a codeword for &quot;the Administration&quot; is &quot;a running sore&quot;; a professor's cure for colic is to ram bellows up the patient's butt). I suppose that this is because some of the topical and local humor is lost on readers, who, reading 300 years later, do not always understand some of the subtler jabs and double meanings.I also found the book to be surprisingly risqu&eacute; (e.g., a 16-year-old giant using Captain Gulliver as her sex toy), not exactly the image the book has in the current public perception. But that does not diminish the book in any way; it is still an outstanding adventure that can be read on at least two levels, and can be enjoyed by all. In this respect it is similar to the Chronicles of Narnia."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Although Swift's novel is often read by children, its rough handling of social topics has gained him a reputation for cynicism. In some circles, the book is considered to represent the frustrations of a twisted misanthrope. However, The way Swift paints his angry sattire into a child's fantasy shows his dexterity as a writer. This amusing little fairytale is not to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"In addition to being a marvelous fantasy, this book has much to say about government and human beings."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Wow, the title really explains everything. My definition of a great book is one that has a thrilling storyline and still carries great symbolism. This book hits a home-run on each one of these. At the beginning of the book, Swift really lays out the story and there is little symbolism, but he picks up very quickly and just keeps on running.In the beginning, Swift focuses on the story of Gulliver and his travels, while interjecting little tidbits of \\"truth\\" through the text. However, as the story progresses, Swift drops the storyline more and more to interject his own philosophical thoughts. By the end of the book, he has basically droped the entire plot and the last 50 pages are a full on rant against the British, civilization, and humanity in general. As I was reading my face was probably contorted into some hideous mixture that compiled hilarity and serious contemplation, but that is what Swift brings to the table.On one side, you really want to laugh as he questions our political system and the corruption that it breeds. He says that lawyers are born into corruption and their only ability is in deceiving the public. Then he points out that our judges, (those who deal justice), are just lawyers who have lasted thirty years in their horrific system. The prose of this entire transaction is excellent, and by the end you find yourself laughing and nodding along at the same time.On the other side, he challenges the very technological advancements that we consider to be humanities crowing achievements, and as he points out the death and catastrophe that was produced by this \\"progress\\", there is a feeling of sadness that is overwhelming. It is really indescribable, but probably one of the most truthful passages ever to be written.If you consider yourself any type of classical literate, this should be one of the top on your list."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Swift's masterwork has lost none of its bite. His acerbic misanthropy is on full display here.As the book progresses, Swift's contempt for humanity grows. This is partly what made the book so compelling for me. Gulliver is only truly happy when he is among the Houyhnhnms, the horse people in the final part of the book. He develops such a dislike for humans that he finds it hard to re-acclimate upon returning to his family in England. What is compelling is that Swift was so obviously misanthropic, yet was able to get away with it. It really speaks to his skill as a novelist. In the hands of a lesser writer, this book would have come out horribly wrong.Swift's descriptions of the different worlds are something to behold. As the reader, I could clearly picture each place in my mind. Swift gives the reader just enough to vividly imagine the world Gulliver is in at that time. Swift has the idea that the reader can do some of the work on his own, which is sadly not something authors ascribe to these days. This is partly the reason why this book is such a classic.A wonderful commentary on the follies and shortcomings of humanity."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It's a good read and probably every bit the masterpiece its reputation claims. The problem with satire, however, is that it doesn't stand alone. Parody, on the other hand, ought to make sense in itself, but obviously more sense if the object of the parody is understood and familiar. Satire only seems to make sense if you know the original.The section in Lilliput describing the bloke with different sized heels on his shoes, for instance, is very funny, but only when the footnote has provided the context. He is described as having to negotiate a political line between the faction that likes high heels and the other that likes low ones. He makes awkward progress with both groups, since he can barely walk or stand up straight in a pair of shoes made up so he can have a foot in each camp. The reference is beautiful. It refers to High Church and Low Church in the Anglican tradition, and therefore to Whig and Tory, the opposing political parties of the time. To stay sweet with both, certain royals kept a foot in both camps, making their progress as ridiculous as the rough-shod Lilliputian.In the books three sections, Gulliver is too big, then too small, then everyone is a horse except for the noxious Yahoos, of course. It was still a lot of fun and, probably, hard witting. The trouble, again, was knowing the targets. If today's Yahoos are considered... perhaps Swift might have googled his yahoos if he had been writing today.One last observation is about well-known classics in general. The most famous scene from Gulliver's Travels, at least the one most depicted, is of Gulliver strapped to the ground by Lilliputian string and twine, while the little blighters run all over him. In Don Quixote, an equally quintessential scene is the tilting at windmills, mistaken by the knight for giants. It is interesting that both of these much quoted scenes appear very early in their respective books. I wonder if that might have something to do with certain people never getting very far through them!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I really appreciated your review, as it helped me get the gist of sections I had not yet read. I would only like to say, however, that while Gulliver may have had some progressive ideas about human psychology, his intention with the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos could not possibly have been Freudian, as Freud's work did not exist until over a century and a half after Swift wrote his book. I do like your interpretation, though, since as 21st century readers we can apply Freud's theories backwards to Swift's writing, and look at what marvelous results we get!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie.

I definitely had favorite \\"countries\\" that he traveled to and loved when I could hear the sarcasm and biting wit. There were times when I'd wonder, \\"this was written 300 years ago??\\" I found that the word 'pimp' (and many other words) has been around that long at least. Another thing that I wondered at was how open the discourse was. The author, whether you mean Jonathan Swift or Mr. Gulliver, the traveler, had no problem discussing bodily functions. Fifty to 100 years later in Austen's time an author wouldn't THINK of doing such a thing.So I found it to be interesting in three ways. First as a work of fiction since Mr. Gulliver travels so widely and sees so many unaccountable things. His descriptions of the natives of these lands is really interesting. Second, as a political satirist Jonathan Swift was acutely poking fun of his countrymen and occasionally I could even discern who he would be making the jest of. More often I couldn't but it was enough to know that he was putting down his contemporaries. Thirdly, as a gauge of humanity / human nature. The same vices, virtues and pastimes Jonathan Swift describes are just as much a part of our society today as it appears they were three hundred years ago. I distinctly remember one line where Mr. Gulliver muses on how the generation before his thought that his generation was the most degenerate and lazy and how they would be the ruin of the society etc. etc. Isn't that what our \\"parents\\" say of us? That there is no faith among our generation. We are impatient, lazy and not willing to create or make long-term goals? I found the whole thing interesting."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Anyone who wishes to discover what the neoclassical period was all about need only read this novel and you will get it! Along with \\"A Modest Proposal\\", Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels demonstrates satire to its ultimate purpose. Which is to take what many people see as sacred and take it to its logical extreme. The book is really easy and really functions as a children's story through the first two books. This is the part most often spoken of in public. In fact most film adaptations only give these two books and leave out the rest.The latter two books is where we discover Swift's unbridled cynicism. While many people think this cynicism is a downfall of the book, I look at it as a shining light of Swift's time. Indeed, I think Swift's wit and biting satire are needed today. Just think about all the fodder a man like Swift would have? We have so many interest groups in America that think they are holier than thou, I only wish a satirist of Swift's stature to make fun of these ne'er do wells of today.I highly prize this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see good satire in action."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The book was good and the author writing style was quite independent. Gave the book 4 stars because the book had good storyline and was interesting but at times it dragged."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" was the next stop on my quest to read classics written in English. I recently read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and frankly wasn't that impressed. For the record, \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" exceeded my expectations and has me perplexed why I was never assigned the book in all my years of schooling.I am familiar with the many re-tellings of choice parts of the book but had never heard the one about extinguishing the palace fire with the power of piss. There are other sections dealing with the bodily functions that are left out of the children's versions of the stories.But lets start with the imagination involved. Swift created four distinct and compelling worlds that turn the role human's play upside down. Not one but four. He used relatively plain language with workmanlike prose to create worlds that showed us in unflattering light but with a purpose.Next there is the satire. Clearly, Swift is talking about his own age but also about human beings that we recognize as full of the pride, avarice, violence not to mention the bottomless pit of human stupidity. He parcels out the satire carefully and slowly so that we begin to believe the exaggerations are reality and by the time Gulliver doesn't want to return to human society and instead live with horses or houyhnhnm, I was completely with him.What about that fourth voyage? While I relished the brilliance of the first three voyages, it is the fourth one when he ends up with the houyhnhnm that I felt the nobility of man's potential and how sad it is that we surrender so quickly to our shortcomings. There is something about Gulliver's affection for the noble horses that conveys this notion with tremendous effectiveness on a feeling level."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Upon receiving this book, I was pleasantly surprised. It is well put together and is small enough to carry around without even thinking about it. The only complaint I have is that the font is somewhat small and the spacing between lines isn't big enough for a Lilliputian to see. It can be tricky to read at times because I end up skipping lines then hunting through the jungle of words to rediscover where I was. However, overall it's an excellent copy and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"A classic tale for the imagination,i remember this book from childhood,and it just goes to show you do not ever have to grow up.i think i have learned from this book it does not matter how big or small you are its whats in your heart that counts.

Guliver's discussions with the local nobility about governance allowed me to learn more about british politics, governance and lifestyle of the time period. The story goes on to spoof modernization for the sake of progress, a danger we can still encounter.

Next thing he knows he's tied down to the ground.I liked this book because it was full of adventure where he met many tiny people that he did not know.I also liked it because there were two tribes that he made friends with, which is very exciting.Finally, I liked the book because the people in both tribes were enemies and fought a lot of the time which was really cool. They stopped fighting when Gulliver arrived because he pulled all the boats of the other tribe to the land of Liliput.I recommend this book for all ages especially those people who love adventure.(Review by Tristan)"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"In Gulliver's Travels, Gulliver explores many fantasy islands where he landed on by accident; he keeps on wanting to explore more far away places. On Gulliver's first voyage, he gets shipwrecked on the land of Lilliput, where he meets people only six inches tall. These people are very curious at first, but then get used to Gulliver being around and helping where needed. On his second voyage, Gulliver lands on an island where people are sixty feet tall. Gulliver then gets treated like a circus animal when a man shows him off for money without feeding him well. Gulliver then finds a way home, back to England and sets off for more adventures that bring him to an island that floats in the sky and also to a land where beasts look like men.One of the most emotional situations in Gulliver's Travels was when Gulliver was in Brobdingnag (his second voyage) and was used as a way to get money by being showed to many people who were curious. I felt bad that Gulliver had to live like a circus animal and on top of that, he was not being fed well. He was traveling with his owner to many places a day getting no respect what so ever by his owner who happened to be a farmer. A quote that I liked that shows how Gulliver felt was, &quot;I was so tired with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word.&quot; This quote clearly states that the farmer was over working Gulliver and how Gulliver felt about being showed to people. That is why this is a good quote that explains the main characters feelings.Jonathan Swift is a very good writer because he gives good details in this novel about the lands in which Gulliver landed on. He also gives detailed descriptions on the government of each land. Jonathan Swift has a very creative mind that shows as you read through Gulliver's many voyages that are like fairy tales.I would recommend Gulliver's Travels because it has a lot of creativity with all of the voyages that Gulliver goes on. It also gives detailed descriptions on the lands visited. The type of audience that I think would really enjoy this novel are the people who are interested in government and also culture. Even though these lands are made up places, it is still fun to see how Jonathan Swift expresses his creative mind through the lands visited and the people made up."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Orwell was a big fan of this book and you can see that reflected in his style.

I recommend it to everyone. Buy it."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"To this classic of English literature, I say: \\"meh.\\" I guess I'm glad I read it, since it's so famous. But I won't read it again. It's basically a set of satirical stories penned by the hand of a bitter, misanthropic old man.I'm sure that the people of the 18th century (when the book was written), found the satire amusing and poignant, but I found much of it to be simplistic, and not particularly insightful. Moreover, the satirical lessons (such as they are) are buried within lengthy and laborious descriptions of things like the etymology of various imaginary words in imaginary languages.From my perspective, The most interesting thing about reading this book was discovering that the most famous stories within it - those of Lilliput and Brobdingnag - are only two of a bunch of stories that comprise the whole. I suspect that those two stories are the most famous because they're the most fun to think about. After all, it's kind of fun to imagine a world in which everything is scaled up or down by some size-constant (in this case Lilliput is a world with a scaling factor of 1/12th, while the inhabitants of Brobdingnag scale by 12x). But even those stories are a bit dry, and the rest of the book is just a curmudgeonly take on life and society, and human beings in general. Meh."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I had to give up on this book about 2/3 of the way through. I was just getting too tired of looking up \\"Old English\\" words as I read.

However, I was using it so much that I would lose the thread of what he was saying.) I'm reasonably well educated, read a lot and enjoy it. However, this book was not anything like what I expected. I though it might be a children's tale but it turned out to be a political treatise."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Swift's masterpiece is immortal.As a ghost writer for one of the main political parties in his time, he was a prime observer of 'the violent desire of wealth and power', which led to 'a heap of conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments. the very worst effects of avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice and ambition'.Man's evil genius was responsible for- fundamental social injustice: 'the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man's labour, and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former.'- war in the name of God: 'a new dominion acquired with a title by DIVINE RIGHT (Swift underlines) ... the natives driven out or destroyed, their princes tortured to discover gold, a free licence given to all acts of inhumanity and lust ... this execrable crew of butchers, employed in so pious an expedition'.And, 'a soldier is hired to kill in cold blood as many of his own species, who have not offended him.'- fundamental inequality between man and woman: 'it was monstrous to give the females a different kind of education from the males ... one half good for nothing but bringing children in the world.'- the corruption of judges: 'the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent. Perjury was amongst the most excusable arts.'- the prostitution of his own profession: 'how the world has been misled by prostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards, the wisest counsel to fools, sincerity to flatterers, Roman virtue to betrayers, piety to atheists, chastity to sodomites, truth to informers.'Swift lost his confidence in man, ruled by 'the great power of habit and prejudice' and whose 'understanding (was) below the capacity of a common hound, who hath judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack, without being ever mistaken.'Swift's masterstroke (under censorship) was to lift by satire the current affairs of his own lifetime on a general and universal human level.His lasting modernity lays in his profound understanding of the power of the media, the male/female struggle, the hypocritical use of religion for social oppression and warmongering, and ultimately the all importance of POWER.His insight into the basics of human nature is worth a Schopenhauer."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is written as a satire, but it is also a well-known children's book. Both children and adults alike can enjoy this story and the lessons that it teaches. It is important to read edited and abridged versions to children since these versions take out the wicked satire that runs through this book, and make it more of an adventure story. In it we see our hero, Gulliver, on four different voyages and his surprise landings in four different places. But, don't be misled - this book is a savage one, and Swift takes aim at the British people in general and the Whigs in particular. He pokes fun at various political, academic and social institutions. In it we meet the Lilliputians, and the giants in Brobdingnag. We also meet the sorcerers on Glubdubdrib and the immortals on Luggnagg. The stories are quite violent and Gulliver is exposed to some fairly rough and scary treatment, but it creates a wanderlust in him that he can't assuage. The wit is scathing, and the satire is pointed, but good reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I enjoyed Gulliver's Travels because it is not just an adventure story but a book of criticms and opinions by the author, Johnathan Swift. For instance,in the lst country Gulliver visits is ruled by horses. He does not want to go back to England because tgher is politcians, lawyers, theives, and drunks there. Horses do not have those things. I think what Swift was trying to say was thatif humans had the minds of horses then life would be a whole lot better. Throught the whole story Gulliver meets many interesting people. He meets tiny people, large people, and magicians. The only thing I did not like about this book was that it was a little hard to understand in some parts."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The book Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift, is a very interesting and well thought out book. It is about the travels of an Englishman named Gulliver and the lands that he visits during his travels. Most books could not hold together without some underlying plot or scheme, but the way that Jonathan Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels, it isn't totally necessary. Throughout the entire book, Gulliver goes about describing in detail how eight different societies work and function as he observed them during his travels.The true beauty of the book is not completely appreciated until a little more is known about the author, Jonathan Swift, and the time period he wrote in. The events and people in this book do not follow the famous clause: &quot;The following story and characters are completely fictional. Any resemblance to real-life people and events is purely coincidental.&quot; Swift, as a matter of fact, takes great pride in using real-life people to base his characters on.

A brief summary of the book would be:Gulliver's Travels is a book about a man named Gulliver who traveled through his world finding lands undiscovered by others. The lands that Gulliver stumbles upon consisted of people six inches high, 60 feet high, a floating land in the sky with people who thought the world would end when Gulliver came, and finally a land where horses ruled and kept a degenerate version of humans as pets. All of these visits to the different lands gave Gulliver a new outlook on his own culture by studying all of theirs."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"i think this book was a bit too old for me to really say wether i liked it or not. my standards are pretty much based on novels from the last one hundred or so years. with that said the only really problem i had is that it was tooslow. the ideas behind the work were great but it was pretty dificult to keep up with the pace of the novel and all of the tiny nuances of the history."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is of course one of the most famous works of literature in the world, especially thanks to the Japanese, who realised a consistent amount of cartoons for the home-video market inspired by it.I must say I was not very surprised by this work, as I knew from the start whre everything would go. The letter and the spirit of Gulliver's Travels are one of the most divulgated to students from primary till high school. That's why I particulartly liked the account of Laputa, which is one of the lesser known episodes (and I looked forward to it, since Italo Calvino had done a remarkable publicity for it once). Especially the Academy of Sciences of that noble country had an interesting Sadian feeling (Swift is one of those philosophic minds which delight in fustigating philosophers); plus, you could witness the explosion of a dog.There's rather a disquieting feeling hanging around these pages. From neurotic midgets who receive rains of urine on their heads, giants with a deformed and stinking skin (not different from our own, if we could magnify it adequately, the author says), to people who after they've come home from a long voyage, prefer talking to two horses and have to hold a handkerchief in front of their nose when they're with their wives and children. Vanitas vanitatum, memento mori. No wonder Swift was an Irish clergymen. But this exposes also a difficulty in his social criticism; generally, we point towards him as a spur to reform. But, how can a work with such a deeply rooted convinction in the decline of humanity stimulate to politicalaction. rather, ity is an invitation to a stoic ideal of life, not unlike Voltaire's in \\"Candide\\"."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book has been on my Kindle for a year or so now.

It may be a classic but to me it is boring and hard to follow."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels was an all right book, although I thought it could be better, but it was very boring at many points, and had very little dialogue. The only part tht I actually liked was the setting and the new lands, such as unknown places like Luggnagg, the flying island of Laputa, Liliput, Brobdingnag, and the land of the Yahoo's. There were also discovered places such as Holland, Japan, and the UK. I think that the reason that I liked the lands was because it was interesting to see how Swift conveyed the images of these lands and their many inhabitants. There were many different characters, like the main one, Gulliver, the kings of all the lands, Gulliver's maid in Brobdingnag, the Yahoos on Houhynymns, and various other characters distributed eithin the lands. The characters were only okay, but i think that Jonothan Swift didn't describe Gulliver and the new characters very well, as Gulliver and their interactions together. The main plot of Gulliver's Travels was Gulliver going on many long, assiduous journeys with completely new types of people. However the plot isn't rigid at all , and often meandered a lot, with no real point. The plot was allright, but it was often dysfunctional and boring. Also, the plot was slow to develop, and although the idea was promising, Jonothan Swift didn't do a very good job at all of developing it."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I liked Gullivers Travle's because he took a trip to the land of Talking Horses and Hunyums.

The reasons I gave this book three stars as, most people give it four, was that the chapter title were not titles, but complete summaries. A chapter title should be about one to five words. Instead the chapters in this book were regularly about two sentences long. Also I believe that there should be words on the front cover describing the book's content and word usage.Another is that in the back of the book there should be a word dictionary or at least something that gives a substitution for some of the confusing Old English words. If the author moved each adventure into several different small books he could have more room to write and enough room to place a small dictionary.In each adventure I felt that Swift did agood job expressing how whether you are tall or short, ugly or good looking, you have something to offer the world wherever you are. In the land where Gulliver \\"became\\" a giant he helped steal another islands' ships andand he also helped by urinating on the emperor'scastle to put out the fire that was burning the castle up. Also in the land where Gulliver wastiny he had something to offer At first he was considered \\"worthless\\", but then most people discovered that he was agood source of entetainment. Gulliver could ride around on alittle boa t to every lady's delight. Gulliver was even taken to the palace of giants he was so entertaining.

As a children's tale, Gulliver's Travels is moderately interesting, with a few brief moments of humor. It is neither riveting nor drab, but simply - average.Despite the preface of the Baronet Books edition, which claims that Gulliver's Travels is a &quot;masterpiece of satire&quot;, I found the irony to be blatant and trite, and, as a result, predictable and boring.While certainly not a great read, it was worth the half hour I invested in it (barely).tpmMarch 18, 2002"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Did you know the monster in 'Frankenstein', which was written in 1816, is compared to the 'Id' in Freudian theory and that he too was created as a character long before Freud was born?"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Who ever said this book was not just for kids is crazy.

This book was Awful!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This classic is a fanciful tale worthy of any child's ears as well as a satirical look at English politics and a critical examination of man's greatest weakness..PRIDE.Swift was fanatically loyal to the Tories and his vehemence to the Whigs culminated in his mental and physical decline when the Whigs prevailed.It is worthy to compare Swift's criticism of man's pride culminating in Gullivers moral demise with Swift's own tragic end years after the book was written. The irony is striking.Humanity is personified in the Lilliputians who are small, weak, corrupt, cruel and proud even in the presence of the giant, Gulliver. Here Swift also draws parallels to political strife in England and he is especially scathing of PM Walpole who is embodied in the character Flimnap.In the second book, Swift, reverses the role of Gulliver who is now diminutive. This sudden shift is a literary tactic which enables us to understand just how frail humanity is and the gulf between what we are ( Lilliputian ) and what we aspire to be ( Brobdignagian ).Swift uses the opportunity to show that with great power there is great responsibility which must be distributed justly. These qualities are what truly elevate humanity and are exemplified in the Brobdignagian King. We see that in the land of giants, a people free of pride, there is unity and peace free from corruption.The third books is a collection of tales poorly conceived yet powerful enough to yet again empasize man's pride as his downfall. This time it is in the form of Laputians who represent a parody on the notion that rationality alone is the means to our salvation.In the final book we see man compared to the idealized Houyhynhynms and the bestial and odious Yahoo's. This literary chiaroscuro shows what humanity is and will become when completely devoid of rationality and civility, a brute, juxtaposed with what potential humanity has to become.Of course we are not on either extreme but somewhere in the middle. Gulliver's fails to realize this and sits as a judge on humanity thereby becoming what he despises the most."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels Grosset & Dunlap Publishers, 1947,306pp.,$5.99Jonathan Swift ISBN number is 0-671-00174-4Gulliver's Travels is a wonderful adventure by Jonathan Swift. At first I didn't want to read it, but once I reading, I just had to keep going! In the beginning, we find a young man named Lemuel Gulliver. Mr. Gulliver was sent to Emanuel to be an apprenticeship to Mr. Bates. By being an apprentice, Mr. Gulliver becomes a surgeon on a ship called the Swallow. But when Mr. Gulliver marries and settles down in London, Mr. Bates dies and his business begins to fail, so Gulliver goes back out to sea. On the Antelope, they leave Bristol with the voyage bound toward the South Sea. Due to a miscalculation by the crew, they are already tired and ill when a storm brews. The captain, crew and Gulliver are forced to abandon the ship. Because Gulliver knows how to swim, he reaches land. That's when the half a pint of brandy from the ship forces Gulliver to fall asleep. When he wakes up, he can't move and he finds strings on his upper body. When Gulliver breaks the strings he's showered with tiny arrows and spears from an army of small people. When Gulliver doesn't fight back, most of the miscommunication has ended with this \\"Man Mountain\\". Gulliver finds himself in a city, a country of little people that speak an odd language. When he knows enough, he asks the emperor for his freedom back every day. All the while, Gulliver mainly wonders how he will get back home once he gets his freedom, that is, if he ever gets his freedom.Jonathan Swift, the author of this wonderful tale, was born on November 30,1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He died at the age of 78, and was known as a writer, satirist, and political writer. For 40 years, he had a political career and many were afraid of his political reviews. A political position which he was trying for was blocked by a Bishop and he was soon exiled from England to Ireland. The disillusioned Swift soon began writing Gulliver's Travels, which is a satire on the corrupt English government.I would recommend Gulliver's Travels to anyone. I would give this book * * * *.

However, Swift's satire really is focused on the idea that all people are Yahoos, just brutes covered with a veneer of civilization that simply makes them more destructive en masse yet less personally able to deal with the world. It's a hard message to stomach, especially when the self-righteous Houhnhynms are so dull; Gulliver believes they are free of the vice of pride, but they seem to me to have endless pride in their society, which, at least from a modern perspective, seems as deeply flawed as human society. These Houhnhnyms keep other Houhnyms as servants simply because the latter are of certain coat patterns. Since there is no money in this society, and since these beings are given no choice in the matter, this servitude is just glorified slavery, which makes Houhnhnym society all the worse for masquerading as something better. I am not sure if Swift intended this flaw as, perhaps, an indication that even the most utopian society has its weaknesses or if it is, instead, just a product of Swift's times. Either way, it made me entirely dislike the Houhnhnyms and their self-righteous attitude towards the Yahoos. Furthermore, the Houhnhnyms decide to castrate the Yahoos in the way humans might geld a horse; this, in itself is perhaps reasonable, but they decide this only after they object to Gulliver's description of the human practice of gelding. Again, I don't know what Swift intended here, but, in any case, I became thoroughly annoyed with Gulliver's respect for the Houhnhnyms. Of the earlier societies, I found the third the most interesting. Worlds of a different scale than our own have some interest, but there were far too many descriptions of the disparity of size. As the daughter of academics, I was much more compelled by the society in which novel methods were being constantly explored, with complete dismissal of what is practical and real. I wish Gulliver had not become so easily bored with the university there because I certainly wanted to hear more about it. However, what I took away most from Gulliver's travels is that Swift was inordinately fond of talking about excrement."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I have to read this book this year for senior year would this book follow the text book that they have for any school?"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"A book that you can take on two levels, the straightforward adventure story, and Swift's social and political commentary.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Its actual title is \\"Travels Into Several Remote Nations Of The World\\" as if by Lemuel Gulliver, but most people know it as \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and the actual author is Jonathan Swift. The book works on numerous levels, it could be viewed as an adventure story for children, an early example of fantasy/science fiction, a general satire of humanity, or a more specific satire of events, society, and politics in which Swift lived. The latter was undoubtedly the way it was taken when first publish ed in 1726 and amended in 1735, but that is the most difficult way for the reader to view the book today. The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is of great assistance in helping the reader appreciate that aspect of the book, with a fine introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr., and detailed notes throughout the text to help explain many of the references.Part I, \\"A Voyage to Lilliput\\" is the best known part of the book. This section has often been used in isolation of the other three parts of the book. This is the story where Gulliver is shipwrecked and washed up on a distant shore, only to find himself a captive of the Lilliputians, who are 1/12th the size of Gulliver. Swift is very detailed in discussing the minutia of Gulliver's experience, from how much he has to eat, to how he relieves himself. Swift satirizes the court of King George I, and of course travel books where the authors stretch the truth. Gulliver starts as a captive, becomes a loyal subject, but then is forced by his own morals to refuse the requests of the King of Lilliput which allows his enemies to work against him. As a result, Gulliver is forced to flee and as fortune would have it he makes it back to home.In Part II, \\"A Voyage to Brobdingnag\\", Gulliver once again goes to sea, and is this time abandoned when he goes to look for fresh water. This time Gulliver finds himself in a somewhat reversed position, still captive, but this time by people who are 12 times his height. The notoriety of Gulliver's existence results in his again being a favorite of the court. Gulliver tries to impress the King with stories of Europe, but his stories of the use of guns and cannons has the opposite affect. This time Gulliver is rescued by luck when a giant bird drops him in the sea where he is found and returned again to England.Part III, \\"A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan again has Gulliver at sea, and his fortunes are worse yet, as his ship is taken by Pirates and he is marooned on an island. Here he is rescued by a flying island (Laputa) which is a kingdom where math and the arts are of paramount importance but they have no interest at all in Gulliver's information regarding other lands. Gulliver then travels to Balnurabi where he visits their Academy which is a satire of the Royal Society at the time. Gulliver decides to go to Japan to make his way on a Dutch ship back to England, but since he has time he first goes to Glubbdubdrib. Here he discusses history with the ghosts, and learns of the immortal Struldbruggs who spend most of their existence old and infirmed. Gulliver then makes his way back to Balnurabi and on to Japan, where he manages to avoid a ceremony where he would have to trample on the crucifix before returning to England. This is the last of the sections which Swift wrote, and is the most unusual.Part IV, \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms\\" starts with Gulliver breaking his promise to remain at home and returning to the Sea. Once again misfortune sets in and his crew mutinies and eventually leaves him on an unknown shore. Here Gulliver meets the dominant species, the Houyhnhns who are like horses. The humans of this land are called Yahoos, and their behavior and actions convince Gulliver that the Houyhnhms are preferable to his own species. In the end Gulliver much prefers life among the Houyhnhms to that among humans (Yahoos), even those in England. The Houyhnhms decide that Gulliver is a danger to their society, and so they exile him. Gulliver is rescued, no thanks to his own efforts, and finds himself once again among humans. Despite being treated wonderfully by the Portuguese captain, Gulliver cannot stand being among humans, and even when he makes it back to his home in England, he prefers to spend his time in the stables with the horses. This section contains my favorite part of the book, where Gulliver tries to defend European \\"Civilization\\" to the Houyhnhms by discussing European wars.If one is looking to read \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" as a Children's book, then there are better editions than this one to choose. If you are looking to read the complete book as an adventure story or a general satire, then there are several editions which contain the complete novel, though this one will work for that as well. If you are looking to read it to understand the more specific and detailed satire that it offers, then the Penguin Classics publication is a very good choice of editions. In addition to the introduction and the notes mentioned before, there are also some textual notes discussing the differences in the 1726 and 1735 editions. For the most part, this book sticks with the 1726 edition, but there are several places where Robert Demaria, Jr. opts to use the 1735 text. This is also discussed in the notes and in \\"A Note on the Text\\" which precedes the novel."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by Gulliver's Travels, a book that I expected to be a tediously difficult read. Instead, I found it to be fast-paced and interesting, though filled with references to various bodily excretions almost to the point of obsession. Having been introduced to some of the book's cool words that have been dictionary-ized (like \\"Lilliputian\\" and \\"Brobdingnagian\\") in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, I enjoyed learning a bit about how they came to be, though was most intrigued by two countries, Laputa and Luggnagg, that I'd never heard of before.In Part I, Gulliver sets out on his first voyage and lands in Lilliput, were the natives are only one-twelfth his size. After freeing himself from bondage, he ingratiates himself with the Lilliputians in various ways, including, in a moment of quick thinking, putting out a fire through peeing, in one of the many bodily-excretion-related incidents Swift shares with the reader. Another, on the same island, involves his dismay at having to...ahem...rid his body of fecal matter, including the lengths (involving wheelbarrows) that the locals must go to to facilitate the situation. Typical throughout his travels, Gulliver is able to learn the language and get on good terms with the native people. As happens after each major stop, he heads home to hang with the wife and kids, then and goes off on his next adventure. In Part II, readers learn about his second destination, Brobdingnag, basically, the land of the giants. Field laborers track him down and his caregivers end up showing him off to others at times as a sort of freak due to his diminutive size. Due to bad feelings about him on the part of a dwarf, he's involved in several \\"accidents\\" involving things like apples, a dog, etc. Again, he heads home. In Part III, where he visits several destinations, he gains passage as a ship's surgeon. Unfortunately, the captain takes on some bad guys, which leads to Gulliver being left adrift. He finds his way to Laputa, the land of math and music, where, among other things, the island is a perfect circle and its residents eat things formed into perfect geometric shapes. From there he moves on to Balnibarbi; Lagado, where they employ some backwards-seeming practices for plowing and constructing houses; Glubbdubdrib, where persons from the world over may be called up from the dead and questioned for a period not to exceed 24 hours; and Luggnagg, land of the extremely intriguing Struldbruggs, whose status as immortals turns out not to be as appealing as one might expect. In Part IV, he journeys to the \\"Country of the Houyhnhnms,\\" where, in Planet of the Apes-like fashion, the beasts (horses) rule, and the Yahoos, more primitive versions of humans, are ruled.Within the story of his various adventures, even a semi-oblivious (in terms of history and politics) person like me will find interesting discussions about and references to social, religious, political, and philosophical issues that still exist today, almost 300 years after Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels. Also good: Silence by Shusaku Endo, Shogun by James Clavell, and Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is near-unique in world literature in that it can truly be enjoyed and appreciated by all. It has over the years been seen an adventure, a children's story, a travelogue parody, a political allegory, one of the first novels, and a satirical masterpiece. The book is all this and more, making it one of literature's ten or so truly immortal works, a towering monument as significant and important nearly three hundred years on as ever. It is one of the few books that absolutely everyone should read, and its peculiar greatness is that, perhaps alone among them, nearly everyone will love it.On the most obvious level it is a rollicking adventure. Swift's imagination is one of the most astounding ever; he invents an incredible diversity of unforgettable places and people, and millions have been enthralled by this alone. The book has even often worked as a children's story - sans crude and heavy elements of course. Those approaching it for the first time are in for a real joy. They simply will not know what comes next and will keep wondrously reading to find out.Those who really appreciate the novel, though, see that Swift was merely using the adventure frame as a vehicle for his philosophical and political views. Often called misanthropic, a deep distrust of humanity affected everything he did; he was sickened by brutality, avarice, pride, and other vices, which comes across clearly here in many ways. Gulliver unflinchingly depicts many of humanity's shortcomings without excuse or even sympathy; our irrationality, stupidity, ignorance, hypocrisy, and perhaps above all, arrogance are on merciless display. The true mockery is often not so much the horror of our actions as the pettiness of our motives. Despite the light-hearted device, a more fundamentally misanthropic and savagely satirical work has perhaps never been written. Anyone wanting shame-inducing proof of what fools human beings are need look no further.Yet it is possible to take this too far. As misanthropic as Swift was, he was also one of the era's great liberals - a fierce liberty champion and advocate for the repressed. Those who read closely can see that his hatred lay not with the downtrodden but with those who make them so - monarchs, politicians, judges, lawyers, and other unsavory types. He was sickened by humanity's inhumanity. The almost unbearably dark ending seems to have no hope for meliorism, and the book generally shows human life as an unbroken misery series. Stern Christianity kept Swift from the existential despair that haunted writers and intellectuals about a century and a half later, but one would be very hard-pressed to find a more despairing portrait of the human condition prior to the late nineteenth century.Again, though, this can be exaggerated. Some parts of the novel are truly light-hearted; there is a wealth of humor, not all of it satirical. There is also a great deal of charming whimsy. Most notable of all, though, is that Swift manages to convey his bitter pill through satire; this is worlds away from the gloomy realist works of the last century plus. Swift is universally known as the greatest English satirist and is one of the greatest ever; he knew how to convey harsh truths in palatable form. The satire ranges from thinly-veiled to subtle. Swift thus lets the real message arise naturally rather than overwhelming the story - a fine line that few can walk straight and that perhaps no one can do as well.The satire's sophistication has been fully recognized only relatively recently; Gulliver was indeed so far ahead of its time that it was perhaps not even possible for all its nuances to have been appreciated earlier. Careful readers will notice that Gulliver, as his name implies, is very gullible - at least at first, often not seeming to see the full import of what he says. However, he becomes ever more cynical and wizened, and the satirical frame gradually lessens to the point where most of part four is simply outright lashing - almost an essay in dramatic monologue form. Some have criticized this on artistic grounds, saying Swift got carried away or even that he began to lose sanity. However, it is clearly deliberate; the artistic control is stunningly precise. Swift knows how to draw us in, introducing his message gradually until we are so taken that we will keep reading even when hit hard. Such finely-wrought mastery has rarely been shown anywhere, much less in satire. This is also important in character development terms; Gulliver is a very complex - perhaps even unreliable - narrator of the type who did not really reappear until the twentieth century. Obvious as Swift's points are, the novel is thus ripe for deconstruction; the book can be interpreted in a near-endless variety of ways with widely different ramifications despite the clear core. This is a large part of the reason for its continuing popularity with critics as well as the public.Gulliver is a landmark in many other ways, not least in the novel's history. It was published in 1726, only seven years after Robinson Crusoe, which is generally called the first real Western novel. There is even good reason to think Swift began as early as 1720. Robinson is one of the few books even more popular than Gulliver, but the latter is far superior by any standard; it has virtually everything Robinson has plus far more. Novels of its depth and complexity were not normal for nearly another two centuries; that such a work came practically on the first novel's heels is truly incredible. Also highly noteworthy is how Swift manages to keep a realistic tone despite so many fanciful events - a task far harder than Defoe's with Robinson. This is of course part of the joke and also Swift's jab at the highly apocryphal travelogues then immensely popular; Gulliver is indeed in large part a parody of them, yet another interesting angle and one now nearly forgotten.The book is also of great historical value. The satire in many ways gives a more realistic glimpse into the important Enlightenment era than a realist work, or even a history, could ever hope to do. We get a good idea of the issues that dominated English, Irish, and European politics as well as other important social matters. Perhaps more importantly, we get a stark glimpse of the thoughts and customs that lead to the atrocities Swift condemns - an invaluable lesson from which we clearly still have much to learn.Last but not least, Gulliver is an English prose watershed. Swift defined good style as \\"proper words in proper places\\" - a seemingly simple, even asinine, definition but one that very few have successfully followed. His prose is plain and straight-forward, as Gulliver himself constantly reiterates, but in the best possible way; few works are so clear and concise. Thus, despite archaic spelling and punctuation, the book reads almost as well as ever; even casual readers who have almost no experience with classics, much less ones of this vintage, can pick it up with practically no trouble. Unlike nearly all classics, it need not be drastically edited, footnoted, and introduced for comprehension. This is hardly true of even many twentieth century works, to say nothing of ones nearly three centuries old. Gulliver is a major part of the reason Swift remains a model for anyone wanting unadorned but transcendently lucid English prose.Surely nothing more need be said. If one could read only five or ten books, this should be among them. Anyone who has not experienced its wonders should do so without delay."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Great notes and text! The book starts off with a brief summary and timeline of Swift's life then goes on to give some background to the story in the introduction.

Gives some good insight into what I'm reading."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I think I bought at least 6 copies already. It's a great gift. The price is good, but the book doesn't look cheap at all. Not to mention this book is really worth reading..."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"With the \\"bowlderized\\" film version my only exposure to Gulliver's Travels, I was under the horribly mistaken impression it was a \\"kids' book.\\" Ha! Nothing could be further on from the truth. To put it simply, Gulliver's Travels is the most succinctly profound piece of literature I've ever read... And being that I'm not an 18th century European, many of the allegories and allusions went right over my head. This is no concern, however, as the book's themes and messages are positively timeless.This book is its own sort of DaVinci Code. The meanings are multiple and layered, with twists of irony and hyperbole, allusion and metaphor at every turn. Then, once you take into account Swift's own biography, the mystery of each passage's meaning becomes all the more profound. But, at the same time, Gulliver's Travels is enjoyable as a straight-forward narrative. At a concise 250 or so pages, it is The Perfect Book.Other reviews go into detail concerning the plot and themes, so I'll avoid rehashing the storyline or offering my own interpretation of each of the four voyages. But suffice it to say, I viewed Gulliver's Travels as a championing of classical-liberal political philosophy (even as Swift was an Anglican priest), and as a skewering of the petty differences upon which governments make war. By the end, the protagonist finds that living under any human government is intolerable, having had his eyes open to the \\"perfection of nature\\" in the Houyhnhnms. I viewed this also as a major advancement in free thought (even as Swift opposed religious dissent!), that a Christian author could write such non-dogmatic fiction (i.e., if man was made in God's image, than what of the various superior races Gulliver encounters?) to be so eagerly consumed by a Christian audience. The vivid imagery, imagination, and multi-layered meaning of Gulliver's Travels is the perfect antidote to those who've recently suffered throughThe Pilgrim's Progress, as they make their way through the classics fromThe Well-Educated Mind."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is a highly intriguing story about a man who goes on many adventures to multiple different islands, each inhabited by a certian form of creature. The first island he arrives at has everything, except all of it is in miniture, including the people! on this island he is hailed as a powerful giant. This island is know as Lilliput. he escapes from Lilliput on a boat that washed up on the shore. The second island that he arrives on is populated by gigantic everything, trees,animals, people, and so forth. on this island he is captured and originnaly displayed for money and entertainment until he is bought by the queen. he escapes from this island in a miniture house that was made for him out of wood. this island was known as Brobdingnag. Once again, he journey to a distant island. this one is populated by people who are obsessed with music, math, and astromany. He leaves this island by way of a ship which takes him to Japan. His final voyage is to the land of the Houyhnhnms. This land is populated only by fully intelligent horses and creatures called Yahoos, which have many human aspects but have sharp claws and are somewhat violent. he takes his leave from this country with the help of the Houyhnhms, who aid him in making a canoe with a sail and paddle. That is a somewhat rough review of the main ideas of his journeys to multiple island on which he finds many strange things and learns multiple languages. I liked this book becauce of its sense of adventere and because of its many new, interesting ideas."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This was excellent. I didn't think I'd ever want to read Gulliver's Travels, the eighteenth century English satire by Jonathan Swift. But I couldn't put the book down. Now it was much a satire on the then current English royal system but what he writes can really almost be a satire on any political system. You can transpose it to be a satire on any American President."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Our hero Gulliver and his wife could use some counseling. It seems that every time he plops down on the sofa with his better-half and children, Gulliver gets restless and needs to go have another adventure. (Did they have sofas back then? If not, how did people crash out in front of their TV sets?) And he lives in idyllic old England, go figure!Each time he does this (gets the traveling jones) he hops aboard some ship, tantamount to suicide in those days, eats salted meat and spoiled porridge for a few weeks, months or years, (unless there is a Chili's or Olive Garden nearby along the way--but he always seems to forget his coupons,) generally shipwrecks and sooner or later encounters some bizarre form of intelligent life in whatever fairyland he has found for himself this time, in whatever chapter of the book he happens to be sojourning in at this particular intersection of the time-space continuum.Usually he is held captive, and then embosomed or exploited by whoever the freaks of nature are this time around, invariably escapes and by a series of miracles eventually finds his way home again, only to discover the same boring wife and children at the hearth waiting patiently despite the years that have passed without so much as a text message.Along the way we are treated to Swift's amazing writing, great humor, wit and stellar imagination. Highly recommended, but it takes a bit of work to get through the whole thing."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The book Gulliver's Travels, written by Johnathan Swift is a very good book for people of all ages from children to adults. This novel consists of four books, which tell of Gulliver's adventures he go on. In the first book, he goes to the town of the little people. Gulliver is the \\"big man\\" in this town, which gives him a lot of pride. He soon finds out that no matter how small the Liliputians are they can commit human sized vices. In book two Gulliver travels to the land of the giants. In this book, he knows sees what it's like to be little and everything is turned around for him. He is picked on and looses all his pride, which he tries his hardest to regain, but fails. In book three, he finds himself on the \\"floating\\" island of Laputa. This book is not a very great book but it still is interesting in some ways. In the last and final book, book four, Gulliver travels to the Island of the Houyhnhum's and Yahoo's. In this book, Gulliver begins to fall in love with the Houyhnum way of life. However, they consider Gulliver a Yahoo and will not let him interact with the Houyhnhum's. This novel was very good and entertaining. I would suggest this book to every reader."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It staggers me that a man could see this much of human nature, admit he saw it, write it down, publish it, and be allowed to die of old age. How did he ever get away with it? Our 21st century satirists seem cowardly in comparison. Who would dare suggest now, as Swift does, that we solve the bickering of Congressmen by sawing their brains apart and swapping halves with brains across the aisle? Attractive idea!For Swift, fantasy is a scalpel disguised as a diversion. Constructing elaborate fantasies allows him to confront the human truths we hide in plain sight. He seldom allows us to forget that our bodies, like our institutions, are a filthy stinking mess. Would a popular writer of the 21st century be allowed to be so scatalogical? How many readers today, who proudly consider themselves tolerant and open-minded, would put up with descriptions like that of the dog's death on page 170?The introduction and notes, by Robert Demaria Jr, are unusually helpful and graceful. There are often beautiful definitions from Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 and thus one's reading is littered with small satisfactions, like discovering that \\"new fangled\\" is a very old word.It's bizarre that we somehow managed to turn the first part of this book into a charming children's story. Maybe we just don't know what else to do with it - just as a tank is parked in a town square so that children can play on it."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is not now and never will be a book for children. Yes, the Lilliputians are enchanting, however, there are numerous crudities in the book. What you must understand is that this book is satire, not play. Read \\"A Modest Proposal\\" if you are unsure about what I am saying. Never take Swift from the surface, he requires a mighty dig into the historical background if you are to gain full measure of his genius.After seeing the movie, my daughter was telling her 8 year-old son that she would get the book for him to read. My husband and I nearly jumped out of our skins, telling her that \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is not appropriate for a child. I have read it many times.

I picked up an old dusty copy of this title at a book fair just so I could have this classic on my shelf. I was just out of college and not too interested in reading anything too boring and heavy. I figured I would scan through it just so I would be able to to say I read it and talk about it a little. What a surprise when I started reading- I couldn't put it down!It was the original version with the addition of footnotes that explained the political climate and other relevant facts of the day. I strongly suggest that you obtain a version with this information as without it you are missing 3/4 of the reading experience. I actually read the whole book twice just to try and pick up the funny, quirky things I might have missed. There are just so many levels to this book. On the surface it is a book about a man and his travels to strange faraway places. Underneath it is a scathing, comical, statement on the state of society and the movers and shakers of the day. I did not know that Jonathan Swift was a comic genius, but this is a fact you cannot miss if you read this book understanding the social satire weaved throught its chapters. I actually would find myself laughing out loud and being overcome with awe at the complexity of the humor the author was able to conjure."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is near-unique in world literature in that it can truly be enjoyed and appreciated by all. It has over the years been seen an adventure, a children's story, a travelogue parody, a political allegory, one of the first novels, and a satirical masterpiece. The book is all this and more, making it one of literature's ten or so truly immortal works, a towering monument as significant and important nearly three hundred years on as ever. It is one of the few books that absolutely everyone should read, and its peculiar greatness is that, perhaps alone among them, nearly everyone will love it.On the most obvious level it is a rollicking adventure. Swift's imagination is one of the most astounding ever; he invents an incredible diversity of unforgettable places and people, and millions have been enthralled by this alone. The book has even often worked as a children's story - sans crude and heavy elements of course. Those approaching it for the first time are in for a real joy. They simply will not know what comes next and will keep wondrously reading to find out.Those who really appreciate the novel, though, see that Swift was merely using the adventure frame as a vehicle for his philosophical and political views. Often called misanthropic, a deep distrust of humanity affected everything he did; he was sickened by brutality, avarice, pride, and other vices, which comes across clearly here in many ways. Gulliver unflinchingly depicts many of humanity's shortcomings without excuse or even sympathy; our irrationality, stupidity, ignorance, hypocrisy, and perhaps above all, arrogance are on merciless display. The true mockery is often not so much the horror of our actions as the pettiness of our motives. Despite the light-hearted device, a more fundamentally misanthropic and savagely satirical work has perhaps never been written. Anyone wanting shame-inducing proof of what fools human beings are need look no further.Yet it is possible to take this too far. As misanthropic as Swift was, he was also one of the era's great liberals - a fierce liberty champion and advocate for the repressed. Those who read closely can see that his hatred lay not with the downtrodden but with those who make them so - monarchs, politicians, judges, lawyers, and other unsavory types. He was sickened by humanity's inhumanity. The almost unbearably dark ending seems to have no hope for meliorism, and the book generally shows human life as an unbroken misery series. Stern Christianity kept Swift from the existential despair that haunted writers and intellectuals about a century and a half later, but one would be very hard-pressed to find a more despairing portrait of the human condition prior to the late nineteenth century.Again, though, this can be exaggerated. Some parts of the novel are truly light-hearted; there is a wealth of humor, not all of it satirical. There is also a great deal of charming whimsy. Most notable of all, though, is that Swift manages to convey his bitter pill through satire; this is worlds away from the gloomy realist works of the last century plus. Swift is universally known as the greatest English satirist and is one of the greatest ever; he knew how to convey harsh truths in palatable form. The satire ranges from thinly-veiled to subtle. Swift thus lets the real message arise naturally rather than overwhelming the story - a fine line that few can walk straight and that perhaps no one can do as well.The satire's sophistication has been fully recognized only relatively recently; Gulliver was indeed so far ahead of its time that it was perhaps not even possible for all its nuances to have been appreciated earlier. Careful readers will notice that Gulliver, as his name implies, is very gullible - at least at first, often not seeming to see the full import of what he says. However, he becomes ever more cynical and wizened, and the satirical frame gradually lessens to the point where most of part four is simply outright lashing - almost an essay in dramatic monologue form. Some have criticized this on artistic grounds, saying Swift got carried away or even that he began to lose sanity. However, it is clearly deliberate; the artistic control is stunningly precise. Swift knows how to draw us in, introducing his message gradually until we are so taken that we will keep reading even when hit hard. Such finely-wrought mastery has rarely been shown anywhere, much less in satire. This is also important in character development terms; Gulliver is a very complex - perhaps even unreliable - narrator of the type who did not really reappear until the twentieth century. Obvious as Swift's points are, the novel is thus ripe for deconstruction; the book can be interpreted in a near-endless variety of ways with widely different ramifications despite the clear core. This is a large part of the reason for its continuing popularity with critics as well as the public.Gulliver is a landmark in many other ways, not least in the novel's history. It was published in 1726, only seven years after Robinson Crusoe, which is generally called the first real Western novel. There is even good reason to think Swift began as early as 1720. Robinson is one of the few books even more popular than Gulliver, but the latter is far superior by any standard; it has virtually everything Robinson has plus far more. Novels of its depth and complexity were not normal for nearly another two centuries; that such a work came practically on the first novel's heels is truly incredible. Also highly noteworthy is how Swift manages to keep a realistic tone despite so many fanciful events - a task far harder than Defoe's with Robinson. This is of course part of the joke and also Swift's jab at the highly apocryphal travelogues then immensely popular; Gulliver is indeed in large part a parody of them, yet another interesting angle and one now nearly forgotten.The book is also of great historical value. The satire in many ways gives a more realistic glimpse into the important Enlightenment era than a realist work, or even a history, could ever hope to do. We get a good idea of the issues that dominated English, Irish, and European politics as well as other important social matters. Perhaps more importantly, we get a stark glimpse of the thoughts and customs that lead to the atrocities Swift condemns - an invaluable lesson from which we clearly still have much to learn.Last but not least, Gulliver is an English prose watershed. Swift defined good style as \\"proper words in proper places\\" - a seemingly simple, even asinine, definition but one that very few have successfully followed. His prose is plain and straight-forward, as Gulliver himself constantly reiterates, but in the best possible way; few works are so clear and concise. Thus, despite archaic spelling and punctuation, the book reads almost as well as ever; even casual readers who have almost no experience with classics, much less ones of this vintage, can pick it up with practically no trouble. Unlike nearly all classics, it need not be drastically edited, footnoted, and introduced for comprehension. This is hardly true of even many twentieth century works, to say nothing of ones nearly three centuries old. Gulliver is a major part of the reason Swift remains a model for anyone wanting unadorned but transcendently lucid English prose.Surely nothing more need be said. If one could read only five or ten books, this should be among them. Anyone who has not experienced its wonders should do so without delay.As for this edition, it is important to realize that, like other Dover Thrift entries, it is bare bones - only a short headnote besides the text. Anyone wanting more will need to look elsewhere, which may be a good idea for general readers, as many of the historical references will be missed. That said, the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is the must read satire that echoes down the years. Swift brilliantly deployed (even invented) many great satirical devices such as messing about with scale, using exaggeration to hold a mirror to ugly human foibles and making the mores of his contemporary society look rediculous. Packed with quirky travellers tales, notes from 17th century sea travel, games, playfullness and proto sci-fi worlds, Gulliver's travels is a compendium of literary genius to last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is one of the most famous works of satire ever written and since it is still popular after 279 years of captivating audiences, it ages like fine wine (like Mogan David).If you have been a victim by seeing the crappy 30's cartoon and believe that the great Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) has played you for chumps, fear not, for this book is grand. It is a satire like I said before but it is geniusly discuised as a children's book.Part 1: Voyage to Lilliput-the most popular segment of the classic and the part that the cartoon is based on. Lemuel Gulliver ends up on an island with small people and wakes up after the Lilliputians have tied him down. Satire of monarchy and rivalry between England and France (Lilliput and Blefuscu)Funniest part- Gulliver estinguishes Empress' palace by pissing on it!Part 2 Voyage to Brobdingnag- Gulliver ends up in land where people are 60 feet tall. Don't really know what Swift was satirizing here but the funniest part is where Gulliver is taken hostage by a giant monkey! HA HA!Oh no, I ain't going to reveal too much but I'll say that further voyages bring Gulliver to a floating island and a land where horses (Houyhnyms) are endowed with reason and beasts (Yahoos)are shaped like men. Gulliver ends up hating men and reflects Swift's own misanthropic thoughts near the end of his life when madness destroyed the greatest writer in all of English History.This was the best book I've read since On the Road by Jack Kerouac and since that great work was by the King of the Beatniks, that's saying something!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, probably the greatest novel, Hell, the greatest literary work from 18th century English Literature is read by children as an adventure story and by adults as a tongue in cheek satire of society which still is a perfect bullseye today. It has aged like fine wine and is funny and just a joy to read.The story is about ship's surgeon Lemuel Gulliver who travels to faraway lands. Well, I know what you are thinking, \\"Oh no, it sounds like those gay Lord of the Rings stories. I can remember the anguish of bordom when I tried to survive the first 20 pages of the book which teaches you what bordom is.\\" That book is of course, none other than the book you know very well as the one being at the top of great incineration bonfires-The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. BAAAD book. You were warned about that piece of caka so stay out, you understand? stay out! (Scatman Crothers in The Shining)Okay, Gulliver first goes to the land of Lilliput, where there are little people and the funniest part of the book is where there is a fire in the apartment of the Empress of Lilliput and Gulliver saves the day when he puts the fire out by...Pissing on it! HA! HA! Obviously that part of the story shows how much Swift hated monarchies.The best satire in the book is when Gulliver goes to an island which floats in the sky and meets very ignorant people there who always have to be slapped by people with a ball on a stick, which is a further satire on monarchy and since the island floats over the land it rules, it is genius satire saying that the rulers are always so far away from the people that they rule.The last part of the book is when Gulliver goes to a land where beasts are shaped like men and horses are endowed with reason. This shows that Swift was close to being a misanthropist, further proven by a letter written by him to fellow satirist Alexander Pope in which Swift said, \\"I hate and detest the animal called man...\\"Well, I've rambled on too much but this book is such a great read and a pure joy that it will make a raving fan out of you just like it made me. This book was so entertaining and funny packed with action and and genius satire, proving that Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was the greatest satirist who ever lived."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift, is an adventurous story with deeper political meaning than many realize. Written to appear historical and realistic, by directly enforcing the reader as the audience, these fanciful stories become believable. Currently becoming more apparent as a children's story, this story holds a much deeper meaning. The political satire that this author portrays is evident throughout the story. I could relate events in Swift's novel very easily to outside events, which proves that he purposefully set his story up as a political satire, full of social commentary. He wanted to accent on the political confusion and corruption that occurs, and successfully delivers this through an interesting, twisted plot. Overall, I feel that this book can be appreciated by many age groups because it can be taken on several different levels. I think there is still more I can learn about this book, but truly took it to heart to understand the majority of political satire that the author developed, and I appreciate Swift's attention to the audience and presenting the book through the perspective of Dr. Gulliver."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"No really suitable for reading to young kids but a timeless classic none the less.

GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is certainly among these immortal works, and I was delighted to return to Swift's masterpiece after more than forty years. Lacking the time to re-read the work in its entirety, I was content merely to listen to an eloquent delivery by David Hyde Pierce -- one that definitely did justice to the text.I must confess that this marked my first exposure (ever) to an audiobook (in whatever format), and I still miss the tactile sensation of turning pages. However, I might submit the same reservation about the books I read on my Kindle, as opposed to those I take off the shelf. That much said, the initial experience has proven most satisfactory. While it took me a short while to get accustomed to Pierce's voice, I soon made adjustment and found myself both enthralled and entranced as Gulliver worked his way through the four voyages. The process ran several weeks, in short installments, yet each left me anxious to hear the next.I suspect most of those reading this review have had much more experience than I with audiobooks, so I'll address concluding thoughts specifically to those unfamiliar with the medium. If GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can \\"work\\" as an aural literary experience, we may abandon any preconceived reservations. This is a splendid production.

He rejoices at speaking to Plato, glories at seeing the armies of Cesar and Alexander, but the more he sees of those that have founded the ruling families of his world the more convinced he is of the value of knavery.Finally he dwells a time among the Houyhnhnms a race of intelligent horses of such reason and virtue that they complete his descent into a state of cynical despair unable to function among humanity, but determined to write a true clear account of his travels.This edition of the book has few if any archic words or phrases making for a clear easy read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is very sad at the end.

It's a major classic and felt that I was missing out on something but having never read it. I love audiobooks and when I saw that this one was only 10 hours long I was thrilled. (It's quite short for an audiobook). Plus, I have read some of Swift's other works and am a fan of his satire.I was delighted to find out that a lot of modern pop culture references have ties to Gulliver's Travels. I think the most recent I've seen was a car commercial.While I did like the book overall, I couldn't help thinking \\"Dude! STOP GOING TO SEA!!!\\" Seriously, nothing good comes of him going to sea. He kept saying that he couldn't wait to get home to his wife and children, but a day or so after finally returning to them he'd leave again. I understand wanderlust, but what the what?I really liked the middle section (or his second trip to sea) where he finds himself on an Island with giants and is taken care of by a little girl. That section was so endearing. And I loved how adaptable he was. He could learn languages like woah. I'm jealous of that particular skill.I can see why this is a children's classic. There's a lot of adventure and far away lands. There's even a royal family. While there were some moments that I enjoyed poking a little fun at, it was an enjoyable book. The narrator also had an English accent which is always a plus for me. I listened to it a few nights right before bed and it lulled me right to sleep. That's what I enjoy the most about audiobooks."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I'm not sure what else can be said about this book that hasn't already been said. I'mout of clever things to say, I'm afraid. Jonathan Swift has always been a favorite but Ican't get over how clever his wordplay is throughout the novel. I really can'tget over how similar it is to Robinson Crusoe at times, especially when he's on the shipto Lilliput. Though his interaction with the Lilliputians wasn't the strongest section,you would be hard pressed to find equally clever interplay of parody and originality. Ican see why the book has been studied so carefully by scholars over the years. Wemeet Gulliver as a dreamy young man in search of adventure, trying to getanywhere that would involve sea travel and see him evolve masterfully. If I had toname the best section of the book, it would probably be the Laputians section, aplace I would greatly like to visit, because my own head is often stuck in the cloudsand to be able to study philosophy and mathematics all day--a dream. There was atime or two over the course of the novel that I felt Swift had gone overboard andmissed some opportunities to drive home his idea of what the ideal society should be.You, as the reader, are left to figure it out for yourself. This book is perfect if youlove thought-provoking literature from an objective, rational viewpoint, or ifyou dream about one day traveling the world yourself."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It was just what I ordered.

Gulliver becomes another surgeon along with Mr. Bates on the ship the swallow."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book was brilliantly written relating the human nature of the time. Whoever criticizes it for the lack of character development, does not fully understand the nature of the book. It is a satire, Swift purposely wrote as little as possible about the main character so we won't relate to him. His purpose was to compare the creatures he met on each of his voyages to the English government and politicians. Even though he was pretty accurate about the politics of the time, he was too negative. Yes, it is the human nature to be corrupt, greedy, selfish and all the other things he mentioned in his book. But people also express kindness, love and compassion and he failed to convey any of that in his work."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is original and you must read it.

These are just the beginning of Gullivers travels. I enjoyed this book although some parts were dull. I would recomend this book to young readers who have a good imagination."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"On a dreary January day, I ran across some old High School literature books and decided on re-reading Gulliver's Travels, this time for enjoyment rather than a grade.Now that I have a little more knowledge of European history than I did as a teenager, I did indeed enjoy a fair amount of the satire in Gulliver's voyages.However, I've got to say that his fourth book with the talking horses slowed me down so much I feared I wouldn't finish the book. Swift moved from satire to moaning and griping about everything human. Wasn't he a priest? I would've expected a man of God to at least have run across one or two worhty persons who might have uplifted him a little.The starry-eyed gushing over the Utopian horses and unrelentingly negative portrayals of mankind gets very old, very fast.

Lilliput is just another image of monarchy, but in no way different from what Swift knew. The criticism comes from the scale of the people who are extremely small. Brogdingnag does not change this approach, only the scale of the people who are extremely big, though in this case there is a direct criticism of the exploitation the grotesque Gulliver is the object of. Laputa, Balnibarbi and Luggnagg show a strange floating saucer in a kingdom dominated by unpractical scientists who try to do everything upside down. It is a satire of scientists in general who are so little concerned by the welfare of the community that they can ruin just for the sake of implementing their hypotheses. Glubbdubdrib is funnier because it enables Gulliver to meet all kinds of people from the past and this leads to remarks about philosophers or politicians or generals that show how small and little and even tiny they were. Japan only shows the extreme anti-christian policy that can be reached there and the extreme self-centeredness of the Dutch, which is probably a criticism of the crown in England. But the last voyage to the country of the Houyhnhnms is by far the best because here we reach both a severe criticism of the human race reduced to its animal instincts and behaviors, and a utopian society in which evil does not exist because it cannot even be conceived, because it is totally out of reach for these kind reasoning and reasonable horses. And yet Gulliver is expelled because he is a Yahoo, no matter what, and the natural reason of these dominant horses leads to rejection, after having found in Gulliver&#65533;s explanations a solution to get rid of the Yahoo by sterilizing them into extinction, just the way men do with horses in European countries, just a little bit more systematically. This leads to the idea that genocide and ethnic cleansing is a natural attitude, an attitude that goes along with natural reason that says that the species standing in the way of reason have to be exterminated. But the book never reaches that level of thinking, since Swift could not know about such policies that will flourish in later centuries, and yet the Irish occupation should lead him to some idea of what such a principle can lead to. Thus at a second level of reading we find a criticism of natural reason though it is not fully expressed and developed. After all it is that natural reason that led, already in Swift&#65533;s times, to the genocide of Indians in America : they were not human, they were attributed all kinds of shortcomings like aggressivity, the love of war, the lack of cleanliness, a strong stench, and many other elements of the type. We can even note that beyond the genocide, the sterilisation policy will be implemented, but not on males, rather on females, and this in some US states up to the 1950s and maybe the 1960s. And this policy initiated by the Scandinavians in the early 20th century (and it was to last at least fifty or sixty decades) was to be systematically used against physically or psychologically impaired people. Hitler will follow that model, pushing it one bit further. In a way the book becomes then some vision of the future. This book hence is a prefiguration of many other books on the subject, such as The time Machine , Brave New World , Animal Farm , etc. This book seems to be the archetype of a literary genre in English literature, and of course the archetype of many films dealing with the same subject, particularly extraterrestrials.To conclude I will say that such a book is definitely not for children even if it is often assigned to young children in some schools.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Satire is a staple of comedy shows on cable tv. However, the greatest satirist of the English language is not to be found in hilarious monologues on television. His name is Jonathan Swift. Swift was an Irish born bishop from Dublin who lived from 1667 to 1775. In his greatest piece of fiction \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" we see him as he punctures human prejudice, hatred, warfare and petty political bloviating!The story is told through the pen of Dr. Lemuel Gulliver who is a ship's surgeon. Gulliver is gullible! Like Voltaire's Candide he learns through his outlandish travels the fraility of the human species.Gulliver is shipwrecked on the island of Lilliput where the people are no more than six inches tall. He is a sense of wonder to the little people having never seen a person who is so tall. The islanders call himQuinbus Flestrin or Great Man Mountain. Gulliver puts out a fire in the palace of the Queen by urinating on the burning building! He defeats the fleet of an enemy nation and is charged by treason by a faction at court.Swiftian satire grills modern political faction by discussing the conflicts between the High Heels and Low Heels and the Big Egg Endians and the Little Egg Endians. He is poking fun at the London government.Gulliver flees the island for England being reunited with his long suffering wife and family. The Lilliputians are as small minded as are people in our own society.His next trip takes him to a land the exact opposite of Lilliput. Thegood Gulliver is shipwrecked and lands on an island. He is in a corn field forty feet high being threshed by giants. He is picked up by a farmer who takes him home in his pocket. Gulliver is given as a boy toy to the farmer's kind daughter Glumdalditch. He is in the land of giants known as Brobdingnag. He is later adpoted as a pet by the Queen. He is terrorized by mice, a vicious monkey and always fears falling out of the little box house which has been built for him. He learns the language of the kingdom but longs for home. After a terrible two years he is rescued when a bird picks up his box home with him in it and carries him out to sea where he is rescued. He returns home to England a wiser man.Gulliver's third voyage account is the last of the four sections of the book written by Swift.It takes the gullible seadog from Nottinghamshire to the floating island of Laputa. The Laputans care only for music and mathematics. They are normal sized individuals who care nothing for the gentle emotions but are only interested in science and intellect. Servants hit them with huge bladders to keep them from their abstract musings. They have no practical abilities. They rule over their colonyBalnibarbi. They are quick to suppress any revolt against their powerThe Laputans hurl huge rocks on their colony if any word is heard of revolt.In this third part of the novel Gulliver finds time to visit Glubbdugdrib an island of sorcerers. Gulliver asks them to call up from the realm of the dead such luminaries as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar. Hannibal and Pompey the Great. Gulliver discovers that the history is the books is often not the real history which was lived. History is a pack of lies.Gulliver also encounters a race of immortals with the odd name of theStrulbrugs. Gulliver learns to his dismay that though they live for all time they grow weaker, uglier and more cynical with the passing years. One wonders what he would think of our culture which glorifies youth?The fourth and final voyage of Gulliver occurs as he sails from England in 1710. Gulliver has become a captain but his crew mutinies and puts him in a small boat on the big ocean. He struggles to another weird island where he is captured by Yahoos who are ape-like inhabitants of this filthy land. He is rescued by the horse creatures who rule the land. They are called Houyhnhnms. They are an outstanding race of rational and kindhorses whom Gulliver comes to love. They view Gulliver as a Yahoo and he is banished from their paradise. Gulliver had earlier related to their king how cruelty and power politics is the norm in European civilization. He is set adrift in the sea where he is rescued by a ship from Portugal commanded by the kind captain Pedro de Mendez.After this fourth and final voyage Gulliver has become a misanthrope who prefers the company of horses to humans. He is upset at the cruelty of humankind to animals and one another. Gulliver began as an innocent optimist but the book ends with its view of a very disillusioned man.Gulliver's Travels can be read at many levels but at its core is a savage indictment of man's cruelty to man. Jonathan Swift was a pacifist and a kindly churchman. One shudders to think what this prophetic sage would think of our world today!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is an excellent book, no doubt about it. However, the edition is not so good. My copy, which is several years old, has yellowed considerably, and the print is small, so it does not make a very comfortable read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"As one of those students across the country required to read this novel, I remain another who has found in it rather impressionable and powerful qualities, rather than just another old and redundant \\"classic\\". It's calling the kettle black, I know, but sometimes you have to say \\"well, there's a reason it's a classic\\".Sure, the beginning sections are a bit tedious what with Swift giving us impeccable detail of ships and wood and rope, etc... It actually took me about a week to get to the middle of the book because it wasn't grabbing me in the way I expected it to. I also have mild case of ADD, meaning I'm not likely to stick with a book - any book - for longer than 45 minutes at a time.It's amazing, the amount of degrees I reversed by Part 3. I read most of the reviews here and to my surprise, found that Parts 1 & 2 are among the more popular in Gulliver's Travels. In contrast, while I found Parts 1 & 2 certainly action-packed, the image left in my mind is one less vivid, less clear, and less meaningful than the latter parts.I honestly wasn't looking forward to this read. For some reason a satiric account of human nature and society as told by some sort of pirate did not appeal to me, which is completely outlandish seeing as I'm a huge fan of satire and non-fiction. In fact, I'm finding Pride & Prejudice much more grueling than any \\"part\\" of Gulliver.I must say this has been one of the very few novels the school has required us to read that left an actual impact on me, and I miss the feeling it gave and the warmth that resonated."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"A common misconception about this famous book is that it is just a kid's story about some guy's adventures with tiny people in Lilliput. I guess you can blame that on popular movies and TV (although a recent telemovie with Ted Danson was not so far off the mark).The reality is much richer. This is one of the greatest pieces of satire and social commentary ever written. Lilliput is just one of the places visited by Gulliver. Other societies visited by Gulliver help illustrate the failings perceived by Swift in his own culture of the early 1700s.Cruelty to animals, bureaucracy, government and human injustices are just a few of the issues targeted.Don't let the social commentary I've outlined put you off. Although this book was published in 1726, &quot;to vex the world rather than divert it&quot;, Swift is very readable today. The book is full of humor, and can be read as a simple adventure fantasy.Even without footnotes the book is very accessible, but an edition with footnotes will make some of the more obscure references and humor easier to appreciate.As for the social commentary, sadly much of it is as relevant today as it was when the book was written."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I like that this edition preserves the original 18th Century spelling, punctuation and grammar. Too many editions modernize or Americanize the text. The notes at the back are helpful but not intrusive. And it has an overall feel of quality, even though a paperback.I own upwards of 30 editions of Gulliver and this is the one I refer to most often when I need to check a citation or another point of information. I also recommend it immediately to anyone asking for an informative edition. It helps that it is inexpensive and in-print, but it would be my recommendation even if it was harder to come by."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Many would bring some escapist fiction like Robinson Crusoeor Swiss Family Robinson which tell of ways to deal withsuch a situation. I choose Gulliver's Travels. Gulliver,thanks to the inventiveness and satire of Swift, manages toescape numerous times from many uncharted locales. While Imay never run into Lilliputians or the like, at least I'llhave optimism and the knowledge that I leave my impressionwherever I go."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels has some amusing and even a few insightful bits, but Swift was no Voltaire. A satire not so much on some particular human follies as on man as such, this book is basically a monument to misanthropy---as is made painfully clear in the heavy-handed fourth part. Not that satire has to be subtle, but it should at least be accurate, at most an exaggeration of the truth rather than a projection of one's own bitter prejudices. Swift's portrayal of human society, even as imperfect as it was (and even more so in his time than now), is at best one-sided. It ends with the narrator repulsed by the smell of his wife, and disgusted with himself for ever having coupled with her and brought children into the world. If you can sympathize with that sentiment, then you might find Swift's satire to be penetrating and clever. If, on the other hand, you see any value in human life and hold it to be more important than the vice and suffering that necessarily characterize some part of it, then you might be better off reading something else."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It took me a while to get to this book - it kept being recommendedby friends, but I was a bit put off by the effort I thought I would have toput into reading a book written 300 years ago. Well, I was really suprised -\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is easier to reads, and is certainly writtenmuch better, than most modern novels. Swift certainly didn'thave too high an opinion about humanity, but rarely washe heavy handed. Thus he is entertaining even when he ispreachy.I agree that the book was so popular because it succeeded onso many different levels. It must have been outstanding politicalsatire in its time (the full effect has, not surprisingly, diminishedover time). However, it also reads well as a parody of travelliterature, a fairy tale, or speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I'm not going to get into the whole &quot;Is this great literature&quot; debate with this novel. If you don't think already this novel is a masterpiece, nothing I say is going to convince you otherwise. This edition, though, is well worth picking up. It preserves the orthography and other quirks of Swift's prose and includes an intriguing, though a bit abrupt (as though written on deadline) &quot;introduction&quot; by Jeanette Winterson, who puzzlingly preoccupies herself with the Houyhnhnms at the expense of the other parts of the novel."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I recently read Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. It is an interesting and different kind of novel. Gulliver is a ship's surgeon who journeys to several different places around the world. Gulliver first adventures to Lilliput, which is inhabited with six-inch humans who are characterized as \\"odious vermin\\". In Book two, he is in Brobdingnag, the land of the physical and moral giants. Thirdly, he lands on Laputa where science and reason live. Gulliver's final voyage leads him to the land of the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos. Here he discovers the use of perfect reasoning from the horse-like Houyhnhnms and the crude and undesired manner of the human-like Yahoos. Gulliver is a simple, objective character that we can easily trust. As his name would reveal, he is very gullible. Through each of his travels Gulliver reports to us as if we were as gullible as he is. He is incapable of reasoning unlike the Houyhnhnms whom he admires greatly. Swift uses satire a great deal in order to point out human weaknesses. Swift wrote this book during the Age of Reason in which science and technology were used to solve all problems. Throughout much of this book, especially while Gulliver is in Laputa, Swift uses satire to point out that scientific pursuits can not morally save us."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is supposedly an annotated edition, with critical commentary. You may want something like that, as I did -- an annotated text where you could read the editor's notes as you go through the novel, learning historical and literary background to the text as you read it. Great -- except the Kindle edition doesn't let you read the notes! You see the tantalizing asterisks -- so you know, for certain, that a commentator has appended some information on philosophical, political, or literary background -- but you can't see it! If you want the notes and commentary, you need to buy the hard-copy print edition. There is no reason whatsoever to buy this Kindle edition (an un-annotated one is available for much, much less money)."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Swift's Gulliver's Travels is one of the smartest British novels ever written. It is a funny, sharp, poignant, and startling look at human nature. The most interesting part of the novel is the many conversations between Gulliver and the Houyhnhnm master relating to the causes of war and other aspects of human nature. This novel is a wonderful reflection of human society that really makes the reader question his or her methods or discourse."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"There is no need for me to go into what a marvelous and timeless classic &quot;Guliver's Travels&quot; is. The satire, while nearly 300 hundred years old, is as fresh today as it was in the 1720s.What I will say about this particular edition is that it is very beautifully done. (If you can get the hardcover edition instead of the softcover, all the better.) The typeset, color engravings and supplemental material in the appendices add up to an excellent edition of this classic. I highly recommend it either as a gift or as a copy for your own library."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is perhaps the best known of a classical satires, following the adventures of Lemuel Gulliver on multiple journeys all of which serve his objective of profiling the moral (and physical) fragility of mankind, with special care taken to point out problems associated with hubris and war (Swift was an extreme pacifist.) This edition of the book features commentary and notes by Robert DeMaria which are helpful putting the book in context, especially for those deficient in knowledge of English political history. As an aside, the textual notes are so numerous, that footnotes would have been vastly more functional to the reader than endnotes, nevertheless, the commentary is largely on the mark and helpful.The book is written in four parts, of which most students are only exposed to part one, as I was previously. In part one, Gulliver ventures to Lilliput, where he is a giant among men, the Lilliputians being very small. He is in fact referred to as \\"Quinbus Flestrin,\\" or, the \\"Man-Mountain.\\" Part one is essentially about political strife in England, and directly skewers the Walpole government with the character of Flimnap. One of the issues for readers will be keeping a running account of all the over-the-top names Swift uses throughout the book (Houyhnhnms, Traldragdubb, Balnibarbi, Brobdingnag, etc.) The notes explain how these are clever, playful words satirizing specific people or things in Europe as it then was, but I must admit to finding them a bit wearisome to wade through after a few hundred pages. Perhaps the most recognizable of the satirized states is Blefuscu, a dead ringer for France. These are minor inconveniences to endure to read one of the greatest works of satire (and allegory) ever written, though I think Swift tops this in the pure satire department with \\"A Modest Proposal.\\"Part two has Gulliver in a role-reversal as he ventures to Brobdingnag where he is now small relative to the population. He is exploited and used as entertainment, but is cared for by the young Glumdalclitch, who becomes his tutor as well. Throughout the book Swift uses extremely expressive language (\\"She would craunch the Wing of a Lark, Bones and all, between her Teeth...\\") and displays an unfortunate predilection for describing human waste production (I actually considered titling the review \\"Obsession With Excrement\\" but decided to leave that to a future student's dissertation in psychology.) This section highlights the parallels between Swift and the equally brilliant, though much less known work, \\"The Monikins\\" by James Fenimore Cooper from 1835. I believe that part two is the most pointed towards government with passages like \\"You have clearly proved that Ignorance, Idleness, and Vice are the proper Ingredients for qualifying a Legislator\\" (pages 122-123.) Later he similarly skewers lawyers (most notably on page 229, and in the information provided in the \\"Textual Notes\\" on page 303,) a feature of the book I enjoyed immensely.Section three is the weakest of the four, and also the last written. It concerns Gulliver's adventures with the flying island, Laputa, and while comparatively weak, is delightfully whimsical. A favorite example is on page 150 where the serving methods of foods are discussed (\\"...a Shoulder of Mutton, cut into an Equilateral Triangle...,\\" etc.) One other note I will make about the book is the very unconventional (by modern standards) capitalization, italic usage, and spelling. DeMaria explains his process for cleaning up the text which is admirable in its purity, though I would have been more pleased if he had applied contemporary conventions of font use at least. Also of note is the fact that Swift himself is irritating in his very irregular and inconsistent spelling and punctuation.Part four is my personally least favorite, as it quickly devolves into what could today be seen as a socialist fantasy world of the Houyhnhnms, horses who rule wisely and justly over the savage and detestable Yahoos (humans.) This part drags, and turns to human self-loathing very rapidly (Gulliver can't even stand the smell of his wife when he returns to England, preferring the odor of his stable, for one example of many.) While I grasp the satirical points that Swift was attempting to make in this part, it falls short for me, although it does make his pacifist bent quite clear. Part four makes the points that Swift sets out to make, and on that level it is successful, I just don't think all the points he seeks to make are valid.Overall this in combination with \\"A Modest Proposal\\" (an essay from 1729 which suggests that the Irish eat their own children) are the most famous works of satire ever written, and should be read by any serious student of English literature or history."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Even though the Lilliputians part of the book is the most popular, I enjoyed part 4 the most. I liked how Swift placed another animal higher than humans, showing that we end up at the bottom in the end. I also like how he had Gulliver change due to his stay with the Houyhnhnms."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is, along with &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, one of Jonathan Swift's infamous understated, biting satires. At the very least edgy, and often outright misanthropic, Swift's writing is not for the optimist. However, his writing here is both brutally honest and imaginative, always delivered with a straight face. It's a clever book, and his adventures are always interesting. As simply fantasy, the book also succeeds - it raises many points about the situations Gulliver gets himself into that a lesser writer would never have thought of.The only real disadvantage of &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; (and the reason it only gets four stars) is the occasionally excessive prose. One section in particular during Gulliver's stay at the Floating Island is almost a sedative, and these parts show up often enough to make the reading an occasional chore. Nevertheless, this is still one of the best satirical novels around, and the story is entertaining on its own. It could have used some editing, but it's very good regardless."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Lemuel Gulliver is a surgeon/ships captain who embarks on several intriguing adventures. His first endeavor takes him to Lilliput, where all inhabitants are six inches tall, but resemble normal humans in every other respect. His next voyage lands him on Brobdingnag, where a grown man is sixty feet tall, and even the shortest dwarf stands thirty feet tall. On his third trip, he travels to several locations, including a floating island. During Gullivers final voyage, he is abandoned by his mutinous crew on the island of the Houyhnhnms, which are extremely intelligent horses. No evil or concept of lying exists among these creatures. The island is also inhabited by Yahoos, savage, irrational human-like creatures who are kept as pets by the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver wishes to spend the rest of his life on this peaceful island, but he is banished and forced to return to England.I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to people 14 or older. Since the novel was written in the 1700&iexcl;s, the words, grammar and usage are a little confusing. The reader also must have prior knowledge of 18th-century politics to get a full image of what Swift is trying to convey. At some points, the author goes into detail about nautical terms and happenings, and that tends to drag. Overall, the book is well-written, slightly humorous, if not a little confusing."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Jonathan Swift&#65533;s 18th century satire, Gulliver&#65533;s Travels, is an extraordinary tale of the adventures of an English ship surgeon. The ship surgeon, Gulliver, by a series of unfortunate events on each of his four voyages at sea, receives the chance to explore the cultures of the countries of Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, Balnibarbi, Glubbdubdrib, Luggnagg and the land of the Houyhnhnms. Each land is considerably different from the others, and creates quite an entertaining read.While the story itself is particularly unusual, the satirical element which Swift applied to it adds another level of comprehension. If understood, one could have a nice chuckle at the way Swift mockingly portrays ideas and people through the various cultures which Gulliver encounters. Some similes, however, are intended to get a more serious meaning across. For example, in his first journey of the book, Gulliver finds himself in the country of Lilliput where the people are only six inches tall, save the king who is seven. In this land there are two groups which were distinguished by which side a person breaks their eggs on. One king published an edict commanding all his subjects to break their eggs on the small side, but many would&#65533;ve picked death over breaking their eggs on the &#65533;wrong&#65533; side, so many did. By this, Swift meant to throw contempt on the exaggerated importance that people place on their differences, as on which side one breaks an egg is a very trivial thing. The two groups mentioned represent the Catholic and Protestant religions, between which were many wars and massacres during the 1500&#65533;s when the Protestants first appeared.Gulliver&#65533;s Travels takes the reader to many lands, all different and unique &#65533; each adding another perspective on traditional beliefs and ways of thinking. Gulliver changes as much as the scenery around him, and after each voyage he has changed dramatically. At the end he has transformed so much that I feel really sorry for his family &#65533; although it&#65533;s only love that could allow them to put up with his strange behaviors.I would recommend this book to anyone with an appetite for literature, as Gulliver&#65533;s Travels is an excellent satire of the ways of the thinking in the early 1700&#65533;s. Also, the author does a good job in describing the lands which Gulliver visits in great detail. Although Swift may not have written this book with intense action scenes and steamy romance, it is definitely a work worthy of the people of today."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The Oxford World Classics version of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels is excellent. There are copious notes explaining the political and social backgrounds to this masterpiece of satire, and Professor Rawson's introduction presents the details of Swift's life in clear and succinct language. In his examination of Swift's method and direction, Rawson discusses the ambiguities of Swift's \\"travel book\\" and his changeable, unreliable character,Gulliver, as he encounters and is affected by the different societies. There is a useful bibliography for further study."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"In this story, Lemuel Guilliver, a career ship surgeon, writes a travel journal about his fantastic voyages on the high seas. His commercial ventures never worked out as planned, either a storm or mutiny ending them before returning to England, but each time he had the good fortune of landing on an island unexplored by Europeans. On these islands he runs into a variety of natives--giants, 6&quot; tall people, people who reside on a flying island, and horses that take human-like Yahoos as pets. Each is an interesting and entertaining story in its own right and without reading any deeper into the story, but that is not why this book is a classic.The author, Jonathan Swift, was a master of satire. As an Irishman he despised British rule and resisted it through his writing. Because criticism of the crown and Parliament was a punishable offense, Swift projected the personalities and social events of the day into fictional characters in imaginary circumstances with wonderful effect. While telling a terrific fictional story, he was able to rail against the system and really make a name for himself as a satirist.The one problem with reading a satire that is dated, is that many of the characters and social events about which the author wrote are obscured by the passage of time. I consider myself to be fairly well acquainted with British history and its major players, but without the assistance for excellent footnotes, I would have missed a tremendous amount in this story. It still would have been great without the footnotes, but would not have provided the same historical lesson, which is why I would recommend a version with a good introduction and footnotes regardless of why you are reading the story and how well you feel you know the history of Swift's era.I liked this book quite a bit, though I agree with many other reviewers who think it might by a little much for younger readers. In cartoons, picture books, or movies, it can be dumbed down to a cutesy fairy tale, which is fine and will hopefully encourage children to read the real story later in life, but an unabridged version will be boring and go right over their heads. I think it is an excellent book for adults who like fantasy fiction or readers who usually like historical or political non-fiction, as it is an excellent review of Swift's times."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I never read this book before although I saw the film in several occasions.

This preoccupation with critics and detractors, of course, serves only to enforce distance between the reader and the plot. It is impossible to lose oneself in the story when you are constantly being alerted to the reservations that others have. Be prepared for that when you read it. Also, the language is not modern.I recommend this book to people who love to read and discuss in living rooms and park benches.

The first voyage to Liliput is the most charming as it is used the play of proportions .Gulliver is a giant among the people so small that they look like&quot;tiny animals &quot;. The liliputans represent the weak creature who yet has much courage , inventedness and curiosity in the face of the danger . Their moral smalness suggest that nomatter the size , man is a political animal and at the same time the emptiness of public grandour of which swift laughs ironically.As an examle , the qualities required for officers in the state to obtain a social position:ballancing on the rope ; the desire of getting as many titles as possible . Gulliver became an embarassment because of his good consumption of food . His enemies wanted to put him to death . His punishment is changed to blinding . Their thinking is selfish . His carcasses will be smaller at his death and less likely to produce infections in the country ; by starving him he will be smaller . the idea is that where political action is in question , morality has nothing to do with the matter . - Lilliput shows the smallness in man , his pride in money , his political uselessness .THE SECOND VOYAGE -Gulliver himself makes in his comments some links between the first and the second voyage . They are linked on the very device they are based: the relative size . The device is a satiric one . - the brobdingnags are large men and as a result of this we see clearly our phisical graceness . - Gulliver has to face different degrating physical adventures . - He is put in a cage like an animal . - Swift let us understand that physical size means moral largeness . Giants are generous , warm and human . The Brobningnag will remanin an ideal in this respect , as they are reffered to in the last chapter of the book . - B. is not a perfect state ; it has beggars and men who exploit others . The B. visited by Gulliver is fortunate in its monarch , who unlike the emperor in Liliput , is very good with his subjects . He refuses to accept Gulliver\`s offer of the secret of the gunpowder ; he is an enlighted king who loves his people and wants to do his best for his subjects moral and physical state .THE 3RD BOOK - it was in fact the last book to be written by swift . It is not so closely connected with the other two and thus it is less satisfactory . - presents the flying island of Laputa . - the island has a politcal reference . what is satirized is the abstract thinking . People are normal in size , but distorted in physical appearance . - they have no eye for the outworld ,for reality . - their human shape is distorted by their loss of human quality ; they live in a world of phantasy . - the capital prooduce a certain atmosphere in which man\`s activity is replaced by the chance of a machine . - the excessive intellectualism of the flying island led to separation from the real world .THE 4TH BOOK- Guliver is in relation with the Yakoo\`s bodies on one side and horses rational mind on the other side . The 4th voyage with its theme differing creatures is a synthesis of both reason and passion . Gulliver stresses strongly on the physical unpleasantness of the Yahoos and their habits , which are a version of all passion for jewel and gold . They are the corrupt passion entirely divorced from the reason . -"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Although not enrolled in the satire class at my high school, I had become fascinated by Gulliver's Travells when I heard some of my friends discuss it. I was not disappointed. It is animated and easy to read, with some moments hysterically funny. Engaging and thought-provoking, I often found myself reconsidering my notions of our society in the light of Swift's portrayal of man as absurd, irrational, &amp; cruel. Nevertheless, I don't believe Swift had an intense distaste for the idea or ideals of humanity per se, rather a repulsion at what state humanity had let itself regress into. I thought this was the best English example of the genre (my favorite satire is Candide). This book is a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone seriously thinking about his or her identity as a human being."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I just finished reading this novel.

Swift's dark, pointed prose leaves little doubt about his feelings towards human society, and the loathsome creatures that comprise it. His withering condemnation of everyday life and people (repeated with increasing intensity after each voyage abroad), continues to resonate today. Who hasn't occasionally cursed the filthy Yahoos, without whom life would be so much more pleasant?It's difficult to miss the inherent hypocrisy that goes along with this view. Just one of the drawbacks of being a Yahoo; none of us are innocent of those things we despise most in others."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Our son-in-law had this book on his wish list.

If you remove the fairy tale element and actually listen to the political and ethical issues raised in the commentary, it really hits home. Well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Michael West &quot;That a weak diseased body, a meagre countenance, and sallow complexion are the true marks of noble blood; and a healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful quality in a man of quality, that the world concludes his father to be a groom, or a coachman.&quot; This quotation is an excellent example of how much Swift loathed the nobility and monarchies, which existed during his life. Throughout the book he uses parodies, analogies, or satire to demonstrate his beliefs making for a wonderful novel that is difficult to stop reading. Gulliver's Travels is without a doubt a book not intended to be a children's story, but since Swift wrote the story with a child-like plot, people miss Swift's intent to satirize the time in which he lived. Only once one reads this novel as an adult does one realize the scornful satire on man. The unfortunate protagonist of the story is named Gulliver whom goes on four adventures to uncharted and mystical lands. The first story starts out in a place called Lilliput, a country of people one-twelfth the size of Gulliver. These people resemble the British, and his enemies there are his enemies in real life. Also, there is an empire called Blefuscu that is the French, the mortal enemies of the British. One of the best parts of this book is his analogy to the history of religious controversy in England that made Catholicism illegal. This is shown with the Big Endian and Little Endian controversy of which a former emperor (Henry VIII) cut his finger while cutting an egg on the big end, therefore making cutting the big end of the egg illegal. Part one is filed with classic satire and is immensely entertaining to read, all the while Swift added pieces that were anti-nobility. In part two, one of the major themes is avarice, and people are willing to become affluent at the expense of someone else's life. Swift implies that Gulliver is shown around as if he were part of a freak show. This is because the giants at Brobdingnag are twelve times the size of Gulliver, enabling Swift to continue the child-like appearance of the book. After the monarchs buy him, he tells them of England and the king is horrified by the boorish behavior of Europeans, and especially the nobility constantly promoting killing to further their own ends. Evidently, Swift is insulting the vulgar nature of man in seventeenth century Europe. Part three is basically a general insult to Europeans, whom at this time were only concerned with music and math. He was attempting to point out the blindness of Europe, and to show them there are other interesting things in life. When there was a mathematical mistake in the making of his clothes by the Laputians, this may have been aimed at Newton, because Swift was severely disenchanted with Newton for making a positive report on William Wood's coinage in Ireland of halfpence. (The halfpence had been constructed of poor quality copper). Obviously, Swift maintains the hilarious, vitriolic satire making the novel an instant classic. Lastly, Swift writes about the Houyhnhnms, horses, which act as people do, but are far superior. Here he insults humanity in general through the superior Houyhnhnms, calling Yahoos (humans) boorish, vile, despicable, and cruel, especially lawyers. Part four is probably the most caustic attack upon humans and the nobility, therefore making it the most entertaining piece of the book. However, the book throughout is entertaining and will keep anyone's attention, regardless if they see through the satire or not. Even though Gulliver's Travels is a magnificent novel, it can be hard to read, due to Swift having used his colossal vocabulary to a maximum. However, Swift also has context clues in the sentences allowing the reader to understand what he means some of the time, but on occasion a dictionary is incredibly useful. For example, Gulliver stated, &quot;I lay in a profound sleep, by the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.&quot; The words, &quot;into my liquor,&quot; help the reader understand infused means to pour into. On the plus side, reading the novel enhanced my vocabulary astronomically with words such as declivity, draught, intrepidity, victuals, infused, and many more. Another potential problem is that Swift's satire can be obscure, and the audience may not understand what the characters are truly speaking about. However, those of us who know the history of Great Britain unequivocally will have no problem reading the novel. Fortunately, to counteract this difficulty, most copies of Gulliver's Travels have notes on specific parts of the novel because the publishers felt obliged to make it more readable. Another realistic problem is the reader may become infuriated by the repeated insults on human nature. Although Swift was correct, some people might stop reading, and this would be a disastrous mistake. One must realize that he is attempting to help civilization through caustic satire, because the whole point of satire is to expose, attack, or deride vices. If the reader can get past these three problems, it will be clear sailing, and the reading will be enjoyable and insightful. Jonathan Swift was remarkable in his ability to see the misgivings of human nature and offer insights on how to correct these definitive problems. Swift also made the novel amazingly readable and enthusiastically interesting to read. Plus, while keeping the reader enthused, he broadened the horizons of the reader's vocabulary. That is important not only for everyday life, but for national exams also. While Swift gave an important message that there are things wrong with the world in the eighteenth century, these problems still exist today. He informs the reader that war is evil and only brings about the deaths of many of our own kind for very few, if any important reasons. Also, he explained the malicious, avarice type nature of yahoos (humans) which inevitably bring about the demise of great civilizations. Finally, a problem that is very rare today, is the existence of monarchies. An absolute monarchy will have a propensity to be corrupt bringing evil and harm to all. Everything he says is true, and Swift deserves the utmost respect for writing this wonderful novel. Anyone who reads this book will surely be amazed at Swift's insight, and it should be required reading for years to come."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"**This review pertains to this specific Kindle edition**Well, this version is at least properly formatted, as opposed to one of the others, however it lacks a TOC and illustrations.

I wanted to relax before starting a more serious book so I semi-arbitrarily chose Gulliver's Travels, since I knew it was a classic and I hadn't read it before. It was a good read, but the book also made me think some about some of the political points Swift makes in the book.I wasn't really prepared for all the satire that is in his book though I did know it's one of the first political satires on the government at that time. The book was great to read though. It was interesting and usually funny and the different races the traveler meets are creative twists on re-thought things.Throughout the book, the author makes fun of opulent lifestyles and courts (at Lilliput), of people who are always looking for the next 'big thing' (at Laputa) and then reflects on how awful the human race is by comparing it to a fictional race of horses on an island (called Huoyhnmhnms). All in all it's interesting to read his take on human vices such as greed and also how he presents the other races and how they deal with these problems.But the book doesn't just talk about how awful humans are. It's also actually a good read that relates the adventures of Jonathan Swift, an adventurer from England, who, from many upsets and an insatiable thirst for adventure, discovers many new lands and spends years in each one.One of the things I thought was most unrealistic about the book was how quickly the traveler learned each language. Phrases like 'within four months I was able to understand almost everything, and speak tolerably well' don't strike me as what happens from someone who is learning language (And I've learned one foreign language and I'm in the process of learning another). Anyways, it's not a big part of the story, but I thought the author could have given more information about the language of each race that Gulliver discovers.But for a fun fiction read, the book is very good, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I can see why it has become a classic and I would like to read it again in the future (When I've worked through my massive reading list.More reviews at Into the Book .net"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Still a good story even after so many years, plus it's free!!

I am sure that I missed a lot of the venom which was aimed at the society and government at that time but I was able to certainly see how furious Swift was towards his intended biting satire. True, the novel has a lot of material that children would enjoy but it also possesses a lot of adult themes and a cruel streak which I found funny and a bit alarming.

The later two are more interesting ideas for alternative fantasy settings but are bogged down by too much preaching.There is a gem in here for Studio Ghibli fans, the third voyage was inspiration for a popular Ghibli movie."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Jonathan Swift, - satirist, churchman, reformer, - is perhaps one of the greatest satirists of all time. &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, his masterpiece, demonstrates the full breadth of his ingenious and far-sighted critique of almost the entire social order of his time, which included the Enlightenment belief in progress, reason and science, as well as the system of government. Critics have gone so far as to interpret him as a libertarian, an anarchist, even a nihilist, as he tended to see how even the highest ideals of civilisation, its most august institutions, were actually the products of barabarism. Like many men of his generation, including Alexander Pope, Swift believed in the &quot;retournons du nature&quot;, though nature was not seen as equivalent to the unchaining of passion and the blind gratification of appetite, but as something that was achieved through effort and discipline. The humour is bawdy and sometimes coarse, no less than that of Rabelais, such as the scene in Lilliput in which the giant Gulliver puts out the fire in the queen's tiny palace by urinating on it. Altogether, the book is an amusing and marvellous satire. Religion, however, is the one topic that Swift, being an ecclesiastic, refrains from subjecting to criticism."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can be looked at from at least two different viewpoints. Traditionally, it is critiqued on a stand alone basis as a satire written by a misanthrope. If taken within his overall body of work, however, it can still be perceived as a satire, but one written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.Parts I and II take a look at the foolish side of Englishmen, their religion, their politics, and their government. Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall. The Lilliputians are actually small in both body and mind. English politics and religion are here taken to task by descriptions of the doctrinal differences between those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels and by the dispute between those who break their eggs at the large end and those who prefer the small end. Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time in Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Lilliput. Here, Gulliver is tiny in comparison to the inhabitants. Here, too, Swift takes England and, for that matter, most of mankind, to task for being petty and contentious. After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king observes that, &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin . . . . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, and all of their ilk. On the flying Island of Laputa, the Continent of Lagado, and the Islands of Sorcerors and Immortals, Gulliver meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but are incapable of dealing with the simplest practical problem, professors who spend their lives attempting to extract sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason. These reasoning horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the beastlike humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth. In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and, after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human species in general, and Englishmen in specific, as written by a rather embittered misanthrope. That is a correct reading, but not the only one. Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that a case can be made that GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of humankind, and, using Gulliver as his example, that it is never too late to see the light.As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children. It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"As a result of an astounding run of bad luck, Lemuel Gulliver, first a ship's surgeon and later a ship's captain, is washed ashore in one strange place after another.First he meets the Lilliputians, tiny people about six inches tall. Next he visits the Brobdingnaggians, giants as large compared to Gulliver as he was to the Lilliputians. His third voyage takes him to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan.His last voyage is to the country of the Houyhnhnms. On his first three voyages, he sees the foibles and pettiness of humanity by observing the strange humans he meets. But he observes them from his own human perspective. In the country of the Houyhnhnms, he meets the degenerate and repulsive human-like Yahoos and the almost perfect horse-like Houyhnhnms. Viewing humanity (as represented by the Yahoos) from the Houyhnhnm perspective so sickens Gulliver that upon his return to England, he is loathe to associate himself with his fellow humans and requires a lenghty period of adjustment before he can look at himself in the mirror or even eat with his wife and children.Gulliver's Travels is satire. Almost nothing in 18th century England is safe from attack by Swift's pen. Although much of the book is dated, the same sort of humans that Swift wrote about are still around today."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels are broken up into four parts. The first two parts are the most famous, where Gulliver visits a land in which he is a giant and another in which it is filled with giants. Although they are very good, I found them somewhat boring. This is probably due tot he fact that I had heard these stories in so many variations already, they no longer had that originality to them. The next two parts however I found to be excellent. Several authors have expounded upon these stories or have continued them in one form of another of them. It is good to finally find the source of such great insight. For example the world in the clouds is quite humorous, and Douglas Adams makes a similar use of this satire in one of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe series. The island of wizard's where you can call up any of the dead to have them tell their part in history can be seen in &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; by Philip Jose Farmer (a Hugo award winner.) The final part about humans being nothing but Yahoos, and inferior to Horses is brilliant. A reversal of roles with other animals to give us a new perspective of ourselves is imitated in other such classics as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells, &quot;The Island of Dr. Monreau&quot; also by H.G. Wells, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, plus several Star Trek and Twilight Zone episodes."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The author's observations on human behavior and politics are as relevant today, as they were when he wrote this book. \\"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" Did the creators of \\"Yahoo\\" ever read the depiction of Yahoos in this book before they named their company? Hmmm."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels was a very well written book, complicated, but sewn with an interesting plot. The story is told first person in the view of an adventurer named Lemuel Gulliver. He goes on an adventure and visits all sorts of strange imaginary places, and learns about the cultures, while relating it to his home in England.The book is written by Jonathan Swift, an author of the mid 1700's. This book was written a long time ago, and that effected the diction used. First, some of the words were complicated Old English and were difficult to understand. He was very careful about his word choice, and used it to express satire. Swift uses a large vocabulary especially when describing people, places, or events. Also, some of the words used were slang and made me stop reading to find the meaning. The book structure was organized chronologically, with the chapters separating important events. This book is filled with symbolism since it's a satire on English society.An interesting theme in this book was the battle between physical strength and things morally right. One battle involves Gulliver with his strength verses the Blefuscudian miniature army. Another example of this is the Brobdingnag's strength verses Gulliver's enslavement. He also observes this confilict when the Houyhnhnms chain up the Yahoos.I recommend this classic to a person 15 years old and up with a strong vocabulary, and a good understanding of English literature and culture around the 18th century. I would suggest reading this book if you are interested in fantasy adventures. I had some difficulty reading this book and couldn't enjoy it for the symbolism at first. After some thought I understand the symbolism and how Swift satires England's society. After studying the symbolism, I have a whole new perspective on the book, and now I can relate symbols in the book to English society around that time period."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver is portrayed by Swift as an average man of average courage, honesty, compassion, and intellect, a typical Englishmen. But there is nothing typical about Gulliver's travels. What Swift has accomplished by making Gulliver the embodiment of common English values and beliefs and then having him visist far away lands that are really the mirrors of English society is an interesting satirical device. He forces the English reader to unknowingly judge English society, not according to some higher law or pristine observer, but through the lens of their own cherished values. This effectively turns English beliefs and values in on themselves as a test of their merit. Swift echoes this structure by first having Gulliver visit a land of little people, which causes one to ovserve them with scrutiny of Gulliver, who is now the little one. After a series of defferent looks at society throug the first three voyages, Gulliver travels to Houyhnhnmland where the narure of people themselves are given the strongest censure, by being directly paralleled with the loathsome Yahoos. Here Swift bluntly attacks almost every aspect of society, which is then compared to the Yahoos point by point by the Grey Mare. Gulliver and the reader finally identify themselves completely with the Yahoos, and Gulliver decides to abandon Yahooism forever. But, he is then immediately banished brom the island by the Houyhnhnm assembly. This poses an interesting question: What is Swift's final message then about man or his future? The fact that Gulliver is unable to stay with the Houyhnhnms or adher to their principles after leaving the island, does not mean to me that man is doomed. I think Swift is saying man will always be Yahoo, but at the same time I think he is advocating an awareness of our Yahoo nature. And, if we can see ourselves through unmuddied reflecting glass and be honest about our Yahoo nature then we can strive honestly for Houyhnhnm values and abandon saying, or believing in ourselves, &quot;the thing which is not.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This is an excellent book for all. The satire in this novel still rings true. Its cross-section of what it means to be human is hard to swallow at times. Not because it seems unreal but because it is extremely clear. We journey to the worlds of the simple-minded and ignorant, to the more sentient, and to the compassionate and intelligent. Which of these worlds are present to Swift all but one. Where do we Stand today?"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is a good book, even if you just read it as an adventure story, but when you can understand the wit and satire of Jonathan Swift, the book is great. It is a fictional narrative, written anonymously by Swift under the pen name Lemuel Gulliver. It is about the voyages and mishaps of Gulliver as he travels to uncharted islands, which are slightly different then a normal trip. He meets six inch tall people, visits a flying island, entertains some sixty foot tall royalty, encounters people that never die, and lives with horses that talk, reason, and have men-like animals for slaves. Along with this imaginative epic, Swift adds ironic humor and lays out his ideas of politics, religion, and humanity. Even though it was written in the eighteenth century, it is easily understood and fun to read for all ages. Some of the more subtle references and satires are hard to connect with, but if your book has footnotes explaining certain things, it will make it more enjoyable. I really like this book and I think you will, too."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book has been assigned reading in classes from middleschool through college, and it is not an easy read. For starters, it's a satire. Also, it was written over 200 years ago, so the writing style will be uncomfortable to read at first. That said, it is worth the read. After reading the text, or in the middle of reading it, read the introduction that the Penguin edition has. This helps place the book into the time it was written and explains some of the satire as well.I personally think Gulliver's Travels is best suited for students who are seniors in high school and older. Anyone younger and the satire will probably be completely lost and it will just be an adventure story...And there are plenty of those to read that would be easier to digest. That said, Gulliver's Travels is a great read and once read, you will realize how many writers have used bits and pieces of it in recent work, both in books and in movies. And so far, there has not been a movie that did the book justice."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"It is good to be reading this story again after so many years and to read it in a pace of time suitable to us, using our iPad and and the kindle app."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"The move with Ted Danson in it is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it, but reading the book is a must as it is the ORIGINAL version of this epic saga, and is quite different in some ways from the movie, especially at the ending (which I will not spoil here) The book also has a few places not seen in the movie, and Swift discusses politics in this book, some parts are actually political satire.

The Land of Lilliput represents a paranoid military society. Brobdingnag represents a pompous culture. The island of Laputa where everyone has high intelligence and no common sense reflects politicians. The Houyhnhnms represent the most educated class who are the closest to an ideal society. Now Swift certainly deserves credit for putting this concept together and this book does deserve a place in the classic museum of literature. Unfortunately this book has a sluggish pace. It also lacks the captivating qualities that Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dickens had down to a science. Now if someone were doing a study of literature throughout the ages, I would say this book is an important study. On the other hand, this is not a book I would buy someone as a gift."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"I am rather disappointed by the book that definitely is a classic. Lilliput is just another image of monarchy, but in no way different from what Swift knew. The criticism comes from the scale of the people who are extremely small. Brogdingnag does not change this approach, only the scale of the people who are extremely big, though in this case there is a direct criticism of the exploitation the grotesque Gulliver is the object of. Laputa, Balnibarbi and Luggnagg show a strange floating saucer in a kingdom dominated by unpractical scientists who try to do everything upside down. It is a satire of scientists in general who are so little concerned by the welfare of the community that they can ruin just for the sake of implementing their hypotheses. Glubbdubdrib is funnier because it enables Gulliver to meet all kinds of people from the past and this leads to remarks about philosophers or politicians or generals that show how small and little and even tiny they were. Japan only shows the extreme anti-christian policy that can be reached there and the extreme self-centeredness of the Dutch, which is probably a criticism of the crown in England. But the last voyage to the country of the Houyhnhnms is by far the best because here we reach both a severe criticism of the human race reduced to its animal instincts and behaviors, and a utopian society in which evil does not exist because it cannot even be conceived, because it is totally out of reach for these kind reasoning and reasonable horses. And yet Gulliver is expelled because he is a Yahoo, no matter what, and the natural reason of these dominant horses leads to rejection, after having found in Gulliver's explanations a solution to get rid of the Yahoo by sterilizing them into extinction, just the way men do with horses in European countries, just a little bit more systematically. This leads to the idea that genocide and ethnic cleansing is a natural attitude, an attitude that goes along with natural reason that says that the species standing in the way of reason have to be exterminated. But the book never reaches that level of thinking, since Swift could not know about such policies that will flourish in later centuries, and yet the Irish occupation should lead him to some idea of what such a principle can lead to. Thus at a second level of reading we find a criticism of natural reason though it is not fully expressed and developed. After all it is that natural reason that led, already in Swift's times, to the genocide of Indians in America : they were not human, they were attributed all kinds of shortcomings like aggressivity, the love of war, the lack of cleanliness, a strong stench, and many other elements of the type. We can even note that beyond the genocide, the sterilisation policy will be implemented, but not on males, rather on females, and this in some US states up to the 1950s and maybe the 1960s. And this policy initiated by the Scandinavians in the early 20th century (and it was to last at least fifty or sixty decades) was to be systematically used against physically or psychologically impaired people. Hitler will follow that model, pushing it one bit further. In a way the book becomes then some vision of the future. This book hence is a prefiguration of many other books on the subject, such as The time Machine , Brave New World , Animal Farm , etc. This book seems to be the archetype of a literary genre in English literature, and of course the archetype of many films dealing with the same subject, particularly extraterrestrials.To conclude I will say that such a book is definitely not for children even if it is often assigned to young children in some schools.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"For starters, ignore the ignorant diatribe of the Dec. 31 reviewer. The whole concept of historical context must be way too complicated for some readers to understand. What kind of person comes up with an anacronistic oxymoron like &quot;18th century Unabomber&quot;? What kind finds fault with Swift for using a literary &quot;formula&quot; he perfected, simply because some later writers, like Orwell in &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; imitated the technique to the point that it has become a modern cliche? (Swift didn't invent the technique, but he certainly was one of the first to use it so effectively) What kind of human being is capable of such questionable judgment? One who is an obnoxious, dense, unrealistic, dimwitted, pretentious, shallow bore--exactly the kind of person Swift scathingly satirizes in Gulliver's Travels.Swift plays with perspective throughout this book, and the mirror he holds up for us cuts through such arrogant pretentions, showing all of our blemishes rather than flattering our egos. Some egos today are so frail that Swift easily infuriates them, just as he did his own contemporaries. Such vehement responses are a tribute to Swift's powers as a writer and they show that his satire is still every bit as relevant today.This is a book that appeals to children, but it is not at all a children's book.

I guess you can blame that on popular movies and TV (although a recent telemovie with Ted Danson was not so far off the mark).The reality is much richer. This is one of the greatest pieces of satire and social commentary ever written. Lilliput is just one of the places visited by Gulliver. Other societies visited by Gulliver help illustrate the failings perceived by Swift in his own culture of the early 1700s.Cruelty to animals, bureaucracy, government and human injustices are just a few of the issues targeted.Don't let the social commentary I've outlined put you off. Although this book was published in 1726, &quot;to vex the world rather than divert it&quot;, Swift is very readable today. The book is full of humor, and can be read as a simple adventure fantasy.Even without footnotes the book is very accessible, but an edition with footnotes will make some of the more obscure references and humor easier to appreciate.As for the social commentary, sadly much of it is as relevant today as it was when the book was written."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This novel is one of the few that I have ever read, but it is so far the best I ever read.

I also like his usage of satire to mock the politics, religion, and society of his time. I always like to read thing that is making fun or moking some thing, and novel does just that. The one thing that I did't like was that it was tough to read, I had to use Masterplots to help me understand it.

At first, you think of Gulliver's Travels as a kid's book due to the cartoons that were put out. But as you read it, you discover it is full of satire for adults.Jonathan swift writes about how people act or fail to act. Such as in the case where Gulliver finds himself in the land of Giants. Many people there are huge, larger than life- sports stars, models, movie stars, politicians of today- but they fail to see their own faults, acme, blemeishes as Gulliver describes them. Then you have the land of Lilliputians, who represent small people in society trying to be something there not, and always trying to push others around. Their election for mayor is funny in that the official who jumps the highest wins! Sorta like our elections today, the canidate who puts the biggest show wins.Jonathan then writes about the way he feels society should be in the land of the horses, noble, honorable, loving.HHMMM And he takes a shot at humans calling them &quot;Yahoo's&quot;, stating they are dirty, filthy, self-centered and how they throw their dung around like monkeys.Some say Jonthan Swift was an eccentric and crazy, others say he was a genius.

There was still the element of being just a plain old good travel story with strong images (particularly in the Lilliput and Brobdingnag sections) but there was also a wicked sense of satire that continues to be relevant and funny now more than three hundred years after the book was originally written.The latter two sections of the book-- Laputa and the land of the Houyhnhnms-- are perhaps a little less vivid for being more pointed in their satirical content (interestingly I have no memory of these sections from my childhood reading) but that in no way detracts from the value of the book.A must-read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift is a wonderful book full of extraordinary adventure.This book is about a very well mannered and wise ship surgeon named Lemuel Gulliver, who gets washed ashore to wonderful and unbelievable lands.

As a result, those with opinions to voice often do so by writing tales of fiction that parallel events and characters in the real world. Some of these tales have gone on to become great works in Western Literature. One example is this children's classic by Jonathan Swift; Gulliver's Travels. Set in fictional places and filled with fictional characters, this book tells the story of Gulliver, a ship's surgeon who experiences adventures beyond anyone's belief. By chance and accident, he is transported from one place to another, and at each point, he encounters a society that at first, is utterly different from his own. But upon closer inspection, the characteristics of each place are exaggerations of actual circumstances found in actual societies. In each place, he also describes his own world to the locals, who in turn are amazed, astounded, and sometimes disgusted by what they hear.One example is when Gulliver arrives on the land of the Houyhnhnms, and the Yahoos they tolerate in their midst. The Yahoos are dirty, greedy, sedentary, and spend their time squabbling amongst themselves and digging along riverbanks for shiny stones. The Houyhnhnms on the other hand, are clean, upright, and roam free through the countryside. Such a story reminds one of the dichotomy between white settlers and Native Americans in North America. The latter roamed free throughout the countryside, and were known to bath themselves quite often. The former, however, rarely bathed, often fought amongst themselves, and spent a lot of time and effort digging for shiny stones that many of the natives found useless.Another example is the war between the Lilliputs and the Blefuscu. This war, as the King of Lilliput tells Gulliver, has been going on so long that nobody remembers how it started, who started it, or what they are fighting for. This sounds quite similar to the never-ending wars between France and England throughout the 2nd millenia AD. And so the parallels and allusions go.All told, this is one of the great works of English literature. The book combines sharp wit, irony, adventure, high drama, and some action into a great story of learning new things, meeeting new people, and coming to understand yourself better in the process."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is not a children's fantasy written by an avuncular Englishman. This book, instead, is a searing indictment of the human race written by a brilliant satirist and misanthrope. The Lilliput episode is most clearly inscribed in the public consciousness, perhaps because it is the least overtly damning of the human species. By the end of the book, however, when Gulliver is forced to leave the equine utopia of the Houyhnhnms, the utter perfidy of humanity is laid bare without compunction. (And it is still as true and applicable to today's societies as it was three-hundred years ago.) No one likes being criticized, especially when guilty of the offense, and Swift is unsparing in his condemnation of our collective culpability. (He makes provision for the goodness of the individual, though, such as the Portuguese ship's captain.) One of the ten best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Considering the topic of this book, I feel it necessary to discuss some of the stated perceptions regarding it:--Apparently some people believe this a children's book, sort of like the cutesy, toned down puppet shows that have passed for adaptations. A question of no doubt: This book was intended as an attack.I see in Swift something like an anarchistic mind--a man so revolted by every tribal persuation that passes for religion or for politics (often equally consumed, the two supposedly seperate ideas fused and bunched together, every contradiction in tact--!) and yet so disillusioned with every so-called 'independent movement', (be they political, social, or that stale haven of the two of them: Someone's brand new church--)that really all the poor man could see left was No hope--Whether this is a lesson for children, whether it's appropriate to allow them to see all of the horrors and the insanity of our secualarized community filled with warring faiths and the greed and the snivelling of a competitive open party system, this is for the parent(s) to judge. If nothing else Gulliver's travels is a shattering portrait of a wide-ranging variety of communities all against both each other and themselves, all living together in a community defined by dicisiveness.Other comments I saw were purely academic: the charts and the lists, the textbook schemata of some condescending mind seeming to boast that they 'get it', when all that they really come across as having gotten is someone else's rather passionless point of view. The quoting of others, the application of philosophies that have today become so common place towards human understanding that these cyrpto-psycholo-intellectualticians undermine Mr. Swift (not to meant pre-date themselves in guess of who represents whom) in their praise, giving the man no credit for intuitive insight. Certain people rank this book as the 'best ever', or--worse yet!--as the compartmentilized 'best SATIRE ever'. Now surely this book is a work of the satiric art. To put it a better way: the whole present concept of satiric intent would not exist without the pulsing heart of Jonathan Swift's works. But to apply a ranking to something that can only be taken subjectively is meaningless.Swift was a man truly without fear. In an age when people could be excommunicated and possibly executed for making fun of those in power, this angry monk scribbled out bitter complaints about the self-serving absurdity of nearly everyone in power. Then, to judge in all fairness, he turns the blame on the victims, telling them that they don't have to take it, that after a while there is no one left to blame for their suffering but themselves. This satire is all-inclusive and can therefore not be conceived with an agenda. It is poking fun. It is the narrative of progressive exaggeration. It is a masterpiece--Now of course we all need to justify our opinions by naming and accepting who or what we represent, but Swift acknowledges that this is just opinion, the one sacred thing to all of mankind. We create our own reality by applying our beliefs to our surroundings And if the whole world is out to get you, ultimately, you must be doing something terribly wrong to be so hated.I urge you--all of you, even those who much prefer an outlook able to provide for happy endings--read Gulliver's Travels. Take your time. And see who you are, taken to the logical extremes relating to your religious, political and community affiliations. And then laugh at the folly of the individual trapped in this world."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is fantastic, but the fact that the myriad of footnotes have no hyperlinks to them (so you have to search the location number every time) is quite aggravating.

The read aloud function works great!"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Great book to read, Gulliver's Travel is a fun read, I would suggest this to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"This book is definitely not the fuzzy, adorable story of big people, little people, and talking horses that currently rests in the popular perception. Sure, it has some interesting scenes and sharp satire. But the Houyhnhnm section of the book (roughly the last fourth) is an unending, unrelenting, anti-human, anti-technology diatribe worthy of Hobbes, Rosseau or Nietzsche. Swift's philosophy apparently is that we should all know our place in the world and never try to improve it; we should live close to the land and shun technology; we should live in simple huts and contemplate good, pure thoughts while communing with nature. If Swift were alive today he'd be living in Montana, sending mailbombs to college professors.Swift's manner of exposition on human shortcomings is also particularly blunt, cheap, and crude. It's a formula repeated by many authors: first, create mythological creatures (talking horses in this case). Second, bestow them with superhuman qualities. Third, compare human beings to the creatures. Fourth, rant on and on about how humans come up short. The technique is boring, unsatisfying, underhanded, unilluminating, unrealistic, unhelpful, and obnoxious.So if you do decide to read this book, my recommendation is to read the first two voyages only, and leave the rest in your bathroom in case you run out of toilet paper."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"There will be two parts to this review. The first, a review of this edition. The second, a review of the book.First, this edition: I cannot easily express how impressed I am with the Sterling Unabridged Classics that I have received thus far. The books are all hardbound, a must for any serious reader. Additionally, the print is large enough for easy reading without being overly large. Perhaps the nicest feature of these books is that each comes with a satin bookmark ribbon bound into the volume. The high quality of the paper and hard covers along with the above mentioned features makes each of the volumes published by Sterling a required addition to the library of any serious reader of classic literature. My only criticism is that the books could use more illustrations. The illustrations that are there are amazing but they are too few. All-in-all I would recommend any serious reader add these attractive and modestly priced editions to their own library.Second the book: I had never read Gulliver's Travels before. While I found all four of the stories that make up his travels to be enjoyable reads I must say that in writing these stories Swift simply recycles the same story over again with different supporting characters. Even the order in which events occur really does not change from story to story. In effect, each story follows the format 1. Gulliver is tired of being at home so he sets off on an adventure. 2. Gulliver is shipwrecked and stranded in a previously undiscovered land. 3. Gulliver is at first suspect among the inhabitants. 4. Gulliver wins over the inhabitants. 5. Gulliver becomes a hero to the inhabitants. 6. Gulliver is forced to leave because of some rule or law he inadvertently broke. 7. Gulliver reluctantly leaves. 8. Gulliver is rescued and returned home. Once you read the first story there is really little new to uncover in the remaining stories. Additionally, I was not aware that the book is actually a thinly veiled commentary on politics and life in Swift's era. If you are not aware of what was going on in the world and in politics during Swift's lifetime much of the symbolism will be lost on you. Overall, while an enjoyable read overall I found the repetition tedious and near the end I found myself anxious for the end. I would recommend that each story be read with a break in between where other titles are read to relieve the stale feeling one gets by reading the same story repeatedly."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is such a great classic that it is difficult to write any sort of regular review. So instead I have compiled a list of observations.Isaac Asimov, the distinguished writer, scientist, and Sci-fi buff, speculates that the made-up languages in Gulliver's Travels are basically nonsense; then he turns around and speculates that Lilliput is a corruption of \\"little bit\\". Good guess! - but maybe it's \\"little part\\" or \\"little pint\\"? Asimov also gives a other cases where highly plausible decipherments can be made.Interestingly, Swift's made-up languages often have a definite Italian ring. Swift himself says so much when commenting on the language of Laputa. Did Swift have a particularly admiration for Italian? Did he study it?It is usually assumed that most events and characters in Gulliver are veiled satires on England, and its misrule of Ireland. Perhaps. But maybe Swift was also poking fun at the Italian states. The \\"good old days\\" for which Swift pined may then be those of the Roman empire.It is often claimed that the fourth book is the best, and the third book the weakest. I disagree! Possibly from a purely stylistic standpoint the fourth book, on the horse-people, IS the best. But this is not enough to make it the most interesting. The Houyhnhnms represent Swift's idea of purely rational, benign beings. They don't lie, and have virtually no crime. But frankly, they are boring! They appear to have neither dreams nor aspirations, and little imagination. They spend much of their time in busy-work - apparently so as to stay out of trouble, in the manner of certain monastic orders. Perhaps the real trouble is that humans have a limited capacity for imagining perfect goodness. Look at the divine comedy triptych painted by Bosch. Which is the most interesting panel? The one on heaven? I don't think so!The third book (the one about the flying island of Laputa) contains a wealth of ideas - even if hastily written. Asimov points out that, unlike the other books, in the third book Swift takes considerable pains to explain \\"the marvelous\\" in scientific terms -- at least to the extent such explanations are possible. This is a hallmark of science fiction, as opposed to fantasy. A strong case can be made for Swift as the first true sci-fi writer. Consider, for example, his amazingly prophetic description of the two moons of Mars.Here is another example of Swifts amazing prescience. It is from Laputa, and illustrates the major concerns of Laputa's scientists:\\"These people are under continual Disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes Peace of Mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little effect the rest of Mortals. ... That, the Earth very narrowly escaped a Brush from the last Comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to Ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for One and Thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.\\"Don't we incessantly hear about the grave dangers comets and asteroids pose to us?"},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels is definetely an interesting read. The changes pace frequently because the book is divided into four books according to his different adventures. Each book(adventure)gives you a differnt view of people and questions about humans and humanity. The last book was my personal favorite-it's a very differnet spin on humanity from the other ones. Overall, it's a very good book and I would recommend it if you need a book to read or have only ever read the children's version."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Like many, my exposure to \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" has been in children's adaptations of the first section, the voyage to Lilliput. I had seen cartoons and live action adaptations, but I had never read the actual book. Well, I figured it was time.\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is so much more than a story of a big man amongst little people. An allegory for the inane struggles of the Catholics and Protestants, the citizens of Lilliput are in a continual war against Blefuscu, a conflict originating over which side of an egg should be opened first, the small or the big. Gulliver, a powerful giant amongst these people, cannot help but see their struggles as amusing and pointless. In a reversal, his next journey finds him a tiny person amongst giants, and as he explains the politics and society of his home country of England, he is forced to consider them also quaint and insignificant.Next he encounters the flying island of Laputa, and a culture entirely devoted to useless science, studies that advance nothing more than information and do not involve the lives of the citizens. This was an allusion to the Royal Academy of Science, and its pursuits far from the lives of ordinary people.Finally, and most impactfully, are the Yahoos and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent horses and bestial humans. In a story that clearly inspired \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" Gulliver is forced to confront the baser nature of his own humanity, and is forever shaken by the encounter.Gulliver becomes increasingly dismayed with humanity as the book continues, until he can no longer tolerate the touch of his own wife, so disgusted he is by what it means to be human. The story is bleak, and offers no hope of redemption. It is a dense work as well, with long political diatribes and ruminations on society.A far cry from the pleasant children's story that I was expecting, and a very good book overall. I can see why it is considered a classic."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Gulliver's Travels details a sailor's journey to four very different fantastical societies. The first, Lilliput, is populated by miniature people who fight wars over the proper way to break an egg. The second, Brobdingnag, is inhabited by giants who put Gulliver on display as a curiosity. The third consists of a kingdom governed by a king who lives on a floating island; the kingdom also contains an academy of scientists performing ineffective experiments, such as trying to extract sunbeams from cucumbers. The fourth is a society in which human-like creatures are made to serve their horse-like superiors, the Houyhnhnms."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"Recently, in my 11th grade english class, we studied the novel Gulliver's Travels. A brilliant writer named Jonathan swift, who knew how to satirize exceptionally well, wrote Gulliver's Travels. When he wrote the novel his intent was not to vex the world, but to train the mind. Gulliver's Travels trains your mind through the knowledge of human sin. The number one sin is pride, and swift defines pride as a failure to realize your own limitations. Pride and the training of the mind are pointed out through all four books of this novel....I enjoyed this book because it points out that pride is good, yet you have got to be careful because too much pride can send you down the wrong path. The book also shows our complex, human vices. Through pointing out our complex vices swift is trying to alert us about the direction that we are headed in. By doing so, he is trying to show correct direction to take, which would help to improve our lives."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"If one could accurately characterize Swift as similar to Hobbes, Rousseau, and Nietzsche, they would ultimately be incoherent; the three have about as much in common as, well, Lilliputians and Brobdingnabians. Jokes aside, however, I would not necessarily take such a comparison negatively. After all, human nature may be fairly base, as Hobbes would posit, and his discussion is sound if his premises hold- whether or not they do, however, is difficult to ascertain, and another issue. As far as Swift is concerned, the same holds for him: his arguments about human ability and understanding seem to me to be valid. If the goal of philosophy is truth, well, then that truth may not always be comforting... but it maintains its value. I am not saying that Swift is correct, so much as coherent... and that alone, is reason to consider his ideas. As far as eighteenth century history goes: I don't think it is necessary to understand the specifics of Swift's criticisms so much as understand the types of things he is criticizing. Someone, and I think aptly, once compared his references to Monica Lewinsky jokes. You can understand this book without fully comprehending the references, so DON'T let this put you off to a wonderfully pessimistic view of human nature."},{"Title":"Gulliver's travels into several remote nations of the world,","review":"As though things went on you did not see Gulliver give up.

Want the kind of book that even if think you know what eventually happened to all the characters, keeps you turning the pages when you should be asleep? This is that book; with a heavy dose of Mexican Pancho Villa stories which may or may not have been true, a clean, dumb hero with whom we can all identify at one point or another, some nifty bad guys, a love story or maybe a couple of 'em, and some political thrusts on the side, in my opinion this is one you can enjoy on any number of levels.patch"},{"Title":"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa","review":"Since I live in Mexico I found this book a great story.

Here is hoping!"},{"Title":"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa","review":"This is probably the finest relatively-unknown novel ever published in the USA. The reviews back in 1982 were stunning. (William Safire in the New York Times wrote: &quot;Rip-snortin', rootin'-tootin' adventure&quot;; the L.A.Herald-Examiner said, &quot;A big, rawboned, wild-blooded adventure, a novel to make any writer proud and many readers grateful.&quot; (I copy these from the paperback book jacket.)Young Tom Mix runs off to Mexico to join the revolution and becomes Pancho Villa's &quot;gringo&quot; aide. This is historical fact, although Irving -- for our benefit -- embroiders this for some 500 fabulous pages. Tom meets all kinds of people who were there, including George S. Patton, Emiliano Zapata, and Franz von Papen. It's a swashbuckling story, and who among us not wished he'd grown up as romantically as Mix does here?The book gives the sights and sounds of a turn-of-the-century world real enough to touch. I note that another reviewer in the L.A. Times called it &quot;a fantasy worthy of Mark Twain, a legendary tale.&quot; And the Houston Chronicle called it &quot;a wonderful, big book.&quot; I agree. If you own a copy, you can sell it for ten times what you paid for it. If you can't find one to buy, try your library. It's GREAT."},{"Title":"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa","review":"Incredible novel of the dying west, and the Mexican Revolution. Even more entertaining than Norman Zollinger 1995 novel - Not of War Only, which is in itself an excellent book. If possible Tom Mix & Pancho Villa is better!The book is a grand adventure, an epic coming of age story of pre-movie star Tom Mix. It vividly captures the excitement, romance, and bloodshed of the revolution.The portrait of Pancho Villa, brings him colorfully to life as a multi-dimensional person - as peasant, bandit, inveterate lover and serial groom, and as a leader struggling with his conscience. It is his flawed portait as a hero - a fighter and killer in search of freedom and fortune that grounds the book and brings all its characters to life.Similiar to Oliver Stone's main character in Platoon, Mix has his good companero (Candelario Cervantes) and his evil foe clouded in darkeness -Rudolfo Fierro to bring his story to life.Probably the greatest western written, few people have ever read, or heard of. After Lonesome Dove, one of the best 5 or 10 best epic western novels you will read on the old west.The action is swift, the plot wildly accurate as real events weave their way into the novel. Even a young George Patton comes to life in the second half of the book.Mostly though - you have Mix as every man fighting, loving, struggling for survival, for enlightenment - doing his best to keep the chief (Pancho) on the straight and narrow path of a hero.The journey is paved with obstacles, and the man's struggle between good and evil.It just never lets up, and it will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa","review":"Only one other book compares to Irving's sprawling but intimate saga of Tom Mix and Pancho Villa. This book gave me the same feeling as The Lonesome Dove. We're back on the trail again, only this time with Tom Mix and the other followers of Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. While the characters come colorfully alive, the story of Pancho Villa is portrayed with historical accuracy as well as gritty good humor. Memorable women play strong roles in this book, and Tom Mix is a complex person, and a great protagonist for the drama that fills this sharply written story.

It is by turns a great adventure story, an examination of the nature of revolution, an historical fantasy, a philosophical treatise on the nature (and shortcomings) of monogamy; but most of all it's a great read.Irving may be best known for the Howard Hughes caper, but this book shows he is a writer with total mastery of craft. This was my second reading of the book, and I read it on my Kindle. (The first time was back when it first came out.)Several references are made to Dumas' Three Musketeers, and I certainly saw the similarities, and the differences. But if Dumas's writing and swashbuckling storytelling still excites you, you'll love this book.If you like adventure, romance, historical fiction, cowboys, and a rip roaring tale of rebellion, intrigue, and the costs of the struggle for freedom, this one's for you.Uke Jackson"},{"Title":"CLEP General Exams w/ CD-ROM (CLEP Test Preparation)","review":"I recently took the Humanities CLEP exam.

But my real beef has to do with the CD-ROM that came with the book.The CD is designed to create for the student a feel for what the real test day will feel like. So I started working with the English Composition questions on Practice Exam 1. I studied for actually a couple of weeks before I sat down and took the first practice exam. According to the CD's score, I failed. Then I went back and started studying the questions that I failed. A few days later, after I felt that I had the failed questions studied, I took the test again and failed again. I repeated this over a period of 4 to 5 weeks. Each time I took the practice exam, I either failed or got a score that was so low that I didn't feel that I should take the real test yet. I want to walk in there and ace it so that I don't have to wait the mandatory 6 months before I'm allowed to take it again.So after weeks of studying I suddenly realized that many of the answers that the practice exam showed me as getting wrong, I had answered correctly all along. I started double checking. I started by taking the English Composition test and using the answer key in the book to record my answers. Guess what?!! The damn book failed its own test! I also discovered that many times I would click on the right answer as being \\"A\\" and the practice exam showed as my clicking on a different letter thereby getting the question wrong.But it gets worse! I soon discovered that there a number of questions that I got wrong that the practice exam on the CD showed me as having gotten right. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!! Now I've got to go back and basically start from scratch. This means that the combination of this book and the CD-ROM has taught me many, many wrong answers and now I have to UNLEARN.

Stick to your hard copy. Thanks for nothing, Amazon. Considering returning my kindle since this was half the reason I bought it!!!!"},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"A brilliant closing volume to the novel. It brings back the lyricism of the first two volumes. I thought in the volumes in between some of that earlier lyricism was sacrificed to the bitchiness of Proust's tone toward the aristocracy he was doubtless jealous of, and his askew view of love that stemmed from his obvious anxieties about having been homosexual. But the early lyrcism and charm of the first two volumes is largely revived in this final volume. And anyone interested in writing, as anyone who makes it to this final volume doubtless is, Proust's passages on the art of writing make rewarding reading.The obvious flaws are that some characters who'd earlier \\"died\\" show up alive in this volume. Couples who had numerous children in earlier volumes show up in this volume having only one child; Marcel (the narrator) recognizes people and then subsequently, in the same scene, doesn't recognize them. I have NOOO idea why some editor didn't knock out these discrepancies and tighten the text. It really seems silly to me to be SOOO faithful to Proust's final manuscript as to include glaring errors. Proust was rewriting when he died. If he'd lived he would have corrected these errors and I think his intention should have been honored. But I'm still giving it five stars, since overall the experience of reading this last volume is of reading something truly brilliant."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"The lists of characters, and of persons and places referred to, at the end are useful even if you are planning to read A La Recherche from page one, so I'd recommend buying this volume first. I am lost in admiration of the immense task of the translators but some comments are in order. They had the problem of translating slang and mispronunciations and the translations of these are often based on British usage of the 1920's. Scott Moncrieff dealt with some of them by leaving them in French. He had a style that was slightly archaic, even for his time (see his translation of the Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter, where he left the dirty bits in Latin). Some of the translations are in British English, with expressions such as &quot;lift boy&quot; and &quot;bowler-hatted&quot; that might need translation of the translation, although I suspect that the sort of people reading Proust and reading a review like this are anglophile as well as francophile."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"Perhaps the most exciting publishing event of the century so far is the new translation of \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" as it is now (and more accurately) called. Finding the last two volumes is a bit of a chore, but search for ISBN 0141180366 or \\"Prendergast Proust\\" or \\"Ian Patterson\\" on Amazon. I haven't read it, but I am impressed enough by the first two volumes in this new translations that I have ordered the final two from England, where they are available in hardcover. Viking has not yet published them in the U.S. (and may not, in my lifetime) but Amazon sells the paperbacks of the British Penguin edition. They are somewhat misleadingly titled \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" which is the series title. This volume is actually titled \\"Finding Time Again,\\" and the translator is Ian Patterson. (Each book has its own translator, for a total of seven. Vol. 5 contains two books and features two translators.)I give this Modern Library edition only four stars because I am convinced that the new translation is superior. Indeed, it's not entirely clear to me who the translator is, in this case; evidently not Fred Blossom, who did the original English translation when Scott-Montcrief died before finishing the work."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"I've been reading Proust's novel off and on since about 2002. Having read the first four volumes consecutively, I got burned out on young M, took a seven year hiatus, and eventually returned to the Albertine volumes and Time Regained in 2012. The particular edition I'm reviewing here, the Modern Library Classics edition, with its extensive list of characters, places, and persons, is a book I wish I'd purchased early in my reading of Proust since it would have helped me in dealing with the vast number of characters that pop in and out of the novel. I always admired those who had managed to read through the entire novel, since I knew that for every one who finally finished it there were probably at least a hundred more who abandoned it at some point. Now that I am one of those weird individuals who did finish the novel, I have a lot of sympathy for those who are fallen by the wayside. At the risk of sounding a contrarian note, I feel like the Time Lost in reading Proust will never be Regained. Was it wasted time? Perhaps all time must be wasted in one way or another. Using the time as money metaphor, which is essentially untrue, a product of our capitalist-consumer culture, I could have \\"spent\\" my time better perhaps by \\"investing\\" it wisely in closely reading market-timing newsletters, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, etc., etc. But instead, I wasted my time on M. All those fallen-by-the-waysiders know what I mean. Life is short, and there are a lot of other things one could be doing, besides scaling this monstrosity.And Proust's novel is a monstrous edifice, imposing like the height of a skyscraper seen close up, but fundamentally an imperfect work of art which may still be acknowledged as a masterpiece just as a painting by Jackson Pollock might appear somewhat shoddy and haphazard when viewed close up, while still remaining priceless from a distance. In Time Regained, Proust lets it all hang out. The description of Jupien's brothel and what happens inside it, especially with respect to Baron de Charlus, is probably the part that sticks most in my mind. But the great afternoon party given by the Princesse de Guermantes (the former Mme Verdurin) which occupies the entire last half of the novel is the main event which brings most of the main characters of the novel together again for a final reprise. There is a fair amount of dross scattered about in the text amidst much extraordinary, unforgettable writing. One outstanding example of the latter is the precious description of the Duc de Guermantes in his extreme old age and his pathetic love affair with Mme de Forcheville (Odette), which takes up pages 486-491.Time Regained should probably be considered the climax and the cornerstone of the entire novel, but instead, it is more like an epilogue. The novel does not really end on a positive note either. It's not a whimper exactly but sort of a muffled affirmation that the art of writing down the past and transforming it will in the end make some sort of difference in the grand scheme of things, whatever that might be. The great, obsessional love-affair with Albertine, which seems to be the highlight of the novel, is mercifully over with, and the author is older, wiser, resigned, deeply committed to the realization of his life's work, the great book he has perennially put off writing. Now, as his own death draws near, he realizes that the time has now come to begin the Great Work. No one who reads the entire novel ever seems to say much about how they felt on finally completing the last sentence on the last page. In my own case, there was a touch of sadness in my heart when the novel came to an end, and even a brief, crazy desire to return to Swann's Way and the two paths. But I quickly laid that idea aside. But in the end I'm glad that I wasted so many days in the company of Marcel. Proust's achievement will remain a monument in my own life to lost and happily wasted time."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"Reader beware ... the Kindle version of Volume 6 DOES NOT include the Guide to Proust. That was the main I bought this volume in advance because of the guide. Amazon has kindly credited me for the book."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"Though it bears the title of Proust's seven-volume masterpiece, this is actually just the final volume, called \\"Finding Time Again\\" in this new translation. This particular book would be the British paperback edition, for the American press run has so far only given us four volumes, all of which are for sale on Amazon in a uniform style.There are small but real differences between the British and American editions. With their greater tolerance for continental foibles, the Brits retained French punctuation, using dashes instead of quotation marks for conversation. They also retained the French wherever Proust makes a literary reference, providing a translation in the notes; in the American edition, this policy is reversed.In reading the first two volumes (\\"Swanns' Way\\" and \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\") I noticed typographical errors that might well have resulted in converting the British to the American languages, rather than from French to English. For example, on page 95 of \\"In the Shadow\\" there is the phrase \\"Professor Cottard and his wife were not to partake of the pleasure\\" when the sentence should actually read \\"NOW to partake,\\" since Swann has decided to introduce the Cottards to the Duchesse! Not earthshaking, but it does rather spoil Proust's little joke.In short, these British paperbacks will serve very nicely if the American reader is in a hurry to complete the novel, and they may also be more free of errors. But I will probably wait for the uniform hardcover Viking volumes.I haven't read Mr. Patterson's translation of volume seven, but I give it five stars based on the company it keeps."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"Alright, so I'm a cheat. I never thought I'd get beyond admiring the bright spanking six volumes of A la recherche (3700 pages! Phew!) on my bookshelves, but when it was announced that Raul Ruiz had made a film of the last book, I seized my chance. Thanks to this brilliant edition you can, because at the end is an exhaustive guide to Proust, listing every character, historical person, place and theme of the whole work, so that just by referring regularly to this you quickly catch up with what's going on. Of course this isn't the same as living with characters and events through literature, but this volume is so amazing you can't fail to want to begin the whole thing and experience them from the start.This is, as I expected, one of the most beautiful and exciting books I have ever read, as well as one of the most frustrating and irritating. What is most surprising, for a book claimed as one of the two greatest of the century, is how old-fashioned it is (compared to the still startlingly modern and socially relevant ULYSSES).It has two types of narrative. One, about a young middle class boy who penetrates society, is a mixture of social comedy and tortured romance familiar to anyone who has read a great Victorian novel - there is the same social analysis of an outmoded caste, wide range of characters, poetic evocation of place.The language, once you get used to the involved, elaborate sentences, is very accessible in a Jamesian kind of way, intricately psychological and analytical, yet supremely elegant and radiant, with a verve and lightness remarkable for such a heavy book.The translation is, for once, remarkable - it can never be the original, I guess, but you rarely feel that you are getting only half the work like you usually do.The second half is less satisfactory. As is appropriate to a book concerned with time, the book's forward progress is constantly impeded, by degressions, flashbacks, fastforwards, explanations. The book, like those of Anthony Powell (if you loved THE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME, you'll adore this) is less straight plotting, than a series of monumental set-pieces.This novel is 450 pages long, but has only about three events - the narrator going back to the country to stay with friends; the first world war; a huge party. These are mini-novels in themselves and are extraordinary as social observation, character comedy and amusing incident, as well as profoundly moving meditations on the inexorable power of history and old age.Imagine the narrator has a remote control as he is walking through the film of his life. He freezes the screen every three seconds and discusses in detail the tableaux vivants before him, bending time and experience back and forwards with ease as he does so.In between these are ruminations on the art of writing. This is a remarkably self-reflexive book, the narrator suddenly starts talking about how he came to write it, what he intended to achieve and what tools he was going to use. The volume becomes less the conclusion of a vast work than the record of its inception; you have to go back then and read it again (believe me, 3700 pages won't seem enough).This section, a book-length manifesto, is fascinating and thrilling, but also repetitive, difficult, frustrating, and sometimes obscure - it gets in the way of the brilliant descriptive passages - the meeting with Baron de Charlus is possibly the most extraordinary thing I have read, until the remarkable coup of the closing party, where people the narrator hasn't seen for years have grown horribly old and form a grotesque, funereal fancy dress party - you want him to shut up talking about Time and impressionism and get back to the fun.Two other things: Evelyn Waugh was wrong - Proust is hilarious, both with subtle ironies and more obvious satiric abuse; with risible character traits and wider social events.Secondly, the narrator is not some unbearable omnisicient know-all as those of Victorian novels - he is deeply unreliable - a prig, hypocrite, voyeur, homophobic, intolerant, puritan, snob, deeply contradictory and cripplingly ill; in earlier volumes he is apparently obsessional, jealous and brutal to the point of insanity. No wonder Nabokov adored him - he is, in his ravishingly aesthetic unreliability, the first Humbert."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"If you've read the first four volumes of the Penguin Modern Classic, Proust's In Search of Lost Time, then don't let the publication restriction in the US stop you from buying the British text versions. Except for minor presentation, they are exactly the same that will be published in the US when the copyrights expire. The only differences (which are hardly a great obstacle to the enjoyment of reading the novel), are the footnotes in back and the original French lyrics which Proust occasionally quotes from in the body of the work -- apparently the British assume we colonial philistines do not know as much French as they do.The introduction to The Fugitive I found hugely welcome -- British translator Carol Clark is unapologetically direct in summing up for us what the previous 4 volumes have been about -- a long wished for insight as I have been dying to know up to this point whether or not I have been truly getting Proust all along.The curse and the blessing is that Proust died before he could give the final sign off on these manuscripts before publication. A curse because he most certainly would have removed or resolved many errors, and extended or rewritten many parts which are its weakest sections. A blessing in that, to be sure, there are in this and the next volume several obvious errors which a good copy editor would have detected and eliminated, but with time have become such a part of Proustian lore that they can no more be removed than say Jimmy Durante's nose shortened or Richard Burton's pockmarks removed or Marilyn Manson's makeup wiped clean.And if one has lasted this long, the addiction to Proust's peregrinations from the plot to discuss seemingly unrelated topics and issues in minute detail - as seen from the other end of binoculars, as Roger Shattuck writes in Proust's Binoculars- one will not be at all bothered about any perceived sloppiness in these last two volumes. On the contrary, one will feel proud to detect them for oneself, and have a private chuckle about it as Proust is forgiven for what would be unacceptable by today's publishing standards.SO don't wait four more years - you'll not care by then or have forgotten much of the threads of the protean plot which keeps all volumes tied into one - for most of what is written in these last volumes is the rich reward the reader deserves after having hung in there until the end, to discover the final fate and full identities of all the rich and lively characters we have come to love - Charlus and St Loup, Albertine and Gilberte, oh, and Mme Potbus' maid - remember her?The Prisoner and the Fugitive translated by Carol ClarkThis is almost a novel within the novel as it deals in two parts with the final resolution of the narrator's relationship to Albertine, this character who, more so than any other, the narrator has kept directly from the reader's curious view and desire to know her in her own voice.Finding Time Again translated by Ian PattersonThe fates of the rest of the characters are revealed, and the narrator in this last volume himself ages (or catches up to the age at which he began telling this long story -- and we will learn why he had to write it all before his death, as the line between fiction and reality between Marcel the narrator and Marcel the famed French writer nearly disappears). This is the volume where, winding down at last from what was always a nebulous plot to one last social scene,like a curtain call, all the characters take their final bows together in old age (either still alive or in the narrator's memory of them). And there are some great surprises left to discover, which hopefully too much reading of Proustian criticism, biographies, and reviews hasn't already revealed to the \`well informed but too reluctant to read A la Recherch&eacute; du Temps Perdu for themselves' lover of literature."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"In this final life's work of Proust on the theme of the passage of Time it's clear that the author is riper, near to death and concerned about the lasting impact of his writing. \\"Eternal duration is promised no more to men's works than to men.\\" Yet there is so much beauty and substance and lyricism in his 4,300 pages clearly his volumes are, both individually and collectively, a masterwork for the ages. The novel seems more like an autobiography in which the names of persons and places have been changed to protect the innocent (and the gulity). Because of his theme, Marcel constantly returns to the events of his life to gain some semblance of understanding of them. In this volume he is concerned with the effect of the world war upon Paris. The familiar characters of Gilberte and Bloch happily emerge again to center stage and, as always, Charlus and Morel. Because of his failing health and self-exile from society, he must have known that he had little Time to tie up all the loose ends and that another volume would not be in the offing after this one. Indeed, he never lived to see this volume in print. By virtue of his failing health the pressing nature of his last years lend a poignancy to the themes of this volume so that it stands out among the other works when Time was full of budding possibilities and had not ultimately become a dreaded adversary. In this volume Proust picks up the leitmotifs that thread their way through this remarkable tapestry in his walks down various ways and he brings them all to a meaningful end. The story lines are surprisingly simple and easy to follow and there is so much enduring value in his masterfully articulated \\"impressions.\\" I decided to commit Time a few months ago to read all of Proust's work --it was Time well spent. I can't encourage you enough to make a similar investment. The work is truly a Timeless masterpiece from one of the real geniuses of his day and through it Proust has justly earned his immortality, his worthy prominence among the best literary minds of all Time."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"\\"Time Regained\\" is a dark ending to the \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" cycle, as Proust, sickly like his fictional narrator, unknowingly nears the end of his own life but senses its imminence. France, like the most of the rest of the world, is now a very different place. The Dreyfus affair is receding into the past under the shadow of the new war that has descended upon Europe, with Germany having ravaged Belgium and threatening to destroy London and Paris.Many of the people with whom Marcel has associated throughout his life and whom we came to know so intimately through the pages of his chronicle are now dead, whether by disease, accident, old age, or the war. Those among the living include the Baron de Charlus, who sympathizes with the Germans and frequents a hotel that serves as a male brothel; Bloch, who has de-Judaicized his name and has assumed an English chic; and Odette and her daughter Gilberte, the latter now herself a mother, who have not so gracefully weathered the effects of aging.Marcel himself is now an adult of at least middle age, and, as far as he is concerned, still no closer to achieving his goal of becoming a writer as he was in his youth. He has, however, started writing articles and comes to realize, as he reflects on the course of his life, that the intricate web of contacts he has made can serve as grist for his literary mill, should he decide in his waning days to take up a pen and make some contribution to letters. And, of course, over the past four thousand pages that is exactly what his author has done. Marcel muses on Time (capitalization intended), memory, and dreams as necessary elements in the creation of art, a product of so much personal pain and suffering that death can seem like a welcome reprieve.Judging the novel as a whole now that I've finished all six volumes, I affirm that there is nothing like it, or even close to it, in literature; like \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"Don Quixote\\" it resides in its own impenetrable legendary world of oneness. In my review of \\"Swann's Way,\\" I compared Proust to Henry James, but I see now that I was way off the mark. James writes like he's throwing his weight around, imperiously demanding intellectual respect and forcing his reader into submission with his intentionally inscrutable compositions; Proust's prose, conversely, calmly and warmly invites the reader into Marcel's society and caresses him with the most delicate sensations and deepest emotions. Proust is closer to Henry Adams than he is to Henry James, but even this attempted juxtaposition is buffered by a wide margin.Proust's style is so ornate that it is the most difficult of any writer's to describe, yet paradoxically there is nothing affected about it; he is quite possibly the most unpretentious writer in literature. He never tries to impress the reader with his erudition, even though he evidently has much, or make himself out to be something he's not; one gets the sense that what he writes is exactly what and how he thinks, as incredible as that seems. He uses humor without trying to be a comedian, sorrow without trying to be a tragedian. He is employing language simply to illustrate life and the world, and I think language has no higher calling than that."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"The melancholy atmosphere that pervaded the close of The Fugitive is carried over into this final part of Proust's huge work. Whereas, in the preceding part, Marcel laments the loss of Albertine and his changed relationship with his long time friend, Saint Loup, the author's concerns are now much greater. France is in the midst of World War I, Paris experiencing night time air raids; and the distinction between the Guermantes' Way and Swann's Way has become even more blurred as both Gilberte, the daughter of a courtesan, and Mme. Verdurin, the insufferable salon hostess, have become members of the mystic Guermantes family. Furthermore, Saint Loup is killed in action and Marcel's hometown is occupied by the Germans. But in spite of the gravity of the events surrounding him, Marcel becomes even more self-absorbed. He still holds onto his drean of becoming a writer, but this desire begins to wane as he becomes convinced that he has neither the temperament, the knowledge nor the fortitude to follow a literary career. Then the pivotal event of the whole novel takes place: he is invited to a matinee at the new home of the Prince de Guermantes.While waiting in an anteroom for admission to the Guermantes' reception, the author is beset by a series of sensory experiences that bring back several happy memories from his past. These recollections, both powerful and joyous, convince him that he has the ability to undertake a literary career, to be able to communicate those ecstatic moments from the past to readers of the present day. His melancholy lifted, he enters the reception to discover that his recent epiphany is only bolstered by what he finds. All around him are the decaying remnants of a fast fading aristocracy. Many of the characters that have been introduced to the reader throughout the course of the novel are met again, but now in the final years of their lives: the proud Charlus, now an obsequious old man; the Duc de Guermantes, described as a &quot;magnificent ruin&quot;; Gilberte, now confused with her aging mother; even Marcel becomes aware that he, too, is quickly getting old. But now seeing things with an artist's eye, Marcel becomes aware that each of these characters, as well as all those people remembered from his life, are &quot;like giants plunged into the years, [touching] the distant epochs through which they have lived, between which so many days have come to range themeselves - in Time.&quot; Marcel's goal is clear. He will spend the rest of his life carefully bringing these giants back to life. In other words, he is ready to embark on the huge task of writing the book that the reader has just finished reading.This part of the novel was published five years after the author's death and suffers from a lack of editing. There are many ellipses, contradictions, and time and place juxtapostion mistakes, errors that Proust would surely have tidied up if he had lived to see his work published in full. But these are paltry criticisms wthen compared to the brilliance of the total work. Unfortunately, Proust is little read these days, and many of those who attempt to read the novel are motivated by the challenge of a literary marathon more than from an awareness of the intrinsic value of the work (as I was). But regardless of the motivation, the effort (and it is an effort) is totally rewarding as the reader sees in Proust's world reflections of his own. It took me a part of seven years to read the complete novel, a period of time in which Proust's search for lost time and my own reminiscences often became linked together as the author's characters shared my own thoughts regarding things past, the specious present, and the eventual fate that awaits us all.Kilmartin's A Guide to Proust, which is included in this volume is well worth the price of the book by itself. The guide consists of four distinct inexes to Proust's novel: characters, historical persons, places and themes. The scholarship that went into compliling these indexes is outstanding and makes it possible for the reader to spend several years (if he so wishes) in working his way through the novel without losing track of the hundreds of characters and personages included therein. One reviewer remarked, &quot;buy this volume first&quot;; I would only modify this advice by suggesting that the prospective reader get this volume when he purchases Swann's Way."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"I attach this review of Proust's cycle of novels to the last novel in the cycle because things are calmer here than over at Swann's Way. The crowd here seems to have thinned out a little. Contrary to what some reveiwers claim, plenty happens in the seven novels comprising In Search of Lost Time. Plenty happens, but it happens \\"over time\\" - as in real life. In \\"Marcel's\\" case, it's a life during which the exalted are brought low and the base are exalted. Proust's novelistic enterprise, which early-on might be dismissed as nothing more than the effete self-absorption of a Parisian dilettante who's \\"not worth the rope to hang him\\" (as one character maintains in Vol. III), turns out, by the final volume, to be a good deal grittier than first appeared.The choice of translation matters. The older, Moncrieff translation comes across as precious and sentimental, while the newer Mayor/Enright/Kilmartin edition seems less so. Compare the title Moncrieff chose, Remembrance of Things Past, (a phrase lifted out of Shakespeare's Sonnet 30) to the literally-translated title used in the newer edition: In Search of Lost Time. Also compare, \\"I would ask myself what o'clock it could be\\" (Moncrieff) with \\"I would ask myself what time it could be\\" (Enright). Though the differences may be minor, I had a much better experience with the newer translation.The cycle of seven novels in six volumes takes considerable TIME to read. I spent the slack year between early retirement and late graduate school reading it. Thus, I modestly propose that every American who has not already done so should quit his or her job immediately and carefully read all seven novels before proceeding any further with thier lives. Not that I'm an enthusiast. My proposal follows from an opinion that we Americans need to spend more time thinking and less time doing. That way we'd do less harm. Even so, readers should be prepared for a certain Proustian indifference to minor matters of proportion. They may find a single sentence that occupies an entire page, or a single paragraph that goes on for eight pages. A chapter of 300 or more pages may be follwed by a chapter of 25 pages. \\"Marcel\\" may go on for fifteen pages about what he experiences while trying to remember a name that's on \\"the tip of his tongue.\\" But if you don't enjoy lengthy examinations of inner experiencings, you probably shouldn't be reading Proust. There were also occasional long stretches of such drek that I wanted to gag. \\"Marcel's\\" sojourn with soldiers in Doncieres in Vol. III was one such. Readers must be prepared to simply forge ahead when encountering these. It gets better.Which leads me to Vol. VI, Time Regained, a tour de force, without a doubt. If the \\"tea and madeleine\\" segment in Swann's Way forms the left bookend for In Search of Lost Time, Time Regained forms the right one. I wouldn't want to give too much away about Proust's final volume. William Empson claimed to have expected an apocalypse and accordingly lamented (or pretended to lament) the apparent insignificance of what Proust actually provided. I'd hate to give away more than Empson did, but I think that by the final volume \\"Marcel's\\" fruitless pursuit of Madame Putbus' maid has been abandoned at last. Even the face of Mme de Guermantes, admired by \\"Marcel\\" through seven novels, has begun to resemble \\"nougat\\" with traces of verdigris and fragmentary shell-work on which grew \\"a little growth of an indefinable character, smaller than a mistletoe berry and less transparent than a glass bead.\\" Volume VI shows \\"Marcel\\" at his funniest, and most misanthropic, as attached as ever to his own follies, yet as quick as ever to dissect those of his friends - a decidedly tragic vision. It made the long read worthwhile. After I finished Time Regained I went back to Vol. I and began all over again."},{"Title":"Time Regained","review":"By the time I reached this final volume of Proust's &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; I was exhausted.

This is the period, the final breath of literary genius from the great Marcel Proust, who devoted his life to this great novel.In \`Time Regained,' the reader is permitted an extraordinary prolegomena on the writer's craft, a self-reflexive exposition of the literary form that prefigures post-modernity and the works of Brecht, Breton, Beckett, and all the rest of them. Proust creates a work that is more exacting, more precise and perspicacious than any work of aesthetic philosophy in the western tradition. He discloses that the art of writing is, in its essence, an act or translation.The artistic content is already contained within the mind and soul of the artist and the act of writing is an act of transporting the content to form.This is a novel about time, and it requires time to read. In this way, Proust the reader develops a relationship with the work within the register of a temporal horizon, which mirrors the register of temporality internal to the characters and unfolding of the fictional universe that Proust has created. It is a joy to read.Also included in this volume is Kilmartin's guide to Proust, a summation of all the central characters, events, and allusions in a la recherch&eacute; for readers who (inevitably) get lost in Proust's complex literary web."},{"Title":"In the workshop","review":"This volume is the third of a three part set by the authors Duplex.

The CDML section is particularly lightweight."},{"Title":"Shell Shock: The Psychological Impact of War","review":"The book focuses largely on the First World War, where the term shell shock originated and and attempts were first made to understand it's concept.The book recounts, through many personal stories how the whole notion of mental suffering was often regarded as a form of cowardice, with many innocents suffering the ultimate punishment/shame, purely due to a lack of understanding of the mental and physical stress that war can cause, whilst authorities seemed incapable of showing compassion for fear of inducing a revolt in their own forces.Distressingly, the author recounts how doctors working for the military were ordered to work with the sole intention of getting their patients well enough to be able to send them back to the frontline, where all the original triggers of shell shock awaited.Incidents are reported of soldiers, who would have no reason to suffer mental illness in everday life, displaying the most bizarre symptoms after being exposed to the continuous horrors of war.Holden goes on to detail how the understanding of Shell Shock evolved during the World Wars largely due to the perserverance and hard work of a number of doctors who often experimented with nothing more than trial and error methods.It goes on to explain how further conflicts in the 20th Century, ncluding Vietnam and the Gulf War have to some extent allowed the understanding of the stresses of war to become almost scientifically identified, to the point where it's now generally understood what sorts of conditions and how many hours of combat the average human can take in war."},{"Title":"Shell Shock: The Psychological Impact of War","review":"I picked this up after chatting to an army doctor about shell-shock and this book has been impossible to put down.

If you've enjoyed The Little Princess and The Secret Garden, you surely will want to read her third famous children's classic. The seven-year-old American protagonist is simply too sweet and good-natured to be true; his widowed mother is a study in patient suffering.Suddenly informed that her son is the heir to an Earldom in England, the mother gives up her homeland to restore her son to his rightful legacy. But his crusty old grandfather(who cast out his youngest son when he married a mere American) proves mean and selfish-universally hated by his tenants. Now this unexpected grandson may be his last chance--not only to continue the family name and honor, but more importantly, for the old man's personal growth.It's a challenge for American readers to understand the dialogue which Burnett often presents in dialect, while ignoring the distinction between New Yorkese and British peasant slang. Neverthless, this book is a gently told tale which will touch those unjaded readers who remain. The underlying theme may be that of the restorative power of innocence."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"First, its so sugary sweet as the interwebs say 'diabeetus' will be imminent. you have the basics, poor father-less kid makes friends with EVERYONE, crotchity relative they never knew about is richer then Midas it seems and suddenly wants poor kid to come be the heir.

The quality of the writing is very good and makes for a great reading. Yet it is so syrupy and idealistic that my head was somewhat spinning. Here are several excerpts from Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, the house is so beautiful!\\" exclaims Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, Dearest, the pony is so beautiful!\\" \\"You are the most wonderful, kindest man I've ever known!\\" Like I wrote, these are few examples, but in the book, there are a lot of them. Mostly, the tone of Little Lord Fauntleroy is that England is a better country than United States of America. The characters of the book are one-dimensional, but there is a good play with positivism and negativism. However, the values set forth by the book don't fit me well because people just can't buy other people's way out of their miseries. Although the therapeutic effect is short-lived, it is unrealistic and condescending. Little Lord Fauntleroy arouses jealousy in the readers that this boy will inherit the vastness of the treasure in forms of money, house, property, and so on and that he has the power to change people's lives. Really, changing people's lives doesn't require any money at all. At the same time, Little Lord Fauntleroy introduces the idea of materialism that it is deemed to be cool to possess a lot of stuff (and why? I ask). Again, the book was written in 1886, and it is difficult for the author to foresee the effects of materialism have on the environment and living space. Another terrible crime committed by the author is that her book is literally about beautiful people. So, the idea is that it is very important that you look beautiful as possible. Hm...sure. All in all, Little Lord Fauntleroy is an okay book, but I have no desire of reading it again."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I ordered this audio CD because I like childrens' classic literature and because I like to listen to audio books while on trips.

When I grew up, they were still favorites. So a year ago when I was buying them for my little cousin, and I noticed \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\", I was astounded. How did I miss such a gem?The story of little Cedric who warms his old grandfather's heart is beautifully written and quite touching.

A large speech was absent at the end, and I caught that only because I'd looked it up; the ending made no sense without it.

I definitely don't recommend this publisher's version of the book."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This delightful story has a reputation for being very sentimental, and it is, but it is also filled with humour. Cedric Errol, an all-American boy, discovers to his dismay that he is the heir to an English earldom, and has to go to England to live with his stern old grandfather, who despises Americans (he must have been reading the Guardian, I suppose). Gradually they learn to like each other, and the grandfather even comes around to liking Cedric's American mother. There is a melodromatic sub-plot involving a false heir, but the story is really interesting enough without it. The best character in the book is Cedric's friend Mr. Hobbs, a staunchly Republican grocer who despises earls \\"I'd like to catch one of em inside here; that's all!\\" he tells Cedric, before he knows Cedric is one of them \\"I'll have no graspin tyrants sittin round on my buiscuit barrels!\\" By the end of the book though, he has become so attached to Cedric that he sells his grocery business and settles in England, where he becomes an avid follower of aristocratic doings. He says he'll never return to America \\"It's a good enough country for them that's young and stirrin - but there's faults in it. there's not an aunt-sister among em - nor an earl!\\" Which pretty much sums up how I feel about America too."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an example of the difficulties of shopping online.I had read the book several years ago and wanted to give a volume as a gift. This printing is unacceptable - unpleasant font, cramped pages and flimsy binding. You will do better with the purchase of a used hardcover volume"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I found this book in my school library a year ago...and i think it was indeed,a very pleasant heartwarming story.So nice was that i even managed to catch Burnett's other titles!Basically,this novel is about a boy living in America who realises that his long dead father was actually a lord's son back in old England.The story goes back when the lord's (youngest and favourite) son fell for a young maiden in America.So madly in love with her that he even dare to forsake his home,his title and his father to be with her.Despite they being poor,the trio led a fulfilling and wonderful life,that was,when the son was contracted with some incurable disease and died.Back in England,the old sire (the lord,of course) never forgave his youngest son for his action.He never liked the maiden,either.Coincidence as it may be,the Lord's two oldest sons either died or ran away(sorry,but i can't remeber this part).Knowing that his time was up,and he needed a heir,the Lord called for his long-lost grandson to come stay with him in England.For a boy who was born and bred in America,and had friends like the baker,the apple seller,the barber and roams round the street during his leisure time,moving in with a stern and grouchy old man in a cold castle was a far cry from his life in America.The old Lord found children a nuisance,but had it not been a fact that he needs a heir,he'd have probably wished his grandson to continue rotting away in America.Cedric Roy (the protagonist and grandson)was nevertheless,the sweet and innocent 7-year-old.He never questions why his grandfather was old and bitter,or why the servants were extremely afraid of their master,or why the castle was cold and dark and empty,or why his mother could not come and live with him (the Lord refused the maided to be within his castle grounds).Overtime,as Cedric Roy discovered more of his grandpa's self,the latter too,was amused by his grandson.A boy of 7,compassionate and caring for others,the old man began to open up...and change his perspection of life...It was amazing indeed,that this lovely bond between a boy of 7 and an old elderly man could get along easily.Burnett's novel was extremely well-written...depicting the childishness and innocence of a child,as well as the black-hearted old Lord.I give this book two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I wanted to read this book because the idea of Little Lord Fauntleroy is such a part of our culture, but I knew nothing about the original. The child is sympathetically drawn (except for the fact of calling his mother \\"dearest\\" which I found odd) and charms all he comes in contact with. He is just an ordinary boy in the US when news comes to him that he will inherit his grandfather's title and is to go to England to learn to be a lord. The grandfather is wonderfully curmudgeonly, the mother is too good to be true, and of course there is a happy ending. There was gentle humour and I liked seeing the change in the old man. A pleasant read."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I had never read Little Lord Fauntleroy, and after reading The Secret Garden recently, which was completely enchanting and full of metaphoric wisdom, I wanted to read more of Francis Hodgson Burnett's work. Personally, the title of this book had become associated with a rather pompous characterization as in &#34;who do you think you are, little lord Fauntleroy?&#34; so I had no idea what the book was even about.To my surprise and delight, just like The Secret Garden, her drawing of the characters in the midst of their circumstances was vivid and real, and completely drew me in. With good reads such as this, I have to force myself to put the book down, so I can prolong the pleasure. From the very beginning all the way to the end, not a scene was wasted or uninteresting. Some writers spend a good deal of time explaining why their characters act the way they do, which becomes tedious.Ms. Burnett's characters speak through their actions, and the story of the little boy who becomes a lord is simply about living spontaneously from the ideals of highest character. So much of the stories in the world today shows us humans who are tortured within by what they can't quite integrate in their lives. They don't touch the realm that this book simply opens one into, the part of humanity that is giving and loving without cause or reason. Reading this book was very refreshing. It's characters are uniquely portrayed and Ms. Burnett, in my opinion, never moralizes. Had she done so, the book would have been far less engaging.If you want to remember your childhood feeling of delight and innocence, if you want to be filled with simple joy and delight without requiring that you be perfect, if you want to remember a part of who you are as an eternal child, I believe you will relish this book."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"One again I'm embarrassed to say I've made it to fifty and never read this book.

Then you've got to love a professional e-book production. Thanks Amazon for high standards."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is a story about a little American boy, Cedric who suddenly finds himself the heir-apparent to a title in England. His grandfather, the present Lord Fauntleroy, (who originally disowned the boy's now-dead father for marrying his American mother) sends for the boy to live with him. His faultless mother of course agrees to let him take this opportunity, while she goes to live in a nearby cottage.Then a woman appears with a boy she claims to be the son of an older son, apparently displacing Cedric as heir. It is a testament to Little Lord Fauntleroy's sweetening effect that his grandfather unites with his mother to fight against this alternate claim (successfully, of course...this is no book for bittersweet endings--the good always triumph, the evil always meet they're downfall, and the good and the evil are always on opposite sides).Enough sugar to gag a horse, but no story. From the start, the little boy is perfect...charitable, pretty, strong, and smart--but infinitely oblivious of others' defects. He does not grow or change. He does not wrestle with problems. He does not even realize there are problems. He is not a character--he's a pro-American fantasy.The real protagonist is the present Lord, the boy's grandfather. His transition from conceited grump to true grandfather is mildly interesting. However, far too often Cedric's perfect little self takes center stage, constantly presenting himself to be admired by the other characters, who were not so fortunate as to be perfect or American."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I got to know this book \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" through the President of SGI, Daisaku Ikeda. This book tells us how a pure, innocent and kind-hearted boy, Ceddie, changed his ill-tempered grandfather. Little Ceddie's mother played a very important role in bringing up his son into such a good character, who always look at people's good points. This good quality of Little Ceddie is what a society need."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is the fable of a young boy (Cedric) who is nothing short of saintly. His arrival in England as a new lord replacing his grandfather casts off the contrast of dark and light. The Earl is nothing short of a brute. Cedric is a saint. Cedric's charm, handsome looks and demeanor evolve the Uncle into a saint himself. That's the story. There really isn't a plot or some great cause and effect drama. The author's gift is the ability to tell a fable -- good can conquer evil.The problem with Little Lord Fauntleroy is of course it's dated. Since contemporary themes were inserted into the tale and contemporary characters were inserted (unlike Secret Garden or Little Princess) that really crunches teeth together. Were this book published today as-is civil rights groups would be up in arms and I wouldn't blame them. Francis doesn't have King's English speak and some of the characters speak with their accent making it hard to understand.Many have called the book sentimental and I didn't feel that. Too many stereotypes and too many shallow characters with not enough flavor made the book flat.On the positive end the language is richer than expected and I liked that insertion and even politics and class warfare get the light of day.Personally I liked the later reads better than this one."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"LIttle Lord Fauntleroy has a bad rap because of its huge popularity in the late 19th century. Every mother apparently wanted their boy to be as selfless and precocious as the title character, so they dressed the innocent boy in the absurd outfit of the book - the velvet, lace collared affair that scarred a generation.But that misses Burnett's point. She creates a world where a child of American sensibilities - raising all boats as his own tide increases - counters the old British guard which, at the time, was the lord had it all, the villagers had nothing.My two favorite childhood books are A Little Princess and Secret Garden. And while Cedric is a little too perfect, the message and the characterization of sudden wealth leading to actual kindness is refreshing."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is a quick read and very well written.

Our kids need to read good books, to be good people."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Cedric Errol is a seven-year old boy who lives with his mother in the mid-1880s on a \\"New York side street\\" that is described as \\"shabby.\\" His father, also named Cedric Errol had died when the boy was a toddler. It turns out that Captain Cedric Errol was the third son of the very wealthy English Earl of Dorincourt who, when his son went to America and married, cut him off. But the Earl's two older sons have died childless, and now little Cedric is his only male heir, known as Lord Fauntleroy, so he sends his lawyer, Mr. Havisham, to America to bring Cedric and his mother back. Cedric is to live with his grandfather in his castle-like manor house to be trained as an aristocrat, while Mrs. Errol, whom Cedric calls \\"Dearest,\\" is to live in another house on the estate. Cedric can visit her whenever he wishes, but she is not to come to the manor house.During this time, Cedric writes his friends in New York, Mr. Hobbs the grocer and Dick Tipton the bootblack. Then a woman comes, claiming that she was the wife of Bevis, the Earl's oldest son, and had a boy by him who is the real Lord Fauntleroy. What kind of influence will young Cedric have on his crusty old grandfather? How can Dick the bootblack help to determine if the boy of the woman who claims to be the mother of Bevis's son is whom he's claimed to be? And will the Earl ever become reconciled to his daughter-in-law? We have read and enjoyed author Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Little Princess and The Secret Garden. However, Little Lord Fauntleroy was her first children's novel and perhaps best-known title. It was originally published as a serial in the St. Nicholas Magazine between November, 1885, and October, 1886. The accompanying illustrations by Reginald Birch set fashion trends. Also the book set a precedent in copyright law in 1888 when the author won a lawsuit against E. V. Seebohm over the rights to theatrical adaptations of the work.The story is perhaps best known today from a 1936 film starring Freddy Bartholomew as Cedric and featuring Mickey Rooney as Dick Tipton, the Brooklyn bootblack. Like Pollyana and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Little Lord Fauntleroy has been misunderstood, and the term is now sometimes used in derision to describe a pompous spoiled brat, usually a young male, who takes his wealth and privilege for granted. However, this is not consistent with the original character, whose personality could be described as naturally and innocently generous, kind, and friendly. I enjoyed reading the book. There are a few minor references to drinking wine, smoking a pipe, and dancing, but there is also emphasis placed on going to church services and praying. Some people today might think the book hopelessly outdated and completely irrelevant to modern life. However, I believe that children need to read books with characters who exemplify good behavior. The fact is that young people don't have to grow up spoiled and bratty as they're often pictured in many books nowadays. They can be raised to be polite and kind, and Little Lord Fauntleroy is certainly a role model of that kind of deportment toward which we can aim."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an excellent book. The man who wrote the book is called F.H.Burnett (Francis Hodgson Burnett).I read this book because my sister was telling me all day long to read it. Now I have to say thanks to her, because it's a great book, what's more, is one of the best books I've ever read.It is about a boy called Cedric Errol. He's not only intelligent but also kind and beautiful. He used to live with his father and his mother, but his father died, so he started trying to make his mother happier.One day, he was in the corner with her close friend Hobbs (he is a man, not a boy), when the woman that works in his house, Mary, went to the corner to tell to Cedric that he have to return to his house. There he saw a man... This man was called Mr.Havisham, he was the lawyer of Cedric's grandfather. This man was there to go with Cedric and his mother to Dorincourt (that was the castle of his grandfather). Cedric would become a Lord, Lord Fauntleroy. At first, he doesn't like that but then...all the things change.The lawyer of his grandfather gave him a lot of money to do what he wanted. The surprise was that Cedric, instead of buying things for himself, decided to help other people. For example: he helped the old woman that sold apples in the street to buy a shop.When Cedric met his granfather, he thinks that his grandfather is the kindest man in all the world, but this opinion is not the same that the poor people that lives there have.Cedric and the countess become very close. But suddenly, a woman appeared telling to all the people that her son was the real Lord Fauntleroy. This new Lord was very stupid and he was not what we can call \\"beautiful\\". Obviouslly, the countess doesn't accept that this stupid boy was the son of his son, and he starts investigating.Here I have to stop, if not I will tell you all the book, no?.

This one is undoubtedly a classic, it is indeed very good literature, excellently written -- everything the other reviewers have said. Nevertheless, its story, its conflict, its central preoccupation revolves around a very British idea of class: one's \\"quality\\" as a person is determined by one's birth. This is antithetical to the very idea of America and will be much too hard to explain to a child. Yet if I wait until he is older, he will probably be turned off by the idealized, syrupy characterization."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Of course, his Little Lordship was a tad too good to be true (and I've a sneaking suspicion that he'd be what one would consider nowadays as queer - not gay, just weird -- what with sunshine just emanating in smothering waves from him).This story makes for a light, amusing escape. Escape from the ghastliness of how people nowadays treat each other: often with suspicion, bluntness, and - dare I say it - parasitism. \`User-friendly' is practically a code to live by. A person is approached with an eye out for what s/he could possibly *do* for you. Don't know yet what that favor could be? Then just keep that person in one's \\"social network\\" \`til he can prove to be of some worth one day.But the little hero of this story frighteningly succeeds in shaming that aspect of the human condition. And he does nothing more than be naturally warm, steadfastly friendly and loyal, and blessedly oblivious to the coarser nature of those around him. He collects friends *not* because he yearns to be that person who is known to have the \`most-number-of-friends-in-his-friends-list', but because people irresistibly, inevitably, find themselves charmed and absolutely tickled to make his acquaintance.This 7-year old boy is the delight of nannies and the nightmare of school bullies. The first for the obvious reasons: a sweet yet mature disposition; and the second because, even if he gets pummeled at school (which, let's face it, would be more than likely - remember, he calls his mother by the name \`Dearest'), he would just as soon turn to the bully and offer to rehabilitate him, proffering a hand of friendship, honest sympathy and earnestness on his \`golden handsome' countenance. A look of horror would then creep on the bully's face as he gapes at this sickeningly sweet boy who just refuses to cry uncle and is now offering to befriend him. The bully then turns and flees as if the hounds of Beelzebub were at his heels.Taking aside the improbability that someone of Cedric's nature exists anywhere or anywhen in this world (think 'Children of the Corn' gone eerily good), this story is actually more suited for consumption for its message of redemption, friendship, and - bear with me on this - contentment in all things simple."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Not only is it a flimsy book with no illustrations (when the illustrations are quite important to the story), but my copy was missing a page, right before the end. My copy goes straight from \\"his mother on one side and the Earl on t\\" then, new paragraph (skipping 263 words and a whole charming scene where little Cedric thanks everyone), it continues \\"hand into the Earl's and stood close to him.\\"Don't waste your money on this \\"Print on Demand\\" edition; get a good used copy instead."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Have you read Bukowski before? If you have,then stories in this book offer you nothing new orsurprizing. Just a bunch of raw, tender and life-likestories, all written with simple, well working sentences.Reading these stories always provides me great pleasureand I enjoy the possibility to read heavyweight thingsin easy way, without having to battle your my through ajungle of words that actually mean something else thatthey are saying. I'm not much of a friend of uselessplaying around with artistic styles of litterature.(Or something like that...) However, if you HAVEN'Tread B. yet, then I recommend you to do it. See, if thiswriting makes any sense to you and if you like the thingsI am explaining, then you probably LIKE READING THIS BOOK!However, this is by no means, the best thing, thatBukowski has written. But still it is better than mostbooks and/or stories nowadays."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Ok, so this is my first bukowski \\"book\\". After my friend recommended reading one of his books and realizing that modest mouse has a song about him, i thought i'd try him out. Hot Water Music is a great band, and i figured this had to be a great book. Understand though that this is less a book than a collection of short stories. I honestly really enjoyed reading this, it was fun, it was quick, and it was edgy, which is what i like. What i disliked about the book was first i'm not a huge fan of short stories(which is my fault). Also every story has a similiar premise and i wonder if bukowski can write about anything other than\\"guy meets girl, guy has sex with girl, some wierd twisted ending leaving with an oh..um, ok, that was interesting feeling. I'm sure i'm being ignorant about bukowski being that so far this is the only book i've read of his. But i have to give it to him; the stories he does right are definately interesting and i was never bored. Doesn't make you think as much and doesn't attack you emotionally like books i've recently read(requim for a dream, trainspotting); but it's great if you dont want to think much and just want something fun."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Let me say that I am a huge Bukowski fan. I absolutely adore Factotum, Women, Ham On Rye, Hollywood and Post Office. Unfortunately, this book is not of that caliber. In fact, Hot Water Music is so bad that it's hard to read. The stories aren't funny, are very repititious, and are pointless. I would say this book is about as bad as Pulp, which was horrible. Bukowski is just not a fiction writer. He's only good when he writes about his personal experiences. If you have exhausted all his novels and are looking for some decent Buk, South of No North is okay, but forgettable. Notes of a Dirty Old Man also is interesting, even worth rereading. But let this be a warning: Hot Water Music is terrible and so is Pulp, so don't buy them."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"ive already started reading it again, and i just finished it yesterday. i havent quite decided what to make of it, but theres something about it that grabs my attention."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"i'm not sure if a lot of people are aware of this, but there is a band that takes its name from the title of this book. Hot Water Music is an awesome band from Gainesville, FL. Most of their music was released on No Idea Records, but their upcoming album will be released by Epitaph Records. They are an absolutley amazing emocore band. Their words give me strength to fight each day. You folks should really check them out."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"I said this about his Mentor, Fante...\\"This author is always a very Good read... NO DOUBT... Fante as the pre course special to a Bukowski banquet... YES!\\" Now ENJOY the main course... Probably one of the best American authors there is."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Length:: 5:47 MinsCharles Bukowski is always a fun writer to read and I enjoy him very much. I'd put this collection ahead of Tales of Ordinary Madness and South of No North."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"The stories in Hot Water Music are the equivalent of walking through the worst parts of town at the best times, when both ends of the social spectrum empty--the gutters and nice houses--and the scumbags within start to move from bar to bar with a bad attitude, filling their guts with handout bar pretzels and stale popcorn. Bukowski follows these people around for awhile and ditches them before they become old news. These thirty-six stories rarely exceed six-pages, and they don't need to. We get a sense of the vulgarity that rubs its belly near the feet of us all.This is standard Bukowski fare: women, booze, coming to grips with popularity after a life of being shunned and enjoying it. At their worst, these stories are uneventfully bleak (\\"Turkeyneck Morning\\") or just sort of uneventful (\\"In And Out And Over\\"). At their best, these are stories of perverts and weirdos settling for less than what everyone else expects them to. The characters in these stories are drunks, rapists, sexual hounds with pathetic justifications for drinking whatever flows down the curb. Though this collection gets a bit tedious towards the end, the great writing Bukowski cultivated with the previous year's Ham On Rye sees him taking his minimalistic approach to life and language and turning it into a series of blinks past the windows where the shady people dwell."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"As an ardent fan of Bukowski and Henry Chinaski, this by far is my favorite book by Buk. If you haven't read any Bukowski but always wanted to, this is perhaps a great place to start. It's a series of short stories that give you a taste for Buk's writing. You'll either love him or hate him. There's no in between. But if you love this book, then you can look forward to many other fictional pieces by Buk that will delight you. Either that or after about three chapters you will want to go out and get drunk, or get laid! Enjoy! Buk is a God!"},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Gripping stories and poems from a man forged by the tragedies of life. I've read nearly 2 dozen of his books and this is my favorite."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"This collection of short stories is very interesting.

This is what books are meant for: entertaining. I don't expect to find a book that changes my life, i just wanna read stuff i can relate to and this is very enjoyable, also very honest."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Ah, the Drunken Master his own self...here he is at his best, writing pleasingly spare and oft hilarious vignettes of his later life's ramblings through the bars and bedrooms of Hollywood's seedier avenues.Not recommended if you don't like to drink, laugh and/or are easily offended...Buk is as far from politically correct as Santa is from Antartica...but oh man, the laughs that his laconic delivery can produce!His genius also lies in his occasional moments of true clarity...once in a while he flat out nails what it is to be human, male, drunk, or just a bum treading water while waiting for St. Peter's inevitable rejection.Of the great writers in the English language, few other than Chaucer are this saucy and brazen and unabashed...and yes, I think Buk's best work can stand beside Joyce and Hem and Whitman and even the mighty Shake when it comes to revealing some of life's truths. Especially the antisocial male's truths. Bukowski keeps it simple and to the point, and has a special talent for revealing the joys of the mundane...his territory is very much his own, the hallmark of a truly classic writer.Be forewarned, there are some verrrrry edgy moments here...but CB's willingness to confront aspects of the human (well, male--very male) psyche that others dare not go near makes him the unique freak that he is.His poetry comes and goes, as do his novels, though Post Office and Women are classics. His short stories have the most humor and twisted pathos, and this is the best collection, methinks. \\"The Great Poet\\" alone is worth the price of admission. Buk loves to hold the idiocy of fame and our culture's shallowness up to the light...usually the barroom light...and no one else has quite his way with love scenes...if you can call them that...Many women find Bukowski to be a pig. Fair enough. But when you're wondering if your new girl will put up with you in the long run, give her this and wait for the reaction. If she laughs, you're good to go.Warning: this book will make you want to crack a cold one or three, or seven, just to enjoy the happily nihilistic thrill of not giving a damn.I don't reread many books...life is too short, with too many books left to enjoy...but this one gets read at least once a year, usually when I need the solace and joy of drinking a few too many at two in the morning while laughing my ass off.One of the funniest books of all time, if you like your laughs a little warped."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"This work of short stories really got me more interested in Bukowski. I got started on the Buk addiction in a rather strange way - with his last novel \\"PULP\\" (which really is atypical of Charles). My second book was also a novel, \\"Post Office\\"- exquisite stuff. Anyways, these shorts are much more in-line with his Post Office days and leave you wanting to go on a bender and smash something valuable... in a good way of course. If you've never read Bukowski then this book should give you a pretty good flavor of his style (straight-from-the-(beer)-gut, unforgiving amusement for the soul).From my perspective, you can read Bukowski 2 ways: for sheer amusement of a great story teller or as a poet-by-compulsion (or both together, as I prefer). Either way - he's good!"},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"My shelf of Bukowski's poetry and prose is testament to the tremendous pleasure I've taken over the last twenty-five years reading his work. He's unique, and although at first he may strike you as a guilty pleasure at best, he's profound. He's also detested by some -- especially women who consider him misogynistic. Decide for yourself, but don't judge him by this book, which is about as close to hack work as he's come -- although Bukowski's hack work beats a lots of others' best. Try Women, The Most Beautiful Woman in Town, or Mockingbird Wish Me Luck."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"The only Bukowski stuff that is \\"bad\\" is the stuff published long after his death. It is no longer has an organic feel and much of it is churned out, so it seems, to make money. This volume was published during his lifetime, so it is very much worth a look and a read."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"I am quite the fan of Bukowski. I enjoyed Factotum, Pulp, and Post Office in particular, and I think Ham On Rye is a work of art. Perhaps the only real catch to Bukowski's work is that he is something of a one trick pony. Don't get me wrong, though. It's still a good trick.Where Bukowski fails in his writing (when he fails at all) is when he allows his nihilism to devolve into creative redundancy. He doesn't have very many points to make, and sometimes he tends to make them in the same way. Still, the man is a craftsman when it comes to the rough-hewn and the unflinching gaze of existentialism.This is why I was disappointed by Hot Water Music.Bukowski's themes (which are a lot deeper than just drunkeness, sex, ambivalence, and poverty, as some of the other reviews here seem to suggest) translate remarkably well when they are drawn out novelistically by his crisp, spare prose and his dry, gritty dialogue. In his books he takes his time teasing his message out of dark shadows and, when it is exposed to the light, he crushes its skull with a sledgehammer.Short stories, of course, don't give him as much leisure for dilly-dallying, and as a result his work here is blunter (inasumcuh as that's possible) and duller and far more repetitive. The majority of these stories are about, of course, ambiently depressed alcoholics who haven't the motivation or energy to do anything but keep digging their own grave. You read enough stories about soused women farting and horny men with hemorrhoids and your head starts to swim. Some people might argue that these stories are meant simply to be funny, and depending on your sense of humor, they are -- but no one likes to hear the same joke told ten, twelve, or twenty times in a row. Unless, of course, you really really like the joke.The more absurd pieces (You Kissed Lilly, Strokes to Nowhere, and I Love You, Albert) are fun enough, and although their playfulness tends to be vacuous, they are still chewy enough to be enjoyable. And there are really some remarkably subtle and clever stories here as well. Most notable among these are Cold Night, The Upward Bird, Beer at the Corner Bar, The Death of the Father II, In and Out and Over, and Head Job.In these Bukowski trades in his usual and obvious attempts at crassness and crudity for a more ghostly skill: the stories are delivered with his typical point-blank attitude, but their profundity is couched without bravado or brassiness. His short stories work best when they avoid the more blatant trademarks of his novels -- liquor-soaked abuse and disdain. Head Job, especially, is notable for being the first time that I have ever read Bukowski write something from a woman's point of view, and he does it admirably.This is a decent but repetitive collection of stories, with gems interspersed throughout, but the overall impression is mostly lukewarm, although hardcore fans will love it."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"Bukowski strikes again! This time with some of the dirtiest, yet hilarious tales he has to tell. This old drunk creates some of the most vivid and wild stories that you can imagine and you can't help but laugh at them.Buk goes places here that only the mentally ill are capable of imagining. He does so with the help of booze and cigarettes and puts a dirty spin on everything. Just when you think the stories can't get any better (read: dirtier), they do. Keep in mind though, if you have never read Bukowski, you may want to reconsider if you are easily offended or are unable to appreciated the more disgusted aspects of life. Trust me, he touches, caresses, and even ejaculates on all the touchy subjects. Just when you think it has been pushed to the limit and shouldn't go any further, old Buk puts the pedal down and goes to the edge of comic genius.If you're in need of a laugh and are happy reading stories from a dirty old man, this is your book hands down. At this price you are surely going to get your monies worth and then some. Be prepared to go down the steep steep slope of endless laughs."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"i've read every single bukowski novel and short story collection, as well as a bunch of his poetry. for some reason, this book sticks out as my favorite. As far as his short story collections go, this is a really strong collection of him during his peak creative period.read it twice."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"I recently saw the movie barfly and I was totally entertained and wanted to know more about the person behind the script, hence, Charles Bukowski. His writing is rapid fire and from the gut. I have a tape of his from when he gave a poetry reading and you can tell he talks like he writes. Truly a significant talent. I am now reading one Bukowski after another. Another favorite of short stories is &quot;Tales of a dirty old man&quot;. There are some stories I have read from him that STILL have me laughing at just the thought of them, 3 months after reading them. He is the underground genius of American literature."},{"Title":"Hot Water Music","review":"This was a very interesting book!

As a 40 year old woman I wanted to feel for the main character and feel there was some sense of morality in the story. But I was disappointed I'm afraid. In fact, I actually disliked just about every character in this book apart from Ruth.They were all so whiney, weak and hypocritical. The main character Natalie being one of the worst offenders. All in all, I just couldn't like these people.Add to that the amount of sections I found boring and tedious, that I had to skim through, and I guess I wish the book had been about 100 pages shorter. I suggest cutting down some of the length and making the main character more likeable. Then the story might just appeal."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I realize this was the author's first novel and perhaps future novels will be better researched and written. I gave it two stars for the effort. I found it to be contrived and trite in much of it's phrasing and an unsatisfying ending. You never were made to care about the characters which is a must for any good novel and inconsistent in the way the characters were portrayed. At this point I would be very reluctant to read another novel by this author."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I did not enjoy this book and gave up on it after reading 20%.

I liked all the characters and their development. There were plenty of surprises and the things I saw coming were nicely done too. What a great book to take to the beach or spend a rainy day with."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Some vague spoilers ahead...although since I'm characterizing the book as \\"predictable,\\" they shouldn't come as a huge surprise...THE GOOD: I read this yesterday (skimmed a lot of the 2nd half), and once I started, I couldn't stop. So Dempsey knows how to hook a reader in, and she throws some really nasty curveballs at her heroine, Natalie, which keep you reading. Natalie is capable and likable. If you like happy endings, everything possibly good that could happen to the heroine does so in the end, and the evil people get their downfalls, with a bit of cushioning.THE BAD: One-dimensional characters and predictable plot. Regarding characters: The three \\"evil\\" characters are Kelly, Tony, and Miles. None of them have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. We're basically told to hate these people and we do, without any kind of depth or ethical questions. The heroine, Natalie, is only flawed in being an \\"ice queen\\" type, messing up when she gets nervous, and being older than the average anchor and thus in danger of losing her position. Although I liked her, she wasn't a deep or particularly interesting heroine, and although the end brought lots of external changes, I don't really know how she changed internally.Regarding plot: after the first couple chapters I knew more or less what bad things would happen and more or less how they would resolve. It was just a matter of time waiting for the characters to realize those same things and get on with it. But then the ending I thought laid it on a bit thick, so much so that any thread of plausibility I had maintained swiftly snapped. I didn't think it necessary to give her a million job options, the hunky guy, the comeuppance of all her foes, AND 1.5 million bucks out of nowhere to boot.THE BALANCE: It's predictable, but not any more so than thousands of other romance titles, and I think the writing is better than average. I would read more by this author. It seems her later books have higher ratings than this debut one, so I would definitely be willing to give another one a try."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I found this book very good light reading for someone with general reading tastes as I have, a nice story that left me satisfied at having read a good book."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book so much!

Not fluffy, but very entertaining.I immediately bought all her other Kindle books.After reading the author's bio on her website, I look forward to more interesting and well written fiction.

Definitely worth your time reading!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was a good first novel by a new author, even for someone who usually reads only paranormal fiction.

It is so contemporary that you will just enjoy the books many characters and actions."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Full disclosure, i know the author. Would not have picked this book up otherwise, but am so glad i did. The characters were compelling, you either love them or love to hate them. The storyline had depth and twists which make it almost impossible to put the book down. The ending is great fun, though it comes too fast.You WILL enjoy this book. Best I have read since Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"What a whiner. Your husband leaves you for another woman, and after you find him trying to get into your house you go ahead and let him in, sleep with him with no apology for the affair necessary, and then are surprised to wake up alone and oh, maybe some important documents are missing from your safe. Then of course you run into the ex and his girlfriend at dinner and have to leave from all the anger you're feeling. Everything is so awful, why am I reading this? Oh, that's right. I'm not. There are too many good books in the world to waste my time on this one!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This is not dreadful, and it is at least free, but it's not good either.The main character is annoying and whiny - her main problem is the prospect of not having her contract for THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS renewed, and that's when the eye-rolling started.She does some really stupid things, such as sleeping with her ex when he randomly turns up at her house (yeah, that's going to end well...) and she spends a lot of time whining about how difficult her life will be when she's not earning a fortune and receiving the adulation of her fans. Pullease.Most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts or total stereotypes. All but one or maybe two have no depth whatsoever... which would be less annoying if the main character was someone I could bring myselfto like/root for, but she has precious little to her as well.The plot is predictable - there was at least one thing that felt like it was supposed to be a big surprise and really wasn't even slightly surprising to me.Basically, it's classically escapist chicklit, not very well done. All this plus some really poor proofreading made me give up on seriously reading it at less than 50% through: I skimmed through the rest to confirm that the whole thing unwinds just as I'd expected, and the main character didn't get remotely more likeable.There are often typos in Kindle books, especially freebies, but it just added to the reasons not to carry on. Things like \\"ms\\" for \\"his\\", and a character being told that she \\"failed to repent that a man was dead\\" - there was even a moment when a character was annoyed that someone else was getting \\"all die airtime\\"... hmmm!If you can find some sympathy for someone facing a tiny bit less luxurious lifestyle and enjoy escaping to the entertainment industry then you might enjoy this, but in the end, there are much better books out there - even among the freebies. Disappointing waste of time."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Although the story was decent, the book needed serious proof reading and the story went on and on. I stopped reading this book half way through to read another book and only finished the book because it was still on my kindle.

Again I am glad I didn't pay for it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This debut novel by the Author Diana Dempsey is about what goes behind a television newsroom.

I'm enjoying all the insights into the television news field."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"As a twenty somethimg professional I found this heroine incredibly refreshing. The plot kept me interested and didn't rely on smut which I often find patronising. This was the first time I had read the author-the sample captured my attention and the rest of the book did not disappoint. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an engrossing read and I will definitly look up more of this author's work."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Can't get into the story, and have put it down after 3 chapters, Hope to pick it up again and finish it. It just has to get better."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It has a great story line, is well written and had an interesting end. It is worth the read"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was definitely a beach read or maybe just a curl up under a blanket near the fire read. It was sweet, funny & real. Loved the friendships and the dynamics between all the characters."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I guess the first book you read on your kindle is usually outstanding. This was a great story, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"i wanted to try getting something that would help me get familiar with my kindle so I purchased this because of price point and ended up loving it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book stayed on my Kindle for quite some time before I finally decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Excellent story telling, never a dull moment and a great ending to what seemed like a never-ending downward spiral for the main character. This is an arthur to keep an eye on. . . \\"Falling Star\\" definitely holds a spot on my keeper shelf. JMHO!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was my first book by the author. I really thought I might NOT like it, but was pleasantly surprised. Loved it. It had a very interesting plot. Normally I wouldn't like a book about newscasting world, or so I thought. Good book for us chicks. Not smutty."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Fast paced, entertaining read with great unexpected twists and turns! I will definitely be checking out other titles from this author!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I am a voracious reader and I have Kindle on my Android phone. I loaded this book one night when I was unable to sleep. This was a page turner, for sure!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had a little bit of everything...romance, devious characters. It was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Quick easy read...entertaining. Has romance in it but it is not the main focus of the book. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"i really enjoyed this book, infact i couldnt put it down. it was a combination of a great story, believable characters and even gave the reader an insight into the world of tv news. i highly recommend that you read this book. am now off to look for more books by this author ."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't wait to see what happened at the end! Loved all the characters even if they were bad!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book will make you wanna punch a wall at one point, then jump up and down with joy at another."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I got this book because it was free and figured I'd at least give it a shot. It was much better than I expected and I finished it in in a few days. Great summer fun read! Had some great twists to keep you interested and wasn't overly sappy or girly. Highly suggest!!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I read this on a trip and it was so good I didn't want to put it down. It kept my attendtion and I am hoping for a followup book because I liked the characters."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I have read so many poorly written free books for Kindle that it was a pleasure to read \\"Falling Star\\". This book (about 400 pages)was well written, the story line well thought out, and it was great fun to see the result of \\"what goes around\\" actually come around.I noticed a review that remarked about editing errors which, in the copy I just read, had been corrected (thank you, Diana). I also didn't think that Natalie was a whiner. The breakup of a marriage should be a big emotional hurdle but she didn't let it rule or ruin her life. She went on in spite of it, and all the rest of the problems that heaped upon her.I'll definitely be looking for more books by Ms. Dempsey!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was a great book!!! Well written, good plot twists and fun to read. I got it for free but would have certainly paid for it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"What a great story line - I loved the added element of a younger man and a younger woman. Falling Star had me hooked from the beginning. I loved the characters and the story in general. This is the first book I've read by this author, but will definitely read more of her books!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I loved this book! After reading it I immediatly had to buy the other two by Diana Dempsey (\\"Too Close to the Sun\\" and \\"Chasing Venus\\"). While this is an entertaining read for females, I can't imagine my husband would like it! It's got some mystery, some romance, some drama, and some parts that made me giggle. That's my kind of book!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The main character was someone I could really relate to and the plot moved very well. I also enjoyed learning about the television news business and it was obvious the writer was well-involved with it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I enjoyed it. It was an interessting story. The vilain was a bitch which gave the story some spice. The story needed to be about 1/3. Shorter. The same thoughts were repeated over an over from different angles which was excessive. overall it was good."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Good fun read, Some of the spelling errors were slightly annoying, and it was a predictable plot but I still enjoyed it; kept me good company on an otherwise boring flight."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Falling Star was the first book I've read by Diana Dempsey. Like other other reviewers, I found the book entertaining, easy to read, and overall a good (although predictable) plot. Also like other reviewers, I was somewhat disappointed in the Kindle version with many format issues. However, as a reminder.....it was on the FREE list and not so distracting it lessened the enjoyment of reading. My one complaint is how the book ended. Yes, Natalie did prevail all her obstacles, and even snagged the handsome hero and helped the evil twits get their just rewards.The one thing I either missed, or perhaps was preoccupied and didn't catch, is which professional opportunity she chose. I'm wondering if I clicked on a page forward and missed it or if the author left it for the reader to decide. In any event, I felt a little disappointed to have devoted a couple of evenings reading Ms. Dempsey's book only to be left in the lurch at the very end. It was hard to wrap my head around which direction Natalie's life ultimately took.Otherwise, I would recommend this book to others and will likely read another book by Diana Dempsey before making a judgment of whether or not her works will find a place in my library."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was a good book. The characters were easy to relate to, and the plot was good. The dynamic between Natalie and all those around her made me want to keep reading the book to see how things would end for her. I agree with a few of the other reviews, though, the poor editing did make the book hard to read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I love over the top characters and the nemesis talking head was so evil she made me laugh. What a great FREE book!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I got this as a freebie. A few grammatical errors, nothing major. Well written, especially in the telling of how the news industry works. The love story was not full or fleshed out for my taste. I do believe we see the female lead grow as a person and as a woman during the story. The leading man was also not very deep in personality. Overall, I read and finished the book in a couple of days."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The book was a tad too long, yet it left some loose ends. Maybe a future novel will follow up those story lines? It was a pretty good first effort; good enough that I will buy the author's other books"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I enjoyed \\"Falling Star\\" though I agree with other reviewers that it could have benefited from more attentive editing. The story line is well paced and, toward the end, the book is hard to put down. I thought that the two prominent \\"evil\\" characters were a bit overdrawn, especially Kelly. Still, Dempsey offers a compelling dramatization of the moral and ethical struggles in a high-profile newsroom (e.g., individual vs. team; greed vs. sacrifice) and even manages to weave in a romantic love story.Ken"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was my first kindle read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A great read, an easy read....an author that I will most definitely be following."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I rarely read romance, but this novel does not read like romance. The characters are complex and the plot is interesting. The book kept me engaged. I would read more of what this author has written. One thing though--the author needs to have the novel proofread--I found at least a dozen English errors."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I was sad when this book ended. I could have read about the characters forever! It was soo good!!!! I cannot wait to read more of her books!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this novel by Diana Dempsey and find it hard to believe it is her debut effort as the standard of writing - the fun, the drama and the pathos is so darned good. The characters are mad, delightful in some of their awful way - and I was vastly relieved when it finished the way I wanted it to!Great stuff, sizzling read and I shall be watching for more of this author's work."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"As I started reading \\"Falling Star\\" I found myself really enjoying the story. The characters you wanted to like you did and the ones you wanted to not like you didn't. Ms Dempsey does an amazing job with her characters. It may have been a little predictable but it was still a good read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I stayed up all night to finish this book. OK, it is just a basic romance, but it was filled with genuine emotion and I really liked the characters. I can see how women in their 20's might not identify with a 40 year old protagonist, but I absolutely liked her and the other main characters in the story. Clearly Ms. Dempsey brought her knowledge of the television news world to this book and I was happy to get an inside peek at how things work in broadcast news.Earlier reviews have complained about the editing of this book. It must have been cleaned up because I only remember seeing one typo. The book flowed smoothly. I was very impressed. For a first book, I thought the author did a great job and I'm looking forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I wasn't very excited about this book as I started reading it (thinking it to be of a Judith Krantz genre -- entertaining but ultimately light 'female' read) but I was pleasantly surprised. It kind of grabbed me as I went along and by the end I really enjoyed the story. Apart from the writing, I liked the fact that the book made me reflect upon the step-motherly kind of treatment we give to women over a certain age in news anchoring, even though they might be more qualified and able than their male counterparts or younger female replacements. It's a sad society we live in if all we care about is seeing a pretty woman on TV rather than the news that she is able to provide. Looks trump information in this age of show business."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"i enjoyed this book. the only draw back was the length which was too short. A longer story would have allowed more character and story development and stopped the feeling that the ending was rushed."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I'm at the point where I read for entertainment. This book was entertaining. It was free on Kindle and gave me two nights of escape to the world of TV news LA style. I didn't necessarily like the characterization of an extremely successful 40 year old woman who is so depressed about her age and insecure about life. Then again, all the characters were stereotypes. Still, it was fast-paced enough not to dwell on the lack of original characters. And in the end, I read it all quickly and liked it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really liked this book - I usually only read before I go to sleep and my sign of a great gripping story is when I look forward to going to bed early enough to fit in a few chapters. I found the pace of the book perfect. The author doesn't let events/scenes in the book drag on - she writes in a concise way but still manages to develop the characters so well. Every so often I would read a sentence or a turn of phrase that was new and creative. All in all, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Was a really good read. For us older women, I could relate and it really does go on in the work place today. Older women are cast aside for the younger ones and I was so angry at Tony, one of the characters in the book, that I wanted to jump in the pages and ring his neck. I couldn't put the book done. It was awesome....."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book was a good, enjoyable, light hearted read. I stayed up late to finish it. It hit the spot for something fun to read after I have been reading mysteries. It made me want to go on a \\"chick lit\\" kick for a while."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"What the heck...it was free! Then I found myself thinking about the characters all day long--couldn't wait to get back to it--the story is compelling and you are left wishing you could find out what the lead character ends up doing and how her romance turns out! Great read--ala Jackie Collins/Danielle Steele!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I actually only downloaded this book because it was free but it is by far the best book I've read this summer. It's chick-lit but the characters and stories are much more developed than in a typical chick-lit novel. Great story line and I plan on reading this author's other books now. It's a great summer vacation book :)"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I read anywhere from 5 to 10 books a week and was utterly amazed that this was a first for this writer. The characters were very realistic and enjoyable, even those whom you didn't really like.I am especially appreciative of subject matter much more entertaining than the fantasy,vampire and paranormal subject matter in so many of todays books!! Thanks for an especially entertaining and educating read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This is the first book I read via Kindle for Android and let me just say i'm not disappointed! This was a wonderful book! It held my attention and I didn't want to stop reading! The characters were believable and engaging. I got caught up in the story and really felt a kinship with Natalie Daniels, the protagonist. It's unpredictable and fresh! I DEFINITELY recommend!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"To make a long story short it was exactly what the preview promised: interesting and entertaining. I would certainly recommend it to anyone out there."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed Falling Star. I found it to be an entertaining read, and the Kelly character was right on target for those of us who have found ourselves competing nose-to-nose with that type of human. (I would say it brought back memories but I believe I have managed to permanently suppress them!)Really fun read! I totally recommend it, and just purchased another novel from Diana Dempsey."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Just as the other reviewers have outlined, this is a fast paced book that is hard to put down. I missed my metro stop I was so involved in the plot. The author has a gift for bringing characters to life. The interactions between the characters are very enjoyable. It makes you think about the local news anchors in your city.I would be very interested in reading more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I loooove love loved this book! I was if-y about it being a free book, but I gave in and downloaded it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down. I was up till 3am because I had to finish before I could sleep. You go through all the emtions with each character. You want so badly for things to get better for Natalie and glad she doesn't give up without a fight. The behind-the-scenes of a news broadcast was great too. A lot more goes on than you think. I'm so glad I ended up getting this book and look forward to reading more by Diana Dempsey. For a more detailed/opinionated review check out my blog this friday (7/22) Chick Lit=The New Black"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book was excellent. The dust gathered on the furniture, but who cared? I had to finish the book. There were several mis-spelled words, but I had to overlook it. I will be looking for more from this author."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I 'bought' this book for my kindle thinking I had little to lose if it wasn't good since it was free. And honestly, I was sucked in the first chapter and have loved it.The writers descriptions of LA's freeways and Pasadena were great - being that I've lived there, it made it even more fun to read.I enjoyed how Dempsey characterizes the LA mentality and lifestyle and shortcomings despite the glamour. All in all, a great summer read!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I'm not done reading this yet, but so far it's very good and well written. Unique plot, and the story gives a great overview of the life of a broadcaster. I'd highly recommend this book to both male & female readers."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Although this is not typical of the books I read, Dorothy loaded it on my Kindle while I was reading a story on hers. This proved to be an excellent story. Daniels writes as a professional novelist; this book is truly surprising for a first effort. I very much enjoyed her protagonist, Natalie Daniels, and her agent, Geoff Marner. I really liked her character development. She never told us that Kelly Devlin was a backstabbing, despicable person. Instead Diana Dempsey described Kelly's actions time and again to show us her lack of humanity and totally self-centered character. I liked the contrast of \\"Nat's\\" news director, Tony Scoppio, between his work persona and his home life. Five stars, Diana! Great read!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"A quick and entertaining read - I loved the quirky characters and the fun plot. I highly recommend this author. A+"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Natalie is a veteran 40-year old TV news anchor in LA whose contract is up for renewal. Natalie is in crisis because she realizes that 40 is old for a woman in TV news and her personal life is in shambles, due to pending divorce. The station she works for is looking to save money on her contract and replace her with a younger, fresher face. She has to deal with the machinations of the station news director and Kelly, a former mentee, who wants her job. Kelly is the kind of woman decent women hate -- young, pretty, but with the instincts of a shark and the kind of person who would run her mother over with a truck to get ahead. Tony, the news director, could be the original boss from hell.I found Falling Star funny and engaging. There were certain plot points that were a little obvious, where I wondered how Natalie could be so dumb. And all the stuff with her agent/lawyer dragged on too long. But overall, it was a very well written romance and I was surprised that this was a first novel."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I read this book during a LONG car trip to Florida. (Actually, my sister read it out loud to me) We both enjoyed the story. I found myself smiling a lot, and I loved the characters. For a light woman's fiction read, I would recommend it. I think it would make a good movie too."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book had me hooked from the beginning. I loved the characters and the story in general. This is the first book I've read by this author, but will definitely read more of her books!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book is great to take on a holiday, relationship dramas, fun and insight into the journalism industry. Easy read and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I loved the read. I felt sorta bad for janet but hell she's not real lol! But to the author: wonderful job."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I'll admit I had a bit of trouble getting \\"into\\" the story at first. But it was good enough to keep me reading and then it just took off. I had no trouble at all reading it through at that point and was glad I did. It's a good story, and the characters were well developed and totally took me in. Worth reading."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book was fun to read and had an interesting twist to it. I liked the descriptions especially in terms of the location where the book takes place. Overall an easy read - I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Enjoyed Dempsey's book, Falling Star. A lesson that good things do happen to good people. All the villains in this book, got what they deserved."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"A nice look into the industry and its issues with a nice bit of intrigue and a touch of well placed romance. I really appreciate how the story line was not propelled by the romance but by the character and the happenings regarding tangible, believable issues.The romantic parts were not overdone, nicely sprinkled in."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Story is so true to life from the beginning. Natalie's problems start and don't stop until she realizes she can change the outcome. She is headstrong and smart. Easy read because it kept you wondering what she'd go through next...and how she would 'handle it'."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Set back after set back kept me guessing. This book got me looking for other books by Diana Dempsey to read. I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book is fantastic; if you're a woman of a certain age it will tick all the boxes, and if you're younger you need to heed the warning! This story of a woman excelling in her chosen profession, yet facing discrimination because of her age and her sex, is a moving and powerful one. Most women reading this book will be nodding in agreement as they witness the sexism and ageism practiced by the heroine's boss. Haven't we all met one just like him? Read this book if it's the only one you read before Christmas! It will do your heart good to see how this classy heroine deals with the situation and regains her pride and dignity."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I thought the book was very intertaining, but not blood and gut and gore. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those of you who like J. D. Robb or Janet Evanovich."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really liked this book. It was interesting to read and it's written really well. I had just visited LA for the first time from Australia before I read this book and I loved that I knew the streets and places she wrote about and could really imagine the story well. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I did not think I would like a book that was free but after the reviews , thought what the heck..might as well try. I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest all the way though. I work at a TV station and although not an anchor, after 33 years, I know all sides of the business and she was spot on with her descriptions. One after reading did I find out the author was an anchor. Great book. Most will not be disappointed !"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"With a title like \\"Falling Star\\" I was worried that the book would be a downhill slide all the way to a crashing end. Though it had its fair share of the dreaded descent, I was pleased with the way the book ended.I've always been one who has rooted for the underdog so I spent the majority of my reading time cheering on the main character, Natalie. It was great to have one or two characters in the story that I loved to hate: Kelly and Tony, and it didn't hurt that one of them was a boss! Many of us have had a supervisor in our lives who has gotten our goat. This book allowed me to envision at least one of those people and mentally vent about him or her without any negative results.My only complaint about the book is that I'm not a fan of swearing. There were a number of places in the book that included one of my most-disliked of all swear words and I don't believe the story benefitted by its use. The same effect could have been presented with less vulgarity and the plot would not have lost its power to captivate readers to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I got this book because it was free, I was surprised that it was so well written. It was a good story, little predictable but a good read. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Don't ask me how this book ended up on my wish list, much less in my cart, because I honestly don't remember. Of course, I HAD to put it there. But I'm sure glad I did. I love to read debut novels, it absolutely thrills me. Especially when I get my hands on a good book like \\"Falling Star\\". I can't compliment Diana Dempsey enough on her first effort. She's very knowledgeable about the world of television news network, and she definitely has a way with prose to create a writing style of her very own. The ups and downs in the life of TV news anchor, Natalie Daniels, will make a reader want to keep going, page after page, to see what can possibly happen next to this woman. It's a great plot with great characters, well written, and a great read.I just this evening ordered two other novels written by Diana Dempsey. That's how impressed with her talent that I am.Congrats, Diana, on a job well done."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews of this book. I wasn't really rooting for Natalie so much as I was rooting against Kelly, Tony, and Miles. All in all, the plot was interesting and kept me reading. However, it became tedious to read through all the filler material that was irrelevant to the plot. The biggest hurdle for me was the extremely poor editing. I read this on my Kindle, so the editing may have been better in print form. However, names were spelled differently throughout the book (Maxine/Marine), and the wrong words were used throughout. The book is in definite need of a proofread. The plot is the only thing that kept me trudging through."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this novel by Diana Dempsey. I have read many things as a mid thirties male and I never recall that I ever had any interest in reading a romantic novel. However, after purchasing a new kindle, I looked for both top selling paid and free books and this book was one of the top free ebooks avaialble from Amazon.com. I browsed through the description and thought, you know, this might be interesting. As a guy, I have long held an interest in news and communications and most guys will tell you they are addicted to the news and the media, so perhaps this might be a good match as the story was centered around a newscaster. After a quick download, I was really taken aback at how easy it was to connect with Diana's characters and how expertly done the character development was. By the end of the novel, you could really relate to Natalie and her struggles and as a guy, I could really relate to the massive conflict in Geoff's life.One thing that is nice about Diana's writing style is that there are just enough details to paint a good picture of the scenes and the surroundings without being too verbose. This makes the pacing fun and fast and doesn't really drag down or slow the tempo of the story at all. Some authors go off the deep end with the details and that can really bog a story down.Falling Star has been one of the more entertaining novels I have read in a long time. Although I prefer miltary and espionage novels mostly, it was nice to read something fun and this book is not just another romantic novel. Its a crazy thrill ride that makes you hanging on for the next crazy development. I have to say that once I started to read Falling Star, I couldn't put it down and after I finished, I purchased all of Diana's books. I hope you will love this fun, thrilling, sexy and crazy story as much as I did and I look forward to more of Diana's works."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Love her style. I train journalists and am getting so much more insight into what's going on in their lives. Wonderful storylines and characters. Another author I can't read when I'm busy and need to get up early."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really liked this book. It brought the book to life for me and I'm sure others would say the same. The author wrote from her her own experiences and that really grabbed my attention. Her book kept my attention not only with the vivid pictures it painted for my eyes, but also with the characters and their constantly changing problems. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone that wants a good read and enjoys the entertainment business."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Make way for Diana Dempsey who shares her intimate knowledge of the cutthroat world of TV news in Falling Star. Dempsey, a former LA news anchor, has penned an exciting story about KXLA anchorwoman Natalie Daniels, who is about to be dumped as she approaches her fortieth birthday. News director Tony Scoppio is the baddie who feels youth and beauty are more important than talent and brains. He wants to replace Natalie with her protege, Kelly Devlin, a scheming reporter who will stop at nothing to get Natalie's job.How Natalie copes with her job crisis, a husband who has dumped her, an agent she's attracted to but who's marrying someone else, and a slew of vicious rumors about her mental stability, makes for a fast-paced, ... read from Ms. Dempsey, a rising star who understands the world of television news from the ground up.Kudos for a brilliant first novel from a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I don't often read a book that has me talking to it like you do to one of those great fun movies... You know the kind, where you sit there and say:Oh he's dead...Yep she did it...Oh please you can't be that stupid...No, no don't go in there...Can't you see he is lying to you...From the very beginning I was sooo on Natalie side and thought I would die if the book ended with her on the internet with no man.. I fell for Geoff right off the bat and just knew he really loved Nat... But he just wasn't cooperating. Tony was a sleeze, and Kelly was a sociopath...I couldn't put it down.... Just Loved it..."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I actually loved the novel. It was a long read but I just felt I had to keep on reading to find out whats going to happen next which made it exciting! The only issue about this book is that there were some typos that needed to be reviewed and corrected. Other than that, I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This is why I LOVE my Kindle!I totally, thoroughly, completely enjoyed this novel! It was well constructed and the characters were believable. What a great debut for this author. I will definitely look for more of her work in the future."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I ordered Falling Star through ebooks on my Kindle. That was a little over 6 hours ago. I just finished reading what was a great summer read. Ms. Dempsey makes the characters in the book come to life. She makes you like them and hate some of them as well. I throughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from Ms. Dempsey."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Never in Natalie's 18 years in news, has she been in jeopardy of losing her contract to a station. Her new boss, Tony Scoppio, is out to take her down a few notches. Maybe even make her leave her \\"throne\\" for good. To make matters worse, Scoppio is replaced at the anchor desk by the same woman she mentored who is younger than her.Kelly is edgy and goes by the beat of her own drum like filming an accident and not reporting it correctly. Thinking everything is working out for her, it all backfires and works in favor of Natalie.Throughout all the craziness going on in Natalie's life, her agent, Geoff, sticks by her side. That is all well and good until they end up in bed together. And then she finds out he not only has a girlfriend, but he is about to propose to her. Can they still maintain their business relationship and both make it out of this situation without broken hearts?MY REVIEW:Ok so...I was not a big fan of this book. It was for the most part pretty good but I feel like it was more of a dramatic novel and not a romance. It did have some romance but not like what I'm used to reading. I wasn't a big fan of how it was written either. It kept jumping back between characters and I know it was necessary to the story but I just wasn't feeling it. All in all I didn't think it was that great."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The first 2/3 of this book is utterly depressing. I understand people have rough patches in live but the main character, Natalie, had a ridiculous amount of opposition. The ending was good but I think the story should have been shortened. It was just too much drama."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I downloaded this as a free ebook for my iPad and I am glad I didn't pay for it. Mildly interesting and fairly well-written, but overly drawn out at times, and I couldn't find much to like about the protagonist. The character development was weak - not much depth to any of them. The plot line was okay, but very predictable for the most part. I can't really recommend spending the time to read this, even if it is free."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The premise of this story was fair and the writing wasn't too bad, but I quit reading half-way through because I was getting so bogged down in the excessive similes and news jargon. If the author can clean up her writing and stay away from the jargon, she could be a really good read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Seeing so many positive reviews, I was pretty disappointed by the book. Like someone else mentioned, I plodded on just to find out what happened to the antagonists, not necessarily because the main character was compelling. I can understand why a few readers were unable to get through the story though. I also skimmed toward the middle through to the end."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Yes, the grammatical errors were annoying, as was the female protagonist (at times). Overall, the book was ok; it's good for a beach read--light and fluffy. I thought the plot dragged on for a bit, and eventually I really didn't care if things worked out for Natalie or not. And in all honesty, I really wasn't rooting for her to end up with Geoffrey. For a freebie, the book isn't bad, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend money on it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I cannot complain enough about the horrendous editing that was (not) done. There were so many misplaced and misspelled words that it really detracted from the enjoyment of the read. Please edit, re-edit, and edit again before you release your work."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I downloaded this book because it was offered for free. This was a good read; a very enjoyable story with strong characters. I am looking forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"The book starts off okay. However, it bogs down early into the book. I felt like the writer was getting paid by the word.I read about 20% into the novel, stopped and skipped to about 95% into the novel. I didn't have a bit of a problem picking up the plot. Plus, all those things one knows will happen from the beginning of the book do happen.Any book that I can flip to the end, not be lost, and find completely predictable is not a book I can recommend.If the verbage had been reduced to novella length, it would have been much better.I also never cared about the heroine. One isn't expected to like the heroine in every book, but I'm pretty sure the reader was supposed to like this one."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I read about 1/3 of this book and couldn't care less about any of the characters. Does anyone really care about the female talking heads who read the and who mostly look alike: blonde, blue eyed, no personality? I tried and tried to get through it, but I finally deleted it from my Kindle."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"While I have never heard of the author before I am glad that I downloaded this book because I was hooked from the first page on. I found myself rooting for the heroine and booing her several rivals. This book made me laugh, it made me cry and at times it even made me angry but one thing that it didn't make me was to want to put it down. I can't wait to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I really loved this book. A little romance, comedy, and action. The only thing that I don't like is having to wait for the next book for the story to continue..."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"It was gratifying to read a free Kindle book that was not riddled with typos and grammar and punctuation errors! The characters were developed masterfully, and although Natalie was not my favorite for most of the book, she was \\"real,\\" so I was happy for her in the end. Nicely done! I looked forward to finishing this book!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"In my role as a book reviewer, I've read more than 1500 books for evaluation. You'd think I'd be burned out on reading by now, but I'm not. This was a refreshing title with an engaging heroine. Yes, it's a bit predictable, but is a great summer read."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book, far into the night. I agree with some of the other reviewers that I couldn't waitfor justice to be served to Kelly, Miles, and Tony. Ms. Dempsey skillfully kept us in suspense as the plot unfolded.I would highly recommend for a great read. Bonnie Drury, author of The Ata Bita Pie Cafe"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"\\"Falling Star\\" is a very pleasant book to read. Filled with the intrigue between a most successful and experimented anchor, Natalie, and a young reporter willing to take her place. The network news director was plotting to replace the anchor for the younger and beautiful Kelly. In addition, he plotted to prevent Natalie to have another job option and assure the network an expertise coverage. Even though pleasant to read, there is a criticism I would like to make: the bride being left at the church by the groom is a common and poor scene that could be left aside for the benefit to the whole context of this book."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I liked the book. I was pleased to find there ARE good books out there for kindle that are free and this one was worth the read. I liked the characters they were believeable and the plot, while it did have its moments, was certainly true-to-life and made it interesting. All in all, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Great read. This book is fast paced, detailed and very enjoyable. The characters come alive and you can see them on the pages."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Falling Star is about 40-year-old Natalie who finds herself demoted from her job as a news anchor. Natalie's husband leaves her, and she is not able to find another news anchor job after her employer spreads the word that she is mentally ill. The novel moves at a steady pace, and is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This was my first time reading A Diana Dempsey offering. I have to say it kept me turning the pages. Made me laugh, made me cry and it made me mad. But being a romantic at heart, was pleased with the ending . The characters were so human and easy to love or hate. I will be searching out new offerings by this arthor. A very entertaining read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Let me first say that I actually had to force myself to finish this book. I kept thinking, \\"okay, this has to get better\\". But no such luck. The only good thing about this book was that it was free. The story could have been good but it desperately needed an editor to cut out massive sections and correct typos. The reason it took so long to read was because I literally found myself changing the sentences in my head in order for them to flow or make sense. Simply put, it was too long and too overwritten for the type of story."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"This book kept my attention & only got a little slow at times with network news jargon. I couldn't wait to see the bad guys get theirs for torturing the heroine. If you're into retribution you'll enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Thank you Diane Dempsey for a great read. I found myself drawn back to my Kindle again and again to follow the human failings and strengths of the characters in this story of those involved in the TV news. Great character details and quick reading that kept my attention during many evenings and early mornings.Ms. Dempsey has been added to my favorite authors list!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"It's a good light read! Perfect for the beach or a long weekend. One downside...It drug out a little bit in the middle."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"In this novel,Diana gives you a peak at what a woman in today's so called modern working world goes through, Her leading Lady not only has to fight to hold on to her career, but she has to struggle with love lost, or is it. Read it and find out. You won't be dissapointed!!!!!"},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Falling Start is a fun, easy read like most books in the 'Chick Lit' genere. Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon read or for lounging beside the pool."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"It gives us a look into the world of television news and how cutthroat it can be. You really routed for the main character."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I am reading this right now and it's definitely worth your time. I am enjoying it so much! Great characters and involves the TV news industry. If you are a read-a-holic, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"I had a really hard time getting into this story. I wanted to enjoy the story, but had to pushed myself to keep reading. The plot was gripping enough, and I really HATED the characters that you were not supposed to like. The problem, however, was that I also disliked the main character (her thoughts and actions). I felt no sympathy towards her, and the best I could say was that I really wanted to see those who were working against her brought down. Half the time, I wanted her new love interest to just stick with his fianc&eacute;e. In fact, the character I related to best (Ruth), got almost no story-time.You might enjoy this book more then I did if you have a really aggressive personality or have gone through a mid-life crisis... that way you might be able to identify with the main character better then I did."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Natalie's husband left her for another woman. Her new boss thinks she needs to be replaced, she is getting old for TV and makes too much money and he needs to cut the budget to get a big bonus. Her protegee has become her rival and is trying everything possible to make her way to the top. And when Natalie finally realizes that she is in love with her agent she believes she is going to lose him to a different woman as he has already proposed (knowing that he ins't in love but thinking he needs to move his life in that direction). In the end it all comes together nicely and shows that sometimes what doesn't kill you really does make you stronger."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Falling Star is an insight into the cutthroat world of television news. Natalie Daniels has made it to the top of the local news food chain as the anchor for a Los Angeles station. She's the station's highest paid employee which makes her a target of the new and parsimonious station manager and the up and comer Kelly who has her eyes on Natalie's anchor chair. Further problems are caused by Natalie's skanky soon to be ex-husband who is after Natalie's bank account. With so much plotting against her, what's a girl to do?Most of the book is spent discovering exactly how bad these characters are. They're all pretty evil and have secrets they can't afford to have exposed. Once Natalie figures out what's going on, she sets out to distribute just desserts. The last third of the book is a whirlwind of unmasking and justice-meteing, and the book ends perfectly, if a little improbably. The best part is that Natalie grows and matures from her ordeal and has a new appreciation for true friends. Falling Star is a great example of how chick-lit can empower women."},{"Title":"Falling Star","review":"Diana is a wonderful story teller. This is the first book I've read that was written by Diana. I couldn't put it down! I've just ordered Chasing Venus and probably will read all of her other books.
