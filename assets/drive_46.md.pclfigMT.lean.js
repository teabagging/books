It seems to lack a plot yet it is very challenging to put down. The novel tells the story of many different characters and how they live and interact with one another. Some of the characters are truly magnificent people with a good heart. Most are doing the right thing for a great person. And some are crazy, but would do anything for someone they love. There are chapters that introduce us to new characters that seem to have almost no part in the story, but somehow are related to a character form before. In the end their stories are all woven together.The novel is wonderfully written and I could visualize everything that was going on. There are times when I just had to laugh and times when I was close to tears. This is a quick read because it is simple and clear-cut, but the story could very well stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I just finished cannery row and i would have to say that so far it is my favorite stienbeck story. i do not thinks there is any worthless chapters, as some people described, it is a very moving, simple, american story, one of the best."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is my first Steinbeck. It will not be my last. I'm kicking myself for letting so many years of my life pass without reading anything written by this obviously gifted author. His style is so different and so smooth.

I would reccommend it to anyone"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Even when describing the most down to earth situation, Steinbeck enchants you with prose so beautiful you have to stop to savor it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"After reading a number of reviews on Steinbeck's novel, I can appreciate that it is not something which suits all tastes. However, I do not feel that Steinbeck sought to create the greatest story ever told. His book is about life and how a group of characters lived theirs. If you go beneath the surface it is a deep and meaningful story about people who live relaxed (at least compared to many people today), apparently &quot;simple&quot; lifestyles. They have their faults but are, on the whole, decent people. Wouldn't it be nice to live lives that are not about conformity and enduring a stressful, highly competitive rat-race?"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This book is a wonderful book. It shows a society that we would not look at and Steinbeck puts such a nice story behind his description. A rare litterary treasure"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I was reading the other reviews and most peoples complaint was that there were no main characters and no plot.

If anyone has a suggestion for the next Stienbeck book i should please e mail me."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I did enjoy reading Cannery Row, but when I got to the end of it, I wondered what on earth it was about. I do think that some sort of a plot could have helped. Even if the plot had been Mack 'n the boys' resolution to give Doc a good party. It just didn't have much closure.However, I did very much enjoy the characters. Lee Chong was my favorite, with his no nonsense business tactics, and collection of junk, being the result of using the barter system with customers that couldn't pay their grocery bills.If I were to recommend one of Steinbeck's novels, though, I would recommend Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I didn't understand the concept of lying in order to tell the truth until I read this book.

Thank you John Steinback."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row was a pretty decent book. I really don't like to read books but this one grabbed my attention just when I read the back cover.

Steinbeck was obviously born with great character developing skills many people can only hope for (I myself happen to be one of those people). The story basically takes you through a few adventures in the lives of the grocery store owners, bums, whores, and biologist of a small town near the coast in California called Cannery Row (who would of guessed?). What makes this book any different from all the stories of bums and whores you ask? :) Well... I think that it is the fact that no matter how hard any of characters lives are, they cheerfully live them, and most importantly don't feel sorry for themselves. One of my favorite of Stienbecks thought provoking passages came from a scene near the end of the book:\\"Look at them. There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better...\\"I cant say I can really relate to the characters in the book, but I certain felt like I knew each and every one of them. Not to be cliche-ish, but I'd say it's a \\"feel good\\" book. Even though these characters have it pretty rough, they live and love life. I would recommend \\"Cannery Row\\" to anyone (and not just for a book report book). Hey, and you'll kill two birds with one stone- you'll get to learn the secret of catching thousands of frogs in a single night and enjoy some of Stienbecks great literature all in about 250 pages!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I could go on for hours. While I recognize the philosophic and literary importance of JS's Grapes of Wrath, In Dubious Battle, Winter of Our Discontent, et. al., the true genius of JS resides in the saints and sinners occupying Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday and Tortilla Flat. The book opens with, in my opinion, the greatest introductory graph in 20th century storytelling. There's a lyricism and eloquence to his writing that is not easily copied. I've read this book about 10 times and each time is like discovering a brilliant gem."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I just finished Cannery Row and I loved it. I didn't care that the book didn't seemingly have a &quot;plot&quot;. The characters were so realistic and such good people that I immediately fell in love with them. By the end of the book, I thought of each character as some sort of saint rather than the bum or hooker that they &quot;really&quot; were. Steinbeck gives the reader an intimate view into this community that he knows so well. I thought of Cannery Row as a sort of paradise where the ideals that are truly important prevail. Even besides all this, I thought that the writing was just so eloquent. I enjoyed reading about these characters that would be overlooked in real life because of the way that they live."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Novel by John Steinbeck, published in 1945. Like most of Steinbeck's postwar work, Cannery Row is sentimental in tone while retaining the author's characteristic social criticism. Peopled by stereotypical good-natured bums and warm-hearted prostitutes living on the fringes of Monterey, Calif., the picaresque novel celebrates lowlifes who are poor but happy. Synopsis Adventures of cannery workers living in the run-down waterfront section of Monterey, California.Synopsis Drawing characters based on his memories of real inhabitants of Monterey, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Henri, Mack, and his boys, in a world where only the fittest survive, in a novel that focuses on the acceptance of life as it is--a story at once humorous and poignant. --This text refers to the paperback edition of this titleSynopsis Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as is--both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual.

Steinbeck's words paint such a vivid picture of the people and places surrounding a vacant lot in Monterey that you will almost smell the fish rotting on the beach and hear the music coming from the lobby of the Bear Flag Hotel. The people of Cannery Row don't do much all day, and they never really achieve anything, but Steinbeck portrays them so magically that by the end of the story they have become archetypal heroes of greatness, honor, and beauty. This is the book that convinced me that I had to read everything ever written by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is an excellent portrayal of life at its simplestand at its most complex. Steinbeck provides a greatdiversity in character development by illustrating thecharacters' actions as though they always were to representthat character's &quot;normal&quot; reaction to a situation. Goodparallels are also drawn between the individual charactersand their environment. Cannery Row is a soothing andrelaxing novel that everyone can enjoy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Having read much of Steinbeck's work, I feel that this book ranks high on his list of fine literature. This book is structured similarly to \\"Tortilla Flat\\" in that it is about a group of blue collar men being inept and drinking. \\"Cannery Row\\" differs in that the plot is more engaging and the language is much more coarse than \\"Tortilla Flat\\".The book opens with the transfer of ownership of a troublesome vacant lot in Cannery Row. This land attracts the residence of the group of misfits that occupy much of the plot. While meaning well, Mack, Hazel, and the rest of the gang routinely see their plans fall to pieces. Even when they attempt to throw a party for the much adored Doc, it only creates mayhem in the Doc's life. It is from these failures in their attempts to please Doc that the plot of throwing a proper party for Doc evolves. Thus a background develops for which the characters to change.Many readers would object to a plot that seems as thin as the one in \\"Cannery Row\\". In reality, the book is more about the characters and their growth than the plot. Perhaps more so than any other writer, Steinbeck knows how to write a portrait of a man."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Bob Dylan included the subject line in his epic song, \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.\\" Precisely what the line means is a matter of conjecture, and I would welcome some comments. It could mean an absolute and for sure recollection, like something burned into sheet-metal; but typical of Dylan, it could mean the opposite, a memory that has no traction, on something so smooth, like sheet-metal, that nothing is retained.At any rate, on my second reading, I found it to be as warm, enjoyable, heart-felt, and humane as the first reading. It stands in contrast to \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" his more epic novel for which he won the Nobel Prize. The later dealt far more with the moral dimensions of the Great Depression, whereas Cannery Row, which is set in the same period, depicts some of the \\"beautiful losers\\" who manage to survive, and accommodate each other in ways most of us have now long forgotten.Cannery Row is in Monterey, California, and as the name implies, is near the large canneries which service the fishing boats, and provide meaningful employment when the boats are full. Steinbeck's prose is lean, and he has the knack of quickly providing the meaningful details that provide essential insights into his characters. There is Doc, the alcoholic intellectual who runs the Western Biological Laboratory, which provides marine specimens for many places in the country. There is Mack, and the boys who mean good, can rarely keep a few dollars together, and who manage to live rent free in the \\"Palace Flophouse.\\" There is Dora Flood, who runs an \\"upright\\" house of prostitution, called the \\"Bear Flag Restaurant.\\" And there is Lee Chong, who runs the local grocery store, and provides, or doesn't, credit for many of the denizens of the area. The plot centers around the two parties that Mack and the boys attempt to hold in honor of Doc. And who amongst us has not known some folks like Mack, who are well-intentioned, but doomed to failure?Steinbeck's social commentary is much more low-key than in \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" but it is still there, at times implicit, at others, explicit. Consider: \\"The things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first, they love the produce of the second.\\"For those enjoying the Great Recession, or not, this is an insightful, wonderful read of the survivors from a previous hard-times era. A solid 5-stars."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row most resembles another Steinbeck novel, Tortilla Flat It focuses on one neighborhood has a group of rogues as main characters and the novel is episodic rather than linear in plot. The big difference is that Cannery Row who adds a depth to the book that the earlier novel did not have, Cannery Row is probably the least of Steinbecks masterpieces novels I consider worthy of five stars because it is more lightweight than the others but the novels emphasis on the need for community in a harsh almost Darwinian society is a strong theme to build a novel ans Steinbeck executes it well. His powers of description and dialogue are in top form as well but the book shouldnt be assigned to kids below the junior or senior year of high school."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Man I love Steinbeck, love him!This book was not a disappointment. It wasn't as much of a novel as a group of short stories with a thin novel thread running through it. It's like the Canterbury Tales on steroids.The characters are all so interesting, almost each one has a chapter or two devoted to them. You could probably read the stories in any order, they're arranged chronologically but you could probably put them in a deck and shuffle them and come out with something unique and powerful.This book is written about the period right after the depression but right before WWII, this time period was still considered to be in the depression but the economy was past the low point. Things weren't as bad as they were but they certainly hadn't picked up.So I say yes yes yes read this book. it's a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck's Cannery Row really makes literary history as a book of rare type and content.Though as similarly put by Steinbeck at the beginning of this book, it's stories come and go like tidal waves -all different, some to come back and some not; I have to say it was interesting and made it hard to pin-point any main characters of the book. (In my opinion the main characters were Mac & the boys and Doc -perhaps Mr. Lee.)Comparatively with some of Steinbeck's other work, like Of Mice of Men, Cannery Row was much more easygoing and calm than his other works that have been thrilling and page-turning. In contrast, it is also a book about low-income, working people who's life is of hard work.The little fishing town of Cannery Row had people with dark pasts and aimless ambitions in life, yet it was warm with friendship and community closeness.There was a sense of philosophical wonder in both the typical and tragic events that occurred throughout this book. It was a simply told story about people living life, most trying to be as a good as they could, with some failing and moving on. A simply put moral of this story would be the will of human perseverance.Never before have I read a book with such an indirect storyline so simply told, whose little thoughtful foreshadowing of events left me so wistful."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck portrayed the characters in his book to with such detail as i read i felt like i knew the people he was describing. The clerk in the store was i have to say is my favorite he was your typical laid back type of guy. The story line was well written every chapter opened up a broader view of their world. Its genuine in its writing how they added emotion and feeling in his word and showed how his characters shared a bond. over all it was a good book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"One of my all time favorite books has been Tortilla Flat, and for reasons unknown, i waited a long time to finally read Cannery Row.Both novels center around a motley crew of small town, simple folk, who all seem to have sound moral qualities otherwise lacking in those of privilege. Steinbeck suggests to us here that success spoils us, and the best human qualities; kindness, honesty, generosity--- are often prevalent of those of least success (which apparantly is the trade-off). There is no better example of this than in Mach and his crew who inhibit the Palace Flophouse.One of the other great things about Cannery Row is Steinbecks mastery of local color and vernacular, and truly brings the town to life."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"i thought this would be a stupid book becuz we had to read it for an english class, but it was actually pretty interesting. i read to the end before the class, for once"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"If you're a person who likes stories with lots of action and an exciting plot, then this book probably isn't for you. If you're a person who likes unique and fascinating characters, then this book is DEFINITELY for you. Cannery Row is about everybody's hometown. It follows the lives of a handful of townspeople--a group of bums led by Mack, a scientist, a whorehouse madam, a shopkeeper--and somehow Steinbeck manages to get me to sympathize with and understand each of them while at the same time making them very real and very flawed. While I might cross the street in real life in order to avoid an encounter with an aggressive \\"bum,\\" I fell in love with Mack and his boys living in Cannery Row.This book is more similar to East of Eden than to Grapes of Wrath. It's short, very easy to read, and I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"What John Steinbeck does so well, time and again, is show us real people, living real life. Nothing really fantastical, yet just a bit out of the ordinary. But real as dirt.Reading him makes me wish I did not have to use the past tense when speaking of how he writes.I just finished his 1945 novel, Cannery Row.I thoroughly enjoyed it.The book is not so much about plot, as it is an evocation of time and place. Almost, at times, a panoply of connected vignettes.Short, economic chapters; never a suffocating moment.The \\"cannery\\" district of Monterey California comes alive, as we meet people like Lee Chong, the shrewd, yet good-hearted general store owner.From aspirin to zippers, if Lee Chong ain't got it, you ain't need it!Then there's Mack, the self-appointed ringleader of a veritable posse of down-and-outers. These guys don't work. [I envied them all the way through...] They just sit around all day and cause unintentional mayhem for the whole town, the main victim being Cannery Row's one seeming intellectual, the marine biologist known as \\"Doc.\\"The central thrust of Steinbeck's novel is that Mack and his boys want to throw Doc a party. Doc is such a \\"nice guy\\" and he is always out there helping others, Mack figures it's time to repay him with a bit of a shindig.Amazing how such good intentions can go awry!The first attempt at a party is a complete disaster. The second attempt, this time the event being Doc's alleged birthday, is not much better, but by now Doc has taken precautions. Getting wind of his own party plans, he himself does most of the organizing, and feigns surprise when people start arriving.But what's the use?At the end of this second party, his front door is again knocked off its hinges, and by now even the police have given up on arresting these well-intentioned hooligans!It's a terrific little novel [almost a novella] in which my lasting impression shall be the fact that all friendships, indeed, all human relationships, must be willing to embrace imperfection. Not just in the other person, but also in our own self.In a subtle way, Doc learns through his bumbling friends, that he is not an island. In fact, he may even need these guys, from time to time.Even he, self-sufficient Doc, may be in need of someone!I often look into Steinbeck's Letters [a book] to get a better appreciation for the time frame of some of his writings. Of Cannery Row, he said, back in 1943, to a friend... \\"I'm working on a funny little book and it is pretty nice.\\"I concur.It is funny. It is nice.The character of \\"Doc\\" was based on Steinbeck's real-life friendship with a man by the name of Ed Ricketts.I read Cannery Row in preparation to reading a new book I recently picked up, entitled Beyond The Outer Shores: The Untold Story of Ed Ricketts, The Pioneering Ecologist Who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell.It's by Eric Enno Tamm, and I look forward to beginning it, next week.I highly recommend Cannery Row, to all and sundry.It's not East of Eden.It's not Grapes of Wrath.But it's definitely Cannery Row!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Although not a moralistic epic like \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", \\"Cannery Row\\" delivers a short, entertaining tale of the many lives in Monterey, California, circa 1940s. There is no one character that stands out as the protagonist, as Steinbeck paints an elaborate portrait of the characters that make up this rundown, seedy part of town. This ensemble of characters and their intertwining stories serve as the foundation of his novel.Throughout the novel Steinbeck paints a vivid picture of life in this lonely port town. Although the Great Depression is over, most of the characters are still downtrodden and poor off financially. However, Steinbeck generally focuses on the better aspects of these people. Yet, there is not all glowing praise for these outcasts and misfits. Steinbeck infuses his generally optimistic view on Cannery Row with flashbacks and vignettes that are dark and disturbing. Death and suicide are an occasional subject, as Steinbeck pierces his otherwise uplifting book with morbid accounts. Of course, this helps to contribute to the realism of his book.Overall, \\"Cannery Row\\" is a short yet poignant story of life for the downtrodden living in a rough port town. Although we can generally sympathize with the characters, Steinbeck lends just enough realism to prevent us from having an overly utopian view of Cannery Row. It's ironic that the real Cannery Row in Monterey has now been gentrified into an upscale shopping area. Yet, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row\\" lives fresh in the novel that he wrote more than 60 years ago."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have never read a book that so richly paints the thoughts,dreams,loves and fears of its characters. A true classic, a must read for anyone who appreciates literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Championing life outside the stiff 9-5 scene, Steinbeck writes this short but funny and moving story of Bums, Corner Girls, and other fascinating creatures living on the fringes of society but loving their poor yet happy existence."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"An excellent all around work. Mixing drama with comedy, Steinbeck comes through here where he failed with Tortilla Flat. A short and easy read, it will last a weekends worth of reading. Not as good as The Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, but a very good effort none the less."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Grapes of Wrath might be Steinbeck's most recognized novel, but Cannery Row is his best by far; Its skim story - throwing a party for one of the characters - is just an excuse for Steinbeck to demonstrate his awesome power in creating and shaping such human, loveable characters. A must, for all reader."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"At first I had to read Cannery Row as a summer reading assignment and I was not looking forward to reading it. But, once I sat down and started to read it, I felt so close to the characters and it was just like I was watching their daily lives through a peep-hole in Monterey. John Steinbeck brought to life human emotions that people feel everyday and painted a vivid picture with words."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have read this book seven times and always find something new that I missed the times before. He attacks every aspect of the human character; even himself. He leaves no stone (person) unturned. His development of character is still amazing and unmatched by anyone. It is easy to see that he patterns his characters after people he knew. The comic episodes juxtaposed with the sad lives of people in lives going nowhere is one of the greatest works of art since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; This book is what America is really like."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This book is the closest thing I have ever read in resembling a photograph. Steinbeck paints a crisp picture of this community while causing you to experience every emotion available. Truly one of his best."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have read this book ten or more times, and I never fail to be completely amazed by it. Its genius lies in Steinbeck's characters and settings, but above all, in his extraordinary ability to write to his readers so that they can see, can understand what he is showing them. Steinbeck is a master of words, not obviously, but so completely that as you read, the words become images, the people become real, all without you noticing the exquisite turn of phrase or detecting the minutely careful selection of each of these words that make up this truly exceptional piece of literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck does a masterpiece with this book. His characters are symbolic and create an exciting allegory."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"In school, most students are forced to read some boring books that their teachers call &quot;classics.&quot; But of course most students don't fully grasp the meaning of most of the books. When I was forced to read Cannery Row, I thought, oh no, not another book. But, during the course of reading this piece, I found that the book made me think. Cannery Row deeply described the importance of the community around you. And in doing so, I came to realize that not everything should relvove around an individual. The people around you help to make you who you are. They are the ones to shape your perspective. Cannery Row portrays this excellently. It is a great book, that all people, not just students should read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I really enjoyed the book Cannery Row, I liked how the book would switch the subject out of nowhere and keep you in suspense.I really enjoyed getting to know the characters.

I really enjoy all of John Steinbecks books, he is a very good author in my opinion."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I think that cannery row was a very good book. It's very interesting and it keeps you on your toes throughout the whole book. This novel is different from many other novels I have read in the past. It can keep you in suspense from chapter to chapter you don't know what is going to happen next. There might have been one or two chapters that I didn't really care for but other than that it was pretty interesting and exciting to read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I think that this book depicts how times were during The Great Depression very well. It shows the odd and in my opinion desperate jobs that people held during these tough times.

It's a great book to read if you are looking for a little background on what times are like."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I thought the book Cannery Row was a ok book.

Doc was my favorite character. I liked him best because he was very layed back and was nice to everyone. He was always there when you needed a hand. I like how Steinbeck made the character Mack.

I like a book with more excitement. I like to read a book with suspense which I don't think Cannery Row had too much of. It had a different outlook on what we would call normal everyday life than we do. I think the characters in the book didn't care if they were doing what some normal person would do but what they thought was best. They got through life not how others wanted them to but how they wanted to themselves. They just wanted to have fun and deal with life day by day as it comes. I agree with their outlook on life and how they emotionally go about it, but I don't agree with the way they lived and their surroundings. I definetly would have tried to get out of there and find a nicer place to live. But I understand all they did and why they live how they live."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I gave Cannery Row a three star raiting because I enjoyed reading the book more, the further I read into the book, but I found the book boring in the beginning. The book's characters are created well, and their lives are put together well with their personalities. There were however some chapters in the book that I felt were not really necessary for the main story of the book, and I would rather read a book without different short stories within it. I did like how I could get into the book to where I wondered what happened next to each character. I just enjoy reading love stories more.

A story about people interacting with each other, but containing no real plot. Just a tale of people's lives. Cannery Row probably has a strong appeal to English teachers and historians of the Great Depression and surely Steinbeck has many themes and symbols woven into the book that would appeal to to such types. But strictly speaking of entertainment value, this is not a book that produces any great anticipation and lacks any exciting development. I'm sure I'd enjoy it more if I read about the deeper meanings hidden within."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is the seventh Steinbeck novel I have read, and also one of the worst (The Short Reign of Pippin the VII is worse). I loved The Red Pony and Of Mice of Men, so I branched out, reading some of his lesser known works. Big Mistake. This novella has no focus, no character you can relate to, no plot to speak of, no definitive climax, and no business being read. I daydreamed through most of it.The reason I don't give it one star is because Steinbeck, like in most of his novels, provided a great description of post-war Cannery Row, and did a decent job of presenting violence on the periphery (kind of like the news today). We see glimpses of violence but we, nor the characters are ever directly affected. Furthermore, the novel's ending is decent, comparing Doc's lonely isolation to that of a gopher being attacked while trying to seek out a mate. Unfortunately, most things leading up until the ending is uneventful, constantly interrupted by dead-end subplots, and lacking in intrigue."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row...A delightful little book filled with justabout every \\"plot twist\\" known to man.I was reminded of Voltaires \\"Candide\\",numerous Greek tragedies, triangle relationships.At the end of the day?The road to hell is paved with good intentions.Surprise is not always welcome.No good deed goes unpunished.Don't be afraid to ask for help.\\"Darling\\" the dog is what brings themback together.Never underestimate the power of animalsin our life.Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.I loved its gentle prose, despite what weall knew Doc was doing.He gathered animals to kill, sent them offto universities, schools, to be dissectedfor medical purposes.Did any of you get that?Or is it just me?Just my take.Enjoy the book.It is a beautiful journeythrough simple live, unfetteredby wealth, nor the pursuit of...BestH."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is an okay book. I think Steinbeck threw in some unwanted and confusing chapters. If those chapters had more substance to the plot then it would be better. Out of the books I have read in school this is one of my least favorite, but not as least as the Great Gatsby. But in the book I did like the characters Mack and the boys, I liked how they were had no cares. Doc was also another likeable character. Because he was nice and like to try new things.

I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen and nothing did. Although interesting in the first two chapters, you quickly get sick of the disjointed &quot;plot&quot;. A vivid setting does not make up for the absence of a story."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have read several of Steinbeck's other works. They are generally good. This book, although, is slow moving and has several irrelevant chapters thrown in. The ending is definitely not what I expected."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This novel is set in a location I have never been. I've never been anywhere remotely like this location. The situations they run into are very different from my life, only on a few occasions have the same sort of things happened to me. In this way it can be nothing but the genius of John Steinbeck's writing, that helps even me relate to this story.The story is very simple, because it is just a carriage for the complex characters to evolve and travel in. \\"Mack and his boys\\", a group of guys that would be considered crooks unless you got a closer look at them, have been helped more than once by a kindhearted man named Doc. To show their gratitude they decide to give him a good party. Their many enterprises and expeditions make up a lot of the story in this book.But Steinbeck uses another writing technique on top of that, almost to get the reader feeling like they've lived in Cannery Row all their life. What he'll do is about every other chapter he'll have a really short chapter that will just give a quick glimpse of the life of somebody who hardly relates to the story. It sounds obscure and a little disorienting but it works perfectly for the idyllic and nostalgic feel that this book portrays.Using a blend of one simple story and many little vignettes, John Steinbeck portrays life perfectly. Every character in this novel is their own human being, he doesn't slight them because they are only mentioned on a few pages, he gives the Chinese man who walks through Cannery Row every evening as much thought as Mack and Doc. It's moving because every character's always changing and evolving. I'm sure anyone who read this book would find a character for them.Cannery Row convinced me that John Steinbeck is one of the greatest character creators and he can weave incredible stories around his masterpieces. John Steinbeck never flinches away from life he takes it fully into his novels without becoming gratuitous in any way. Cannery Row was an ingenious novel about real life.Some of the best proof of that statement is the way that not only the characters evolve but our perceptions of them evolve. Mack is a hood but he's also a nice guy that tries to help people out... when he's not swindling them. The prostitutes that play big roles in this novel are sophisticated and caring. Steinbeck makes no assumption of any human nature in this novel and he doesn't let the reader either.Cannery Row is a beautiful representation of real life. Steinbeck completely takes on the growing organism of Cannery Row and works with it, shapes it, becomes it. He did it so well that in the end it's not even his novel: it's the readers. I would recommend this book to anyone from a teenager, to a middle aged person, to an elderly person."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is almost like a book of short stories. There are some central stories that follow main characters, such as a gang of jobless, penniless hooligans known as \\"Mack and the Boys\\", and a marine biologist named Doc, but interspersed between these chapters are very short tales about everything from two sailors on a date with two blondes to a gopher who decides to build his home under the ground on Cannery Row. Steinbeck explains this story-telling format in the first chapter by asking the reader, in terms that warn the reader of his similarity to the character of Doc in the novel: ...The style of the Cannery Row - like most of John Steinbeck's fiction- is easy to read and free-flowing, which can be deceptive, because the characters and themes are quite deep. Take Mack and the Boys, a group of friends the town views as worthless, though friendly and fun-loving, do-nothings. A lot of the book centers on their attempts to do good things that continually turn out bad. ...\\"In this way Mack and the Boys seem like simple, pitiful characters. However, Steinback uses them as examples of people who are truly content with themselves and their lives, and who don't try to rely on money to achieve happiness. ...Because of his ability to show the humanity of all his characters, even those viewed negatively by others, Steinbeck has a true gift of characterization. This is also seen in Doc, a good character whom everyone in Cannery Row likes and relies on. Although he has many friends and allies, Doc is portrayed as a lonely, solitary man who is more at home while dissecting animals or reading books than at the bar or a party with his friends. Doc's character comes to life near the end of the book when Mac and his friends finally throw him a successful party and for the first time in the novel he relaxes and lets himself go while in the presence of other people. There is also a mentally challenged child named Frankie who shows Doc what real love is, and this is a good way to show that although many people can need and want a person, very few actually care for him or her unconditionally.Steinbeck's literary gifts do not stop at characterization of people. He constantly uses personification throughout the novel, so that animals seems as real as the other characters. And of course, by titling the novel Cannery Row, Steinbeck promises readers a great description of the setting and surroundings of the novel, and he does not disappoint them. I have been to Cannery Row and although it has changed a lot since Steinbeck's novel was published in 1945, I am still able see it come to life again in my mind while reading the novel. Anyone finding the first paragraph intriguing will be just as intrigued by the end of Cannery Row, because John Steinbeck expertly shows all of these things and more throughout the entire work."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is like a painting. Created with a careful hand and wise heart, it is a simple portrait about a very eccentric and eclectic community that lives by the sea. The characters are foolish and their lives often are ridiculous but there is a familiarity. These are people that we know. These are sensibilities and personal virtues that we understand and share. They are us on our worst days and our best. If we had the chance to observe our lives from a far off place, we may see a story that unfolds like this book. Written in a style that is both lyrical in its efficiency and beautiful in simplicity, it is an easily accesible work that can be appreciated by everyone. This book does lack the gravity of other Steinbeck novels. Often presenting the plight of man immersed in modern society, drowning in the consequences of modern ideology, Steinbeck takes a softer, more humorous approach in this portrail of the human spirit. This book reads more like poetry about the daily rhythms of everyday life. This book is not going to rock nations, shatter governments, or upsurpt the foundation of any belief system that you adhere to but it will leave you with a private smile and a warm feeling for a small seaside community that exists somewhere at sometime."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Good points:It's unabridged. Jerry's delivery is superb; he brings the book to life.Bad points:It's difficult to get a copy.I managed to track this down years ago but no longer have it.I wish it was available on CD ... I wish it was available, period.[Note, January 2012: it is on CD! See below]If I had read Cannery Row and found it less than enjoyable, this would have changed my mind and made me want to read it again.As it is, I have read and re-read the book, and am now on my second copy.I listened to the tapes whilst driving to and from work, so much so that I wore them out. Much to my shame, I didn't copy them before that time.If you enjoy Steinbeck, you will love this. If Cannery Row is a good example of his writing abilities, this is a superb example of the ease with which his written-to-be-read work translates so well to a read-to-be-heard medium. If you have the choice between this audio book and the movie, forget the movie; it's a non-runner.But then, I'm biased. I've read so many books of so many kinds that I don't think I could be particularly subjective but for the fact that, of all those books, Cannery Row is my absolute favorite.[Edited on January 18, 2012:I am delighted that this recording is now available on CD, published by Penguin Audio in June 2011.Now that my cassette tape edition is, umm, somewhat 'tired', I am determined to buy the CD.For those who are interested, I heartily recommend it:Cannery Row (Penguin Classics)]"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Having read many of Steinbeck's novels, I went into this one knowing what to expect, and I was not disappointed. In some ways this book reminded me very much of Tortilla Flats, in that it's largely about poor people who make the best out of their situations. In other ways it reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath, in that there was a lot of thinly-veiled social criticism, but the socialism themes weren't overwhelming. The one thing I found to stand out more in this novel over the other two was the fact that Steinbeck's humor really had a chance to come out in this one. His humor reminds me of, perhaps, the sort of humor one might expect from a grandfather. The book really focuses in on simple living, and the ability to find contentment without wealth. I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Age 13 and up. Doc, a young marine biologist who collects specimen throughout the state of California is thrown into a world of wonder at Cannery Row, with the characters of Dora, Mac and his friends, Lee Chong, and a few more interesting characters. Without much of a plot, John Steinbeck is quite successful in capturing the different feelings of people in the place of Cannery Row. Short vignettes are thrown into this tremendous novel, although not a part of the main story line, but provide different perspectives of people who live at Cannery Row. The \\"story\\" to Cannery Row is quite simple. Doc, considered to be a hard-working and respectable young man, is given a party by Mac and the boys, who are unemployed men. Mac and the boys set up this party in Doc's lab, but it was trashed because Doc was late in getting back to his home. After the party, Mac and the boys felt very ashamed for being disrespectful to Doc, so they planned on fixing another party. This party turned out to be a success for everyone in Cannery Row. Although this plot may seem quite pathetic to many, Cannery Row is written well and can be read by almost anyone. Women, men, girls and boys alike will have a very enjoyable time reading John Steinbeck's novel, and will do so for many years to come.Steinbeck refers to alcohol many times in Cannery Row. Afterall, Mac and the boys are constantly talking about purchasing a locally brewed rum known as \\"Tennis Shoes.\\" Therefore, this novel may not appeal to the elementary readers, but mature Junior High School Students and anyone above the age of 13, boys and girls, are recommended to read this book.-------Tyler Maloney"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"\\"There are your true philosophers.\\" -Doc's laconic, yet accurate, observation astutely equates Mack and his motley gang of apathetic winos to that of philosophers. However absurd this may sound to those who have yet to read Cannery Row, it is altogeter true and revealing. Steinbeck, as is his custom, expertly and artistically endears his lowbrow group of characters to the reader. While whores & alcoholic bums living on the indigent fringes of Monterey, California may not sound like your cup of tea, they nonetheless make for a great novel.Steinbeck, allowing his characters to speak with candid blue-collar vernacular, ties in his uncanny and unique ability to pull the reader into the woefully downtrodden, yet extraordinarily vibrant, and all too real, world that is Cannery Row. Just like he so masterfully accomplishes in Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck exquisitely explores the inner depths of humanity and the immense resiliency of the human spirit and its inherent propensity to overcome the trials and tribulations of adversity.Despite being miserably destitute and forlorn by others' standards, the eclectic gang of Cannery Row consciously rises above the utter chaos of soulless ambition and covetousness and, in their genuine indolent happiness, perseveringly subsist as \\"curiously clean.\\" Short, yet blissfully sweet."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"In Cannery Row Steinbeck depicts the beauties that everyone bears. Most of us, however, are tarnished by either greed, scandal, or sin. Cannery Row, in my opinion, bears the best style and course of writing. There is no real climax to the book. There is no shocker ending. Nobody gets murdered or wins the lottery. There are 196 pages of rich, pure, and profound content. Cannery does not thrill you by disecting the twisted sadistic mind of a sereal killer, documenting his/her thought and action like Mary Higgins Clark(hint hint Mrs. D.). Steinbeck merely tells the story of a blue-collar town and lets the reader interpret the profound and inspiring deeds and deceits. Yes, I did say profound deceits. You don't understand? READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Chapter 6 of CANNERY ROW opens with a rich description of a Pacific tide pool. \\"It is a fabulous place: when the tide is in, a wave-churned basin, creamy with foam, whipped by the combers that roll in from the whistling buoy on the reef. But when the tide goes out the little water world becomes quiet and lovely. The sea is very clear and the bottom becomes fantastic with hurrying, fighting, feeding, breeding animals. Crabs rush from frond to frond of the waving algae. Starfish squat over mussels and limpets, attach their million little suckers and then slowly lift with incredible power until the prey is broken from the rock. And then the starfish stomach comes out and envelops its food.\\" The passage continues for two pages, reveling in grace and beauty, but also in danger, violence, and death, ending at last with the tide filling the basin once more while \\"...on the reef the whistling buoy bellows like a sad and patient bull.\\"In her fascinating but rather academic introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of CANNERY ROW, Susan Shillinglaw suggests that the tide pool is also a metaphor for Steinbeck's study of the inhabitants of the ramshackle buildings behind the old sardine canneries in Monterey, California. Certainly, these characters have a lot in common with creatures hidden under rocks that come out only at certain times of day. But they are fascinating when they do. Other readers have rightly commented on the wealth and humor of the loosely-connected series of anecdotes that make up the novel; this is a heart-warming tale that almost simultaneously brings a smile to the lips and a tear to the eye. The Steinbeck that could look with such sympathy into the gentle heart of simple Lennie inOF MICE AND MEN, or applaud the desperate will to survive of Tom Joad inTHE GRAPES OF WRATH, paints this collection of marginal characters with affection and without judgement. Describing them as \\"whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,\\" he changes that in the next sentence to \\"saints and angels and martyrs and holy men\\" and means the same thing; the book proves his paradox.But I look at the passage about the starfish quoted above, and read further in Steinbeck's description of the pool, \\"tranquil and lovely and murderous,\\" to his account of the black eels, the snapping shrimps, the seductive anemones, and that \\"creeping murderer the octopus... [attacking] ...as ferociously as a charging cat.\\" Although there is danger, death, and tragedy in the human tide pool of Cannery Row, it is relatively muted. Perhaps Steinbeck, writing at the end of WW2 with several tough novels behind him, wanted to leave violence behind. The pay-off is the warmth of what remains; the danger is occasional sentimentality. While there is tragedy implicit in the novel, it is suggested in softer tones.The tide pool is seen through the eyes of the one character who rises above the others: old Doc, who makes a living collecting zoological specimens. As an observer of the human world as well, Doc might seem the writer's surrogate, but while Steinbeck treats him with empathy, he also keeps a certain distance; this is not autobiography. The character is based on Ed Ricketts, the book's dedicatee, a marine biologist whom Steinbeck accompanied on the extended study trip immortalized inTHE LOG FROM THE SEA OF CORTEZ. Doc is well-liked but solitary, his life cheered mainly by classical music on the phonograph, occasional women, and continual beer. Although we meet him early on, we realize only gradually that Doc must be very lonely -- a realization that makes us aware of the essential isolation of most of the other figures in the book. A very few go under, but most manage to rebound by doing something at once outrageous and life-affirming. At the height of a wild party in his honor that brings the whole community to his door at the end of the novel, Doc recites an old Sanskrit poem of lost love. I am not sure that the actual poem completely works, but the combination of sadness and joy, like the two masks in the old theater, is a perfect summary of this marvelous book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This, I believe, is a Zen story created long before most Westerners had any idea what it my mean to be Zen. Steinbeck clearly was involved in an intellectual and spiritual preoccupation which was visionary and apparently not the least bit fashionable in his time. One can't help but believe that Steinbeck shows himself, in Cannery Row, to be a bonafide forefather, for a variety of reasons, of the Beat movement. And if you are one of those people who smirks condescendingly at the Beats, don't let that keep you from Cannery Row. It's one of those stories that takes you to a place and a time and a community you'd prefer not to leave. It's the kind of book one should read in a porch swing in July under a weak light with a beer that will get too warm if neglected."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This is a small and quick read, but it is wonderful. I read it first in high school and then again in college and then maybe three times since just for the joy of it. Most anything Steinbeck is great, but this is a gem!!!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Stienbeck had experimented with loosely structured tales of noble drifters before, but his musings on the theme peaked with the classic Cannery Row. Although it is not as epic as East of Eden or as urgent as The Grapes of Wraith, the novella may be Steinbeck's best book for its style, personality and heart.There is no central storyline in Cannery Row, only a cluster of anecdotes, concerning inhabitants the lowlife district of a coastal town in pre-World War II California. From the contemplative Chinese grocer to the sociable but cynical marine biologist to the charismatic leader of a fellowship of drifters, these are some of Stienbeck's most memorable characters and their exploits are wholly entertaining.Even though Cannery Row is free-spirited, it is not light. Themes of discontentment, emotional weakness and sometimes painful disparity between intent and outcome color the novel's vignettes. Even the book's portrayal of lighthearted drifters revolves around a heavy thesis. These are strong, capable people. What does it say about society that they can't or won't achieve anything overly tangible?But such questions do not concern Cannery Row's greatest strength: how enjoyable it is to read. Its first sentence is about as famous as Moby Dick's and A Tale of Two Cities'. \\"Cannery Row is Monterey California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a dream.\\" The prose is just as invigorating throughout, another reason why Cannery Row is a plotless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get. that is definetly true for this book. i was expecting to read another boring high school book, but was sweep away and left with a new understanding of life and a better idea of what to look for in the never ending pursuit of happiness.&quot;Cannery Row&quot; has the most life like characters ever to jump off of paper. trying to understand the characters is rather impossible until you understand that the characters are real people looking for the same things as you and me. The most successful character of the book is the Doctor, he has money, a good job, and plenty of work to do, however the author choseto make this character the least happy. the authors favoritecharacters are the hoboes.

Most anyone will become totally absorbed in Steinbeck's characters and the earthy world they live in. Steinbeck knows human beings and has the most astonishing insight into their problems and feelings (Try the Red Pony as another example of that.). There is something on every page of this book that intrigues and I found myself laughing through most of the book and exclaiming, &quot;Man, this is a great book!&quot; The images he paints are vivid and haunting and the symbolism -- especially with regard to male/female issues -- is perfectly done. When you have finished Cannery Row, you can look forward to its sequel, Sweet Thursday, for another great reading experience. I'd put this one up with Huck Finn for enjoyment and quality. This is REAL literature."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"\\"The sale of souls to gain the whole world is completely voluntary and almost unanimous - but not quite.\\" J.S. \\"Cannery Row\\"Like Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\", Steinbeck focuses on a cast of characters that fail to consent to the rigid rules of our money-obsessed, Capitalistic American society that the rest of us automatons (myself included, unfortunately) blindly conform to. Like Kerouac's unconventional classic which would come out a dozen years later, \\"Cannery Row\\" doesn't have much a plot. It is essentially a short tale about the lives of the men and women who populate the cannery district of Monterey, California right after the great depression. And a truly unforgettable cast they are - Mack, Doc, Lee Chong, Dora, et al... Each character is real and unique, each character so exquisitely human. One of the main reasons why I enjoy Steinbeck so much is the fact that he is able to write about the frailties of the common American while not being as overly judgmental and self-riotous as other greats tended to be at times (i.e. Sinclair Lewis and Dreiser to name two). He was a writer who focused on the benevolence that resides in men's hearts and souls, despite all their imperfections and sins.In my past life, before I became a well respected,'successful' business man. Before the ulcers, before the insomnia, before the apathy and ennui swallowed up my soul, I was your classic beach bum. It almost seems as if that past life of mine never really existed - surfing twenty to forty hours a week, living off of bad coffee and Top Ramen, working odd jobs a couple days a month so that I had enough money for beer and to cover rent, letting my hair go long and shaving only when I felt like it, partying five nights a week, etc... etc... What a bum I was back then! Yet back then, you never saw me sans a smile. Despite all the unhealthy food, all the beer, all the late nights, etc... I was never healthier in my mind and body. I was never healthier because I was truly at peace and happy. This is why I loved \\"Cannery Row\\", because it brought me back to that simple time and place. In many ways, reading this was quite a bittersweet experience. However, we all have to grow up someday don't we? At least that's what they all say...This is one of my favorite reads of all-time. Right up there with \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\" (the latter being my second favorite novel of all-time) and of all his novellas, this is definitely the best in my opinion. I haven't read them all, but I've read the majority of them, and although there are plenty of other jewels in that bunch, \\"Cannery Row\\" is the gem among gems. It is a simple story, but sometimes simple can be sublime, and this short story is all the proof one needs to back up that statement.So great, I read it twice!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The name John Steinbeck is near legend in American Literary circles for his prose depicting the life of the common man in a typical (in context) setting. How I managed to obtain a degree in English Literature without reading any of his novels is a statement both of my scholarly avoidance while in college and one of my ignorance, the latter being a matter now corrected. A visit to Monterey this summer caused a yearning to read of that picturesque location upon my return and this was the book brought to mind. While I cannot say that Steinbeck is now my favorite period author, I can say this will not be the last of his novels I read.The reader is welcomed to Cannery Row by being informed that it becomes itself only after the work that gives the area its name ceases. It then becomes \\"quiet and magical\\" with the stories that create it can, like those who inhabit the Row, only \\"crawl in by themselves\\" (p.2-3), as they cannot be forced into obedience. These stories are of people, their relationships and how that synergy creates a world of community so close knit that all are accepted because none need fear being rejected.Cannery Row is home to unforgettable characters. Lee Chong, the original \\"Sam Walton\\" whose small shop stocks everything (but discounts nothing EVER). Dora Flood, the \\"Mother\\" of the row and proprietor of \\"The Bear Flag Restaurant\\" whose \\"girls\\" serve specials never listed on the menu, if The Bear Flag had a menu as it is not a restaurant. Mack, Hazel (so named because he was the seventh child born to his parents in eight years and his mother forgot he was a boy), Eddie, Hughie and Jones who serve as the \\"caretakers\\" of the Row while not being bothered with consistent employment or knowing the lack of sustenance. Finally there is Doc, owner and operator of Western Biological Laboratory who is the heart that causes the Row to be sustained.The book is arranged by observations of these characters as they go about their lives with each other on The Row connected by short chapters of philosophical musings about what was just seen. These \\"musings\\" were reminiscent of those conversations once held on front porches, around wood stoves, dorm rooms late at night or over cups of various libations. What is achieved in this manner is a feeling of inclusion and a depth of meaning that was somehow not present before the book was opened. Merely by \\"observing\\" those on The Row as they go about living, the author is able to bring the reader back to a clearer look at him/herself.The book is a classic, it has been read for generations in high school and college classes and it merits this label. The language is spot-on for each character (there is some \\"adult\\" language used) and the movie (starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger) is good but cannot reflect the power the book offers. The narrator plays with the disbelief of the reader, causing her/him to be reminded that this is not reality and they are only observing the Row from a distance, the response is that akin to watching a play unfold. This technique is a safety net for those moments when the book becomes a little too close. The frog expedition to the Carmel River and the ensuing birthday party for Doc (which he knew nothing of even though it was at his house) are two instances where this was true and they are worth reading the book in themselves.I am glad I visited Monterey, twice in fact, in one summer. The first was the glitzy, tourist Mecca in a breathtaking setting. The second was the \\"magical\\" place full of quirky, often unsafe, unpredictably dependable people whom d0 not realize how special they are. Now that I read that last sentence, the reason I enjoyed this book so much is clearer, it sounds like my hometown."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Took me a while to get the significance (and magnificence) of this book. I usually read history/action books, so I initially found this a little slow. That is, until I realized the depth and complexity of the characters. The characters are the \\"action\\" of this story. Beautifully written...one feels the scenes are in three dimensional high definition. So glad I read it and looking forward to my next Steinbeck book. Strongly recommend this well deserved classic. Have vacationed in Monterey a few times...it will be even more special next time."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Easy to read. Lots of laughs. Wonderful view of humanity. Happy recollections.Informative too. Deserves to be regarded as a classic"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"CANNERY ROW, John Steinbeck's paean to depression era Monterey, is a short read, a likeable read - its characters are mischievously fun, harmlessly rogue-ish and entirely contented, and, with its illusion of freedom from responsibility and modern stress, the novel's atmosphere may even spark envy in some readers. I know I am tempted in that direction. Less a novel than a series of loosely connected vignettes, CANNERY ROW is anchored around the character of Doc, a marine biologist based on Steinbeck's friend Ed Ricketts, as he aids and inspires the people around him. With nothing but good intentions, the denizens of the area conspire to throw him a party in appreciation for all he does - though they'll need a practice run before they finally get it right. They do eventually, and the vagabonds, prostitutes and businessmen alike come together for a night of celebration. Afterwards, like at low tide, the excitement recedes and the residents return to their tidal pools of subsistence, happy and sated.Perhaps I'm too much of a cynic, but there seems to be something fundamentally wrong about this novel. That such an environment existed in the way that Steinbeck describes it may be true, yet so few sharp edges remain on this gem of a memory that I suspect the author polished it and polished it until it gleamed just the way he wanted it to. What's left are essentially quite virtuous people engaged in stigmatized behavior - or at least that is how I imagine a post-war America would have seen it - but now that the stigma is blunted, we're left with the idyllic image of Monterey that I suspect only ever existed in Steinbeck's memories.What's wrong with that, you might ask. Nothing, particularly. I liked the novel more than not - and HOW could you not, really? Though I may not actually wish to be like any of these characters, I can't deny that their world has an attractive charm to it, as though it would be a nice place to visit, even if I didn't want to live there. But I think that charm comes through omission, by ignoring darker shades of the environment, which were surely more complex than the tale that Steinbeck spins. And because that grimmer reality is missing, the events of the novel feel contrived, manipulated by the author - regardless of their basis in fact.I have yet to find another book by Steinbeck that has affected me as his third novel,To a God Unknown, did. To me, that book touched on themes and archetypes that, if not exactly generating insights into the human condition, at least felt as though it struck some deep chord. Because I can hardly help comparing these later novels of his with the earlier, I may be too harsh on what is actually an entertaining, often humorous romp through Steinbeck's memories of Monterey. So if you are looking for nothing deeper, then CANNERY ROW will surely satisfy."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I loved this book.

It would have been a lot better if it wouldn't have changed main characters so much. I like books that only have a few main characters.

The short stories on the people of cannery row seemed to clutter the book and offered nothing but a few pages to the book."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I slept through school and never read any of the classics by Steinbeck or Hemingway, etc.I got into Steinbeck this summer and Cannery Row was the first book. I loved it. The characters, the language, the communication, the dialogue, the funny farcical stories ...Two chapters really hit me like a ton of bricks - Chapter 14 when Steinbeck talks about \\"the hour of the pearl\\" and then Chapter 15 when Mack and the boys try catching frogs in the dark of night. Chapter 14 may be one of the finest pieces of writing in the history of literature, and I say that in the context of what I have read. Nevertheless ... I put the book down for an hour and tried to absorb that of what I just read. Then Chapter 15 had me laughing wildly.I have not seen the movie version of Cannery Row, which, I guess, is a combo of Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. Regardless, the book version of Cannery Row is a must read. Terrific."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have become a big Steinbeck fan over the last few months, having read The Pearl, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row during that time. The beauty of Steinbeck's style that is evident in all of these stories is that, much like a masterful boxer, he will float and spar while filling the reader in on the transpiring events, and then a paragraph comes along that literally jumps to life, like a well-timed barrage of attacks. Either in the form of layers and layers of description that make you feel as if you are feeling, smelling, hearing and seeing everything the characters are, or in the form of a humorous antecdote that causes you to read about four times faster than normal, the barrage carries you through the story.Cannery Row is set in Monterey, CA during the Depression and focuses on a handful of characters, but the main ones are Doc and Mack. Doc runs a place called Western Biological and works collecting animals for other scientists and doing other work at his lab that is not really specified. He is rather an enigma in the town, and he is a Renaissance Man. Everybody in Cannery Row knows and loves him, including several ladies, and he is just generally a good guy that seems to be extremely intelligent. He is also a flawed character, though. He drinks beer for breakfast, is afraid of commitment with the ladies, and seems to fear genuine intimacy with anyone. He stays up late reading and listening to classical music and gets up early to do his studies/work.Mack is a \\"bum\\" by our standards, but he fills a role that Steinbeck loves to explore. He is extremely intelligent and gifted in some areas, yet lacks the motivation to hold a steady job. He is a leader and natural salesman and politician, yet he chooses to lead a group of other bums that he calls \\"the boys\\" and lives in a shack that he finagled out of the local grocery store owner.Through the medium of extremely well-developed characters and beautiful, descriptive narrative, Steinbeck also instructs us about the nature of humans. One of the basic things that I learned about this nature is that people who are in \\"down and out\\" circumstances are often very capable and intelligent people who simply prefer not getting caught up in the social rat races of life. This was evident in the story of the parade, and if you read the book, Doc will do a better job of explaining what I mean than I can. Steinbeck also takes subtle jabs at those of us who turn our noses up at these people, like the town people who taxed (read:extorted) the \\"illegal\\" whorehouse at an exorbitant rate in order to stay open and then frequented the establishment through the side door.I highly recommend this book because it affected, instructed, and entertained me, and it will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is a rundown street in Monterey, California - one that, presumably, takes its name from the sardine canneries based there. It's home to much more besides, though - honky-tonks, grocery-stores, flop-houses and whorehouses, even a laboratory...and a whole host of likeable, memorable characters.Lee Chong, who runs Cannery Row's grocery store, is the first to be introduced. He's a fairly astute businessman, though probably a little unorthodox at the same time. He's willing to extend a line of credit (within reason) and he'll accept some alternatives to cold, hard currency when it comes to settling up. When Horace Abbeville comes in to settle what is reputedly the biggest grocery bill in Monterey, he offers a small warehouse across the way as payment. Although it's not much of a building, Lee knows it could be worth quite a bit if one of the canneries decides to expand - and, therefore, he quite happily accepts.When word gets out, Mack - the leader of Cannery Row's small group of homeless men - pops in for a visit. The boys kindly offer to move into Lee's warehouse...Lee agrees, even though he knows that 'token' rent of five dollars a week will never be paid. On the other hand, he has willing bunch of security guards on call, guaranteed (legitimate) custom whenever the boys have money and absolutely no pilfering when they don't...which is more than the other grocery stores in Monterey are able to say. It also means that his warehouse - subsequently renamed the 'Palace Flophouse Grill' - is always well looked after. No-one ever breaks in, no windows are ever broken and it never 'mysteriously' burns to the ground. Mack's group - despite what you might think - are a good-hearted, likeable bunch. They're all unmarried and only Eddie - who fills in fairly often as a barman at La Ida - has anything like fairly regular work. When they need some cash, they're happy to collect frogs and cats for Doc, over at Western Biological.Dora, meanwhile, runs the 'Bear Flag Restaurant. Here, you'll be able to negotiate for the one thing you'll not be able to buy in Lee Chong's Grocery Store - and, despite the name of her establishment, we're not talking about hot dinners. Nevertheless, the restaurant's twelve female members of staff are all kept pretty busy. Despite earning the wages of sin, Dora proves a lot more charitable than many who work in a more respectable trade. Then there's Henri the French painter - who, technically, isn't either French or a painter. (He explores art through alternative materials). For the last ten years, he has been living on a boat he has built himself...though, since the boat isn't complete, it's still moored on dry land. (Henri never intends to complete it - while he loves boats, he hates the ocean).The book's lynchpin proves to be Doc - a kind, gentle, generous and sympathetic soul, who runs the Western Biological Laboratory Doc. Despite having dug himself right into the heart of Cannery Row, he still appears a rather lonely character. He sometimes has a few lady friends over, but he never visits Dora's. He only has a few simple pleasures in life - the occasional beer, a touch of poetry and a spot of music - and everyone who meets him wants to do something nice for him. 'Cannery Row' follows what happens when Mack and the boys decide to throw him a party.Life may not always have been easy in Cannery Row, but it proves to be a 'quiet and magical' community with genuinely likeable characters - a place where people look out for each other. A very easy, very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The trilogy, Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, and Sweet Thursday are my favorites of his tomes I read just for the joy of reading them. Cannery Row is the second of the set. Steinbeck at his best observing how funny is the tragedy of human experience."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"&quot;Financial biterness could not eat to deeply into Mack and the boys, for they were not mercantile men. They did not measure their joy in goods sold, their egos in bank balances, nor their loves in what they cost&quot;. (Page 119)&quot;They just know the nature of things too well to be caught in that wanting&quot;. (page 142)I guess that for every reader there is a paragraph in which somehow the author summarizes the scope of its novel. For me is the one transcribed above. Each character have a gentelness a lightness which can be accomplished by any person at any pointy in life. Then life ceases to be a maze to be cracked and becomes in and out of itself a surprising aventure. How they get there?, well this is a novel not a self-help book so the process is not described, but a key (the same one)is offered to you in every page with amazing friendliness, elegance and style. Be kind to yourself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Steinbeck's Cannery Row is, at times, a humorous look at a social microcosm and its individuals struggle to interact with, but, as per J S Mill, not interfere with, each other.The daily lives of Doc, Mack and the boys, Lee Chong, Albert and the rest move with a slow fluidity from snapshot to snapshot as each struggles to relate to his or her neighbor, to do good by them and achieve a place within the social stratum that is firmly fixed.Essentially, the plot is to hold a party. The self-deluding, but well-intentioned, Mack and the boys come up with a plan to gather frogs in order to hold a party for Doc. Within the social structure of the Palace Flophouse they successfully obtain all the necessary 'bits' to enact the plan, but its inherent seflishness means that they ultimately fail, wreck Doc's laboratory and end up being outcasts from their place in the social strata. Ultimately they realise that the Party needs everyone in Cannery Row's assistance and, once everyone pulls together, it is achieved spectacularly.A humorous look, yet with a deep underlying comment on the struggle for survival, at a small geographical area, the lives of these people leaves an indelible mark on the reader and you are left with a sense of affiliation and understanding that transcends the novel."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This book's theme and style are not different than all of Steinbeck's previous novels. The tone is depressing, although you will be captivated by the lives of the people in Cannery Row. The main characters- Mack and the boys will hold your attention to the very end. The main theme- opposition to change is present throughout their lives and all the lives of the other people of Cannery Row. The interruptive chapters, which give backround information or provide the reader with a better sense of what is going on in the main story, shew the lives of the other residents of Cannery Row. There is Doc, of Western Biological, which will have you feeling sorry for him by the end of the book, the girls of the Bear Flag resaurant, and the man that skates on the flag pole at the general store, and the Chinaman. They will all have you interested in the book until the end."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row was, when I first sailed into Monterey Bay on my ketch, the Wild Goose, a real place--much the same as when Steinbeck wrote about it in 1945.Steinbeck, in his book &quot;Cannery Row,&quot; describes it during the period when the sardines were still running, and the canneries were going full blast. He describes the inhabitants, many of whom were drawn from real people ('Doc' Ricketts, for example, whose lab on the 'row' is still maintained as a kind of shrine) and his characterizations are marvelous.He spins a great yarn.And the places: The Poppy restaurant is in a different place, now, on Alvarado Street in downtown Monterey, but it still exists.Steinbeck writes about a time that is no longer, and as everyone knows, you can't go back. But, you can see it through his eyes, and in that way we can, sort of, stop the relentless march of time and enjoy the past as it was.When I sailed into Monterey for some respite from the sea, I didn't intend to stay long. Our boat was salt-crusted, and needed some repairs. We stayed ten years, and loved every day of it. During that time, we watched sadly as &quot;old Monterey&quot; was torn down and replaced with a Doubletree Inn and a conference center. Time marches on!When we got there, the canneries were still there, on Cannery Row (which is between Monterey and Pacific Grove, in 'New Monterey'); great, rusted sheet-metal hulks. The sardines had stopped running, but Steinbeck's books had a cult following, and so the row changed into a tourist trap. The canneries were torn down, and bars, cafes and a huge aquarium replaced them. Flora's whorehouse became a pizza joint. The place fourishes, today.It's all gone. 'Doc' Ricketts was killed when his car was hit at the crossing on the east end of the row by a train. (By the way: he was a married man with a family, some of whom resent Steinbeck's depiction of him as a rake and a drunk.)Yes, it's all changed--but, through Steinbeck's depiction, you can still enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I am surprised that some reviewers think Cannery Row is lightweight Steinbeck. Nothing could be further from the truth. Steinbeck opened this novel with some of his best writing in describing the mood and the place that was Monterey and Cannery Row. He tells us up front, in marvelous prose, what this book is about and captures the mood of a place that today is nothing more than restaurants and souvenir shops.Cannery Row is people with individuals that Steinbeck knew, most important being Doc, based on the marine biologist Ed Ricketts. Critics have complained that the book has many sentimental characters, such as Frankie who is hopelessly devoted to Doc. However, it can be argued that Frankie is a well-worked out portrait and adds to the overall portrait of Cannery Row. As in life, there are equally somber and happy episodes in this book.It should be remembered that Cannery Row was written just after World War II when Steinbeck received requests to write something to make people forget about the war. What he came up with was something personal and nostalgic. It is well to recall that Edmund Wilson thought Cannery Row was Steinbeck's \\"most satisfying book because it attempts to objectify and exploit the author's own relation to his characters.\\" The novel flows from chapter to chapter with sprightly language and carries its readers along for the ride. It is one of those books that you wish would never end.The Grapes of Wrath may be a monument of a book to Steinbeck's working man but Cannery Row is one written for himself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I laughed out loud several times reading this book. It was like I was there too, in the thick of the log-sitting gang straight out of Huck Finn. I say Steinbeck's got soul because I hadn't come into contact with anything so beautiful and personal as his prose other than Marvin Gaye, although the feeling conveyed has more in common with the music of Al Green. His characters are sympathetic but all too human. His writing is lean and natural, and reminds me of the parts of To Kill a Mockingbird. I can't really praise it adaqequately, lacking a B.A. in literature, other than to describe my reaction to Cannery Row. I saw that ray of sunshne falling on the row, and I too was aware of the beauty that Steinbeck saw in the rough hewn characters populating it. The book is just so warm, to the point that my temperature almost came to a boil as well when doc came home to see his place ruined, and I laughed along w. doc when he put only his &quot;best&quot; records away in anticipation of the next party. I also appreciated Steinbeck's lack of pretension. His language and style is appropriate to the subject matter, and further brings you into the world of the row. I've mentioned several times how much I felt like I was there, how real the characters were, but I should point out that the book wasn't merely beautifully written escapist literature (which is nice too). I got close enough to the characters to feel their anxieties and disappointments. I think that's what makes this like both Al Green and Marvin Gaye. In any case, this book is a gift, even moreso than something like Annie Hall (which seemed a bit contrived), reinvigorating faith in human nature while tenderly pointing out how easy it is to fail. The characters in Cannery Row are redeemed, in the end, by continuing to try."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Like many American youths, my only exposure to Steinbeck was when I was forced to read the grapes and wrath and of mice and men in high school, both of which I greatly disliked. I was pleased to discover how much I enjoyed Cannery Row. The down-to-earth, provincial comradery, and the small every day considerations of a tightly knit community are beautifully rendered and far more accessible, I think, than the national themes in some of his larger works. My only complaint was that the prose often has this self satisfied quality, like its just too pleased with its own coziness. Overall though, I think I prefer Steinbeck lite."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Years ago, I got on a Steinbeck jag and ended up reading everything I could find that he'd written, including his take on Sir Thomas Malory's story of Kind Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table. And since, I've picked up one or another of his books, re-read them, and thoroughly enjoyed them again. Until now, I'd not re-read Cannery Row.The book has tumbled off bookstore shelves regularly, no doubt due to the passion literature instructors and their students have had for this story. And it even made it into movie form, a charmer of the same title, the story loosely built about Steinbeck's and starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.What's given this book its staying power? As I re-read it this time, and by modern creative writing standards, it's a bit clunky, both technically and structurally. One comparison that comes to mind: Cannery Row was a precursor to the later works of Ken Kesey and Jack Kerouac. Maybe a bit about Cannery Row will explain.The story takes place in Monterey, California, in a seedy area dedicated to canning fish. As you might expect, this is a dingy, bawdy place, peopled by a cast of characters, their individual histories vague, mostly the down-and-outs of many other of Steinbeck's books. I won't indulge in naming names, but this bunch, whom we might crudely call bums, live in flophouses, some even in a cylindrical boiler. Their counterweights are a houseful of hookers, a Chinese storekeeper and, at the eye of the storm, Doc, a man of vague background, but a self-styled scientist interested in marine life.This ungainly story has a tandem focus - two parties the bums throw for Doc, one a catastrophic mess that destroys his laboratory, and another one threatening to do equal damage. So I repeat myself here: what enthralls about this story?The charm and freedom that come with, as Kris Kristofferson sang, nothing left to lose. Compare these to Kesey's Merry Pranksters, and Kerouac's Dean Moriarity et. al., and you see the indomitable spirit of the underprivileged. Of course, writers as far back as Victor Hugo have recognized the rough-hewn dignity of the underclass, their culturally closed ways, their unique morality, even their unique gifts to language.As I said, this book isn't superlatively written, but it's the soul of the book, of its characters, that continues to enthrall."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This book is only around 120 pages but in what would constitute the first act of most novels, Steinbeck fleshes out a wide array of characters with great depth by revealing their psychological innerworkings effectively and efficiently with brief anecdotes. The storytelling is so economical that the layout is almost like a kids' book...but there is an adult depth to everything that makes this a high-value, high-impact 120 pages.In terms of the grand scale, the stakes here aren't terribly high if you look at them with pure objectivity, but the daily life and mindset of the characters is so finely revealed that even the small events that transpire in these pages feel like they carry great weight because you are invested so heavily in the ordinary details of the lives of these ordinary people."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I've always loved this book, and as soon as I opened the front cover, I remembered why. Steinbeck has a way with words that is unique, and his characters in this work of fully developed and very believable. The edition is nice, and both covers extend to page holders. Glad I bought this!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"My dad has been a truck driver since I was born and he hates it. He has spent oh-so-many hours in his truck thinking about what he would do if he won the lottery and a shade few less telling us what he's come up with. He buys a couple a week with his numbers, which include our birthdays, of course. I have always been a lottery talk scoffer, and my dad says, \\"It's okay--if you won, the money would be gone in five minutes to a hand full of ragamuffins.\\"I don't know about that, but I do know why he says that. I have always been drawn to the downbeat and dirty and I don't know why I'm like this!! If it seems sentimental and cheesy, that's because it is. I love things that are in pain. Loooooove.Still, I don't like the cheesy collage of feel-good vignettes about bad guys and the downtrodden that come out at Christmas on TV. And making a hero of the humble just sorta makes me feel bad and patronizing and naive. Some people do it right, though, and it makes me feel okay to be the big, naive, exasperating, wounded-dog lover that I am! And I feel so grateful!Steinbeck opens up Cannery Row calling its inhabitants \\"whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches,\\" but also, \\"saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,\\" and said they all meant the same thing. And he totally meant it. He loved the world! This book is full of dispicable acts, and pain and suicide and abuse and crime, but there is absolutely nobody to hate. We even sorta feel bad for the kid chanting \\"Ching chong Chinaman!\\" at the fisherman. Because of what happened to him next.There are certain scenes that I use again and again from books to mentally rub my own life onto and I think that little Frankie under the excelsior, quivering in disappointment is going to be the one that I take with me from Cannery Row. Or maybe it'll be Mack from the Palace Flophouse, laying on his cot and remembering everybody he's ever let down. Or maybe Mack and I will fall in love and adopt Frankie"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I have always loved Steinbeck books. When they were required reading in school I always looked forward to them the most. Of Mice and Men was my first and ever since then I have been hooked. I recently read Cannery Row for a school project and I could not put it down. The way Steinbeck writes his books is truly unique. He fills the pages of Cannery Row with stories of Doc, Lee Chong, and Mack and his gang. This book will remain as one of my top favorite books of all time. It is beautifully written--one would say almost like poetry--as you read the book you fell as if Steinbeck is sitting across from you telling you the stories himself.I have been to Cannery Row many times in my life but could never picture it as an industrial area mostly because gift shops on every corner and the tourists that crowd the streets, but the way Steinbeck writes Cannery Row it paints a vivid picture of the way life used to be and of the struggle to survive. Cannery Row is also very comedic I found myself giggling at the stories just as much as I found myself in deep reflection over the morals that were being presented. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody looking to put a smile on their face and at the same time learn a little something about life."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I picked this up on a whim and it turned out to be a delight to read. The Post or Times recently ran a story about the last sardine cannery in the U.S. closing down - the end of a world, the reporter wrote, chronicled by John Steinbeck in Cannery Row.The reporter neglected to mention that while it was set in a Monterey dominated by the canneries, the Steinbeck novel never ventures into the factories or factory life. Rather, it portrays a small Depression-era community on the other side of the tracks that includes a flophouse with a group of deadbeats, a whorehouse, a Chinese-operated grocery, and a \\"marine laboratory\\" that probably would be shut down by a dozen laws nowadays.It is a series of vignettes about this community rather than a narrative, though events do move towards a climax of sorts with the second effort to host a party for Doc, who operates the laboratory. The main characters are Mack, the leader of the flophouse group, and Doc, though we get little inkling of their interior lives.What moves the reader along are the wonderfully observed details of the life in Cannery Row, the character quirks of the individuals, and above all the delicious irony of the narrator. This is a very funny book, with touching moments of a broad tolerance for human failings and the small joys that all of us try to salvage from larger dreams gone awry.Take this riff on the Model T Ford: \\"Someone should write an erudite essay on the moral, physical, and esthetic effect of the Model T Ford on the American nation. Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars...Most of the babies of the period were conceived in the Model T Fords and not a few were born in them....\\"Steinbeck's style is spare, but still has soul - Hemingway with heart. For instance: \\"The Carmel is a lovely little river. It isn't very long but in its course it has everything a river should have. It rises in the mountains, and tumbles down a while, runs through shallows, is dammed to make a lake, spills over the dam, crackles among round boulders, wanders lazily under sycamores, spills into pools where trout live, drops in against banks where crayfish live. In the winter it becomes a torrent, a mean little fierce river, and in the summer its is a place for children to wade in and for fishermen to wander in....\\"Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize largely on the strength of Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but his smaller books, this one and Of Mice and Men, also stay in print for a reason."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I've recently read several Steinbeck novels and novellas, including Of Mice and Men and East of Eden. I found both of those works to be outstanding and was determined to read more Steinbeck, hence this review.Cannery Row is a relatively short novella, set in early 20th century Monterey, California. Of similar length to Of Mice and Men, I felt that this work was not the equal of the former, both in relation to character development and entertainment value.As in other Steinbeck works, the author uses imagery and symbolism to good effect, but in my opinion, the characters in this novella were not as engaging or interesting as those in other Steinbeck novels I have read. Certainly a worthwhile read, but not exceptional."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"What an incredibly enjoyable book!This was the first Steinbeck that I've read without being assigned or force fed and boy was I glad I did! Scouring the cluttered shelves of Itaewon's What the Book I found my self inexplicably drawn to the Classics section. Perhaps it was because at least the authors seemed familiar while the fiction shelves were packed with cheap romantic novels and sci-fi reads left behind by the plethora of LBH's to pass through Seoul.While I've never purposely been driven towards Classics, my pleasurable happen-chance encounter with Jack London convinced me that I might be missing something. So, recognizing Steinbeck's name and remembering that I must have enjoyed Of Mice and Men as well as The Grapes of Wrath to some degree, I decided I'd give Cannery Row a spin!In such a short story, Steinbeck manages to develop such interesting characters and paint a scene that is so vivid I can't help but put the book down every now and then to just watch what is happening. What I really liked about this book was how easy it is to read. The prose are so simple that is almost comes off as a children's book. Even so, the story itself is so wonderful wound around such interesting characters that I couldn't help but fall in love with the people of Cannery Row, even the good intentioned but maligned residents of the Palace Flophouse!If you're a human being with half an interest in other human beings I don't doubt this book will tickle you as much as it did me!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"'Cannery Row' is Steinbeck at his best. From the first page you know you are in for another beautifully written book with his lush descriptions, wry sense of humour and wonderful characterisations. Looking at life on Cannery Row and following the exploits of a house of bums, a whore house, a doc and a grocery store, to name a few, this book has delights on every page. I was completely engrossed in this book for the two days that I sped though it, it was so hard to put down and then I was left disappointed that I'd finished so soon. A mark of a brilliant book I find. There are so many touches I could comment on, it is hard to know where to start, from Macks cheeky and inoffensive scams, to Lee Chongs and Doc's resignation to them and way more besides, this book has funny and touching moments in spades. I can only suggest you read this book soon and let another Steinbeck masterpiece enrich your life.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Of course Stienbeck is always wonderful. His writing is smooth and easy to read and he knows his subject well. I enjoyed reading this book again as much as the first time I read it back in high school."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The book was in great shape considering it was used. The selling also got it here beyond fast. Thanks it should work out for college just fine. :)"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is basically the same book as Tortilla Flat, but somewhat more amusing, with slightly more engaging characters, and a slightly less horrific ending. Like that book and much of Steinbeck's early work, Cannery Row isn't so much a novel as an interconnected series of short stories posing as one.Again, it centers around a group of bums who spend most of their time figuring out how to get a drink without having to actually do any work, and then sitting around drinking, and the climax involves them attempting to throw a party for a friend which ends up going disastrously wrong---or, at least, is rather TOO successful. This time around, Steinbeck wisely includes as that friend a sort of \\"intermediate\\" character to help his working readers relate to the bums, the marine biologist Doc. Doc is unconventional and definitely not part of the \\"rat race\\", but not altogether unproductive. He's a very interesting and sympathetic character, and if the book had been more about him rather than the bums I probably would have enjoyed it more.But in the end it's still just an attempt to glorify the lifestyle of a bum, for which I have little sympathy and do not consider to be \\"humanistic\\"---personally I think human beings can do better than that, and the fact that Steinbeck didn't says worlds about his view of his fellow man.So on the whole, maybe worth a read once, and definitely better than some of his other work (Tortilla Flat, Grapes of Wrath, The Red Pony, The Pearl, etc.)---but if you're looking for a really great Steinbeck novel to read, skip this one and pick up East of Eden or Of Mice and Men instead."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Being a friend of John Steinbeck must have been an unnerving experience. He is a master of delving into the human psyche, holding it up to the light, turning it around and over, dissecting it, and then putting to paper some of the best characters out there. He does it again with Cannery Row, which is really almost a novella (I read it in a couple of hours.)The book has a bare-bones plot, but is loaded with character and description. It is at once poignant, maddening, funny, tragic and fascinating...quite a lot for a little book like this. Reading it is kind of like watching a movie with a script that telegraphs the upcoming scenes and you want to warn the characters what they're in for, but they can't hear you. So, all you can do is read on and see how it all turns out.Oh, one other thing; the book has one of the best dedications I've ever read: \\"For Ed Ricketts, who knows why or should.\\" Now I'm off to try to figure out \\"why.\\"Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"This has to be one of my all time favourite books. Skip the boring analysis of the book at the beginning and dive in straight to Chapter One. An absolute page turner - don't hesitate, get it!Tim"},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book. Going to have to read more Steinbeck. It is an all-over-the-place set of interrelated stories set in and around Monterey. The story centers around a few main characters, all the while interspersing scenes of what is going on in the background: life in Cannery Row. This format gives a very laid-back, meandering feeling to the book - you never know what to expect from the next chapter - and provides an interesting portrait of life in 1930's Monterey which flows completely unforced from the collection of stories.I bought this after a visit to Monterey peaked my interest. Definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Back in college, reading Cannery Row was an assignment. I slogged through it ever watchful for irony and themes and symbols ... the kinds of things a professor might ask on a test. At the time I wasn't impressed with the book. It was too sentimental, too black and white in its themes, and too short on the social significance of Steinbeck's greater works (Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden).Revisiting Cannery Row after the past few decades was a revelation. Scenes and characters that made me roll my eyes at 20 suddenly had new relevance to me in my 50s. What once seemed sentimental was now Steinbeck's reverence for the common man. He populates the book not with the types of heroes who change the course of history, but the type who are heroic only in getting back up after adversity knocks them off their feet.Nowhere in the book does Steinbeck refer to his characters as \\"poor.\\" Instead, he finds in Mack and the boys and Dora and her girls of the Bear Flag and Mr. Chong and Doc an abundance of riches. They may not have everything they want, but they have everything they need. From viewing Cannery Row as a minor Steinbeck book, I've come to greatly appreciate the bittersweet lessons it teaches."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"I cried at the end, and then read it again and cried again. Beautiful and amazing, and don't ask me how because the subject of the story is not really all that interesting!

A wistful or excessively sentimental sometimes abnormal yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition\\" - Webster's Ninth New Collegiate DictionaryIn 1945 John Steinbeck, already a successful author, was recovering in New York from physical and psychological wounds received as an active war correspondent in World War II. He returned to his writing and to his memories of where he grew up in as a young man in the late 1920s and early to mid 1930s - to the Cannery Row of Monterey California where the canneries which lined the street extended out over the water to receive sardines by the tons from the sardine boats which brought them in until over fishing ended the catch in the 1950s, where his best friend Ed Ricketts (\\"Doc\\" in the book) had run the Western Biological Laboratory until it burned down in 1936, where good hearted people - Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, Mack and the boys, Dora - the generous madam who ran the whorehouse called The Bear Flag Restaurant - helped the poor, where Gay, Henri the artist and Frankie, the poor lad who couldn't do anything right except love his fellow men hung out on means which were virtually non-existent. The result was this emotional lovely reminiscence of times past told as a novel without a plot but in form a series of stories about his friends who had lived on Cannery Row and what they did when he knew them.It is writing at its best. The Model T, the frog hunt, the \\"party\\" given by \\"Mack and the boys\\" for Doc and then the real party given for Doc are episodes we will never forget. And, finally, when those of us who lived through these times, who remember simpler lives, and simpler times, who have walked down Cannery Row before it became a tourist spot and who have seen the shrimpers and the lifting fog and who remember in wistful nostalgia our friends now gone come to the end of the book and read Steinbeck's last stanza of the poem which ends his own thoughts, - the poem which echoes his own nostalgia - we have a tear in our own eye - rightfully acquired,\\"Even now,I have savored the hot taste of life,Lifting green cups and gold at the great feast.Just for a small and a forgotten timeI have had full in my eyes from off my girlThe whitest pouring of eternal light\\""},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Classic Steinbeck! Great character sketches that are fun to read; I found myself laughing out loud in quite a few places. The characters are easy to relate to, with Doc and Mack being my favorites. When I read Steinbeck I see a little bit of myself in each of the characters - the good and the bad. It is therapeutic!Cannery Row also provides a great look at early Monterey. Having been to the area several times, it makes it all the more enjoyable to revisit the streets, hills and coast through Steinbeck's descriptions and think about how the area might have looked, felt and smelled before I ever had the chance to see it.Cannery Row is a fun, light read compared to many of Steinbeck's other works, but it is still a great book and a wonderful representation of the author's style. I would rank it #2 among my Steinbeck favorites, with East of Eden being #1."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"when reading this book, i fell into the present-oriented society that was cannery row. the plot may seem minimal but is so endearing because of the realism. nothing seemed to hit Mack and the guys too hard. you have to read this book. you'll love it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"If I had to pick only one Steinbeck book out of all of them, this would be the one.

Steinbeck doesn't run along to long of a plotline, yet still fills a book with beauty. It's the place that is the magic here, with the scenery taking the role of a character all its own. The mastery is revelaed when you realize that you're soaking in the beauty of what is normally considered ugly: docks and a cannery, the decaying part of a town, the homeless camps... But it all seems like the greatest pllace on earth. Steinbeck makes it seem like it's not where you are, but how you look at it."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannery Row is much more than the short comic sentimental telling of a year in the life of a marginalized community that exists on such scraps as an industrialized society throws its way. It is also a sustained and almost completely successful protrayal of philosophic fatalism in action. Those who struggle to the top are wasting their lives while those who literally dance to Nature's rhythms can find a sense of joy in being completed. Sometimes that completion is available through death, sometimes through accepting one's lot in life, and sometimes there is an opportunity for a great party...but not if you try too hard to plan any of this."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"The climax of characterization for American writers.

Although some people are right in saying that the plot isn't as strong as it could be, these people only need to look a little deeper. The second chapter alone, with its description of Lee Chong and Mack and the boys is a pure literary masterpiece. If you are in doubt about whether to read this book or not, read it.

By that I mean that this book has shed a little light on my life and opened my eyes a little. It has reminded me not to look upon those that are financially inferior to yourself as &quot;poor&quot;. These creatures are in many ways superior to yourself in their view of an easy going life without the troubles of money. I'm not saying that all homeless people are philosophers, but I am saying that the old adage is in fact true: &quot;You can't judge a book by it's cover&quot;.

Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, \\"Cannery Row\\" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), \\"Cannery Row\\" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study.

What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others.

Doc is always trying to help everyone and offering his help. Throughout the whole book everyone is trying to repay or give back to Doc because the people of Cannery Row feel that they own Doc something. The people come up with a plan to throw him a party, but the plan backfires and Docs' house ends up getting messed up the party has a negative reaction.

There are your true philosophers...I think they survive in this particular world a lot better than other people. In a time when other people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness, they are relaxed. All of our so-called successful men are sick men, with bad stomachs, and bad souls, but Mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean. They can do what they want. They can satisfy their appetites without calling it something else.\\"...a manifesto that rings particularly poignant in this, the beginning of a new century, the riches and ruins of the \`New World Order' .In style the book resembles Steinback's earlier 'The Pastures of Heaven,' alternating between characters and situations to construct an overall glimpse of a working community--but the characters of 'Cannery Row' are less eccentric and the writing is more polished, and where in 'Pastures' Steinback sought to show the cracks and flaws within the small-town facade, the theme of this particular book is the true meaning of wealth.Wealth is often confused with material possessions/excess, rather than spiritual and physical health. Thus we have a vast American middle-class working countless crushing hours to obtain that new SUV and thus gain the illusion of success--which, of course, keeps out economy 'growing' and the shareholders happy, not to mention the fastfood chains and the hospitals busy. Nor is this a new manifestation of public consciousness in the high-speed information era: Steinback undoubtedly saw it taking place in the steady urban sprawl of southern California, and wrote his reaction on the printed page.The wealth Steinback champions in 'Cannery Row' are simple, subtle values: the respect of friendship, giving unconditionally, forgiveness, accepting others for who they are, enjoying what you have rather than fretting about what you do not, minimizing negative stress through selfless actions and negotiations...all 'shown' rather than 'told', the mark of real talent. I give 'Cannery Row' four stars because it is a bit on the light side, and not quite in the league of Steinback's five-star masterpieces (Grapes, Winter), but this is certainly a worthy read in and by itself."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"John Steinbeck is incredible at giving vivid pictures through using words.I felt like a watched a movie from reading this book.the story never really goes anywhere and its a short read.i guess when u read a steinbeck novel you need to focus on the symbolisms and analogies rather than the actual stories."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"i think this book was cool becuase they all get drunk and party and they arent very smart but the book lags because john stienbeck goes into a totally differnt story that has absolutly nothing to do with the main story like in chapter 14 i had a hard time paying attention to it the book really didnt have a big climax and i thought it could use more intensity."},{"Title":"Cannery Row","review":"Cannary Row was a good book.. it was very descriptive, as if you were actually in Monterey CA.

Claire was once the toast of Broadway as an award winning director and playwright, but relocates to Palm Desert to manage the Desert Arts College Theater. Mega-millionaire Glenn Yeats recruited the most talented people including Claire to chair the departments at the school.At a welcoming party hosted by Glenn, Claire meets and hits it off with fellow chair Paul Huron and his wife Jodie. When Paul needs a ride from airport, Claire volunteers to take him. Upon arriving at his home, they find Jodie dead with her valuable wedding ring missing. Claire becomes obsessed with the case and soon proves quite competent at finding clues; She is so good the lead investigator officially adds her to his team.While it seems implausible for a police officer to allow a civilian to help in a homicide case, the heroine's mindset and actions will make believers out of readers. Michael Craft provides an intense tale with appealing characters that the audience will want back in future novels. DESERT AUTUMN appears to be the first novel on what has the potential of being a great series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Desert Autumn: A Claire Gray Mystery (Claire Gray Series)","review":"Claire is a very well known and respected theater director from New York. After a lot of pressure from a billionaire developer, she agreed to head the theater department at a new theatrical college near Palm Springs. Then, after only two weeks in the desert, a colleague's wife is found murdered. Claire, having directed murder scenes in theater, now has an urge to help solve this murder.Along the way, Claire meets Tanner, who was initially a suspect, and convinces him to enroll in the new college. Tanner, who is less than half her age, is very anxious to do just that. For an audition, Tanner recited a monologue from a play that Claire wrote. She was very moved. Then they took their relationship to a new level, with a little bump and grind.Claire works her way through several suspects, and does indeed finally solve the murders. Yes, there was a second murder. There was one person who could have put the pieces together and nailed the murderer sooner, but the murderer searched him out and killed him as well. I was shocked at who the murderer was. I had some suspicions, but was blinded by other possibilities.This was an excellent first book of a new series. I cannot wait for the next books to come out. I hope to hear more about Tanner, and look forward to hearing about Thad Quatrain as the school opens and classes begin."},{"Title":"Desert Autumn: A Claire Gray Mystery (Claire Gray Series)","review":"An interesting start of a new series with the main character a theatre director, introduced in his short novel \\"Rehearsing\\" Here Claire Gray, a renown Broadway theatre director comes to Palm Springs to build a theatre program at a new college for the arts built buy a billionaire software magnate geek (can you say Bill Gates anyone?) Anyway, Mr. Crofts skills at narration, story development and complexity are improving with every book. I truly enjoyed this new one since the emphasis was not strictly on gay characters but a healthy mix of gay and straight characters. in many ways the only flaw in the characterizations I found was that the lead character, a woman, is written more like a strong assertive gay man rather than a true woman."},{"Title":"Desert Autumn: A Claire Gray Mystery (Claire Gray Series)","review":"I've been a fan of the Mark Manning series for a while now.

I had a hard time putting it down. Nancy Drew to Mark and Neil's Hardy Boys? I'm not sure it's even legal to put it that way, but there it is.And I'll say it again if you like.Bottom line: If you enjoy Craft's other works, you WILL enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Desert Autumn: A Claire Gray Mystery (Claire Gray Series)","review":"In DESERT AUTUMN Michael Craft finally gives voice (and a new mystery series) to Claire Grey, his first lady of the American theater who had been previously introduced as a minor character in his successful Mark Manning series.Now as she begins her own series, Claire's reputation as a leading theatrical director and playwright has brought her to the attention of computer software maven, D.Glenn Yeats. Yeats is personally supplying the cash and drive needed to build and staff his own Desert Arts College near Palm Springs, California. His goal is to create the ultimate educational facility dedicated to the arts staffed by the leading practitioners in each of its many fields. Naturally he sees Claire as the crowning jewel of his illustrious faculty, and after repeated attempts he finally persuades in her to head the drama department of the school.The novel begins with Claire's arrival in the desert shortly before the opening of the school year where she is quickly introduced to not just the other members of the faculty, but also the body of the wife of one of her fellow professors. Naturally, the woman has been murdered; and Claire (noting that in the theater the two motives for murder are either greed or passion) decides that the motive for this murder had to be passion as she sets out to (unofficially) aid the police in uncovering the murderer.The book is fast-paced and well-endowed with plot twists. Just when you think you've discovered the identity of the murderer, another potential suspect is revealed. Actually, the characters keep auditioning for the part of the murderer right up to the concluding chapter, which naturally ends with a traditionally theatrical flair.DESERT AUTUMN is a well-written and entertaining novel with the cast of extremely interesting characters needed to populate a continuing series. Although, I felt at times the key characters of Grant and Kiki just didn't ring true. But based on the author's previous work, this minor detail will be resolved as the series progresses.Overall, I was particularly attracted to this book because it combines two of my interests - mystery fiction and the world of the theater. Claire Grey is a welcome addition to the ranks of fiction's amateur sleuths and I not only look forward to her continuing adventures, I also encourage you to add her toyour reading list, too."},{"Title":"Desert Autumn: A Claire Gray Mystery (Claire Gray Series)","review":"As a devoted reader of Michael Craft's past books in the Mark Manning series, I must admit, I was skeptical of his intentions to go for a mainstream (straight) audience with this new one. Now, having read &quot;Desert Autumn,&quot; I'm completely won over. Claire Gray is a delightful heroine, with depth and drive. Her sense of longing and search for self identity provide the perfect counterpoint to Craft's other hero. (And Claire's taste in men will be found appealing by readers on both sides of the fence!) The story itself is as good as any Craft has written, a little long maybe, but the author seems to be feeling his way in new terrain. Highly recommended.

I would take the certification test, but you have to go through official training first (quite expensive). I am generally apprehensive about buying a computer book that gets a really low review from what seems to be a credible sources. But I took a chance and bought Virtualization: From the Desktop to the Enterprise.Basically, I would like to share with you that this book is darn good and it covers virtualization applications, like ESX Server and Virtual Server really well. Moreover, the book does a really good job of taking you through virtual file systems, clustering, and virtual machine backups on a budget. One thing I noticed about the book is that it is pretty darn vendor neutral and will get you up and running in not time.After reading the book, I wanted to share with you what I found out about the one-star review.Allegation in Review:\\"-It says ESX [runs on the] bare metal but then lists the size requirements to install it on Linux and Windows [which is impossible, if it runs on the bare metal]\\"What I found out:On page 154, the text states that \\"ESX server directly communicates with your system's hardware and is said to run on the metal.\\" Within two paragraphs, hardware requirements are discussed. No mention of Linux or Windows is made. Moreover, the first paragraph in the section under \\"Installing VMware ESX Server\\" (p.154) states that ESX Server is \\"a stand-alone product, which means an operating system isn't required to host the ESX Server virtualization application\\". No where in the text are the requirements of ESX server conflated with GSX server which installs on top of Linux and Windows. This statement by the reviewer is false.Allegation in Review:\\"-It totally mixes the concepts of SC swap with vmkernel swap by applying sizing recommendations for SC swap to vmkernel swap.\\"What I found out:The book discusses swap file configuration location for the Service Console (SC) on page 167: no mention of sizing requirements is made. As noted in the chapter introduction (Chapter 5), the book is taking a \\"step-by-step approach when showing how to install each virtualization application\\". Moreover, on page 154, the book discusses that \\"two configuration scenarios [will be covered:] the first scenario covers what might be involved with a troubled installation, and the second scenario details what you'll experience with a typical configuration.\\" If the reader of this review actually read the book and was performing a troubled install as noted in the introduction, the information on page 168 regarding swap files is about the current Swap Configuration screens. The text makes no distinction between the vmkernel swap file and the SC swap file.Allegation in Review:\\"-It talks about USB on ESX [which is currently not supported] \\"What I found out:The book does cover the configuration and use of USB devices and the book acknowledges that it is currently not supported. The book, beginning on page 185, provides detailed steps to make USB function. In addition, on page 185, the book states \\"VMware fully documents disabling USB support\\" and on page 187, the book discusses that \\"USB devices aren't supported within ESX Server...and VMware briefly explains this in Answer ID 1015 in its knowledge base.\\" Despite that USB is not \\"officially\\" supported, it does work and enabling USB is clearly documented by VMware in its knowledge base. The statement by the reviewer is a misrepresentation of the text."},{"Title":"Virtualization: From the Desktop to the Enterprise (Books for Professionals by Professionals)","review":"This book was an excellent buy. Finally someone has covered virtualization in its entirety. I was looking for a book that covered installing and best practices when using VMware GSX and ESX server but was pleasantly surprised to find out that I had ended up with a book that covered a whole lot more. The authors not only covered VMware products but also covered virtual file systems including DFS and AFS and load-balanced virtual clusters. This book also included helpful tips and scripts for backing up virtual machines. If you have attended the VMware class on ESX and Virtual Center, like I have, this book covers most of that material and fills any gaps left by that class.

I must say that I have been very impressed with its content. The authors cover all of the major virtual machine software technologies, including VMware, Microsoft Virtual Server, and Microsoft Virtual PC. At first I was afraid that with so much coverage, this book would be a rehash of existing online docs, but this wasn't the case at all. While the book does offer some simple guidance to get you started with each technology (with both coverage on Windows and Linux), its real value comes in the many tips, tricks, and hacks discovered by the authors. For example, there is a chapter full of backup scripts that can be used for VMware VMs on each platform type, Microsoft Virtual Server, and Virtual PC. The book also describes how to resize virtual disk files. This is not supported, but pretty good to know if you have a virtual disk that is too small.The book also covers distributed file systems and clustering. I had wanted to setup DFS on Samba for a long time, but didn't have time to do all of the research. After following the procedures in the book, the process was pretty easy. There are also steps provided for setting up Windows and Linux failover and load balanced clusters.The book finishes up by describing SANs and storage virtualization.

I saw several books on Amazon, but decided to buy something that covered all aspects of virtualization. I settled on Virtualization: From the Desktop to the Enterprise. Let me fill your ears with what I think.What I Like:This book covers Microsoft and VMware products and was very helpful for installing the demo versions that came with the book. I downloaded the latest version of ESX from VMware (I had to give them my email address). The book nicely compares hard to find specifications of both Micorosft and VMware products, and some did differ from current product releases. I suspect the authors were using data that was available at the time. I think one of the most cool things about the book is that the authors give you tips and tricks on using services the vendors don't support. I don't know about you, but I like to know about easter eggs. Enough about software applications, Let's move on.This book just doesn't stop with virtual applications; it completely discusses virtual storage and virtual file systems. Now, if you were like me, you may be thinking who cares about virtual file systems and storage, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out about how much I was not leveraging the resources of my work servers. For me, the book is worth it for these two things alone.What I don't Like:For book written at an intermediate level, I really don't have anything bad to say other than that I wish it covered open source products like Xen.Chuck Doan"},{"Title":"Virtualization: From the Desktop to the Enterprise (Books for Professionals by Professionals)","review":"This book provides installation coverage for VMware (ESX, GSX, and Workstaion) and Microsoft Virtualization applications (Virtual PC and Virtual Server).

Though the book can be a bit academic, it is easy to read and is packed with practical information and devoid of marketing hype. Some vendor specific information is outdated; however, the publisher maintains updates on the web.

We are a Microsoft shop, and I really like the idea of keeping it that way by using Virtual Server. On the other hand, after reading several software reviews on the Web, I am completely aware of the power of Linux and what ESX Server can potentially do for us.To aid in the decision making process, I knew I would have to test both systems. After getting this book a couple weeks ago, we easily installed and configured both virtualization products and ran them with our in-house applications simultaneously. For our tests, both performed about the same. What really helped us in testing is that the book introduced editing configuration files, managing virtual machines across multiple servers, and monitoring virtual machine performance for both virtualization applications. The book also covers command line commands. The book also covers virtual file systems, clustering, backup, and rule-of-thumb best practices, but as an IT veteran, I didn't find this information as something I didn't already know. As for whether or not we are going with VMware or Virtual server, we are still testing and we got off to a great start with the aid of this book as an excellent primer.

The author would have liked to present more complete evidences of the Flood as the cause of the fossiliferous strata than he was able to do in the space available. He resolved, however, to satisfy his desire ... by writing a separate book dealing only with that subject. That book, a companion to 'After Its Kind,' the writer is presenting to the Church in 'The Deluge Story in Stone.'\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"It would be folly indeed to maintain a Flood theory of geology, if the Bible did not countenance such a theory.\\" (Pg. 1)\\"The manner of their entombment tells an instructive story... It can hardly be thought that these fish are in their native habitat, or died naturally where they bred and flourished, as uniformitarian geologists maintain regarding shells that are found in the strata. Only some catastrophe of the nature of the Flood can satisfactorily explain their mode of burial.\\" (Pg. 42)\\"...for no other reason than that the strata are in the wrong order, on the basis of a supposed organic evolution, the strata are said to have reversed themselves.\\" (Pg. 146)\\"According to the sacred record, the purpose of the Flood was to punish and destroy men. The question is asked, Where are the fossils of these men? Why are they not discovered as are the relics of prediluvian plants and animals? To this objection various answers have been given: ... It was God's deliberate purpose to leave no vestige of prediluvian man remaining.\\" (Pg. 161)\\"Assuming the Biblical record to be correct, the general similarity between the widely scattered accounts (of the Flood) is readily accounted for. The only alternative to the theory that there was one single flood catastrophe, universal as far as the human race is concerned, which is the basis for all of the Deluge legends, is that there were many separate local floods each of which is the basis of a different flood account. This alternative has this chief objection: namely, that the remarkable similarity in the Deluge legends is not accounted for.\\" (Pg. 166-167)"},{"Title":"Squirrels and other fur-bearers (The out-of-door library : school ed)","review":"I got this book for material for research for a book I am writing.

Blackmore guides the reader on an exhilarating crashcourse through all the issues relevant to the problem of consciousness, from Descartes to the thought of contemporary scientists and philosophers.This book has a number of unique strengths. Most importantly, Blackmore has managed to distill to their essences the various features of what is often a baffling subject, and writes in clear, lively prose. This alone would justify the book's purchase.Another strength is her focus not just on the speculative, but on the hard science relevant to consciousness. She frequently makes reference to (and explains) experiments illuminating the characteristics and activities of the mind/brain.Blackmore also does a good job at introducing prominent thinkers in the area of consciousness by including photos, mini-bios, and explaining their work and why it is important.Blackmore seems very clever, and overall is quite fair in her assessment of the competing strands of thought within this field. There is only one peculiarity (whether it is a fault or not depends on perspective) that concerns me: almost every discussion of any aspect of consciousness seems to include, and often concludes with, entirely uncritical descriptions of what Tufts philosopher Daniel Dennett thinks about the issue. This is odd, because virtually everyone else's ideas are subjected to tough questioning by Blackmore. As if to punctuate this seemingly uncritical embrace of Dennett, Blackmore even uses photos of - guess who? - Daniel Dennett to construct a montage demonstrating blind spots (see page 82).As a kind of prima facie indicator of whether there was indeed a dramatically lopsided reliance on, or deference to, Dennett, I turned to the index to count up the number of pages in which various scientists and philosophers were referred to or discussed in the book. To be generous, I disregarded thinkers mentioned only in passing, and focused on eleven prominent names (Chalmers, Churchland, Dawkins, Damasio, etc.). The average number of index pages for each thinker was fourteen, while the total number of pages for Dennett was....71! No one else even comes close to half the citations.Despite the real achievements of this book, Blackmore's handling of Dennett might be of concern to some readers, who, like I have, have gotten the sense that at this point, it is far too early for the construction and reinforcement of any orthodoxy or dogma; while many theories have been proposed, we all still seem to be feeling about largely in the dark vis-&agrave;-vis this most mysterious of fields.However, as is again made clear in quotations from him in the book, Dennett seems (sometimes gleefully) predisposed to dogmatic, Cardinal Ratzinger-like pronouncements about almost every aspect of this science (note, for example, the telling title of his 1991 book, \\"Consciousness Explained\\" [sigh]). He often seems to advance his arguments using rhetorical features that place them stylistically in with arguments made by people like Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson. (Perhaps this is an inevitable consequence of a commitment to any fundamentalist, absolutist world-explaining ideology [whether theist or atheist, like Dennett embraces]; but since, as I mentioned, this is only the dawn of consciousness studies, who knows? Perhaps future research will finally reveal whether the relentless arrogance and dogmatism of Dawkins and Dennett and Swaggart and Robertson are indeed attributable to identical neurological processes in the brain, showing all four humans to be of the same unique type, no matter how much they might all loathe being associated with each other; and depending on how the free will debate turns out, we might even be able to find out whether any of them can even be held accountable for the general intolerability of their pedadogical styles).This is not to say that Dennett is wrong about everything; he may turn out to be right about everything. All I mean to say is that, given the current less-than-airtight evidence for Dennett's ideas, and a modus operandi that suggests he may not exactly be open-minded, Blackmore's attachment to Dennett ought to be considered by readers. If we buy a book called \\"Economics: An Introduction\\", and we see that of all the economic authorities cited, Karl Marx has over five times the average amount of citations and is the only one treated uncritically, we would have every reason to suspect that possibly a prior commitment by the author has inhibited her ability, or even desire, to evaluate or present Marx's ideas sans bias, or even sans what psychologist Daniel Goleman calls mental lacunae.If, as seems indisputable, Blackmore thinks Dennett is closer to the truth on everything than everyone else, can we see the requisite hard evidence that he is? And if this evidence does not exist yet, should Blackmore's endorsement of Dennett not just be made explicit so we can take that into consideration as we try to form our own conclusions about things?In fairness, I should say that Dennett, for better or for worse, is a leading voice in consciousness studies, so one might as well become familiar with his ideas (I won't spoil the surprise).Despite the Dennett issue (Blackmore and Dennett might argue \\"because\\" of it), the truth is that this book is still by far the best that I know of for introducing the emerging science of consciousness. Blackmore might be twitterpated with the chest-thumping Dennett, but she's very smart and a very good writer, and covers pretty much all the bases that need to be covered in an intelligible way. That's why I'm giving this book five stars.Good luck"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I am glad to find a complete book dealing with all aspects of consciousness in CLEARLY written format, with graphs and tables to facilitate comprehension. The book covers everything I had seen before from Artificial Intelligence to Philosophy to Neurology to Evolutionary Biology.Say one wants to get an idea of Dan Dennett's theory of consciousness (without having to get through Dennett's circuitous, unfocused and evasive prose) or Searle's Chinese room argument or Turing's test or Chalmer's position or Churchland's neurophilosophy or a presentation of research on the neural correlates of consciousness...Everything I could think about is there."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"You have to wonder when an author declares her intention to perplex you. With any book about the human mind, you have a right to expect information and clarification. There's a great deal of information here, and it's presented with clarity. However, while you will learn much from this book, at the end you will be aware of how much remains to be done. That situation, as Blackmore explains, is due to the nature of the subject. Not only are the issues of consciousness difficult to explain, but, a definition - the very foundation of discussion - is lacking. With such a frail base, what can an author give the enquiring reader? Blackmore summarises the advances made in attempting to define \\"consciousness\\". Her approach, although formatted as a textbook, is accessible to anyone wishing to delve into studies of the mind. She's to be applauded for synopsising a very dynamic topic with apparent ease.The study of consciousness is inevitably contentious. With so little firm information available on the workings of the brain, theories of \\"how the mind works\\" abound. Blackmore skilfully guides the reader through the many theories of mind that have emerged over many centuries. Blackmore uses those theories to organise her presentation, describing a theorist and his/her idea as a discussion focus. Inevitably, it is Descartes and \\"dualism\\" that provide the opening scenario. The structure allows the author to post some \\"assignments\\" that may look like academic exercises, but are couched in terms any reader can understand and use. After all, we all have ideas about what \\"consciousness\\" means. Why should we not test our assumptions? Blackmore helps us do this as each chapter offers another step in contrasting our own views with that of the philosophers.With over two millennia of thinkers on thinking, ideas proposed and overturned, it would seem this book might be a Rogue's Gallery of theories and theorists. Blackmore is too even-handed to render summary judgements, especially condemnatory ones. There are few heroes in this tale - with the exception of William James. He's frequently lauded, not only for founding the science of psychology, but for the lengthy list of insights into the human mind he discerned. Blackmore's tributes to James are low-key and not effusively laudatory. But there are few chapters that aren't introduced by a Jamesian quotation. James' successors, from Chalmers to Searle, address Cartesian dualism in various ways. Dennett, the most scathing critic of the \\"Cartesian theatre\\" in which a virtual little \\"person\\" sits in our brain viewing the world, crops up repeatedly. That's only right and proper, since many of those claiming to have dumped dualism, secretly harbour it. The hints are often well camouflaged, but Blackmore shows how Dennett's discerning gaze penetrates any obscuring verbiage to triumphantly expose it to public scrutiny.As Blackmore guides us through most of the prevailing concepts of consciousness, she introduces some of the novelties that distort our perception of it. Nearly half the book is composed of descriptions of things that mislead us. Various dream states, and their impact on the body are presented. The \\"phantom limb\\" syndrome, amnesia and perceptions of spirits and fairies all make their appearance. Blackmore parades these anomalies before us, accompanied by explanations of their real nature - which runs from cryptic neurotransmitter behaviour to outright fraud.Although this book appears as a university text, and will likely be welcomed in many classrooms, its readership will not be confined to academic halls. The mysteries of consciousness are of concern to us all. That alone should lead to it being placed on countless shelves. These are issues that continue to intrigue us. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Susan Blackmore has written an excellent book dealing with one of the most challenging problems confronting human kind as we enter the 21st century: What is consciousness and how do we explain it. The book examines consciousness from myriad viewpoints;philosophical, psychological, and biological. Ms. Blackmore presents a plethora of fascinating topics such as:What is it like to be a bat?,What are we actually seeing?,What is it like to be an animal?,Could a machine be conscious?, What are the neural correlates of consciousness?, How do we distinguish between reality and imagination?, and, finally, How are Buddhism and consciousness related?All the key players involved in the study of consciousness such as Renes Descartes, David Chalmers, Patricia Churchland, Daniel Dennett, Alan Turing,Francis Crick, Roger Penrose, John Eccles, etc. are found in this wonderful book.Each chapter contains profiles, concepts, activities, and practices,and readings. The references are excellent. And Ms. Blackmore writes in clear, concise prose.If you have ever wondered what consciousness may be, then this is the book for you whether you plan to use it for a college course or simply read it yourself. This is a great and fun read! Don't delay; buy a copy today and the price is right!!!"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Don't kid yourself. Reading this book will be a lot of hard work, as each chapter takes a lot of thinking and reflecting.But is also lots of fun. And Susan Blackmoreguides you through the subject with plenty of good and precise insights. So, it is well worth the effort.Some chapters I would have liked longer and more in depth, while some could have been shortened considerable in my view. However, with a subject matter that has kept the best thinkers on the planet busy for at least the last two millennia - I guess you shouldn't be surprised that readers might disagree on the weight certain issues are given in this book.Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, consciousnessgets covered from all the angles you would expect from such a book. From neurology and biology to philosophy and onwards to artificial intelligence. Certainly, I don't feel that there is anything missing in Blackmores introduction to the subject of consciousness.Like other readers I feel that it is far too early for the construction and reinforcement of any orthodoxy or dogma in the field of consciousness (Except of course that I think we should keep the loony stuff out - and there I go, on my way to my own definitions of good and bad).And I do enjoy Dennett as much as the next guy - but from time to time in the book you have the feeling that Dennett is \\"truth\\", while the author feels free to deal a mortal blow or two to others, as being merely silly believers in the cartesian theatre model.Certainly I don't think e.g. Antonio Damasio is given fair deal in this book (as I consider his work really outstanding and far above any cartesian theatre illusions). Damasio is also more in line with what I think might be the truth of the matter that Dennett. Blackmore has the bias the other way around. Or so it seems. But nevermind.Still, it is a brilliant and enlightening book.-Simon"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I used this book for a philosophy class. Blackmore took ideas that could potentially be very confusing (especially to someone new to the philosophy and explanation of consciousness), and explained them in layman's terms...this book was written clearly and thoroughly. Consciousness: An Introduction was my saving grace in that philosophy class, through this book I was able not only to understand, but become interested in learning about consciousness."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Really nothing great here as far as advancement or variety. Blackmore gives a straight up the line (biased in her favor and Dennets, note the HEAVY citing of their papers) history of consciousness research and theory. However, anyone other than the mainstream dennet followers are given a mention at best, and I was VERY surprised at the few pages she affords Chalmers. Of course, it gets preachy towards the end with Blackmore's Americanized buddhism, but overall is a good start for exploration. Aside from the heavy bias there are some cute cartoons. Seriously though, most of the research cited isn't current, challenges to Dennet and Blackmore herself dont exist in this book (or their reality) and really should be given to students with a grain of salt and a bit of surrounding information on some of the very brief topics (qualia? turing? ndes?). If we teach all students to think in this same mold we're probably going to get...more of the same! I suggest this text with supplementary readings and heavy elaboration for the suggested classroom use."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Blackmore wrote a very important book, because it is the first \\"true\\" textbook on the subject. There are other texts, like Wallace's consciounsness and behaviour, and other collections, like Block et. al.s nature of consciousness, or Carters consciousness, but these could be described or used as textbooks without being textbooks per se. That is, Blackmore's book has the exercises, review questions, profiles of some important figures, that make it a real textbook. However, I am impressed more by the scope of the book. There are many different chapters on many differetn things, and the author does not forget about issues like parapsychology (Blackmore was once a psi researcher), time, animal consicousness, all issues that many other authors seem to leave aside.The book itself is very readable, and the strenghts,like the number of different chapters, come with weaknesses, like too brief discussions of certain very important, or central, themes. Blackmoere does succeed in giving a sense of the perplexities of studying consicousness to the reader. She is also a very apt philosopher, and explains philosophical ideas much more clearly that other non-philosophers do. She is also very common-sensical and does not fall for many of the traps laid on the field of consicousness studies, save, of-course, only one. The \\"illusion\\" trap. Let me explain.Everey time the discussion is about to climax, and the reader expects an insight, or maybe a conclusion, Blackmore seems to state that everything may just be an illusion. Visual perception? an illusion. Free will? an illusion. Binding? an illusion. qualia? an illusion. Now I do not believe that illusions do not exist, or that they cannot serve an explanatory role. Certainly, visual perception and free will might be illusions. Attentional blindeness studies, and Wegners or LIbets work suggest these possibilities. But why should perceptual binding be an illusion? it is a fairly simple conceptual question, it is empirical and many empirical studies, like the synchrony or attention- models, seem to offer not so mysterian answers. The thing is, I believe, that Blackmore got caught in the intuition pumps created by none other than Daniel Dennett, the philosopher who by the way is most quoted, discussed and brought to bear on every question posed in the book.Blackmore seems to believe not only that there is no cartesian theather, a place where all consicousness comes together, (which is right), but that it is impossible that consicousness could be located anywhere at all. If this is so, she is wrong. Consciousness is in the brain. How, why, at what time, we still do not know. But if we can locate consicousness in a brain, why not several brain areas? we can just discard those that seem not essential for consciousness, in lesion experiments, for exapmple. Why not just couple of brain areas? now, it may not be that simple, maybe consicousness does not reside or happen at a time, maybe its just identical with those brain a reas. Why the big fuss about consicousness and everything about it as an illusion? Because Dennett is probably the most convincing philosopher, and Blackmore was convinced.How about qualia. An illusion, Blackmore tells us. It only seems there are qualia, but there are not. The thing is, qualia ARE that seeming, and it is that seeming that needs explaining. Qualia are real, and that anything seems like anything at all is a proof of their existence. What exactly they are, I do not know. But they are not just illusions. AS if their being so would solve anything anyway.Blackmore also got too carried daway with drawing lines. Either you are a physicalist, a functionalist, or a dualist. She also knows how to determine that. Either you believe in zombies, or not. This is by far the most simplistic analysis of the philosophical quarrels I have read lately. This is not to say she does not make some important points, however. Philosophers, nevertheless, would have a field trip in reviewing this book. Scientists woould be angered by her mysterianism and pessimism. Maybe this makes this book perfect for non-specialists.This is all too negative. The book is very, very good and complete. It covers many, many important issues. It has an extensive bibliography, although extensive is not enough with such a complicatted subject. It is trully the first textbook, and is very accesible. For the same reason, it ends up being quite superficial at times. It is all good for the undergraduate taking a course, but the really interested reader should only see this book as a good place to start. Those familiar with the field could do without reading it, but they should anyway. Blackmore does deserve her name among those considered experts on the field."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Indeed this is, as the subtitle says, an introduction to the many topics related to consciousness. Within, the reader will find sections on attention, theories of self, agency & free will, evolution of consciousness and its function, artificial consciousness, neuroscience of consciousness, the unconscious, altered consciousness (including sleep/dreams, drugs, hypnosis), meditation, and more.With clarity that textbook-style volumes usually lack, Susan Blackmore begins by posing the fundamental problems of consciousness to the reader and asking us to genuinely reflect on this idea of \\"my consciousness\\" that, perhaps until now, we've never truly investigated very deeply. Blackmore goes on to introduce us to the many issues and problems related to the study of consciousness, and how many great thinkers have attempted to solve them. Of course, each approach has its merits and failures and Blackmore attempts to address them each on their own grounds. Whether she succeeds or not may depend on who you ask, especially considering how deeply divided the proponents of various theories of consciousness are. I think the apparant bias in Dennett's favor (claimed by other reviewers) is probably real but, in defense of the author, a fair hearing of Dennett's theory does require considerable attention and I think she succeeds in giving it without implying its superiority.Throughout the book are many flashy graphics, illustrations, personal profiles, and \\"Concept\\" and \\"Activity\\" side-bars to help the reader (and potential instructor) along. Some were useful, but unfortunately others served to distract more than anything else. A book on conscious awareness shouldn't be cluttered with distractions! The only other issues I encountered had to do with a few vocab words thrown at the reader without clear initial explanation (e.g. \\"homunculus\\"), and also at least a couple times during Blackmore's descriptions of experiments I found it difficult to piece together exactly how the experimental set-up was supposed to work.These things aside, this book is a great introduction to those (like myself) not yet familiar with the consciousness debate and its major players. With such readability and the obvious enthusiasm of the author, it's hard to put down once you've picked it up. The meat of the book is in the first half where the major theories of consciousness and self are initially laid out, so if you don't have the stamina to see it all the way through you'll at least get the most important parts. The author encourages readers to begin at the beginning, but to feel free to skip to the sections that most interest them once they've read about the basic problem of consciousness.After reading this book, I feel like I have a broad enough base of knowledge that I can read much more in-depth studies and topics and still keep a larger perspective on the consciousness debate. Now I just need to choose which book to put on my list next!"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I decided to order this book after reading an article from Susan Blackmore on the web.I am half way through the book.God, it is so good.Takes you through so different approaches to think about consciousness.I am a computer guy and don't know much about psychology, cognitive sciences... but Susan makes it very accessible and you get to learn about many different fields (philosophy, psychology, biology, computer science...)It's the only book I have read about the subject, so I don't know how it compares to others.But I found the book extremly clear, well divided and the layout is just great.Amazing job.If you are like me, you may have your opinions on consciousness, and you may wonder what other people that thought about it have to say.Then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Susan Blackmore has written a textbook on \\"consciousness\\". Do not be put off, it is eminently suitable as a reference. A feature is the extensive bibliography at the back. Blackmore is a determinist but freely discusses the work of other researchers who do not share her viewpoint.For anyone seriously wanting to come to grips with the latest ideas in human consciousness, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"I am not a student and wanted to read a somewhat in-depth overview of consciousness. I am very disappointed by this book, despite liking the author's book The Meme Machine.The book contains large sections on ESP, out-of-body experiences, etc. This shows the book's target audience; undergraduate students presumably like this cool stuff. The book is full of boxes and pictures that are there presumably to make the text easier to read. This is in itself a signal (not proof) that the text itself has been dumbed down as well.Many classic experiements are described (this is good), but not in a very satisfactory way. For instance Libet on arm flexing and free will. However, there are no conclusions. I would for instance like to know what the majority of researcher think about the issues today. If they fall into two camps, fine, just describe the current status. Instead the author describes some follow-up experiments but she gets too hooked on describing them rather than mention their theoretical significance for advance our theory of consciousness. And then she ends and moves on to another topic.In a way the book is easy to read, but it is harder to feel that one has understood anything after reading. It is like reading Nietzsche; easy to read, but to understand is another matter. But I suppose the similarities end there."},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Shortly after read THE MEME MACHINE, I had a dream in which I was arguing with Susan Blackmore about her denial of the existence of a self. She told me that I had just misunderstood her. Though quite sure that I had not misunderstood her, from past experience I know that my unconscious is aware of more things than I am, it seemed a good idea to further examine her ideas. Though an excellent book, this review will concentrate upon those parts with which I disagree, since those were the part that forced me to think more deeply about my own bias.Susan Blackmore presents the strictly materialist view of consciousness. In other words, she believes that the self, free will, and consciousness are all illusions. To say that something is an illusion is not to deny that it exists, but that it is something quite different than it appears to be. Some years ago while working in a hay field after dark, my friends and I saw several rabbits jumping around near a hay bale. When we got closer, we saw that these rabbits were just paper beings rustled by the breeze. The paper really existed; the rabbits did not. As I understand SB, consciousness is more like papers blowing in the wind than real rabbits. This conclusion necessarily follows from SB's assumption that it has already been proven that consciousness is a product of blind evolution.SB points out that \\"the underlying molecular processes are usually assumed to be deterministic, so this is one reason why there appears to be no room for free will.\\" Quantum effects cause indeterminacy, but these infinitesimal effects merely provide for a range of similar, random outcomes rather than drastically altering the possible outcomes. This is also necessarily true for molecules functioning in the evolutionary process. It is a truism that life and human consciousness can only exist because molecules have to potential to form them. Blind evolution insists that this potential is accidental rather than intrinsic. Dennett's evolutionary algorithm - \\"If you have variation, selection, and heredity, you must get evolution\\" - glosses over the fact that for life to have formed there had to have been hundreds of molecules, each with a complex, highly specific structure, working together to capture and extract energy, replicate, and protect themselves. These molecules had to do these things because the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that they must assume the most stable, lowest-energy confirmation available. Why more reasonable to assume that these molecules did this by mere chance than to assume that life and consciousness are innate qualities of existence? We might assume, as many intelligent people do, that these qualities were put in the molecules by God, but explaining the existence of complexity by assuming that it was created by something infinitely more complex answers nothing. It is more reasonable to assume that life and consciousness exist in primordial form in non-living matter. If this is true, then evolution is not a consequence of selfish genes being by haphazardous gamma bombardment and fighting amongst themselves by survival of the fittest; genes are naturally self-mutating and survival of the fittest is merely the rule life must follow as it naturally progresses towards a level of complexity capable of self-reflective intelligence. This is the possibility that SB either completely ignores or derisively dismisses as \\"magic.\\" The actual evidence is no better for accidental than intrinsic consciousness, and the latter assumption has the virtue of being optimistic. We are not required to imagine gene machines at odds with their constituent molecules, as Dawkins does, or that consciousness might actually be harmful, as SB does.If consciousness exists in its own right, then asking what consciousness is for is meaningless. Consciousness just is. Matter is so that consciousness can organize itself into life and intelligence. SB quotes Searle's statement, \\"brains cause minds.\\" True, but consciousness causes brains. Therein lies the conundrum of human existence, because brains, as SB tells us, function essentially as \\"mindless\\" meme machines. Meme machines form \\"selfplexes,\\" arbitrary identities forged by whatever environment we happen to be in. One brain can even form multiple selfplexes. If our minds are cut off from the primordial consciousness that is the center of our being, our sense of self is indeed delusional, with only delusional free will, and with a pronounced tendency to ideology addiction. In SB's world, our being has no center, so there can be no true self.According to Carl Jung, the main human task is to undergo the individuation process in order to realize the higher self. SB dismisses Jung's theories as frustratingly untestable, though this complain is equally true of her meme theory, and of Buddha's (SB is a Buddhist) notion that one can awaken to the fact that there is no self through meditation. I was surprised to discover that Buddha denied the existence of self. Jung favored Buddhism above all other religion, yet the doctrine of no self clearly contradicts Jung's notion of the higher self. However, this is really only so if Buddha was a materialist. If Buddha was not a materialist, it is surely misleading to call him a \\"bundle theorist,\\" as SB does. What could it mean for a bundle of sensations to achieve enlightenment? There is no self beneath the delusional self to be free of delusion. SB quotes Wren-Lewis: \\"it is no longer the 60-year-old John who looks out at the world, but the shining dark infinite void that in some extraordinary way is also \`I.'\\" D. T. Suzuki says, \\"Absolute faith is placed in a man's own inner being.\\" These two men, at least, seem to experience a self beneath the delusions. However, when we once start giving this pure sense of \\"I\\" names such as \\"divine self,\\" and claiming that Christ is a symbol of this higher self, we will most likely delude ourselves with memetic jargon. So if Buddha was not a materialist, I think I understand what he was getting at. Since SB is a materialist, I understand but disagree with what she is getting at.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)"},{"Title":"Consciousness: An Introduction","review":"Blackmore provides a readable, comprehensive introduction to the field.

And there was this strange phrase: \\"There probably are no paranormal phenomena. (...) if psi exists it is an extremely weak effect\\". It is like saying: \\"The world probably isn't round, but if it is, its curve is extremely flat\\".

I had purchased a different book on Handel for our homeschooling, but it had an anti-Catholic slant and such a serious and lecturing tone that it took the pleasure out of learning about the composer, especially given the young age of my students.Plenty of time later to sort through those issues, but for now, I wanted them to become familiar with the basics of the composer's life on a child's level, and to become acquainted with some of his music, so they could appropriate a love of classical music and a familiarity and \\"friendship\\" with composers into their lives.The stories are well-written and fascinating. They capture the imagination of a child, beginning as they do with the composer's own childhood and awakening love of music. The illustrations, black-and-white, are lively and engaging. Music for many compositions is included if you have a budding pianist in the house.The companion CDs are mixed. They do include printable coloring pages, and they include recordings of each piece of music included in the text, which are many. However, they are digital recordings, not recordings of actual live musical performance, and therefore sound a bit tinny and sterile. I sometimes play these, but when I can, I try to find the same pieces on youtube recorded by real musicians, or in my own CD collection, so that my kids can hear how the real thing sounds. What a difference hearing a digital rendition of a Handel piece versus the real thing played on a harpsichord!Other than that, these are delightful books.

The photograph above doesn't do it justice. The material is kivar-like, and his famous photograph of the entrance to the Moulin Rouge is tinted in red and yellow. Inside, the photographs are arranged thematically, according such topics as Salesman and Traders on the Streets of Paris, or Trades, Shops, and Window Displays, or interiors of Parisian homes, or, my favorite, Old Paris.As the introduction of the book points out, Atget was the great photographic recorder of Old Paris. It is to Paris of the turn of the 19th to the 20th century what Weegee was to lower Manhattan. The pictures in this book are nothing short of remarkable, and to look at them for any length of time helps transport one, to the extent that that is possible, to a world that no longer exists. This is not beautiful, genteel Paris. It isn't the Paris of Proust. It is more the Paris of Baudelaire fifty years down the road, the Paris of Toulouse-Latrec.This without any question the finest inexpensive edition of Atget's photographs currently available, and since Atget is the predominant photographer of the Paris of a hundred years ago, the best inexpensive book of photographs of Old Paris."},{"Title":"Atget's Paris","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of work by Atget.

This is an excellent value for a budget book."},{"Title":"Atget's Paris","review":"Excellent presentation and quality of images. Good representation of what is the whole work of the best Paris-dedicated photographer of the 19th-20th centuries.This book is a must, don't hesitate!"},{"Title":"Atget's Paris","review":"Score another beautifully done coffee table book of photography to Taschen's publishing reputation. Atget was not only one of the pioneers of street photography he may have been the first full-time practitioner of that art? If not the first, he was certainly one of the best and he devoted his entire life to that career. It was amazing he could make a living at it, but then again he had given up both his acting and painting careers, so it may have seemed more lucrative than either of those professions.\\"Born in 1857 the son of a Libourne carriage-builder, he lived for over three decades in the great metropolis of Paris, where he constantly explored the city's historic streets and squares, made contact with numerous potential buyers, and gave evening lectures in adult education centers.\\" His original plan was to sell individual photographs of scenes and nudes to artists in order to save them the costs of traveling to the location or paying for models. He had a great many commissions and contracts to document the historic architecture of \\"Old Paris.\\" His normal shooting gear included 20 kilos of equipment including a heavy-duty tripod, wooden camera and a supply of 18 X 24 cm glass negatives. He spent his entire adult life dragging this heavy burden around all of Paris and its suburbs. It was amazing he had any energy left to take his photos.\\"From 1902, onwards, his visiting cards and letterheads proudly read \`E. Atget, Author and Publisher of a Photographic Collection of Old Paris.'\\" By this time he had become a successful and much in demand photographer.Around 1909 the Paris photographer grew tired of working on a commission basis and started publishing his work in the form of albums of prints and post cards. The subjects of the albums tended to focus on particular subjects such as \\"Vehicles of Paris\\" which was devoted to the pre-automobile means of transport used by Partisans. As the son of carriage maker, Atget had a particular affinity for these horse drawn means of transport and those pictures are some of this reviewer's favorite examples of the photographer's work. He concentrated on the old and carefully avoided the new and trendy. Photographer friend and promoter of Atget's work, Berenice Abbott who eventually purchased most of Atget's negatives and prints from his estate, counted 121 different albums of his work in 1927. Samples from these different albums and motifs are used to separate the different types of photographs reproduced in this collection. Two of my favorite sections in addition to the \\"Vehicles of Paris\\" are the so-called \\"bizarre series, such as portraits of prostitutes (1921), or shots of merry-go-rounds. Added to this, he made a new edition his of his photographs of shop-windows.\\" The shop window displays look very much like the products of today and include styles of clothing that are once again coming into vogue. A neighbor of Atget, Man Ray, was one of the first photographers to take notice of Atget's work and began collecting and publishing it as well as recommending it to other artists, collectors and publishers. May Ray also shared Atget's interest in clothing mannequins, but while Atget considered all his work mere documentation of the world he lived in, Man Ray was more interested in making his photography something more. Berenice Abbott was one of May Ray's darkroom assistants and she may have introduced Ray to Atget or vice-versa since Man Ray was his neighbor?I don't want to end this short review without also mentioning the collections of Street Fairs and the many portraits of \\"Salesmen and Traders on the Streets of Paris.\\" Both chapters contain many memorable images including one of my favorites entitled 'Model-Boat hirer.\\" That picture brings back many happy memories of my own childhood in St. Louis where I used to sail one of my grandfather's antique model boats on the lake behind the St. Louis Art Museum.Little about Atget's personal life is known, but this volume does include an excellent year-by-year illustrated biography of what is known about his background. This is one of the more important collections of photographic history that has been published by Taschen Publishing. The book contains separate translations of the text in English, French and German.

I always enjoy broadening my horizons by reading well-written essays."},{"Title":"Character Studies: Encounters with the Curiously Obsessed","review":"These nine 'character studies' are about people (quirky, unusual) Mark Singer has sought out, interviewing them for his articles in the 'New Yorker' magazine, and spending time with them to learn their idiosyncrasies \\"just for the fun of it.\\" They're not people he'd choose to have as friends, but fodder for a national magazine to poke fun at their 'out-of-the-ordinary' fixations. Some might be classified as 'oddballs,' but he describes them as \\"curiously obsessed.\\" Obsession is a compulsive, often unreasonable idea or emotion; a preoccupation with a fixed idea. His conviction is that 'character is destiny' but the 'character' in these stories come through as if they were a character in a play.Sara's the mom who used a nanny to program her children's lives while she had an important job as an architect. Even before the first child was born, house rules were made for the chores being divided fifty-fifty. Dad would be a 'New Man,' and Mom a 'Fulfilled Woman.\\" I know such a couple; even though 'Mom' didn't become an actual 'real' Mom for ten years, my son even had to cook some evenings, always shared the household work and held a full-time, stressful job. After their one child was born, she was too overwhelmed to do any grocery shopping or laundry, and he still had to do all that plus his usual share of the rest. He always went to bed exhausted, frustrated, and unhappy, driven to the point of near collapse. Sera lived with her husband, Tom, in the same house Tom grew up in and their four children attended the same public schools he had. This was in the same town where Mr. Singer lived in 1996 in New Jersey, when this article appeared in 'New Yorker.' Tom's a publishing executive.The nanny's job was to keep an hour-by-hour timeline, follow instructions and fill in the blanks. Sera ran the house like a business; \\"the nanny followed a printed menu of activities that Sera had prescribed to stimulate visual, motor and auditory progress. The regimen would change as the children grew older, when she would devise more elaborate charts and daily-activity requirements.\\" She was quite the dictator.He even parodies a co-worker, Joe Mitchell, who died in 1996, writing a strange memorial remembrance of a man who'd been a reporter more than two decades before Singer was born. He'd been on the staff since 1938, almost sixty years, at the 'New Yorker' where he could write in a style no one previously had; he had a 'graveyard fixation' with a \\"virtuoso of graveyard humor.\\" Comparing him to James Joyce, he chose lost souls, impostors and freaks to write about, among other strange New Yorkers.Mr. Singer tried to be a detached observer as he describes the living conditions, the way they're dressed, and their odd fixations; his judgment of these people as 'obsessed' is obvious. He tries to appear impartial, but the way he portrayed the highly-educated Richard Seiverling, the quintessential cowboy wannabe, was condescending. Just because the elderly educator (M.A. and doctorate in education at Penn State) who had started as a hobby, the National Tom Mix Festival as a \\"labor of love,\\" Singer described the \\"Cowboy Corner\\" thusly. It was packed full of Tom Mix memorbilia, \\"a telephone-booth-size niche complete with many photographs of the star of western movies. Whoever heard of an \\"L-shaped\\" phone booth, as he had earlier called this 'mini' museum there in Hershey, Pennsylvania, near the family home in DuBois. Singer, originally from northeast Oklahoma, where the main Tom Mix museum was located at Dewey, starts out: \\"My plan was to tour the second floor of Dr. Seiverling's house, where he had installed a private museum -- a collection of artifacts documenting his life and its intertwining with the life of Tom Mix.\\"The first ten National Tom Mix Festivals had been under the chairmanship of the esteemed Dr. Seiverling in Hershey, but the eleventh (1991) would take place in Las Vegas where the \\"Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino had added to its collection of antique automobiles the 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton Coupe that Mix was driving at the time of his fatal accident. The car had been carefully restored after the accident...and regarded as an important fixture of the collection right up there with Hitler's Mercedes and the Alfa Romeo that Mussolini gave his mistress.\\"Best known for the B-Western, 'Riders of the Purple Sage,\\" Mix also starred in 'Destry Rides Again' and 'The Rider of Death Valley.' Mark Singer attended the four-day festival for his 'New Yorker' article and parlayed the big man as a braggard. In Knoxville, our cowboy wannabe hosts a Saturday matinee showing the old westerns on the local public television station, called 'Riders of the Silver Screen' and somehow always mentions 'Riders of the Purple Sage' as an examplary motion picture of that genre. Marshall Andy is an Eddy Arnold \\"aficionado.\\"In his tribute to Martin Scorsese, \\"the man who forgets nothing,\\" Singer digresses quite a bit to appear knowledgable about the repetorie of his mainly unconventional films. Some Scorsese fans consider him \\"America's greatest living film director.\\" He feels he was put on earth to bring Mel Gibson's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" to the screen, with his \\"evangelical earnestness. \\"Across many months, I had many conversations with Scorsese\\" and was in awe of his ability to recall details from every movie he'd ever watched, \\"along with five-plus decades of personal history, sensory memory, family mythology, music heard, books read, all of it instantly retrievable. Instinctively, he'd engraved facts and images and feelings that he'd been able to draw upon throughout his creative life.\\"Mark Singer has out other books including SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA, CITIZEN K, MR. PERSONALITY and FUNNY MONEY."},{"Title":"Character Studies: Encounters with the Curiously Obsessed","review":"In this book, Singer dismisses evidence that Pancho Villa's head was stolen by the Skull & Bones Society in 1926. He fails to deal with the evidence provided byLet the Tail Go with the Hide: The Story of Ben F. Williams, that provides solid proof that in 1926 the Yale Skull & Bones Society acquired Pancho Villa's head for $25,000. Williams confirmed this fact from the mouth of the grave-robber himself. He also confirmed independently that $5,000 was directly paid by Frank Brophy, of the Brophy banking family, prominent in Arizona Republican financial life since the early part of the twentieth century.Ben Williams, the narrator of the book, recounts how one night he helped spring a soldier of fortune, Emil Holmdahl, from a Mexican jail by practicing some type of scholarly legerdemain upon the mind of a poor Mexican police chief. Holmdahl was being held on suspicion of having stolen Pancho Villa's head from the rest of his assassinated body. He denied it to Williams, who vouched for his character, got him a razor and a basin of hot water, and pulled him out of a Mexican jail by dint of his superior gringo intellect. There is abundant independent documentation that Holmdahl was an officer under General John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing, who prosecuted war against Villa, and that Holmdahl had even worked for Villa. A likelier grave-robber would be hard to find.Six weeks later, Williams ran into Holmdahl at the El Paso Club on the top floor of the Hussmann Hotel in El Paso, New Mexico. Holmdahl admitted that he had in fact stolen Villa's head for $25,000, and offered him half the take for getting him out of jail. Williams rejected the dirty money, and never saw Holmdahl again. Years later Williams was hobnobbing with Frank Brophy in his office and noticed his Skull & Bones credentials on the wall. When Williams remarked on the fact, Brophy told him that successive classes of Bonesmen rival each other to gain skull trophies. His class had secured its place in Bones history by getting that of Pancho Villa, the great revolutionist of Northern Mexico, who had thought to retire peacefully, but died in a hail of lead years after he thought he'd made peace. I found Williams' account entirely believable. Singer dismisses the account without a fair hearing. Singer is a lightweight. I'll go with Williams' account of the provenance and disposition of Pancho Villa's skull over Singer's."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"It had been heralded as a milestone by some, a work of tawdry cynicism by others. Regardless of how one feels about Jason Todd's death (pre-retcon), what are the merits of \\"A Death in the Family\\" as a story? To be frank, their aren't many; the case that eventually leads the Robin to his death begins with the Joker taking on a painfully out-of-character role as a (Farsi-speaking) international arms dealer. Sure, he has the same maniacal grin and disregard for human life, but while the Joker is traditionally handled as a madman causing mayhem just for the sake of it, here he acts far too much like a stereotypical money-hungry villain in possession of out-character-motivations and abilities. That the Joker's Farsi-speaking is unrealistic is not the problem (no Batman reader should complain of such a thing); the problem is that it disregards everything we know of the character. Had the (dubious) polling not resulted in Robin's death, this story would have been forgotten, except maybe as a gimmicky one-off experiment in reader participation.Saving this collection, though, is the second half story line, \\"A Lonely Place of Dying.\\" Not only introducing Tim Drake as a worthy successor, not to Todd, but to Dick Grayson, \\"A Lonely Place\\" also serves to justify Robin's existence: He keeps Batman balanced, helps him remember his own youth, and makes him a better strategic crime-fighter (perhaps because of Batman more careful when more than just his life is at stake, but this is left up to the reader to decide). Furthermore, the link between Batman and Two-Face, old friends before the villain's mental and psychological scarring, is explored through a sublime bit of parallelism in which both characters are shown considering their rival's own strategic gifts and how they can counteract them. For all of these reasons, \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\" is a splendid piece of Batman storytelling, making this collection worth buying despite the shortcomings of \\"A Death in the Family.\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I loved this graphic novel .

Still, both stories are excellent, and either of them alone would make this collection worthwhile.\\"A Death in the Family\\" takes place before LPOD, and as you probably know, deals with the demise of Jason Todd, the second Robin. I won't go into plot summary too much, but I do have some non-spoiling thoughts on this story. First of all, the artwork is okay. Not great, not terrible, and certainly outdated. It's not even the drawings that are the problem, but how they're colored. The colors were much mor elimited in the '80s, and that's why people who should be colored with black hair, actually have blue hair in this story.Next, even though I was eager to see Todd be killed, something odd happened: I actually found myself caring for him and wishing against his death. The creative team was able to get me attached to the character, even though I had no particular fondness for him before reading this. Somehow I found myself dreading his death.They made it very emotional and sad--two good things.The story was not, however, perfect. I felt that Batmna recapped things too often. Something would happen, then Batman would recap, then something else would happen, and then you'd get the whole story told to you again. It felt a bit unnecessary, seeing as I don't forget things every three seconds.Another thing I didn't like was how often Batman reiterated that the reason he had not killed the Joker in the past was because the Joker is insane, and therefore, not responsible for his actions. 1) Batman doens't care if you're insane or not. If you're a criminal, he treats you how he sees fit. 2) That's not the only reason Batman hasn't killed him! How about Batman's No Kill Rule? It doesn't matter whether or not the Joker's insane, because Batman would never kill him anyway.*SPOILER*However, there comes a part where Batman pretty much leave sthe Joker to die. WRONG!! He would NEVER do that!*Spoiler End*Overall, I felt the ending was a little incomplete. Batman pretty much sums it up perfectly when he says, \\"Unresolved.\\" There should have been a few more pages, either showing Batman's grief, following the Joker's story, having Batman talk with Superman . . . Anything! Any sort of epilogue would have been better than none.I know I spent most of the review criticizing DITF, but I did enjoy it a lot. The story was really good and I liked how both the page number for each issue was given, as well as the page number for the overall story. DITF is probably about 7.5/10 and LPOD is over 9/10. For my full review (5-star October 2012 review) of LPOD, check here:Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Wow.... This blew my mind. It was just something I didn't see coming! Obviously you can tell what happens by the title and the cover but the way it happens just is sad but heroic in a way. This story starts out with Robin having some emotional difficulty dealing with the death of his parents. He decides to take a walk to blow off some steam after Batman decides to take him out of action after he attacked a group of thugs without taking caution. While on his walk Robin runs into a lady who bought some of his family's items when they were being sold. Robin looks trough them and finds his birth certificate. Robin (or Jason) realizes that his mom Catherine Todd (Now known as his STEP MOTHER!!!! (gasp) ) wasn't his real mom but actually it was someone who's name starts with an S! I don't want to spoil it all so I'll stop there. Just in case you are wondering the villain in this book is the Joker. I highly recommend this to Batman fans or event people who have grown up with batman and robin but are not big \\"fans\\" but want to read the series. Worth every penny! Btw for you DC fans check out the DC app on itunes where it has just about every comic they have made on there. ( Batman has ones going back to the 1940s!) the app is free and so are some of the comics but most are a dollar a comic and the big volumes are about 3 to four dollars. Check it out! It's on iTunes!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"SPOILERSJoker busts out of Arkham Asylum (the place is useless, really) and heads to the Middle East to sell a cruise missile he's had in storage, and Batman follows to stop him. Meanwhile Jason Todd aka Robin is working through some emotional issues and finds out that the woman he thought was his mother wasn't his biological mother so he sets off to track down his real mum.I know this book is always on peoples' lists of \\"must-read\\" Batman stories but, besides Jason's death, there really isn't anything particularly good about this story. There are too many coincidences - Jason's search for his mother takes him to Israel, Lebanon, and Ethiopia, to find each of the three women who could potentially be his mum; these places also happen to be where the Joker goes to sell his missile/make money, and of course Batman and Robin cross paths in each instance!Then there's the Joker. First off I hate how he's drawn in the \`80s, his face is ridiculously long like an Easter Island sculpture. Second, I hate how his entire motivation in this book is money. I realise the Joker of the 21st century is far cooler, just think of that scene in \\"The Dark Knight\\" when Heath Ledger's Joker burns an enormous pile of money, but did Jim Starlin have to make his Joker so pathetically hung up on cash? In one scene when Joker's money is destroyed he slinks away in the shadows whining \\"My lovely money... whatever will I do now...?\\" - so pathetic.And then there are the strange nuances with Batman and Robin. In the middle of a desert Batman and Robin take down Arab guards and don their gear, but they manage to pick the guards that suit their superhero outfits so Batman gets a blue robes and Robin red robes. Then Batman says something about covering a large amount of terrain using something that will make them \\"invisible\\" - hang-gliders! He reasons that anyone looking at them will think they're birds. Yeah, birds have jets don't they? Robin's outfit too is really stupid. Those bare legs and little green scaly shorts look so daft it's a wonder they got away with it for so long.When Jason dies, Batman gives a summary of his life and gives a lame reason for wanting to have a child as a sidekick fighting criminals at night - \\"I guess I was just lonely\\". But he vows to \\"never again\\" allow a minor to help him fight villains as evil as Joker and Two-Face. Right, except right after this he meets Tim Drake and trains him to become the new Robin. Sigh... I don't know why Starlin tried to reason Robin into existence, just accept that it's weird but it is what it is. He's a colourful moving target to draw gunfire away from the guy dressed in black (or blue in this book). Move on.I'll give credit to Starlin for making the death scene very stark and brutal, though the events afterwards that keep Batman from attacking Joker completely negate any of the impact because you're wondering how on earth such nonsense made it into print. The Joker becomes ambassador for Iran, that bugbear of Cold War 1980s America. Yes, ambassador. What absolute rubbish.This is such a bad \`80s comic book full of poor dialogue and plotting and that cheesy comic book style of drawing that instantly dates it, that it's amazing it's held in the high regard it is. It's reputation must be held up by aging fanboys who look back on this era with nostalgia and ignore the fact that the Batman books of this time (barring a few exceptions) were mostly terrible and can't hope to stand up to the generally high quality of the Batman books being written today. I suppose every Batman fan must read this if only for the mythology aspect of it, but it's not even the end of Jason Todd. He comes back in Judd Winick's \\"Under the Hood\\", so that the book's sombre and dark cover underlines the silliness of superhero comics in general - characters come back all the time, there are never any real endings.Anybody looking for a fun Batman read will not find it here, nor is it a deserved classic; \\"A Death in the Family\\" is just a book that happens to have an event in it that some consider to be important but really isn't. Definitely missable, this is ultimately a disappointing read."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I gave this a 4 out of 5. Not because I don't understand how great and a must read this comic is, but that I also see the datedness of the story. It was a big deal back in the day. People were asked to vote for Robin to live or die, and this isn't the original Robin. This was the Robin after Dick grew up and became Nightwing, but before Tim Drake. This was when Jason Todd was Robin. He was both loved and hated by Batman fans. I didn't care for him in some ways, but that is because I felt Tim Drake was a better Robin and earned the right to be Robin in the story arch that follows this one called A Lonely Place of Dying.This is a big event in Batman's life. It is a story of his failure, even if it was out of his control. This was going to haunt Batman for the rest of his career. It would be like loosing a son to him and failing his parents all over. It is a good story, and a must read for any fan. However, towards the end it gets a bit dated and unnecessary. Without giving away much of the plot there is an appearance of a former Iranian leader allying himself with The Joker and many mentions of Reganomics. I felt gave the comic a bit of datedness and a sour taste. It felt a little political at the end and took away from the main story and ended up being a bit corny. It just left me with a sour taste, although over all its a great story.Overall its a great story and well worth the price. If you like this story I'd suggest getting A Lonely Place of Dying afterwards, its a great read and definitely moves the Batman story arc forward."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The story puts Batman thru emotional hell. I read it with red hood: the missing years, and under the hood Parts 1&2. Together they turn Jason Todd from an angry kid to a man determined to prove he is better than batman."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The story was well written, with Bruce &amp; Tim going all over the world to find Tim's mother. The Joker also knows Robin's mother, and he kills Robin and his mother. Very good, but kind of sad."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"In a nutshell, it's interesting to see how Robin dies, but this novel is an obvious sign of the times when middle east tensions with the US were high and Batman still said stupid things like the old campy 60's show."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Quite possibly the worst thing I have ever read. The plotting was sloppier than a mid-season sitcom, too much suspension of disbelief in all details that sell a story (the friend of the Todds, the names of possible people in the book, the fact that all 3 were alive and \\"interesting\\" people (why one of them couldn't be a coffeeshop waitress or something, esp if they came from Crime Alley). Perhaps the worst of the book was the cartoony artwork (one step above an Archie comic) and the avoidance of any depth of exploration of charcter. This was a wonderful opportunity to explore Batman's history of loss, his sense of individual responsibility balanced with protection of those he is close to, whether he can acheive attachments and whether he is an obsesssive zealot wrapped in the violent violet cloak of vengence or a man trying to work through his own past and issues of loss. Instead, Death in the Family was a crude, poor constructed, poorly coordinated piece of opportunistic garbage from the post-Reagan era. The 800 number says it all. If I were Denny O'Neill I would sanitize my name from this project and make no mention of this book, as though it were a bad joke or an off-color comment made when you thought no one was listening. Pure drivel. Only for the most obsessive collector (like myself)."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"So many other great Batman stories were written around this time -- Alan Moore's Killing Joke, Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum. This is not one of them."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I still remember this was big news when it first came out and I still remembered the title it was called A Death in the Family. As a long time mostly cloested comic fan- out of fear of being labeled a geek, etc, I thought it was in poor taste not only to kill Robin who had been so much a part of the Batman mythos over the years as much as Batman himself, but to make The Joker from here on look like the biggest legitimate psychopath to ever grace the pages of any comic. I still remember the Batman TV show, the movies, the cartoon, and The Joker was a wise cracking villain, who- though he may give the impression he wants to kill batman, was not some super big psychopath. Anyhow, another similar story followed this years later- The Knightfall saga, telling the story of how Batman finally meets his match in a new super villain named Bane, who doesn't kill Batman, but breaks his back. The Death in the Family and Knightfall saga are some of the only interesting aspects to an otherwise mediocre Batman mythos in pop culture and urban legends. If DC comics was looking to draw in more readers and make a little extra money by killing some its most famous characters, here's one guy who got suckered out of some money. It is too gimmicky of a marketing approach, too much a silly and geeky guilty pleasure that you can't help but be aware of Batman in pop culture that it was too tempting to resist. Comics are my guilty pleasure I guess."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Apart from quite a poor plot and weak story which, as most of the other readers commented, has the sole purpose of getting rid of Jason, the writers obviously have never been to Lebanon. Maybe they would like to know that Batman has a lot of fans there and all this story did was alienate them because of its prejudice and racism! Can't you stick to fictitous places and keep politics out of it guys?"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"You've got to love DC. Every few years they decide to make national headlines by killing off a major character and boost sales. Now of course, DC NEVER wanted people to know that the Robin that was killed was NOT the original Dick Grayson character but rather the second Robin Jason Todd (who?) and what's more they left his fate up to a vote by fans via a 900 number. That shows you hoe popular Jason Todd was.DC got what they wanted. I was working part-time in a comic store and I remember vividly the all-out frenzy there was over the original issues. We limited one per customer and I never saw so many parents in the store to buy that ONE issue as moms and dads took separate places in line to get this \\"collectible\\".The Story was written by Jim Starlin who is an excellent writer but seems so much better with the more cosmic storylines people know him so well for rather than a gritty Batman story. Jim Aparo's art, while capable really is old style 1970's all the way. Aparo was an excellent artist in the 1970's but simply could not compete with guys like McFarlane and others in the 80's.Jason gets mixed up with the Joker who is granted citizenship by Iraq! later gets beaten by the Joker with a crowbar and then blown up. Well of course it would be not long before Batman would take Tim Drake as the third Robin and Jason would become a mere footnote. Bet DC never alerted the press to that little tidbit of information."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This book is an awful excuse for comic book writing. In it we find the second Robin, Jason Todd, in a search for his biological mother. He goes off to other countries to search for three possibilities. And both Batman and the Joker end up there for different reasons.After going through the first two women, Robin and Batman find his real mother. Then Batman goes off for a little while and Joker shows up and kills Robin and his mother.The lowest point in this is when Joker becomes the ambassedor of Iran. Which means Batman can't touch him. Superman tries to keep him in line.Truly bad, though it gets a star for the emotion showed by Batman, this should be skipped by comic fans."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"First, I want to state no graphic novel is going to get five stars from me. As much as I enjoy Batman, to give any of them five stars would be a stretch. After all, how many are on par with Twain, Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, ect.So, with that said, I have to state this is even poor for a graphic novel. The plot line is weak. The story itself is weak. If not for the killing of a key member in the Batman family, this would be unreadable.In other words, read it for the time line within the Batman realm, but do not think that you are getting a great story."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"It's been a while since the publication of this comic. A dreaded re-read only confirmed my very poor opinion of this comic. It can't be the worst comic ever (it has Jim Aparo as illustrator) So work it out by subtractive deduction."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"And the best Batman story ever is only like 4 stars anyway, and that's only on a good day. So this story, being the worst Batman story ever, doesn't stand a chance. Robin was voted dead by Batman readers, and they pinned it on the Joker. If Batman ever finds out he's going to beat his readers down. You have been warned.Also Jim Starlin is the 14th worst mainstream comicbook writer of all time. (My super-computer did the calculations.) He's right below Steve Englhart and right above that Mraz guy who used to write Green Lantern. I wish my super-computer wasn't such a geek!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"It has been said that there are three milestones in the modern age of Batman:1.The death of Thomas and Martha Wayne.2.The alliance of Batman with the newly christened Robin, Dick Grayson.3.The death of Robin II, Jason Todd.Chip Kidd mentions in his book \\"Batman Collected\\" that the name Todd echoes in the German word \\"Tod\\" which means death. It is no irony that Jason Todd represents loss and tragedy in the DC universe and he is remembered as a boy who fought in a man's war against crime.While many of the tragedies of Bat-lore are based on villains' origins, the impact of this story is heavily weighed upon a not-so-righteous Robin. Fan never bonded much with Jason, a hotheaded youth who grew up fending for himself on the streets of Gotham. His nature vs. nurture instinct left him with little sympathy for criminals. (He once pushed a rapist off a roof to his death.) This is not to say that all streetwise parentless children are juvenile delinquents but in the case of Jason Todd, Batman was unable to successfully channel his inner rage into the more positive goal of Robin.\\"Death in the Family\\" unfolds as Jason goes off to Ethiopia in search of his long-lost mother. Bruce follows him and the two are caught up in a deadly battle of terrorists, betrayal, and the Joker. Despite Bruce's warnings, Jason's desire for truth blinds him from practical self-defense and he is lured into a trap before being beaten half to death by the Joker. Batman rushes to save him but it's too late and the Boy Wonder is finally annihilated in an exploding warehouse. The scene of a defeated Batman clutching Jason's bloodied body covered in tattered red and green rags is one of the most powerful iconic moments in all of DC's stories.The Joker's influence in Iran is a bit far fetched and has annoyed fans for its almost ridiculous stereotypes, but it only serves to channel the story along. After Batman returns to Gotham and buries Jason's body he discovers that his archenemy is rising up in the ranks of foreign alliance. Superman has to intervene to prevent Batman from bringing the wrong vengeance down for Jason's death.What made \\"Death in the Family\\" so powerful and a controversial best seller?Answer: The fans.DC allowed readers to call in by phone for two days to vote on Jason's outcome of the story: live or die. By a narrow margin in the ratings of fellow fans around the country, he was given thumbs down. I have heard in the world of the media, \\"There is no such thing as bad publicity\\". Hate mail did rain down on DC comics for doing this but the scenario just a small taste of how much of an influence the readers truly have on the outcome of a story.The story telling is adequate but what makes \\"Death in the Family\\" so influential is its titanic tragedy. Robin has been a part of the Bat-mythos since 1940 and his relationship with Batman has always not only been that of a mentor and a student, but as a father and a son.This book IS controversial but I believe DC knew they were taking a risk from the start. Those that read this story should be getting more out of it than a thrill or being disappointed if they don't like it. \\"Death in the Family\\" is a powerful reminder of the larger plan that works in the graphic novel market of a modern age audience. This story is one of the darkest of all dark stories, which says much for a serious hero like Batman whose origins are rooted in the death of his parents. The death of a surrogate son remains a stirring memorial in the Bat Cave where Jason's uniform hangs in a crystal case. The inscription reads, \\"In memory of Jason Todd. A good soldier.\\"If the story leaves you feeling downtrodden and depressed, I recommend reading \\"A Hero Reborn\\" next as an uplifting tale of how the mantle of Robin found worthy hands in Tim Drake, the third Boy Wonder and the current one to date. For another brooding but even more bewildering and thrilling story, \\"Under the Hood\\" is a recent work of fiction by Jud Winick. It brings about a question that has haunted Batman for over 16 years now: \\"What if Jason was never meant to die?\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"All of the other reviews do a good job of telling you about the story, so I won't rehash that here. What they don't tell you is that this new edition of A Death in the Family also contains the rare out of print TPB A Lonely Place of Dying. That makes this a great value worth getting in that you have the death of one Robin, Jason Todd, and the introduction of the next, Tim Drake. Unfortunately for me, I didn't know about that when ordering these stories and now I have a TPB copy of a Lonely Place of Dying that I'll need to sell now... :("},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"To begin with, let's give massive kudos to DC Comics for having the guts to tell this story. It sent Batman down a path even more guilt-ridden than his previous one and eventually led to the creation of a real balancing force in Tim Drake, the current (and best) Robin. Although the gimmick of allowing readers to call in and vote for letting Jason Todd live or killing him off seems sort of callow, it did gain this story serious attention, attention that it deserved. However (and perhaps this is the DVD fan in me) I feel sort of a pang of guilt that we've never seen the alternate ending for this story, the one where Jason survived. DC had both endings ready to go to the printer, just waiting for the response to come in... is there any reason we couldn't have included that alternate chapter in this collection? Heck, even if they stuck an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; label on that chapter, it would be fine with me. Something to consider, DC, the next time this book goes to print."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The book renders the tale in which the second Robin, Jason Todd, meets his end at the hands of a notorious villain. Understanding some of the current Batman storylines requires knowledge of this event.The death in the family that the title describes molds the Batman character into what he is today; extremely reluctant to work with partners and overprotective of the two family members he still has.Strangely, this event reminds me of why Batman is truly a hero. Only he must pay the price for his one-man war on crime; casualties are unacceptable. He is willing to sacrifice himself completely to the task of cleaning up and protecting Gotham, he is not arrogant or cruel enough to manipulate others to do his bidding, however. This is his burden, and no one elses'. I think it is more of necessity than choice that he does work with anyone else.This book also reminds me of one of the things that most angered me about DC in this era; I wish they had just retired the second Robin because of his recklessness. In fact, that is what Bruce considers before Todd's life is cut short. So perhaps that complaint is overblown, but this will always remain Bruce Wayne's and Batman's, darkest day. Keep that in mind when you decide whether or not to get this."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Well, there certainly isn't anything blantantly WRONG with this story. In fact, the end of it is fairly spectacular. Its the set up that bothers me.While I find it interesting that Robin wants to find his mother, I don't see why 90% of the story needs to be about Iranian terrorists and not Robin. While we should be getting a last look into Robin's soul, we instead see a bunch of guys with cloths over their heads shooting at him. Joker's elaborate &quot;scheme&quot; seems pointless and stupid, even for the Joker. Worst of all his plan is waaay too convenient for the purposes of the story.But as I said, the ending was well done. By the end of the story I knew what fate I would have chosen for Robin (kill the twerp!) but it was still sad to see him go. So if you, like me, truly need to see the death of Robin, then go ahead and pick this up. For what you pay for it, it is definently worth it."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"A few years back I read the trade \\"A Death in the Family\\" and I remember being mildly dissapointed. Even when it is a definitive point in time where Batman world change I found it kind of silly in some parts.i heard before of \\"A Lonely place of Diying\\" too but I was reluctant to buy it. Old fashion comics wasn't good for me so I decided to let it go.UNTIL... I found this new edition named \\"A Death in the Family (DC Comics Classic Library)\\" that contain both stories, I JUST GOT TO HAVE IT!.I love it from begining to end, from the dustjacket to the beautiful red hardcover on the book. The inside was improved too. The paper is thick, and (seems to me) is kind of recolored, or the ink make perfect match with the paper because I just can't remember \\"Death...\\" was so colorful.Anyway, even when the first story is silly at parts, is compensate by the second story that tells Tim Drake's origin. There is an introduction and epiloge, and as a final dish is the alternate end for \\"Death in the Family\\" were Jason Todd actually lives. well, to be fair that's not actually that big of a deal. It is only one panel that change. Still...My only complaint is the price. Although is a pretty cool package, is kind of expensive for me. Still I don't regret it."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"A DEATH IN THE FAMILY is a decent story that follows the events that lead to the death of the 2nd Robin, Jason Tood; his death; and the immediate aftershocks. The story isn't too bad, but does contain a few plot holes which are overlooked by the very strong ending. For the most part the art is average, though there are a few scenes that stick in one's mind long after the book has been put down.The comic became one of the most famous Batman comics of all time for three reasons. One, readers decided the fate of story. Two, a major character was killed off; something that was quite rare in the DC universe up to that point. Finally, the death of Jason Todd effects Batman even to the present day; he has become haunted by his death almost as much as he has been haunted by the death of his parents.As a side note, this comic first appeared in the middle 1980's when tensions between the U.S. and Lebanon were still quite hostile (they still had some American hostages) and that tension forms the background of the comic."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"First, my quibbles: This is very much a post-Iran/Contra scandal novel, complete with a guest appearane of everyone's favourite arab fundamentalist leader, and stereotyped arabic revolutionaries galore. Carboard cut outs of characters lifted from the collective consciousness of the western world rarely make for affective drama. Another quibble: The story doesn't really take off until part four, when Jason finds his mother. Before then, the tale is episodic and poorly plotted, with little foreshadowing as to the upcoming danger. The inclusion of Lady Shiva seems a bit pointless. Pros: Jason's sudden and unexpected death is both sudden and brutally affective. Jason does not even recieve the expected &quot;dying words of friendship scene&quot; expected by most western readers. He is just dead. The Joker, too, and Batman's obsession with him is handled superbly...the moment when Joker stops and simply stares at the scowling Bruce Wayne is wonderfully suggestive...is the bond between these two so great that they can simply recognise one another...with or without the mask? Ultimately, it is an essential read purely for Jason's death, but is a descent and entertaining read in and of itself."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"So it's Wednesday and I hear someone calling at the door, I go to check it out and I realized it's the mailman with my first amazon order, it's kind of special because i'm from Chile and I have never done this before.So the first thing I do is to see if it was the right product. It was, then I started to carefully reading it and suddenly all the memories of reading this when I was a child on a lousy Spanish edition came back rushing to me. I simply love this story, and to have it on a edition this awesome and in English it's just plain great.For those of you who are still having doubts about buying it, you need to consider the following aspects:1) It has a red hardcover protected by a nice printed cover that's shown on the picture of this Item.2) It has the whole story, you can smell the 90's on this edition.3) And i'm from Chile, so if I got it here, you can get it anywhere.It's a must if you know anything about Batman, besides if you already have a \\"Killing Joke Hardcover Edition\\", like myself, having this new hardcover story realizing what important event happened to Batman after that, this is just your ITEM.Thx. Amazon."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"DC Comics used a cheap promotional tool - a fan poll - as a means to \\"determine\\" what should be done with the second Robin, Jason Todd.Turning a story line into a typical means for a radio station to give listeners \\"ownership\\" in shows yielded Todd paying the ultimate price for his brashness and bold steps into vigilantism, no matter the end results for Batman. The geopolitical angle with the Joker is silly, but the way the iconic villain meticulously sets a trap for Robin is brilliant, as it plays on the worst aspects of an ego that cannot be dismissed as youthful exuberance to do the right thing.The feelings of Bruce Wayne/Batman truly slice into the soul of someone who understands the slippery slope of allowing raw emotions to determine actions while in the line of duty. But was everything done by the Dark Knight to prevent the steps to death?Though this volume is not be a complete picture to the hype - that won't happen until the company releases the alternative finish for the vote - it is a compelling story that gave the (slim majority of) voters what they wanted....in a compelling story."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Reading it now makes me realize I probably never actually read it. I was reading Batman back in the day; I boughtBatman: The Killing Jokewhen it originally came out, for instance. But I might have shifted to Marvel Mutants by then. Or I might have disliked the hype, with the 900 number and all. Who knows? I just kind of figured I had read it at some point.Anyway, I thought it was a pretty solid story. It's a bit contrived, of course, but I like Bruce's dilemna about how to deal with Jason to keep him safe, etc. Joker is very calm and calculating, and the idea that he's desperate to raise some cash after being incarcerated is believable. I like that the government sends Clark to go warn Bruce away from attacking Joker at the UN. After they argue, Clark says, \\"I always feel like he knows more than I do.\\" I was surprised to realize that this story takes place not long after Killing Joke, as they refer to Babs' shooting on a number of occasions. That's quite a brutal period for the Joker."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This is the most emotionally resonant Batman book I have ever read. I really felt Batman's pain as he dealt with another close death in his life. The Death in the Family story also contains other cool things like Joker joining the Iranians and trying to kill the U.N. with his laughing gas....Superman makes an appearance in the book too. I can't really say anything bad about this story except there are a few parts where it is just a MAJOR coincidence that Batman finds Robin in Beruit. Really? And then the Joker just happens to be in Ethiopia and is dealing with the person that Batman and Robin have come to Ethiopia to find. Okay, I admit that these coincidences are almost ridiculous...but I didn't let these minor problems with the story take away from one of the most well written Batman stories I have ever read. On top of Death in Family being so good, this hardcover version also comes with \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\". I have not read the story yet, but my understanding is that it is the introduction of the new Robin, Tim Drake....it's just icing on the cake at this point...Highly Recommeded!!!!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This is a classic arc and essential in understanding Batman's mind state during the modern age of comics. The death of Jason Todd was the second big tragedy in the life of Batman and he has since considered it quite possibly his greatest failure. Todd was a troubled kid, he acted on pure emotion and he didn't listen. He was nothing like Dick Grayson and no where near as likeable as Tim Drake. Here we also see the Joker at his most evil and cruel. This story is great, dark, and emotional. Because it is reflected on and flash-backed often in many of the major Batman stories since, it is very important to be familiar with this. This is the story where the Joker hit Batman the hardest. On a personal note, this was the first Batman TPB that I ever purchased when I was a kid back in the very early 90s. 1989's Batman movie made me a Bat-fan, this book made me a Comic-Bat-fanatic."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"With the revival of Jason Todd in \\"Under the Hood\\" many have wondered if that cheapens the impact his death has. As Bats himself said, \\"This doesn't change anything\\"This hardcover collection contains both \\"Death in the Family\\" itself and the followup storyline \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\"The first story reminds me in some ways of \\"The Killing Joke\\" in the way it feels so clearly as a product of the the zeitgeist of the late 80's while simultaneously feeling fresh. It is realistic in a grim way, while strangely feeling like a logical installment in the same series that has been running all those years. It contains a lot of content concerning the ugliness of human life, and strangely putting Batman and the Joker in the middle of it only highlights the horror of it all, instead of rendering it absurd.The second story is an interesting one, feeling more comfortably in the DC Universe with the Teen Titans mulling about and Two Face on the Rampage. It introduces Tim Drake as an absolutely earnest, intelligent nice character, who the Batman comics were lucky to get.Overall these are not grand artistic stories, but they are good stories worth reading as a comics fan, if only to show that not all of the grittiness that followed in the wake of Watchmen and DKR was bad."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"It's hard to imagine anyone who reads comics who hasn't read Batman: A Death in the Family, but if you haven't, you should. It's not that this is the best Batman tale ever, in fact plot seems a little far-fetched even for Batman. But the emotions dripping from the pages are raw and real and the death scene is worth the price of admission. And it should be noted that the price of admission is only around $5. You can't pass that up."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Okay,when DC was planning this storyline they knew they were treading into new territory.It would be a controversial time in the comics industry where the companies wanted to get more mature with their readers.DC lead a campaign in whicn the fans would vote to either kill Robin(Jason Todd,Dick Grayson's predecessor)or to let him live at the end of the story.Long story short,the Joker ends up beating Jason within an inch of his life with a crowbar.Batman was elsewhere at this time.Jason discovered that his mother was alive but under the Joker's fearful leadership.They met briefly before they were locked in a shipping crate.Jason was laying on the floor bleeding to death when the Joker placed a bomb with a timer in the crate.The Joker preceded to beat Jason's mom up pretty bad too.Just before the bomb went off,Jason shielded her from the blast.Jason died in her arms.Batman found the two,then Jason's mom dies and the last image you see is Batman carrying Robin's lifeless body away from the scene.It was a very gritty story for it's time but it was necessary for DC to evolve into the '90's.A new or old Batman reader or fan should own this story.Not only is it gripping, but it's comic book history just like the Death Of Superman and Knightfall.Excellent DC Comics read!"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Here we are again lucky enough to have the fantastic talents of Jim Aparo drawing Batman. Yet another DC comics publicity stunt in part, though, as the latest incarnation of the Robin character was not too popular with readers. So, they decided to do a storyline where the Joker captures him, and the readers could vote on whether he died or not.Pretty clearly from the title, it is thumbs down for the Bird Boy."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"There are so many Batman comics out there nowadays that sometimes it's hard to pick out the good ones in the overflow that is offered. Let me be of a little help here and say that THIS one is one of those books you WANT to pick up. Why is it that nice ? Well, it's a story in which everybody (by now) knows what is gonna happen, still it takes you by surprise WHEN it actually happens and it is never boring or predictable. You don't see it coming. But &quot;the big event&quot; is certainly not the only reason why this story is good. It's also a very well written story where you get to know more about Jason Todd and what follows after Jason himself gets to know things he didn't know before. The storytelling through the art is great here and definately adds to the already good writing. Certainly one of the better Batman TPB's to pick up."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The Joker killed Robin...maybe not Robin I,who was too old to be a Boy Wonder-but Robin II,who was too headstrong to be a truly efeective Boy Wonder.

Even if you haven't read it, the cover says it all. Robin dies. Although he was not the first or last Robin, it still sent ripples through the Batman canon that are still creating waves today (i.e. Under the Hood, Countdown).I have to admit, this is the first story I ever read with Jason Todd as Robin. I knew a little bit about him but it's a little pathetic that before I even got to know the guy, he's gone. However, Starlin does take the time to fill in a little back story for those like me that may not have a clue as to who this Robin is or where he came from. It made me want to start backtracking and read a little bit more about him while he was alive so I could appreciate his departure more.The basic story is after Bruce grounds Jason from active duty as Robin, Jason comes across his birth certificate indicating that his mother who he thought to be dead was in fact not his real mother and that she may still be out there. After some detective work he narrows it down to three women and goes off in search of her. Meanwhile The Joker is up to no good selling a nuke to terrorists in the middle east and Batman is on his trail. By a huge coincidence Bruce and Jason run into each other and end up helping each other with their missions.Other than the unlikeliness of their journeys intersecting, the rest of the rest of the story plays out rather well with a few surprises as in addition to some good action and dialog. Starlin manages to make Jason's last moments meaningful and character defining. Jim Aparo's artwork is also pitch perfect and works really well in telling the story.Although the story is not quite as epic as I had expected, it must have been mind blowing when it was first printed. The fact that leading up to his death you never see it coming would have been the best reading experience. It seems like just a simple story of Jason trying to dig deeper into his past and Joker up to his old tricks and then they hit you with a ton of bricks out of nowhere. I'd say that is a pretty hard thing to pull off well and that is why this story sets the stage for the rest of Batman's career."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Batman: A Death in the Family is arguably the most controversial comic book storyline of all time - and everything about it is just great except for DC's reaction to the fan reaction to the death of Jason Todd (the second Robin). The revolutionary thing about the series is the fact that DC set up a hotline and allowed readers to decide Robin's fate after he was caught in an explosion in issue 428. A slight majority of the 10,000+ callers (in a window of only 36 hours) gave Jason Todd the thumbs down, and so it was that Batman once again became the lone Dark Knight (for a little while, at least). And the media hoopla commenced - which was, however much they still deny it, DC's plan all along.Jason Todd was always a problematic Robin, but he had been getting more and more reckless - so much so that Batman finally takes him off active duty. Then Todd finds out that the woman he called Mother was not really his mother, and he sets out on a quest to find his biological mother - he has three names, and it's just a matter of finding each woman on the list. The search takes him to Beirut. Meanwhile, the Joker has escaped yet again, and it looks like he's trying to sell a nuclear weapon to terrorists in the Middle East. Fate dictates that the lives of all three major players intersect at a vicious crossroads overseas. What is most shocking about this story arc is not the death of Robin - rather, it is the manner of his death. His newly discovered mother basically betrays him, the Joker beats him to a bloody pulp with a crowbar (and really enjoys doing it), and then he's trapped inside a warehouse when it blows up. Still, even after the betrayal, he tries to save his mother's life - it makes for a truly fitting, superheroic end for the second Robin. The story doesn't stop there, though. Even as Batman is grieving Jason's death and questioning all of his actions and decisions regarding the boy, the Joker gets himself a job as the UN ambassador for Iran. That gives him diplomatic immunity, meaning Batman, no matter how much he wants to finally put an end to the Joker, can't touch him. The State Department sends Superman in to break the news to Batman, and for a while it looks like Bats and Sup are going to go at it. Batman knows that nothing good will come of the Joker's upcoming address to the General Assembly - and he's right. Still, the storyline closes on a note of ambiguity, which is almost how it had to be. The whole traumatic experience puts the dark back in the Dark Knight and has definite repercussions for the future development of Batman.Here's my take on this Robin-ocide thing. DC created in Jason Todd a problematic character whom, to make matters worse, they did not develop in a very good fashion. A lot of Batman fans truly disliked this brash, young kid who whined all the time and was clearly never ready to fill Robin's shoes. How can we undo the wrong and get rid of Jason Todd?, they must have asked. We all know the plan they developed - let the fans decide whether he lives or dies. How relieved they must have been that the vote narrowly went their way and sealed Todd's fate. This had the double bonus of letting them blame the fans for Robin's death - and they did so, at every opportunity. What really sticks in my craw, though, is their reported astonishment at the media circus this decision created. I mean, come on, this whole scheme was designed as a publicity coup - and a pretty brilliant one, as it turned out. Here we are almost 18 years later, and we're still talking about and debating A Death in the Family. (Of course, DC recently made the extremely stupid decision of actually resurrecting Jason Todd - as a villain - in Batman: Under the Hood, despite editor Denny O'Neil's quote on the back of the A Death in the Family TPB saying what a \\"really sleazy stunt\\" it would be to ever bring him back.)"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I found this book to be one of Jim Starlin'sand Jim Aparo's best efforts.

Killing off Robin (Due to a reader's poll so the readers killed him, not the writers) was both risky and created a fascinating edge to Batman. The Joker, in usual maniacal form here, weaves his sinister plots as Jason tries to find his long-lost mother. With real emotion, sharp action and an incredible finale, this is possibly the best in the Batman comic series. The artwork is deep, dark and complementive. Really impressive and inviting, and the theme contains a real sense of yearning for acceptance and a need for self-completion. A must have addition to any Batman fan's collection."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family (the Batman TPB) resonates more in the history of the character of Batman than it does as a stand alone graphic novel. Jason Todd's Robin was a small blip and is most interesting and important for this series of four issues which chronicle his very bloody death. It certainly is not the best writing by Jim Starlin but the appearance by Superman later helps and the idea of the Joker becoming the ambassador of Iran is so ridiculous it almost works. Jim Aparo puts in adequate drawings, down a notch from his best work in the early Brave and Bold, and still seeming a little downtown Neal Adamish. These issues still have power in their killing of Robin, years later still a shocking scene."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Any bat-fan needs this book in his/her collection. The death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, set a buzz with batfans back in the '80s. The fans voted and decided Robin's fate.

Get ready for a new Robin."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is a great, gritty Batman story. This story is from a time when comics were about the story telling and not gimmicks. Jason Todd's death was groundbreaking and if you read this you will see why. I did not grow up with the J.T. Robin but became a fan of Batman and bunch in the mid 90's, so Tim Drake era. With that said, I didn't have much of an appreciation for Jason Todd as I never read about him. This tale actually made me care about the kid. When you see Joker commit the heinous act on Jason that led to his death, it was gripping. I miss the fact that super hero comics no longer bear their teeth in stories like this did. The artwork was also good for me, it was clean and simple but brought depth to the story telling, something you don't see in recent years.This edition with the inclusion of the origin of Tim Drake is a nice addition, but I could have lived without it. It's just not as gripping as the death of Jason Todd."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I have been a Batman fan since kid, almost 30yrs.

Story line is great and shocking. Loved the old school drawings, it brought back memories. Recommend to buy this book."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This is a decent story which is mainly well known for the out come rather than a great story. This is something I would recommend to fans of Batman to read for the sake of the importance to the Batman story line, but I probably wouldn't recommend to many others. In fact even if you're a Batman fan and you don't have a lot of money to through around there a lot of other Batman stories I'd point to before this one. Now I don't want to say that this is that bad of a story I was entertained and never thought about not finishing reading it.I think the biggest problem for me was the fact that most of the time it didn't feel like the Batman universe. It just seems odd having Batman run around in the Middle East. Now having been a fan of comics for a number of years now, I have come to know that often I will be asked to suspend my disbelief. But a few times it took it a little too far form me in this one. For example it seems a little too coincidental that Batman follows the Joker to the same city in the Middle East that Jason Todd ran off to looking for his mom. Two other examples are Batman bringing gliders and a mini helicopter with him to the Middle East/Africa. And the Joker being recruited as Iran's ambassador by Ayatollah Khomeini. I don't know it could just be me but I thought that was a bit much.There were a few good things about it to though. While I wouldn't say the art work was amazing or anything, I thought it was pretty good and reminded me of the artwork in some of the older Batman comics (I mean that in a good way). I also liked the fact that the story addressed that when the Joker got out of Arkham he was without most of his assets and need to make some money to get started up again. In short I recommend this for the historical aspects rather than a great story."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Main redeeming factor was the death of Jason Todd. But, the Joker as ambassador of Iran, yeah right. I just found many aspects of the story to be unrealistic in terms of most batman stories that I have read.

It's a true classic, I highly recommend to those who love Batman at his best."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This book is a fair read at best. The whole thing was probably more exciting at the time it came out and people were able to vote to decide whether or not Robin died. However, upon reading it now, the whole story is rather medicore. The plot has gigantic holes in it even for an 80's superhero comic. Batman and Robin travel around the world and everything and everyone they are looking for falls into their lap repeatedly. The art in the story is average, but certain scenes are very poorly done. The only thing that saves this book from being banished from my mind altogther is the fact that despite the shortcomings, it is a pretty entertaining read and it has a strong finish."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This book is one of the most unfortunate comics still in print. The premise -- comics readers being asked to give thumbs-up or thumbs-down to a difficult, unpopular, but still important character -- was awful, and put blood on the hands of a lot of readers. The plot is rather ludicrous, full of coincidences and lots of Jason Todd jetting from place to place to little purpose. The force of Jason Todd's death -- which had so much resonance in, for instance, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" -- has since been rather muted by the new, wonderful Robin guided by Chuck Dixon. (You wonder if Jason Todd could have matured into this Robin, given the chance.) Still, the Joker is used well in the story, Superman is effective, and there are several striking and memorable scenes. This is an important story in the ongoing saga of the Bat, but I suggest that it stands as a monument to a tragic and irreversible editorial decision rather than as a triumphant Batman story along the lines of \\"Dark Knight\\" or \\"The Killing Joke.\\""},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This story is a bit dated having originally being published in the 1980s, but still a good read overall. I would recommend this to any serious Batman fan."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Before I even knew who Jason Todd was, I knew there was a Robin who died. I didn't start reading comics much up until recently, but I have always Loved watching the cartoons (Batman the animated series, Batman Beyond,justice league, and even a bunch of marvel cartoons including spiderman and the x-men) because my dad used to collect comic book movies.Sometime a year or two ago my husband and I were bored and headed to a local redbox to find some entertainment for the night. Under the Red Hood just happened to be in stock and as soon as we read the description the rabid geeks in us were like \\"OMG we have to see this tonight!!\\" Finally I was gonna learn a little something about Bat History! We were just blown away! If anything inspired My husband and I to start trying to read comics besides The Dark Knight movies, it was Under the Red Hood the animated film alone. We own the bluray now and have watched all the documentaries on that disk more than once. We decided to get A death in the Family as we started collecting and I just finished reading it. I was not disappointed in any way, shape, or form! And I still almost cried when Jason died (even though I knew it was going to happen anyways.) It took a tremendous amount of willpower to maintain my composure. The animation is also very good because You see sooooo much pain on Batman's face as he holds the young man hopelessly in his arms.It is now one of my top 3 and I have a feeling it will always be there. I did not find Jason to be the nasty smart @$$ brute people claimed he was. Was he reckless, yes. Ruthless, a little. Human, Absolutely. More so than anybody in the bat family ever has been. If ever he was a jerk in the comics, as soon as you open up the pages you start to see him grow as a character and quickly at that. Which makes losing him at the end of the story all the more painfully profound and moving. You also see more of Batman's humanity too. You see how deeply he loves and cares even though he would never tell a soul. Most importantly, it reminds you that Batman is not infallible! It's a painful eye opener about what it costs to be \\"The Batman.\\" It also raises the untimely question, What Price is too high for \\"Justice?\\" This book is a MUST if you have any interest in the graphic novels featuring Batman and it is as relevant today as it was 24 years ago. That is some strong staying power for a graphic novel that is almost a quarter of a century old.Lastly, what makes this edition extra awesome is that you get two 5 star stories for the price of one. A Lonely place of Dying (the follow up) is included in this book as well and that story is equally wonderful and powerful. You see how much of a difference one random act of kindness from many years ago can make. The impact has the potential to be HUGE! You see exactly how much one moment can change your life. Whether it's for the better or the worse, it's completely up to you. And as a Fan Favorite, Tim Drake is a completely accessible, sympathetic, and rich character full of depth. He has incredible courage inspired by the compassion and enthusiasm only a child could have. This child is also a wise and very bright one, so it's fascinating getting a peek into how his young mind works."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I purchase this product off of ebay for a similar price. I enjoy the volume, but I will admit that this volume is only for a select audience that knows a lot about Batman and Jason Todd. With that said here are the reasons to buy this book. If these reasons do not apply to you then do not buy it. If they do then you will enjoy it very much1. It is a major story development in Batman history. This is the first Robin that died while in Batman's care. The Robins are like Batman's son and to witness his death and knowing it was his fault is scarring. This event can be more scarring then watching your parents get murder and then dressing up likes a bat to fight criminals at night... So get this volume for posterity.2. If you readBatman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1,Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 2,Batman: Battle for the Cowl, Batman and Robin, or anything with Jason Todd in it.

To witness the death of Robin.[...]"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"While this story's fate was determined by Bat-fans, it is still a great book, featuring wondrous art by Jim Aparo, and the adventuresome writing by Jim Starlin. A shocking story which made the Batman into a different man, severing his ties with the concept of Robin, as well as his pseudo-friendship with Superman."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Anyone who has followed the Batman comics over the years knows what kind of impact the death of the Jason Todd-era Robin had on the Batman mythos, but the outcome makes more impact than the overall story. A Death in the Family is a solid tale of the Dark Knight seeking justice for the death of Jason at the hands of the Joker, but just about everything about this story comes off as lame. Jim Starlin's writing is cliche, and the Joker becoming the ambassador of Iran? Please. Now I know this is a comic book, and I'm as much a comic geek as the next guy, but that is plain old ridiculous. What saves A Death in the Family worthwhile (somewhat) is the emotional impact of the outcome, and the solid art by Jim Aparo is a nice touch, but if it weren't for the impact this would leave on the Batman mythos, this wouldn't be worth picking up at all. What would have been a nice bonus though, would be if DC would include the alternate outcome of the story (fans could call in and vote whether or not Robin would live or die) which I'm sure they have laying around somewhere, which would be a nice extra to fans who remember when this storyarc hit."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The original edition of Death in the Family only included that 1988 story, but this new edition also includes the 1989 follow-up, A Lonely Place of Dying, and that is a plus. However, this is one of the worst Batman stories. Denny O'Neill's final Batman story involves the second Robin, Jason Todd, embarking on a quest to discover the true identity of his mother, because she can only be (get this) an Israeli secret agent, a deadly assasin, or a crusading doctor, all of whom have names that begin with S and happened to be listed in his father's phone book. The plot betrays its 1980s origins with stop-offs in famine-plagued Ethiopia and civil war-torn Lebanon before the Joker brutually kills Jason Todd (SPOILER ALERT for a 25-year old story that made headlines in its day). Fans were given the opportunity to call a 1-900 number to decide Robin's fate (the original ad is included in this collection). The plot then sinks further into ridiculousness, with the Joker allying with the Ayatollah and becoming the Iranian ambassador to the UN. Then Superman shows up to tell Batman that he can't kill the Joker because it would create an international incident. . . A Death in the Family attempts to answer one of genre fiction's most perplexing questions: Why wouldn't a hero like Batman kill a truly evil monster like the Joker? Its answer is as typical a copout as a time travel story that ends with \\"We can't change the terrible events of the past because it would destroy the future!\\" Nevertheless, this story of the death of Robin is an important stop in the history of Batman.The followup story, A Lonely Place of Dying, is better-written. It introduces the third Robin, Tim Drake. The focus of the plot in this story is on Two-Face, and while A Lonely Place of Dying is nearly ruined by an endless parallel narration by Two-Face and Batman, just to show that they're, you know, two sides of the same coin, it does finally establish exactly why Robin is a necessary element in Batman stories. A Death in the Family is far from the greatest Batman story, and while it certainly isn't the worst, it's definitely pretty high on that list."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"The book is about the death of Jason Todd the second Robin. The story is in 4 chapters. Plus, there is A Lonely Place of Dying a 5 part after story about Batman and the New Titans. Great story overall"},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"For Batman, the death of his parents was the biggest tragedy of his life. They were both taken away from him by two bullets. Bullets shot by a random mugger. Bullets that would scar Bruce Wayne for the rest of his life.Bullets that would lead him into becoming the Batman.He was motivated by the loss of his parents to rid Gotham City of the criminal element that took his parents lives. He would carry that promise for the rest of his life. But he would not do it alone....for he had Robin, The Boy Wonder.And the decision to recruit him into his dangerous mission would ultimately lead to tragedy....THE DEATH OF THE SECOND ROBIN, JASON TODD.Yes, I did say \\"second\\" Robin, because more than one person has worn the mantle of Robin. The first person to become Robin was Dick Grayson, who was the most well known Robin, as he wore the costume from the late 30's, all the way to the mid 70's. But Dick soon outgrew the role, and set off alone as the adult crime fighter Nightwing. Batman would continue to fight solo, until he met Jason Todd, a troubled orphan who literally tried to steal the tires off the batmobile. Batman felt sorry for the young boy and decided to take him in as the second Robin. But Jason Todd never set well with readers of the day. He was reckless, brutal, and was fueled by his anger. While I myself never had a problem with this (I actually thought it was an interesting depiction of Robin), the readers continued to complain about Jason, and the editorial board at DC decided they had to do something about it. But since the couldn't figure out what to do, they decided to let the readers choose Robin's fate!The story itself shows that Batman is starting to realize that Jason's recklessness is becoming a serious problem. In order to keep his anger under control (and to not let himself get killed), Batman forces Jason to go off active duty. When Jason hears about this, he angrily leaves the Wayne Manor, and walks towards his old apartment in Crime Alley. When he gets there, he finds a startling discovery. He finds his birth certificate, where his mother, Catherine Todd's signature isn't there. Instead, there is a blacked out name starting with the letter \\"S\\" in its place. Realizing that Catherine Todd was not his mother, he travels across the world to search for his real mother. His search leads him to the Middle East, where the Joker is busy selling nuclear weapons to Arab terrorists. I bet your wondering why he would be doing trade with terrorists. Well it's because the police started seizing his funds after he recently crippled Barbra Gordon in THE KILLING JOKE, and he's trying to recover his lost money. Plus he's also insane! When the Joker finds Jason, he takes advantage of the opportunity, and beats the boy wonder near to death before leaving him to die in an explosion.This where the readers were able to decide Robin's fate. DC Comics gave the fans two phone numbers. One would allow Jason to survive the explosion, and the other would send him into his grave. In the end, the death phone number won by a slim margin, and Jason was found dead in the rumble by Batman. A scene that will have you moving with tears.The story about Robin's death may be controversial, but it's an amazing story that plays a key role in the life of the dark knight! Jason's death shows us the risks that Batman is taking by allowing a young boy to fight crime along side him, and transforms Batman into more of a loner as he limits his partnerships with his other allies in the future. But more importantly, this story makes Batman's obsession with the Joker even more personal. During the 1980's, the Joker was becoming a darker and more murderous foe as his crimes became more heinous. A powerful example of this was in Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE (a personal favorite of mine), as he cripples Barbra Gordon in an attempt to drive her father insane. He ended her career as Batgirl with a single bullet, and has know gone over the edge once again by murdering the boy wonder. These two crimes would cause Batman to no longer hold back on the Joker, and in some cases, would even be tempted to break his one rule with the Joker. In short, these factors make Jason Todd's death the second greatest tragedy in Batman's life.It's a tale that will truly move you away, and prepare you for how Batman will decide his actions in the future. Controversial or not, I will always treasure this as a truly sensational story of the dark knight!May Jason Todd rest in peace..."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This best selling 1980s graphic novel let the readers decide if the second Robin, Jason Todd, would live or die after an explosion. In this late 80s graphic novel there's an actual copy of the advertisement and the 900 number to call to decide upon the fate of the Boy Wonder. The fans decided they didn't like Jason Todd much and voted to kill him and no that isn't a spoiler based on the title and cover. Apparently the vote was close. Over 10,000 votes were cast, with the final vote being 5,343 votes for Jason to die over 5,271 for him to live (Wiki). There is a copy of the cover which shows Jason Todd surviving (in case the fans voted for him to live).The story in of itself ranges from very good to questionable. I don't want to give spoilers but some felt the Joker to Africa connection was too coincidental and others didn't like the Joker and Iran connection though back in those days I think there was a lot of hostility towards possible Middle Eastern terrorists and look what happened during 9-11 so maybe it's not so farfetched or maybe it still is? Additionally, the graphic novel covered issues that concerned the country/world at the time: the IRA, Reaganomics, the Lebanese War, nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, Iran, rogue states, the famine in Ethiopia, Iran-Contra affair and much more.After the death of Robin II you get to see the Batman going down the wrong road even though his friends try to guide him back to the light (he even punches Superman surprisingly). It isn't really until Tim Drake (the future Robin III obviously) takes action on his own and brings Dick Grayson, the first Robin who is now Nightwing, to his senses that Batman begins to recover. For those not in the know Robin serves as a reminder of who Batman/Bruce Wayne used to be before his parents were horribly murdered before his eyes.The artwork is traditionally classic with a distinctive almost bright blue coloring to Batman (which makes it really hard to believe he can surprise people in the desert by sneaking around) which I haven't seen in a while. Also, emoting obvious emotions is more prevalent than in later comics.IGN comics ranked this as #15 on the top 25 Batman graphic novels.At the time this was presented the killing of superhero characters was a new thing. These days they die and then come back with the old bait and switch or when writers want to look for some reason to bring them back. Denny O'Neil, editor of the Bat-comics at the time of Todd's death, stated on the back cover of A Death in the Family trade paperback: \\"It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.\\" However, O'Neil would later regret his decision. Uh huh.This is a must read for Batman fans simply for its history. Get it.ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; BATMAN MYTHOLOGY/FRESHNESS: A minus (for its time); STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; WHEN READ: June to July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Batman: A Death in the Family is an amazing story describing Jason Todd's final days as Robin.

Being myself adopted, I connected straight off with Todd's search for his mother, not knowing who she is. This, of course, only amplified the effect of the titular death. I also enjoyed much of Joker's plans in this story. The Iranian delegate struck kind of close to home- remember the guy who said \\"no preconditions\\"?- but it never got too political, even in dealing with that. A great, emotional Batman story with a great twisted Joker plot."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"**SPOILERS** Read in the cold light of day, nearly two decades after publication, I found this famous Batman comic to be gripping and emotionally involving, but also quite offensive for its racism and right-wing ideology.Robin, an orphaned emotional wreck, is told to take a break by Batman, who realises his father figure approach has gone wrong. Robin's anger turns to excitement when he realises his true mother may still be alive. Through his ensuing search, and some illegal weapons deals between the Joker and Arab terrorists, Batman, Robin, and the Joker somehow follow each other to the same far-flung spots on the globe, before the tragic outcome voted for by fans.I certainly didn't dislike Robin in this comic - he was petulant, but obviously hurting, and the writers gave him a dramatic and emotionally weighty send-off. But the plot that leads to it is a series of coincidences that requires too much suspension of disbelief; how the three main characters can end up involved with the same people in the same places so many times doesn't really hold weight.Far-fetched plots are one thing; but the politics of the story I found difficult to stomach - the portrayal of Arabs is stereotypical and offensive; neither do I particularly appreciate seeing Batman beat a woman senseless and then drug her against her will - for this reason, and for the sake of giving the plot a bit more credibility, the second of the three candidates for the role of Jason's mother should have been omitted; Woosan's involvement in the story added very little.The Joker, as always, is a repulsive pervert - his face is well-sketched as a portrait of pure insanity. His use of politics to protect himself from persecution could have been an effective idea, but again the racist backdrop to it spoiled the whole thing; given the forthcoming Batman vs Osama, one has to ask: do the PNAC sponsor Batman or something?All in all, this comic series was certainly worth the money - I just wish the creators had indulged in a bit less political immaturity."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I can't believe Jim Frickin Starlin wrote this storyline.DC realized they'd made a mistake by making this new Robin such a badass. He was totally unlikable. So they made a decision whether by killing him outright, or giving him a mortal wound they would write him out. We get a hackneyed \\"looking for my birth mother\\" script with just too many ridiculous coincidences. (One candidate just happens to be a Batman villan, another just happens to be dealing with the Joker). What crap. Then on top of that, the Iranians, (this was pre-Gulf War remember) make the Joker a citizen and a delegate. Even in the comic-book world its impossible to surrender belief this much. Starlin probably needs to stick to the outer-space cosmic sagas.But there are good points: the characterization of Batman comes through shining bright. He's visibly shaken now. For the first time, he contemplates murder. He blames himself. We also see more of the contentious relationship between himself and Superman.But one thing about this book -- it changed the Bat universe for all time; the Joker is now in a class by himself among Bat-foes;(it got personal, you might say) Jason Todd's memory continues even until this day, and of course it led to the introduction of the new, extremely popular Robin Tim Drake. (Who would have ever thunk that the sidekick could sustain a 100+ solo title run?)Of course, all that stuff comes in several successive books, not here. My recommendation: buy used if you can."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"I found this to be a very good story with plenty of suspense.The part about the Joker stealing a cruise missile and trying to sell it to terrorists made me think about what mighthappen if someone really did get their hands on such a weapon. It was also interesting to see Jason Todd searchingfor his mother. I couldn't wait to see who it was. It wasso sad when she turned on him and handed him over to theJoker. It was almost fitting when she died. It was reallytragic when Batman finally found Robin and knew before hechecked for a pulse that Robin was dead."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"Forget about the setup, this is an important story in the Batman mythos, the death of Robin II. Written with two possible endings in mind, the story affects continuity for years to come in the comic book."},{"Title":"Batman: A Death in the Family","review":"This is without a question the best Batman story I have ever read. Jim Aparo and Jim Starlin and Mike DeCarlo are the team for Batman. I would seriously reccomend buying some of the issues this great team did together.

The book consists of a succession of bite-sized articles, containing pearls of encapsulated wisdom. Two of the most lustrous of these, in my opinion, included 1) an amazingly lucid and simple derivation of the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics, and 2) an explanation of the origin of the proton's mass. There are actually very few equations contained within this book, but it is by no means as \\"watered-down\\" as many popularized books on science. On the contrary, Dr. Wilczek gives you a glimpse of the current thinking in the field, where the concepts are not elementary (even if the fundamental particles are!). Like Richard Feynman before him, Frank Wilczek not only leads you by the hand to a better grasp of ideas such as broken symmetry, but also takes you to the leading edge of theoretical physics development and shares how a Nobel prize-winning scientist thinks about problems. Even facts that one has heard many times before take on a fresh meaning, such as when he describes how the indistinguishability of electrons results from the fact that they are excitations of the same pervasive, universe-filling quantum field. Throughout, Wilczek vividly conveys his appreciation for the grandeur and beauty of our universe. He also sprinkles witticisms and anecdotes (including an interesting one relating a discussion with Feynman) throughout the book, which lightens the reading and makes it entertaining as well as instructive. After digesting the contents of this remarkable book, the reader will have a much better idea of what it means to imagine that \\"the world is a multilayered, multicolored, cosmic superconductor.\\" In short, this is an impressive collection of essays, and reading Fantastic Realities will help you cultivate a deeper understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level."},{"Title":"Fantastic Realities: 49 Mind Journeys And a Trip to Stockholm","review":"This is a wonderfully thought provoking book.Frank Wilczek is that rarest of breeds, a lucid physicist. Working in Feynman's tradition, i.e. raising the communication of physics into the literary canon. (Yes, this reviewer believes the Lectures on Physics should be included in the literary canon.)Collecting a series of articles published in Physics Today's Reference Frame, Nature and other journals, Wilczek has tackled topics such as: The nature of force, The origin of mass, Einsteins Equations, Diracs Equation, Quantum Theory, QED and QCD; Subjects at the core of physics and cosmology, and, to which he has been a seminal contributor. It ends with a delightful description of winning the Physics Prize and the Nobel Awards ceremony, in the voice of Betsy Devine, of Funny Ha Ha or Funny Peculiar?These discussions, crafted in a clear manner, are reminiscent of the elegance of the physics itself, an elegance often unrecognized by those who don't appreciate mathematical subtlety or it's inherent beauty. In this, it helps to have a guide who has a deep understanding of the subject, and takes such obvious pleasure communicating it.Another thing I love about this book? Like Feynman, Wilczek challenges the creative, artists, writers and others, to intellectually grapple with the beauty of physics, either as expressed in the gaseous giant planets or, in this case, the proton and it's extraordinary symmetries. Then? To use this understanding in their own work.As a poet, I am particularily delighted with the poems included in this volume. Since Lucretius, using poetry to elucidate physics has been severely lacking. We need more of this.As an avid reader of these pieces, I have wished they were collected in one place. Now they have. Because of this? Wilczek will significantly influence the understanding of physics among the educated lay in this post modern age, and on, into the future.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fantastic Realities: 49 Mind Journeys And a Trip to Stockholm","review":"Frank Wilczek's new book is a great read by one of the best in the business for anyone interested in physics and should be accessible to people with a wide variety of backgrounds. The book consists of a collection of 43 short pieces, most of which have been published elsewhere (often as \\"Reference Frame\\" columns in Physics Today), broken into 11 sections, each with a short introduction. The writing is exceptionally well-informed, elegant, lucid, and thought-provoking.There's also a section of 6 original poems, which I'll not comment on since I'm not a literary critic, as well as a final section of extracts from Wilczek's wife Betsy Devine's blog Funny Ha-Ha or Funny Peculiar?. The blog entries explain exactly what it's like to be a family member of a Nobel prize winner, and contain lots of useful tips for you and your fellow family members should you ever win a Nobel prize and need to know exactly how to prepare for your trip to Stockholm. I hope I won't be damaging sales of the book by noting that they're available on-line.Wilczek started out his career with a bang, discovering the asymptotic freedom of Yang-Mills theory in joint work with his advisor David Gross. He was thinking of this work in terms of perhaps showing that the SU(2) part of the new electro-weak gauge theory of Weinberg and Salam might not have the same problem that QED had (effective coupling growing at short distances, invalidating perturbation theory), but Gross was thinking more about the strong interactions and the short-distance scaling behavior recently observed at SLAC. If it could be shown that Yang-Mills theories also had effective couplings that grew at short distances like all other known QFTs, that would rule out QFT as a theory of the strong interactions. The discovery of asymptotic freedom made it clear that Yang-Mills theories might provide a successful strong interaction theory, and there was one obvious choice for the right theory: QCD.Many of Wilczek's pieces deal with QCD in one way or another, from explaining his original work with Gross, to more recent developments concerning high temperature (relevant to heavy-ion collider experiments) and high density versions of the theory. He also explains some of the beautiful data that has accumulated over the past more than thirty years since its discovery that give us impressive evidence for the validity of QCD. Wilczek puts QCD into a more general context, explaining how logarithmic running of coupling constants can explain the small size of the strong interaction scale when compared to the scale of a putative GUT or even the Planck scale. Besides QCD, he provides excellent discussions of the rest of the standard model, the electroweak theory.In several different pieces about beyond the standard model physics, Wilczek emphasizes two pieces of evidence that we have for some sort of GUT scenario. One is the fact that if you take the 16 dimensional half-spinor representation of SO(10), under the SU(5) subgroup it decomposes as 1 + 5 + 10, giving all the standard model fields of one generation (including a right-handed neutrino), but in a single irreducible representation. The second is the calculation (that he did in 1981 with Dimopoulos and Raby) of the running coupling constants for the supersymmetric SU(5) GUT, which show much closer unification of the three couplings at a single energy than in the non-supersymmetric case.These two facts are definitely the strongest evidence around for the idea of a supersymmetric GUT, an idea which has dominated thinking about beyond the standard model physics for nearly 30 years, but they are far from convincing. Wilczek deals with the other main idea that has dominated the field, string theory, by essentially ignoring it. I only noticed one or two mentions of string theory in passing in the book. He's not taking a position pro or con on the subject, just deciding that other things are more worth writing about.The longer pieces in the book are among the best, including a piece on the Dirac equation, written for a book on the most beautiful equations, and pieces on fractional charge quantization and quantum field theory in general, which are a bit more technical than the others. Wilczek brings in interesting historical context to most of the things he writes about, often in an original way.Perhaps my favorite piece is one entitled \\"What is Quantum Theory?\\", which deals with one of my obsessions. Wilczek claims that perhaps we still don't properly understand the significance of quantum theory, especially what it has to do with symmetries. He notes that Hermann Weyl, soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics, realized that the Heisenberg commutation relations are the relations of a Lie algebra (called the Heisenberg Lie algebra), and this exponentiates to a symmetry group (the Heisenberg group to mathematicians, Weyl group to physicists). Wilczek goes on to speculate that:The next level in understanding may come when an overarching symmetry is found, melding the conventional symmetries and Weyl's symmetry of quantum kinematics (made more specific, and possibly modified) into an organic whole."},{"Title":"Fantastic Realities: 49 Mind Journeys And a Trip to Stockholm","review":"Frank Wilczek's book opens your mind to new frontiers. I was particularly shocked to learn that the components of protons and neutrons, the building blocks of all atom nuclei, where the mass of atoms is concentrated, have very small rest mass so that practically all proton mass comes from Einstein's formula E/c2=m. In a sense we are all ethereal criatures. The other shocking idea regarding the Higgs particle, hopefully soon to be discovered at CERN, is that the Universe acts as a superconductor.However, the book is a collection of articles written, if not for experts, for scientifically sophisticated readers and laymen will find it hard to read."},{"Title":"Fantastic Realities: 49 Mind Journeys And a Trip to Stockholm","review":"I saw the book in a book fair: \\"Fantastic realities\\" and \\"mind journeys\\" sounded like fun and interesting adventures at the same time... I skimmed through the pages and the title of one chapter scared me off: \\"QED Exposed!\\" What on earth is QED? If I don't even understand the titles, what can I expect...?To my surprise, the book was autographed by the author . \\"mmhh...It will most probably be the only book that I have autographed by a Nobel Prize winner, and if I do not understand a word of it, I can still enjoy the trip to Stockholm by Betsy Devine...\\" I readFearful Symmetry: The Search for Beauty in Modern Physics (Princeton Science Library)first (excellent book by the way), it seems that \\"fearful\\" was less frightening than the QED thing.The mind journeys are independent essays on different topics in quantum physics and the standard model (everything quite understandable except for two chapters that according to the author were meant for scientists or students in this field; these chapters were a one-way trip, definitely not for anyone with weak notions of the Greek alphabet). Since the articles compiled in this book were originally written for different audiences and occasions, sometimes information is repeated in different essays.I gained new insight on the unification of the known forces at high energy states, but also on the shortcomings of all known theories until now. The section on Planck's constant is excellent. I also found it interesting how new particles and their masses can be predicted and how we are hoping for new results from the large accelerators since the deep philosophical question now seems to be: to Higgs or not to Higgs or does nature abhor vaccum after all? I still find the terminology for all the flavoured and coloured particles difficult and confusing.I loved the article written as a tribute to Dirac, here Mr. Wilczec shows that he not only masters \\"asymptotic freedom\\", but that he is also an extremely skilled writer. While reading this chapter, I felt as if a mystery was being unveiled. I admired the beauty in Dirac's equations, how he solved the problem of the results of the equations showing both positive and negative charges for the same particle and how he simply stated that the negative results must be \\"antimatter\\". What a journey! By the way, years later I found out that I was not the only one liking this article, it was chosen by Mr Farmelo as one of the most beautiful essays of modern science compiled in his bookIt Must Be Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science, which is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bunker's War: The World War II Diary of Col.

I knew that most immigrants had a hard time when they arrived in America, but I had no idea they were treated just as badly as the blacks. This book gave me a new perspective on what the Irish went through, as well as the soldiers' sufferings in the Civil War.

As Keenan and his friend went off to fight the Civil War, they thought things would change for the better. Instead they found out the cruel, harsh realities of war. Disentary, disease, starvation, frostbite, limbs blown off, and ears or eyes destroyed from battle. Both men in the story spent time in POW camps, if you could call them that, under horrible conditions. Death seemed imminent in these camps.

I saw how Keenan and his fellow Irishmen tried to get work or start a new life, but were greeted by competition for jobs at the factory, and signs in store windows that would not allow Irishmen inside. As Keenan and his friend went off to fight the Civil War, they thought things would change for the better. Instead they found out the cruel, harsh realities of war. Disentary, disease, starvation, frostbite, limbs blown off, and ears or eyes destroyed from battle. Both men in the story spent time in POW camps, if you could call them that, under horrible conditions. Death seemed imminent in these camps. When the war miraculously ended, Keenan finally returned to his wife and hometown expecting a hero's welcome. I won't ruin everything by telling you the ending, but it is a worthwhile read. A perfect read for St Patrick's Day.The Debt Has Been Repaid, September 7, 2002Reviewer: Dottie Wiegand from Atco, New JerseyWithin the realm of formal education, the Civil War has essentially been presented as a timeline of dates, battles, notable victories,and crushing defeats for both armies.Mr.Sudell modifies all of that. Through the introduction of authentic characters and veterans of that era,he colors that same timeline with such depth and dimension that the reader lives with the characters and endures their fears and fervor, their agonies and jubilations. John Keenan, Mr. Sudell's great, great-uncle and a Civil War veteran, relates his battle and prisoner-of-war experiences, and, while horrified by the indignities suffered, we are reassured by the indestuctible will of the human spirit and the unwavering sense of patriotism.The title,Though All The World Betrays Thee, provides a clue as to the manner in which we did not repay the debt of gratitude owed.It remained outstanding until the arrival of Mr. Sudell's book. I believe that he has repaid that debt in full.

It is a wonderful quick read about a man (family) over coming adversities in life, yet continuing to hold on to and cherish what is important in life. Dr. Primrose never becomes jaded after all that is thrown at him. Just when you think he can take no more, more is piled onto him. In the end, of course, all is well. While I wouldn't call the book exciting itself, there are exciting elements...kidnappings, death, cheating, and more. I enjoyed it so much because Dr. Primrose is truly a stand up guy and one we can all learn lessons from."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I have, in a way, two completely separate reviews for this novel, with two completely different rankings. As a serious novel it gets one star; as a comic novel it gets four. I have gone with the four-star ranking because I have very little doubt of which it is.If this book was in fact written as a serious panegyric upon the glories and virtues of the simple, holy life, and the blessings that come to those who persevere in the face of adversity, it is the most consummate tripe. The characters are caricatures, the emotions farcical, the plot lines banal. Primrose (the narrator) is a fool, and a particularly pretentious and self-righteous one. The women in the novel should make any self-respecting woman cringe. The tireless soliloquies on economics, politics and religion make you unwittingly begin to skim. I will take Wittgenstein's advice and just pass over the ending in silence. Think Danielle Steele in a more obscure vernacular, but worse. (Yes, that's right, worse.)Thankfully, it's not serious (or, at least, I am almost certain that it isn't). As a comic novel it comes off kind of like a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker movie about a Jane Austen novel. The beauty of it is, however, is that it's so deadpan, it's so subtle in its irony, that for the first eighty pages I really thought it was sincere - albeit terrible. I won't go into the plot details as most of you probably don't want someone to spoil the plot for you, and the rest can easily find it succinctly traced out by my fellow reviewers. I will say that it's a Book-of-Job-style parable, and one of the most complete and believable satires I've ever read.(I will add, just to give my review some perspective, that I love 18th century British literature, Fielding and Sterne in particular. In other words, my opinion has not been overtly colored by an ignorance of either the genre or the writing styles of the period. At least, I hope not.)"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar.

It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...&quot;hate&quot; is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's 1766 novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; offers the trials and tribulations of Primrose, an ecclesiastic living in the English countryside. Primrose is content in his life, with a faithful wife, and lovely, if somewhat distracted children. Hearing that his banker has gotten into trouble and fled the country, Primrose and his family begin a series of adventures which test the strength of Primrose's convictions.Among the issues which Goldsmith addresses in the novel are social ambition in a rigid class system, the drawbacks and benefits of a relatively liberal household, and the admittedly imperfect nature of the British legal system. Sprinkled throughout the novel are various discourses on the notion of liberty, the primacy of the monarchy, and a wealth of interesting references to British imperialism and colonial slavery.Regarding the class system, Primrose seems throughout the novel, to eschew the idea that social or economic mobility is possible, or even desirable. He posits, in a way that follows Aristotle and Edmund Burke, that people are fit for certain stations by their very nature; and that such social partitioning is right and should be maintained. Primrose also appears as a latter day Horace, championing the virtues of simple, rustic life. This pastoral life is directly associated in the novel with the laboring classes, who, not without faults themselves, manage to avoid the intrigues and excesses of the consistently vilified city folk.Goldsmith's writing style is fast-paced, with clear, direct language, wonderfully rendered characters, and a surprising number of plot twists for so short a work. Primrose and his eldest son George are the two finest characters in the novel. Both exhibit a picaresque tendency to wander and interact - Primrose with the intellectual/philosophical elements, and George with the material/experiential elements in the world. This is altogether a wonderful, spirited novel, and Stephen Coote's introduction to this Penguin edition is excellent in its explication of the novel's major themes and concerns."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"\\"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.\\" So ends chapter 13 in this delightful novel by Oliver Goldsmith, his only novel by the way.Oliver creates a pious character in the form of the vicar, Dr Primrose, that suffers from that most deadly of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. The problem is he doesn't know it. As a result he is brought down peg by peg, and made a thorough fool of in the process, in a way that is comical and warm to the reader. The vicar becomes a most beloved character by way of his suffering and in the end I'm sure will have earned from even the most hard hearted reader that most cherished gift a reader can bestow upon any flawed character, redemption.Oliver also creates villiany, more like evil incarnate, in the form of Mr. Thornhill. Thornhill is central to the most severe of the hardships suffered by the vicar and his family. A very meddlesome and self-centered character indeed!!Written in the 1750's, it has it all. Greed,envy,lust,unjust imprisonment, even prostitution. Yes, It's hard to believe a novel written in the 1750's could even touch on the subject, but nevertheless it is central to the plot.Combine all this with some of the finest wit in English literature and you've got a great way to spend a weekend. The book is less than 200 pages and moves along at nice pace from page one. Well worth everyone's time."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period. If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent. It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know. If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now. You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study. It remains an important book."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"I found this little book a delight from start to finish.This was a favourite little &quot;classic&quot; of the Victorian classroom.

In fine, a book to be read over &amp; over without a dimunition of pleasure at each reading."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Told with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor and wit, The Vicar of Wakefield, published in 1766, features the delightfully innocent Dr. Primrose, a cleric who believes that kindness and virtue will always be rewarded. Surrounded by his wife and six children, Dr. Primrose lives a comfortable life, but he becomes the victim of theft when his broker runs off with all his investments, leaving him penniless, just as his son George is about to be married. When George's marriage is canceled due to his lack of prospects, the family moves to the country, where Dr. Primrose becomes vicar of a rural church.One disaster follows another, involving Dr. Primrose and his family. The poor but kind Mr. Burchell, who saved daughter Sophia from drowning and befriended the family, later shocks Dr. Primrose by slandering the daughters and ruining their chances to become companions to two women in London. The sale of the family's only horses to a trickster leaves them virtually penniless. His older daughter Olivia is abducted and \\"ruined.\\" The house catches fire, and their landlord demands his rent, knowing that the family has nothing. No matter how outrageous the calamities (and those mentioned above are only a sample), Dr. Primrose insists on seeing the bright side, even when there is no bright side. Virtue and goodness, he is convinced, will always be rewarded.Owing as much to eighteenth century satiric comedy as to the developing novel, the story of Dr. Primrose and his family satirizes the sentimentality of early novels, such as Pamela, while it makes use of sentimental devices to further its plot. Poking gentle fun at Dr. Primrose for his innocence, Goldsmith never mocks or belittles him. Coincidence, mistaken identities, the humiliation of all the villains, innumerable surprises, and the restoration of Dr. Primrose's fortunes lead to the \\"deserved\\" happiness of Dr. Primrose and his family in the conclusion. Virtue is indeed rewarded, and evil is indeed punished. A gentle novel filled with charm, The Vicar of Wakefield feels like a \\"lady's novel,\\" one which lacks the bawdy excess of Fielding and the unique humor of Sterne, while never taking itself too seriously. n Mary WhippleShe Stoops to Conquer and Other Comedies (Oxford World's Classics)Oliver Goldsmith; a biography.

He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are. This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain. The theme of the book resembles somewhat the Book of Job from The Bible. Our hero is a good and innocent man who remains steadfast in faith and unbroken in courage as he faces numerous disasters. It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security. The family consists of a mother and father and six children.

It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Regarded by some as a sentimental novel, Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766) describes the fortunes and misfortunes of the first-person narrator, Dr. Primrose, along with his wife and six children. The narrative is chiefly concerned with a description of Primrose's increasing adversity and the final restoration and elevation of his condition, in a story-line reminiscent of the Biblical book of Job. First the Primrose family loses their fortune, their home is engulfed by a fire, and eventually Primrose himself finds himself in prison, one daughter reportedly dead, another abducted, and a son jailed. But all is in the end restored as the narrative returns to the idyllic life of the Primrose home and its inhabitants as described at the end of the first chapter: \\"In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.\\" The circle is completed with the closing words of the final chapter: \\"As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.\\" Although Primrose is a vicar, his congregational and pastoral charge rarely comes into the picture, and it is more the events in this family circle that are the focus of his story.In the face of more than abundant adversity, Primrose remains the eternal optimist, a sweet and nave vicar who portrays himself unaffected by the worldliness and faults he sees in the lives of those around him. Nowhere is his naivete more evident than when he falls prey to the same deceptive character he has previously chastized his son for falling victim to. Yet Primrose remains blind to his own flawed character with its intellectual and spiritual pride. For example, when his half-dead son makes his entrance in the closing stages, Primrose affirms his own freedom from vanity, although the statement in which he makes this bold assertion suggests the opposite: \\"He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.\\"While one must at times roll one's eyes at his excessive parade of virtue, the reader cannot help feel a strong measure of sympathy for his overly sweet character and good intentions. When his house burns down, rather than mourn the loss of his worldly possessions, he rejoices in the safety of his children: \\"'Now,' cried I, holding up my children, 'now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my, treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.'\\" When misfortune results in his incarceration, he sees prison as an opportunity to convert the ungodly: \\"I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.\\" Even his most malicious oppressors are reason for optimism: \\"... as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.\\" And upon discovering that Jenkinson's account about the death of his daughter is false, he chooses to be overjoyed at her return rather than angered by the deception: \\"'How could you,' cried I, turning to Mr Jenkinson, 'how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain.' \\"While Primrose's strength of spiritual character, moral fortitude and steadfastness in the face of crisis is exaggerated to the point of humor and wild improbability, it is nonetheless admirable in what it suggests about the human spirit. He sleeps untroubled while in prison and having suffered the most grave misfortune and being deprived of all that is dear to him: \\"After my usual meditations, and having praised my heavenly corrector, I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning.\\" And rather than grieve over his misfortune after his house has been engulfed with flames, he sees it as a positive benefit, for it humbles his wife's pride and makes her more receptive to the return of his daughter from prostitution: \\"I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one, and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.\\" And when too much laughter and merriness displeases Primrose in preparation for the solemn ceremony of marriage, he makes it the occasion for spiritual correction: \\"I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this Mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them.\\" And even some of the other characters share this virtuous approach, for rather than commiserate with Wilmot upon the loss of his fortune to deception, the senior squire remarks: \\"your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished.\\"Like Job, Primrose suffers at the hand of increasing disasters, but unlike his Biblical counterpart, he doesn't go to the ash-heap to mourn or struggle with his condition or grief. He remains constant in hope and optimism, sees in the greatest disasters opportunities for spiritual correction and growth, and always retains the prospect of improving his fortunes, if not in this life then in the hereafter. Despite his overly optimistic character, this nave and simple man who wants to serve God and his family presents a somewhat charming figure. We are curious what will be the outcome of his life, and our sense of expectation is heightened by the twists and turns of the plot, which for an 18th century work is reasonably fast paced and quite accessible for modern readers. While improbable, Primrose's journey from fortune to misfortune and back again might prove morally instructive not just to its protagonist, but to us all. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Goldsmith's only novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, is, as another reviewer pointed out, a modern (1766) version of the book of Job. In the book of Job, Satan attempts to make a fool of God and at the same time attack Job. Satan accomplishes this by arguing that the godliness of Job, who is God's beloved, is motivated by self-interest alone. God allows Satan to test Job in order that God and Job be vindicated.In Goldsmith's story, Dr. Primrose is a priest with a loving wife and 6 wonderful children. They have an elegant house, the respect of their neighbors and the means to help others less fortunate. We are barely introduced to Dr. Primrose and his family when they are beset by misfortune. Their wealth is stolen and they must give up their family home and move to a distant village. From this point on, a series of ever increasing calamities occur.Through it all we know that Dr. Primrose and family will persevere even if we can't anticipate all the twists and turns in the story. With that said, Dr. Primrose is not perfect. The introduction makes clear that he is possessed of intellectual pride. This measure of sin lends the story an air of authenticity that would be missing if Dr. Primrose was perfection personified. As a side note, the Penguin edition of this book does have a useful introduction which helps to frame the issues Goldsmith was trying to communicate as well as providing context for the times. The end notes are also of tremendous help.The ending may be unlikely but the message of faith and family love endures. Don't let the age of this classic novel prevent you from enjoying its wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The vicar of Wakefield","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield is one of those books you told yourself in college to read but never quite got around to it. It is Goldsmith's only novel and includes several of his poems. The book might be termed \\"The Book of Job as written by Jane Austen,\\" in that it tells of the toils and troubles that beset an English vicar and his family, while at the same time being concerned with the love affairs of young people. The family Wakefield consists of the vicar, his wife and six children, two older boys, two girls of marriageable age and two small boys. The family is forced by circumstances to leave their good, middle class life in Wakefield and move to a lesser, but still tolerable existence in the countryside. There they encounter a variety of characters, some good and some bad and some seemingly good, but bad and some seemingly bad, but good--it all gets sorted out in the end.Much of what happens in the book is improbable, but the idea is not to present a factual account as much as a story about morality. As time goes by we see the foibles of the vicar and his family, but at the same time we see their natural goodness as well. But their problems mount and the book descends into what seems like unrelieved misery. We keep waiting for the negatives to turn into positives--after all this is not Thomas Hardy--but they are slow in coming and then are crammed into an implausible ending. One advantage of the book is that it is relatively short (less than 200 pages), thus we are not forced to wade through 500 pages of drudgery to find an alls well that ends well ending.I rate it at four stars because it is an excellent example of classical English writing with a story line that gives some insights into the life and values of English people at a time when England was growing in influence and power in the world."},{"Title":"Representative Men (Seven Lectures)","review":"Love it....Love it!

The novel was published in 1936 still having the power to draw the reader in to the intricate tale of murder woven by the Dame of Death.Mr. Shaiitana is a rich Italian who meets Hercule Poirot at a London exhibition of snuff boxes! Shaitana's bridge party is unique since he has invited four persons who are thought to be murderers. They are:Dr. Roberts-A popular London doctor who has a history of adultery and the death of patients through the improper use of poisons.Mrs. Lorrimer-A wealthy bridge playing expert who murdered her husband several years prior to the events related in the novel.Major Despard- A handsome womanizing African big game hunter who has been accused of killing a Safari client because he was having an affair with the victim's wife.Anne Meredith-The youngest of the card party guests; she is a plain young woman who has been hired into domestic service. One of the elderly women she labored for in a small English village was murdered. Anne lives with a young woman named Rhoda Dawes (there is no hint that the girls are lesbians).Also invited to the card party are Hercule Poirot, Superintendent Battle, Colonel Race and Ariadne Oliver. Ariadne is a crime novelist who loves to munch apples. She bears a distinct resemblance to Agatha Christie.During the course of the card party night the hapless Mr. Shaitana is murdered by the use of a sharp bejewelled stileto knife in possession of the victim.

Also during this complicated case there is a suicide; a near fatal murder attempt by drowning and a fatal injection of the poison Evipan. Also utilized in a past murder are antrhax and typhoid bacteria into the bloodstream of the murdered person.

Since I have never played Bridge, the scorecards and descriptions in the book were confusing. That in itself is a pretty large handicap when trying to figure out this whodunit.

Leave it to Poirot to discover the true culprit by questioning each of them about their bridge-playing methods.This book does not follow the typical Christie method and has fewer characters than usual, making it more difficult to provide necessary clues while concealing the mystery of the person who committed the deed. As usual, it has fast-paced dialogue which moves the story along nicely and multiple twists at the end.Christie is #1."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Overall this book was very intriguing and one of my favorites because as Christie says, \\"This book is not that kind of book\\" where you spot the least likely person to have done the crime and find that they have done it. This is book is where all suspects are on the same playing field and they all could have done it. It is difficult to decide who it is because each person has a motive and each person is a murderer in their past. One must pay attention to the details of the character, their past, and the present murder. Christie does a very well done job of thoroughly confusing the reader by setting each suspect up in situations where they could have done it. Only those who truly understand the psychological mind will be able to deduce who really was the murderer. The only downfall to this book is for those who do not understand the game bridge. But even if you don't it's an excellent read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys putting their own \\"little grey cells\\" to work.To summarize, Hercule Poirot runs into a Mr. Shaitana, who claims that he knows people who are so good at murder no one but him knows about their secret. Four sleuths, including Poirot, and four murderers are invited to dine and play bridge at Shaitana's. As the night continues, their host ends up dead and no one knows who did it. It is up to the four sleuths to narrow down the suspects by finding out what their past murder was like. Once they know how they murder, they will be able to make a logical deduction of who performed this one.Poirot lets his \\"little grey cells\\" go to work by asking each murderer about the room they played bridge in and also about the game and the rubbers played. \\"With eyes of the mind\\", Poirot leans back to think and is able to one by one eliminate the suspects by putting together the past murder with the present character and brilliantly uncover the true murderer."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"I have read almost all of Agath Chrisite's books, and this one ranks high on my list. Rigt up there with And then there were none, Murder of Rodger Ackroyd and Murder on the Orient Express.

The host, Mr.Shaitana, invites four guests suspected to have each committed one murder. Mrs.Lorrimer, Mrs.Meredith and Dr.Roberts are at the party along with an array of four brilliant detectives, Colonel Race, Mrs.Oliver, Superintendent Battle, and the ever persnickety Hercule Poirot. Not one of them really knows their host.After hours of playing bridge, a body is found... the body of Mr.Shaitana, stabbed to death.While Hercule Poirot searches for the murderer, he exposes other guest's past crimes one by one. This will cause a flurry of thoughts and predictions but you'll never guess how this one ends. You'll love this book, I promise. It has a great,great ending and a very extraodinary plot.

He invites to dinner four detectives plus four people he suspects may have gotten away with murder.Along with Poirot are two detectives we have met in earlier Christie works: Colonel Race, the trouble-shooter from the Foreign Office, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. Introduced in this book is Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a best-selling mystery writer, who has been compared to Christie herself. Like Mrs. Christie, Mrs. Oliver eats large quantities of apples while writing and Mrs. Oliver's books are about a quirky Finn who is not unlike Mrs. Christie's quirky Belgian. Mrs. Oliver will return in six additional novels.The other four guests that evening are: Dr. Roberts, a successful physician; Mrs. Lorrimer, an affluent widow who loves to play bridge; Major Despard, an African and South American explorer and guide; and Miss Anne Meredith, a young lady Shaitana met in Switzerland.After dinner, a game of bridge is arranged. Shaitana directs the four detectives to one room while the other four guests play in a separate room. The host says he does not like the game so sits and dozes by the fire in the room where the four possible murderers are playing. When the guests prepare to leave later, it is discovered that Shaitana has been fatally stabbed at some point in the evening.All four detectives tackle this case in their own way. Bridge players will delight in the way Poirot handles the case. He concentrates on the game itself, the hands that were dealt, and the method of scoring. If you pay attention to the game, you just might guess the murderer.This is one of Christie's classic surprise endings and, in my opinion, one of her best works."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"This book, with its initial copyright in 1936, shows Christie at the height of her powers.One of the coziest things about a Christie mystery - especially those which were written earlier - is that they are set before so many of the great advances in forensics. There's no mention of computer databanks or DNA, no fiber analysis nor hair samples. Now, I'm all for the wonderful things that can be done with forensics for capturing criminals in the real world, and these can make for fascinating reading, too. But novels are sometimes more pleasant when they don't deal with the technical side of things, but let the readers ponder, along with Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, the psychology behind the murder.In Cards on the Table, Christie sets up an imaginative, elegant, albeit implausible scenario. Four murderers - successful ones, those who have gotten away with it - are invited to dinner by Mr Shaitana, a rich eccentric who collects only the best - including collections of people. To the same dinner party this Shaitana invites four specialists in crime - a policeman, a man in the Secret Service, a writer of detective novels and of course our protagonist, Hercule Poirot. The dinner is excellent and Shaitana then makes some provocative remarks, putting the wind up in his quartet of murderers. The two groups - murderers and crime specialists - then divide into two different rooms and play bridge for the rest of the evening. Shaitana does not play, but sits in an armchair by the fire in the same room as the murderers. The evening continues until late. The crime specialists come to bid their host farewell, when lo! - to their great surprise, they find that their host has been murdered in the chair. The deed must have been committed by one of the four bridge players during the course of the evening.Christie then proceeds to reveal much about the murderers and their history. She does her best to be fair during the course of the book, putting her own cards on the table. And of course the pool of those who could have committed the crime is also limited - in another sense, the cards are also on the table. Finally, the bridge game plays a role in the assisting Poirot in figuring out whodunit. You can enjoy this book if you don't know bridge, but it helps if you do.Another advantage of this book is that there's also no appearance of the dim Arthur Hastings, for which I'm grateful.The psychology, in my opinion, is spot on in this book, and makes it one of Christie's best. My only question - and one which she did not have to answer - is to wonder if Shaitana had any plans for the end of the evening, assuming that he had survived? But Christie is not obliged to answer this question, and she does not."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Agatha Christie's preface to this book says it all. In most mystery novels, finding the murderer is easy; one merely has to focus upon the person who was least likely to have commited the crime. Needless to say, this is not that kind of book.The incomparable Hercule Poirot has always boasted of his insight into the criminal mind. And in this book, he discovers, perhaps, the case most suited to his method. Four murderers, thrown together by a slightly sardonic host. Each had a motive. An oppourtunity. At the end of a bridge game, the host was found dead, and one of the four did it.Hercule Poirot, once again, delves into the psychology of crime and exercises his &quot;little gray cells&quot;. A note: At one time or another during the book, all of the suspects will seem the least likely, and most likely to have done it. Perhaps the most obvious candidate for murder is the one that is guilty. I am saying nothing more."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Think of it- four suspects, all with an equal oppertunity and motive to have killed the mysterious Mr.Shaitana. At several points, it seems as though you know exactly who has done it- until you find out that it was not them, but another suspect. A brilliant, though sometimes confusing plot, all come into focus by the charming personality of Hercule Poirot."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"In my personal opinion, this Christie is virtually flawless. I think it is her best book.I espceially love the beginning of the book. It is almost ritualstic, like a Japanese dance. Quite unlike, say, Ackroyd or Express.The solution is not a trick (unlike both the previous); and it is based purely on psychology. Very good characterisation, an almost surrealistic atmosphere, and a devious, devious Poirot!The only comparison to this novel is And Then There Were None, which is even more devious, but less of a joy to read. Ackroyd I still admire greatly.But this book is, overall, the best of Christie I have read.Jonathan Lim"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"I was extremely pleased with Cards on the Table. The premise for the book was duly intriguing, with perhaps one of the more creative plot ideas to boot. The sleuths were intelligent and delightful, the possible murderers all sufficiently suspicious, and the victim a person who played his role to the nines.Dame Agatha made a point to say during the prologue that because you knew right away who the four possible murderers were, the element of surprise during the unmasking would be slightly less than if suspicion were cast on a whole room-full of people. True, perhaps, although not the common thread in ALL mediums.Cards on the Table, despite its aforesaid lack of surprise, does manage a neat, nice, maybe even SHOCKING unmasking of the murderer. It has no qualms about turning you around, giving you the classic Christie twist that makes you suspect each of the four in turn--and all in one chapter! You then realize that the true murderer is none other than the per! son you least suspected most--and that is perhaps one reason why Poirot was known to say it was his FAVORITE case, after all."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Nobody really knows Mr. Shaitana's true origins but he's clearly a suave man-about-town, if a bit of a nefarious and prickly character, who LOVES to observe human nature. He has a discussion about this very topic with Hercule Poirot at an aristocratic soiree and says that he'd like to sponsor a little dinner party where there are four \\"detectives\\" pitted against four potential murderers.Poirot warns Shaitana against such a frivolous endeavor but Shaitana is insistent and sets up his small party just as he had described -- and, of course, Hercule Poirot is one of the detective-guests as are three other folks that we've run across in other Christie tales: (mystery author) Mrs. Ariadne Oliver; Scotland Yard Superintendent Battle; and, Colonel Race, the adventurer.The evening focus is a card (bridge) party for eight guests total, with the host, Mr. Shaitana, remaining on the sidelines, walking about and reveling in his unique idea until he eventually tires and retreats to a fireside chair for a rest... where he is subsequently found dead!Which of the four prospective murderers did it? Of course, Superintendent Battle is in charge of the case but he's shrewd enough to enlist the aide of his co-detectives.This is one of my favorite Christie mysteries, especially since it involves a number of good detectives whom we already know from her other works. \\"Cards on the Table\\" was originally published in 1936 so it's a fairly early Christie entry.While not quite up to the caliber of either \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" or \\"Death on the Nile,\\" I can still highly recommend this one to any fan of a good cosy murder mystery."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Mr. Shaitana, an acquaintance of Poirot's, invited him to a party to meet four people who he though got away with murder. An Inspector from the Scotland Yard, a British Secret Service and a murder fiction writer were also invited to the party. Mr. Shaitana challenged the investigators to figure out what murders the suspects had committed. The suspects, Dr. Roberts, Major Despard, Mrs. Lorrimer, and Miss Meredith, all were in the room playing bridge when Mr. Shaitana was murdered. The four investigators began working on clues using their own techniques to solve the crime. Which one of the suspects murdered Mr. Shaitana in fear of Mr. Shaitana telling the police about their crime and were they all crime that Mr. Shaitana thought? I would rate this book a 5 out of 5. All four suspects seem to be guilty and them seemed to be innocent. You don't know who did it until the end. I've always like Agatha Christie books since I saw the remake of Murder on the Orient Express on TV. Since then I've read about 13 Agatha Christie books."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books; it ranks right up there with The Murder of Roger Akroyd, Murder on the Orient Express, And then There Were None, and Death on the Nile. The characters were extremely well drawn, especially Rhoda and Ann. I love Mrs. Oliver! :-)However, you should definatley read Murder on the Orient Express first, because Poirot rather carelessly reveals the solution to that book in Cards on the Table. Read it; you won't regret it.If you love Agatha Christies too, please email me!"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Okay, just to say, i\`m only 11 so don\`t think you have to listen to me.As the title states I think this is one of her most compex and confusing books that Agatha ever wrote right behind &#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; and &#34;Murder on the Orient Express&#34; the exitement factor isn\`t quite as big as in her other novels because there are only four people who could have done it but it the sychology and text make you second guess yourself about every ten minutes. Don\`t read this if you haven\`t read Murder on the Orient express because Poirot gives it away in casual conversation and, frankly it is a little better than Cards on the table, although it doesn\`t matter what order you read them in.I am sure that when you read this book you will find Mrs. Oliver comical for she impersonates Agatha\`s alter ego perfectly, &#34; When it starts to get boring a bit of blood or another murder will always liven things up&#34; she quotes in the book. If you are one if those fans who like the multiple murder mysteries this is one that has three and supply\`s the books main exitement factor. Now notice that I didn\`t say entertainment, that was because the the thoughts that the text puts into your head are so interesting that you are blown away by the detail of the book.The last twenty percent of the book is edge of your seat stuff and you won\`t be able to put it down so plan for a long session near the end. Plus, Agatha masterfully convices you to believe each of the four suspects in one chapter!I am a huge Poirot fan and I have already read almost half of his books and I am just about to read The Mystery of The Blue Train so if you like this review be sure to look for mine on The Blue Train soon."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"First published in 1936, this is the 12th Poirot book, the 3rd Superintendent Battle book, and the 2nd Colonel Race book, and has no narrator. It's the first case in which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once.The story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen.For Shaitana, like a few other collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of \\"tigers\\" (Poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.)Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner.Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players!This is, of course, Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. There are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with?Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention).And, of course, there's Poirot. He's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning:(1) Describe how the bridge games played out, and(2) Describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's house where the bridge games were played).See if you can figure out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"I've read a bunch of Agatha Christie books, and this one is certainly among the best. A bit faster paced than some of her novels, but it still maintains the complete character development and complex plot typical of an Agatha Christie mystery.

Well Baby you have no idea, simply the best."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"--is plot. Fiendish plots. Labyrinth plots. Impenetrable plots. In \\"Cards on the Table,\\" she has exceeded herself. It is a whodunit lovers delight.To make such a puzzle work, the circumstances have to be fairly contrived. So you will just have to accept that four of the best sleuths alive all have consented to be guests of a repellent billionaire who claims the other four guests are successful murderers. Why the four accused murderers would also accept is unimportant. The entertainment will be contract bridge with the idea that by knowing a person's bridge game, you will see the inner man (or woman as the case may be.) Actually, this is not true. Some very nice people become gargoyles at the bridge table then instantly revert to their nice selves once the game is over, but we will let this pass.The sleuths are Hercule Poirot, the observer from hell; Supt. Battle, the plodder but tenacious; Colonel Race, pragmatist and gentleman; and Ariadne Oliver, penner of detective novels and rather silly. Why Dame Agatha didn't substitute Jane Marple in Ms. Oliver's place, I do not know. Perhaps Jane didn't play bridge.The guests are stock Christie characters: the Doctor, the Ing&eacute;nue, the Stern Upper class Lady, and the Military Man. The sleuths play together in one room, the guests play 3+ rubbers in the other room (the reader is supplied with a tally). Sometime during the play, the host is murdered in the same room as the guests with no one the wiser except the murderer, of course. This is an embarrassing state of affairs for the sleuths, having the murder happen almost right under their noses, and they pool their skills to unearth the murderer. We gradually find out more and more about the guests. Each, of course, had an excellent motive for doing the host in. To keep us thoroughly confused, the guests lie at will about themselves and each other, but they cannot outthink, outwit and outplay their opponents for long. We get the solution, and then a twist and then a final twist before Poirot & Co. have successfully settled the matter.This is one of Christie's finer puzzles. It suffers from a static setting (the crime scene), but she invests enough interest in all the characters to keep our attention close and our little gray cells churning.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"If you don't play, understand, or enjoy bridge (the card game), it may be difficult for you to be completely immersed in this book.

Her books are timeless, and are as enjoyable now as when they were written in the 30's and 40's. Not many authors have her longevity, and very few in the mystery genre. This stoy at first appears simplistic, because there are only four suspects, and each of them very credibly could have been the murderer. But the story is much more complex than it first appears. The four potential murderers have apparently all get some sort of murder in their histories, so each one of them could have killed Shaitana. Not only that. the murder was committed when none other than Hercule Poirot and Chief Inspector Battle are both on the premises. This is a very cool killer indeed, and Battle and Poirot set out to unmask the killer. I don't know why I had not read this Agatha Christie story before, but I certainly missed the boat.

He wants Poirot to come to dinner to meet his exhibits - murderers who he claims have \\"got away with it.\\" Although Poirot finds his hobby dangerous he agrees, leading to a dinner party with four sleuths (Poirot himself, Colonel Race, who works for the Secret Service, Superintendent Battle from Scotland Yard and our old friend the detective writer Ariadne Oliver) and four possible murderers (the cheerful Dr Roberts, the explorer Major Despard, serious bridge player Mrs Lorrimer and the young and nervous Miss Anne Meredith). After dinner the guests play bridge, while Mr Shaitana dozes by the fire and, during the evening, he is murdered.This murder leads to our four sleuths pooling information in trying to discover who could have killed the host in full view of everybody and also looking into their backgrounds to see which of them, if any, were really guilty of murder. Christie was a keen bridge player and, although you may think this makes the book dry, she is careful to only use the card game as a small part of the story. The real fun is in the uncovering of secrets, as all the guests at the dinner party meet up and discuss what happened. Although Mrs Oliver uncovers some great clues, it is M. Poirot and his little grey cells that reign supreme and solves the mystery of what happened. First published in 1936, this is Christie at her best - which is better than any other crime writer there has ever been."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"I love Agatha Christie so it was a good read, but it wasn't one of my top picks.I had a hard time keeping my focus because I don't play cards or know the lingo."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"This was delivered to my Kindle with no difficulty.

The author and the four detectives, and thus the reader, have a lot of fun with this conceit.

When he arrives he finds three other detectives have been invited, enigmatic Superintendant Battle of Scotland Yard, Colonel Race of the Secret Service, and Mrs Ariadne Oliver, a writer of detective stories. The four murderers are an elderly widow, Mrs Lorrimer, dashing, adventurous Major Despard, bluff Dr. Roberts, and Anne Meredith, a young seemingly innocent girl. The two parties, murderers and detectives, settle down to play bridge in separate rooms, Mr Shiatana sits by the fire in the murderers' room, and in the course of the evening he is duly murdered. The four detectives set out to solve the crime. As with all Christie novesl there are plenty of humorous touches. One of my favourites is when Superintedant Battle calls for one of the suspects. \\"I should have kept him to the end\\" said Mrs Oliver \\"In a book, I mean\\" she added apologetically. \\"Real life's a bit different\\" said Battle. \\"I know\\" said Mrs Oliver. \\"Badly constructed.\\" The detecives find out a lot about their suspects, including the nature of the murders they committed in the past(one of them turns out to be innocent of any murder). There are lots of exciting plot twists, and you are kept guessing until the end. I understand it is possible to work out the identity of the murderer by studying the bridge scores reproduced in the book, if you understand bridge that is. I don't, but it doesn\\"t matter, this is a thrilling story anyway, one of the best Mrs Christie wrote."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"the mystery book that has an established 'brand' name of agatha christie is rare to dissapoint you as the possibility of good mystery book written by her is high...so whenever you want a nice and cosy mystery,you can rely on her book(but not all)...this particular book is one of the most ingenious set up that you could wish of...the plot is mainly around the murder during the bridge game,now that agatha was well known for her wide knowledge of bridge..so she used her talent in this book...this book is a must for all mystery lover"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"This is absolutely one of the best.This ranks in one of my top 3.Read this.It is a masterpiece.A shocker!"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Well, what can i say (WARNING SPOILERS)?Christie always gives us turnaround conclusions, but this! Well, this book reminds me in a way of \\"And Then There Were None\\" in that all (but 1) of the fiends really are murdereres.Actually, i digress. Before i get into the meat of the book, and it's positives-let me mention its negatives. For one thing, it is assumed that you know Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle, and Miss Oliver already. Ok, i knew Race, Battle, and of course Poirot, but i don't remember Miss Oliver, so i was led quite merrily up the garden path thinking that somehow she was guilty. (She does seem quite...unusual). Also, the book assumes that you must know bridge inside out. Ok-i understand that it was written in the 30s, and in England, where Bridge is played much more than now. But even in books in contemporary times, i hate it when it is assumed that one knows things. It's like if the solving of a 2010's book was based on facebook attributes or texting lingo-not everyone does that, so the ones that don't will be at a SEVERE disadvantage!Ok-that out of the way. I like how this book breaks into 4 parts as we explore the past crimes of the 4. Once the Major was believed by Poirot (that he didn't really commit a murder), then he was off the hook for me. The older lady (i forget her name) seemed far too engrossed in the game (remembering every hand in detail (i must confess, i skipped the page with the lengthy bridge explanation)) to have committed murder, so it was left to the Doctor and the young girl. For some reason, i didn't trust her-but that might be because in my personal life, i've been hurt FAR too often by \\"sweet young things that at least to me turn out to be not so sweet\\". But just as i was congratulating myself on solving the murder, it turned out the Doctor did it! (Don't worry, that oh-so-innocent girl was a bad 'un as well!) That stunned me.I will say though that just as in And Then There Were None, all the ones who really committed murder were punished. The Major was the only one of the suspects to live happily ever after, (and as i said before, he didn't murder).The only other thing i think is a \\"slight\\" negative is that it seems too coincidental that the young girl visited the older lady just before she was killed when she had nothing to do with it, but coincidents do happen i suppose.Well, my speech is becoming far too long, so let me say again, read the book-even one of Christie's \\"stinkers\\" beats most authors best works!"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Cards on the Table is one of Agatha Christie's closed-room whodunits (a format she was master of) featuring her popular detective Hercule Poirot. But as far as Agatha Christie mysteries go, this one was just \\"ok\\" -- good but not great and definitely not Christie's best.Unlike many of her other stories, this one didn't focus so much on Poirot -- as much time was spent on the activities of Sergeant Battle and Ariadne Oliver as on Poirot himself. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, since I'm not terribly fond of the too-smug Poirot.However, for me this book had three main weaknesses that kept it from rising above the mediocre. First -- and perhaps least -- is the character of Ariadne Oliver. This is the first time I've encountered her, although according to the Wikipedia article on Christie, Oliver is a frequently recurring character in her mysteries featuring Poirot. Meant to be a spoof of herself, Ariadne Oliver is a feminist writer of popular mysteries featuring a Finnish detective. I suppose she is meant to be comic relief, but I found her to be a simply silly character who detracted from the story overall.The second weakness of the book is that it focused largely on the game of bridge. If you're not familiar with bridge, as I am not, then many of Poirot's deductions and comments will not make sense to you.But the major weakness of this book is the most fundamental. And that is, the murder was committed at a dinner party, with the 8 attendees being the only possible killers. And the weapon was found still on the body. So why didn't they just dust the stiletto for fingerprints, and then take the fingerprints of everyone present? That would quickly and easily identify the murderer. There is mention later in the book of fingerprints, so obviously fingerprint technology was available and in use in the 1930s (when this story is set). The answer is obviously that the mystery would then be over in two chapters at the most. Nevertheless, the long, drawn-out, elaborate investigation seemed needless and senseless to me from the beginning.This is not Christie's worst, but not her best, either. The narration is fine, though."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Written at the height of her powers, \\"Cards on the Table\\" contains one of Christie's most intriguing set ups. The mysterious Mr Shaitana (who is repeatedly described as Mephistophelian) is a purveyor of odd collectibles, and approaches Poirot to invite him to a dinner party with a difference. The assembled guests are Poirot, Colonel Race, a Secret Service agent, Inspector Battle of Scotland Yard, and the mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver, as well as Mrs Lorrimer, a composed widow, Anne Meredith, a young ing&eacute;nue, Major Despard, a big-game safari hunter, and Doctor Roberts, a personable physician. The former group are all investigators of some kind or another; the latter are a more disparate group, but when Shaitana separates the two into bridge parties and falls asleep in a chair by the fire, none are prepared for what happens next.When Poirot and his group finish up the game and enter the drawing room, they are horrified to discover that Mr Shaitana is sitting dead in his chair, stabbed to death with a stiletto. Any of the four sitting in the room could have done it, and it soon becomes obvious that all are equally suspect. Shaitana had previously made hints to Poirot that he \\"collected\\" murderers who had gotten away with their crimes, and Poirot realizes that his death is exactly what Shaitana had planned for his dinner party.It's four detectives pitted against four murderers: each one of them had the motive and the opportunity, but only one of them is guilty. Whilst the other three detectives go about the usual methods of deduction, Poirot takes an interest in the psychological aspect of the bridge game that the would-be killers were playing.\\"Cards on the Table\\" is one of the few mysteries that contains a foreword by the author, in which Christie explains that too often she's been told by her readers that most of the time all they have to do to identify the killer is to find the least-likely suspect. In this case however, all four suspects are *already* guilty of a crime, with an equal interest in committing another. As Christie herself says: \\"they are four wildly divergent types; the motive that drives each one of them to crime is peculiar to that person, and each one would employ a different method. The deduction must, therefore, be entirely psychological.\\" Perhaps more than any other Christie mystery, the solution to the murder is found in Poirot's insight into the criminal mind.Readers who are unfamiliar with the game of bridge may be a little cross-eyed at the constant references to the bridge game, though it should not impede the possibility of deducing who the killer is. Christie still \\"plays by the rules,\\" and does not overly rely on specialized knowledge. She does - as the title implies - puts all the cards on the table.This also marks the first appearance of Ariadne Oliver, who is a very transparent fictional version of Christie herself. With her tendency to eat apples while she's writing and her frustration toward her fictional detective Sven, Christie takes the opportunity to poke fun at several aspects of her writing career - including fastidious readers, the complications in getting a plot underway, and the distaste she has for several of her own novels. She's a great character, and pops up often in subsequent mysteries.\\"Cards on the Table\\" is one of the best Christie mysteries out there, with Poirot at the top of his game."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Cards on the Table by Agatha ChristieAvenel Books, 1936115 pagesMystery; Hercule Poirot4/5 starsSource: LibrarySummary: Mr Shaitana collects things; one of those things allegedly being people who have committed murder without being caught. One night he invites four renowned investigators of crime (Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle, and writer Ariadne Oliver) and four people who presumably have committed murder. But at the end of the night, Mr Shaitana is dead and Poirot and the others must race against time to capture the culprit before s/he becomes to emboldened by success.Thoughts: This is apparently the first Poirot novel with Ariadne Oliver, a mystery writer who allows Christie to express anger toward her fictional detective, discuss detective fiction, and provide comic relief. I quite liked her although sometimes I feel like Christie doesn't much like women.The four suspects were pretty interesting and there was a lot of backstory as we tried to figure out the psychology of them in order to discern who could have committed this murder. We also got to spend a lot of time with some of them, which helped me distinguish them in my head not that it helped me solve the mystery.As there were only four suspects, I had a 1 in 4 chance of getting the right person. But with all of the plot twists and details uncovered, I ended up very confused. I should just go with the least likely person! Seriously, there are at least two major turnabouts that change things! There was also entirely too much talk about bridge.Overall: A bit confusing but very thrilling and maybe you'll have better luck figuring out the murderer!"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"I enjoy reading the occasional Agatha Christie title, though- nine times out of ten- there's just no way I have any chance of unraveling the undoubtedly complicated solution. Predictably, that was the case with \\"Cards on the Table\\", an unusual entry in the Christie canon in that it features several of the author's notable detective characters appearing together. But also predictably, there's clean, no-nonsense writing; sharply drawn descriptions of individual crime scenes; skillful use of mood and flavor; and colorful, well drawn characterizations. In other words, it has all the things that are the true reasons I enjoy Agatha Christie.Interestingly, though, once the murder or murders is solved, Dame Christie apparently had no more use for her characterization, descriptive, and other storytelling skills, as all her books- this one included- immediately end once there isn't a crime left to unravel. You bought a mystery, you get a mystery-- end of story! Funny, then, that I always viewed the mystery plot in any given Christie title as a kind of bonus, picking up the books mainly for the writing qualities I described above, or put another way, the well-drawn journey.And, once again, Christie's \\"Cards on the Table\\" delivers exactly that: an involving, well-drawn journey. And that's good enough for me. But I guess that also means that I'll really, really enjoy an Agatha Christie title if I find myself actually figuring out the solution before our detective hero does!"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"The grey cells are at it again. Mr. Hercule Poirot finds himself at a strange dinner party where the host turns up dead. His death is no big surprise to Poirot, since the host, the mysterious Mr. Shaitana, confided a strange hobby of his to Poirot before inviting him to dinner. As a collector, Mr. Shaitana had a vast array of knick knacks and souvenirs, but for this dinner party his exhibit was to be four persons who had each gotten away with murder. Combine these four persons with a mystery writer, a private investigator and two professional sleuths, and the table is set for an ominous outcome.The four possible murderers compose a variety of characterisitics. There is Mrs. Lorrimer, an excellent bridge player who recalls the entire game but little about the room it was played in. Dr. Roberts, a well-known and well-liked physician, who may have had some scandal in his past that he is desperate to cover up. Then there is Major Despard, an extremely good looking adventurer with a possible smoldering temper. And finally the seemingly innocent and naive Anne Meredith, the youngest of the party, but quite possibly the most dangerous. Before the mystery can be solved, Mr. Shaitana's murder is not the only death that must be solved, and the race is on to stop the murderer from striking again.\\"Cards on the Table\\", like all of Agatha Christie's yarns, is a fast-paced quick read. Even for readers who are unfamiliar with the game of bridge, the descriptions of the game do little to slow the pace of the narrative and actually do much to further the mysterious personalities of the four possible murderers. The story is told from a variety of viewpoints, as each of the four 'sleuths' try to gain knowledge that will solve not only the murder of Mr. Shaitana, but also try to uncover what knowledge he held over each of their heads that may have given them the motive to kill him in a room with others present. \\"Cards on the Table\\" is an enjoyable read with several intriguing plot twists that almost have Hercule Poirot scratching his head and admitting he's made a mistake - something he is not prone to do, and doesn't do by the novel's end."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"Mr. Shaitana, an eccentric rich man who owns exquisite objects, invites Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's famous detective, to dinner at his flat to show him his latest collection. Only this time, Shaitana's acquisition does not consist of snuffboxes like the ones displayed at Wessex House where he meets Poirot. Shaitana has gone beyond collecting things; he is now collecting people who have gotten away with murder. The night of the dinner Poirot meets the four suspects: Doctor Roberts, Mrs. Lorrimer, Major Despard, and Anne Meredith. He also meets Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a writer of detective stories; Colonel Race, a secret agent; and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. After dinner the guests play a game of bridge. The four sleuths play in one room, while the other four guests play in another room where Mr. Shaitana, who declines from playing, sits alone by the fire. At the end of the evening, Mr. Shaitana is found stabbed to death. Even though there are only four possible murderers, the four detectives begin an investigation, which I guarantee will delight any murder story aficionado.I was captivated by each detective's distinct way of speculating who the murderer is and how each of them has a different method of investigation. I found it interesting, for example, how Poirot uses the scores of the bridge game the suspects played the night of the murder to find out some information about the suspects. This novel presented to me the challenge Shaitana presented to Poirot: the challenge of finding out who committed the murder without any evidence except for the murder weapon and the subtle clues Shaitana mentioned while dining. The dramatic, extremely creative and suspenseful plot allured me, thus making it my favorite Agatha Christie novel so far."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"While at an art gallery opening Hercule Poirot makes the aquaintance of Mr. Shaitana, an eccentric collector of art and curiosities. Among his curiosities Mr. Shaitana includes a few murderers who have managed not to be caught, or even be seriously under suspicion. Shaitana decides that he would like to have a dinner party to show off his collection and to that end, he invites four murderers and four detectives. During the dinner he drops a few not so subtle hints about what he knows and sits back to watch the 'fun'. The fun takes an unexpected turn during the after dinner bridge games, the host is murdered.The detectives on the case are Poirot, Col. Race from the Foreign Office, Sgt. Battle (THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY) and Ariadne Oliver, mystery writer (DEAD MAN'S FOLLY and THE PALE HORSE). The murderers include Dr. Roberts, who may have killed a patient; Col. Despard, who may have killed the husband of the woman he loved; Mrs. Lorrimar, whose husband died under 'usual circumstances' and Miss Meredith whose former employer died of an accidental poisoning.The detectives decide to try to uncover the murderer themselves, each has their own ideas about who did it and why and each goes about the investigation in their own way. The plot takes many interesting twists and turns. Just when it appears that all has been revealed Christie gives one of her characteristic twists .The main reason that I feel that this is a four, not a five star novel is the emphasis placed on the bridge game. As a non-bridge player I felt that there was a vital clue that I was missing even though it was right there in front of me. In fairness it is possible to solve the crime without the bridge game clues but it was still frustrating while reading the story."},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","review":"This one contains three plot twists that had me grasping at straws.

Yet it's useful for more deeply understanding the moon signs in both genders.

The book is slightly mis-titled, as the information given is not sensationalistic or exasperated with men as the title suggests. It's down to earth and practical -- as well as potentially transformative for relationships if taken into account! I'd like to see another version of the book titled to get men to read about themselves.

Philosophically, Tilly is a historicist who refuses to \\"search for grand laws in human affairs comparable to the laws of Newtonian mechanics\\" this attempt, Tilly says, has \\"utterly failed\\" (pg. 9). Instead, a better \\"effort necessarily depends on turning away from 'laws' of social movements toward causal analogies and connections between distinctive aspects of social movements and other variables of politics\\" (pg. 10).To that end, Tilly pursues 9 main arguments in this book:(1) From their 18th century origins onward, social movements have proceeded not as solo performances, but as interactive campaigns. (2) Social movements combine 3 kinds of claims: program, identity, and standing. (3) The relative salience of program, identity, and standing claims varies significantly among social claimants within movements, and among phases of movements. (4) Democratization promotes the formation of social movements. (5) Social movements assert popular sovereignty (6) As compared with locally grounded forms of popular politics, social movements depend heavily on political entrepreneurs for their scale, durability, and effectiveness. (7) Once social movements establish themselves in 1 political setting, modeling, communication, and collaboration facilitate their adoption in other connected settings (8) The forms, personnel, and claims of social movements vary and evolve historically. (9) The social movement, as an invented institution, could disappear or mutate into some quite different form of politics (pgs. 12-14, 35-37,150-152).Tilly pays very little attention to the history and power of ideas (this may annoy some Political Theorists). Also, according to Richard Hogan's book review in \\"Contemporary Sociology,\\" proponents of the resource mobilization model and political process model of social movements will find Tilly's overall approach as a challenge and opposing view."},{"Title":"Social Movements, 1768-2004","review":"The book is fine, well researched and whatever, but I felt that his approach was far too simplistic. In addition, his theory of WUNC (worthiness, unity, numbers and commitment) does not even take into consideration leadership or the use of violence. In addition, his writing style is incredibly annoying - he begins with a VERY specific, in-depth example and you do not even find out what he is talking about until five pages into each chapter - so instead of giving us an outline of his argument, we are left to search through pages to find his main points."},{"Title":"Social Movements, 1768-2004","review":"I was required to read this book for a Sociology class. The point of the class was to study \\"movements\\" for social change. This book is very difficult to read, and is an extremely dry presentation of the material. The author skips around a lot going from movement to movement within a particular century. The early centuries are presented poorly, lumping an entire centuries worth of history for a country into 2 pages. And with that, trying to make connections between the first part of the century and the last part of the century.This book also seems to make it a point to avoid talking about the United States. The US is given a page and a half in a 40pg chapter (including a half page chart) lumping everything from the Abolishonist movement, the Dry movement, the Women's movement, and Nativist movement without really discussing any of it.The author also rips the spine out of these \\"movements\\" by so narrowly defining the term social movements that any type of voilent retaliation of \\"mob\\" mentality becomes eliminated from discussion.If you have to buy this book for class, do so, just be prepared.

By exploring the Scrolls as a whole, as well as the main groups of Jews in ancient Israel, Schiffman presents an amazing thesis as to who theses people were, and what schism led them to break from their homes and form this community. A book full of wisdom, and insight, Schiffman leads the reader on a complete exploration of the times, Scrolls, and provides a very helpful glossary for the layman, and scholar alike"},{"Title":"Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran","review":"Lawrence H. Schiffman wrote an excellent book re The Dead Sea Scrolls. RECLAIMING THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS is a clearly written account of the development and interpretation of these Scrolls which were first discovered in 1947. Schiffman argues that not only Christians but also religious Jews can benefit from this book to gain a better understanding of the roots of their religion.Schiffman presents the controversies surrounding the editing and publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls. These controversies were based in part on pettiness, professional jealously, etc. Yet, Schiffman also informs readers that some of these controversies were based on honest differences of opinion. An interesting feature of this book is the photo plates of some of \\"the players\\" involved in this controversy. One of the scholars involved in interpreting and publishing the scrolls was Ben Zion Wacholder whose was one of the professors this reviewer's son while in graduate school at Hebrew Union College in Cincinatti, Ohio. Schiffman gives a detailed yet clear picture of the scholars involved and explains why there was controversy and what the differences were.Schiffman also explained the cultural mileau in Palestine and Judea during the time that the Scrolls were written (c.400 BC-200 AD). Devout Jews were caught in cultural conflict between Hellenistic Greek influences and later Roman influences especially after 63 BC. Schiffman explains that these differences were serious and led what may be called the Maccabean Wars (c.175 BC-163 BC). Schhiffman showed that not only were there conflicts between religious Jews and their Greek and later Roman rulers, but these influences caused internal conflict among religious Jews themselves. For Christians this helps explain the mention between Saduccess and Pharisees mentioned in the New Testament. For those who seek a biblical background of the Jewish vs. Greek conflicts, the books of First Maccabees and Second Maccabees, which are found in Catholic Bibles, are the biblical sources. As an aside, religious Jews celebrate Hanukkah to commerate the Maccabean struggle against the Greeks. Schoffman's book helps readers to better understand this conflict.An important feature of THE DEAD SEAS SCROLLS is the maps and geography of the sites where the Scrolls were found. Alert readers should understand that the Dead Sea Scrolls were written over a long period of time in response to outside political pressures and internal Jewish conflicts. Some of the Scrolls contain parts of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)and are some of the earliest examples of books of the Bible that we know of. Readers should note that some of the biblical books found in The Dead Sea Scrolls are different and either shorter or longer than those contained in contemporary bibles. This is a good topic to investigate.Most scholars and historians think that memebers of the Essenes wrote and edited The Dead Sea Scrolls. One interpretation of these men is that they isolated themselves from both Roman and secular Jewish influences. Schiffman exlained that these men may have been pacifists, but some scholars disagree in that the Essenes were not always so peaceful. The debate is based in part that the Qumran site was a fortress for militant activity. Schiffmann effective argued that this site was NOT a military fortress.Schiffman further how The Dead Sea Scrolls assist in explaining both the origins of Christianity and the development of Rabbinic Judaism. In other words, The Dead Sea Scrolls are the exclusive domain of either religion. Schiffman makes a good case that THE MISHNA and THE TALMUD were base in part on these scrolls. Schiffman gave both Christians and religious Jews a clear explanation of how THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS contributed to both relisions.Essentially Schiffman presented a readable account that should satisfy reasonable men whether they are Christian or Jew. Honest scholarship and honest/reasonable debate can coexist if scholars can shed their personal and professional jealously. Serious readers should give this book the serious attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran","review":"While almost certainly the fault of the marketing arm of the publisher rather than of the author, it is a bit disappointing that the dust jacket promises a Forward by Chaim Potok (in brighter lettering than the author's name) that turns out to be a mere one and a quarter pages, and merely baldly restates the thesis of the book that the Dead Sea Scrolls were not the library of a community foreshadowing Christianity, but the library of a community firmly within the Jewish tradition.As for the substance of the book itself, there is some disappointment there, also. It appears to be a very good draft of a not-quite-edited book. There are often shifts between the documents found at Qumran (the Dead Sea Scrolls) and those found elsewhere at other times. Although the documents are named when being discussed, the general reader is often left to ponder the sources, the origins, and the relative dates of the documents.At the beginning, there are several tables that illustrate in detail points that could have been made in summary. For example, there is a table setting forth the age of various Dead Sea Scrolls as calibrated by Carbon-14 dating. The table even includes the number of samples of particular scrolls tested, although the meaning of those numbers is not apparent to a non-expert reader, and not explained by the author--yet there is an entire column of data. (p. 32). On the next page is a graphic showing that the Carbon-14 dating of the scrolls was not that far off from the dating performed by paleographic scholars or explicit dates set forth in the scroll itself. Whether the table distorts the statistics would not be apparent to any non-expert, so the point would just have been better made by authorial assertion. On the very next page is a pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of the Dead Sea Scrolls among Biblical materials, sectarian material peculiar to the Qumran community, non-sectarian material, and unidentified material. Why the percentages are important is not disclosed. Moreover, it is not even clear whether the percentages refer to the number of separate documents or to the bulk of the documents--in other words, do the percentages refer to the number of separate works or to the number (and size) of pages? A table that would be helpful is a list of every book discussed, where it was found, the language in which it was written, and the approximate date of its composition. For example, in Chapter 19 the author discusses \\"The Assumption of Moses\\" in a single brief paragraph. This text is not mentioned anywhere else in the entire book. A non-specialist is in the dark as to what this esoteric text may be, or any other information that would shed light on its significance. Indeed, the author adds to the puzzle when he states that the text is \\"written in either Hebrew or Aramaic.\\" Can it be that the author does not know in which language it is written? Is there more than one text of it, written in different languages? We do not know. The author tells us, unhelpfully, that the text was written \\"most probably around the turn of the era.\\" (p. 321). Which era?The want of an editor's pen is noted in unnecessary repetitions. On pages 276 the Qumran community's limits of travel on the Sabbath are set forth: \\"..on the Sabbath one was permitted to walk only one thousand cubits (about 1,500 feet or 450 meters) beyond the city limits.\\" But the second text notes an exception: in order to pasture an animal, one could go another thousand cubits...\\" A few pages later (pages 282-83), the same information is given: \\"The sect had two Sabbath limits: One permitted a person to walk only one thousand cubits beyond the city; if one were pasturing an animal, one could go an additional thousand.\\"Similarly, one is frustrated when the author quotes a passage that is unambiguous in its meaning, and then unnecessarily paraphrases the passage:\\"'He (the king) shall choose for himself from them (those he has mustered) one thousand from each tribe to be with him, twelve thousand warriors, who will not leave him alone, lest he be captured by the nations. And all those selected whom he shall choose shall be trustworthy men, who fear God, who spurn unjust gain, and mighty men of war. They shall be with him always, day and night, so that they will guard him from any sinful thing, and from a foreign nation, lest he be captured by them. (TEMPLE SCROLL 57:5-11)'The king is also required to select twelve thousand men, one thousand from each tribe, to serve as a palace guard. They must never leave him, lest he be captured by foreign enemies. The members of the guard are to be honest, God-fearing men, of the highest military prowess.\\"Pp. 269-70. Another example:\\"'For Jerusalem is the camp of holiness, and it is the place which He (God) chose from all the tribes of Israel, for Jerusalem is the chief of the camps of Israel. (HALAKHIC LETTER B58-62)'Only Jerusalem has this exalted status since God chose it. Furthermore, for legal purposes the city is the equivalent of the wilderness camp.\\"P. 389.For all of the author's insistence on the complexity of the Jewish world with the many sects and communities during the time of the Qumran community, he dismisses the century after that with the simplistic notion that the rise of Christianity caused a Jewish consensus by the year 132 C.E. He concludes that the Jews unified against the Christians as a competing group for the \\"mantle of the true Israel.\\" P. 404. This is despite the fact that many early Christians continued to worship in Synagogues for a couple of centuries. See, e.g., When Christians Were Jews, by Wayne Daniel Berard. Why the splintered groups would coalesce in the face of the common enemy of Christianity when they did not unite against the much more powerful Romans is not addressed.Overall, reading the book is like hearing one conclusory position in a scholarly debate, without hearing the responses from the other scholars, or without having the specialized knowledge required to determine whose opinion would be more plausible. Even so, I learned a lot about the different Jewish doctrines of the first centuries B.C.E. and C.E., as well as about the archeological remains at Qumran."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran","review":"No study of early Christian or 2nd-temple Judaism would be complete without an understanding of the content of the dead sea scrolls. Professor Schiffman provides a well organized and insightful study of the 2nd-temple period. Professor Schiffman is enthusiastic and up to date in his subject matter so we come away greatly satisfied with his treatment of this topic. I especially enjoyed the lecture on the interpretation of scripture which gives great insight into how the early Christians (apostles in particular) used the Jewish scriptures in light of their understanding and witness of the resurrection event. Ideal study to strengthen understanding between the two great faiths of Judaism and Christianity.

But alas, Professor Lawrance Schiffman has arrived to set the record straight. In this book, Professor Schiffman (thoroughly, simply and undeniably) demonstrates the early existence of specific Pharisaic ideas in 150BCE, that were later attributed to the Beit Hillel school of Pharisees. Thus, the claim that Pharisaic Judaism is some (post 70ce / post Temple) concoction of the Rabbis has now been reduced to the rubbish heap - where it always belonged. Thanks Professor.

Six of the 13 stories date to 1919 or before, and the remainder to the early 1930s. Many of the stories brim with optimism and energy; as Lewis notes in his preface, the earliest stories \\"are so certain that large, bulky Americans are going to do something and do it quickly and help the whole world by doing it.\\" Even writing from the advanced perspective of 1935, Lewis noted that the earliest stories \\"belong to an era as distant now and strange as the days of Queen Victoria or of Noah's ark\\". Nearly 75 years later, such stories portray a world alien to our own, but familiar in its nostalgic evocation of a shared national mythos.These short stories are charming and entertaining; the satire is gentle and the human portrayals sympathetic and affectionate. They show none of the biting satire or heavy-handedness of some of Lewis' most successful novels. Even when a \\"Babbitt\\" appears (as in \\" Go East Young Man\\"), he is quite a likeable sort. Indeed the Sinclair Lewis that emerges is less a satirist or even a realist, than a romantic whose idealism is tempered by sympathy for the foibles and limitations of human beings.If one wanted to find fault, one could note that the several of the stories have a commercial feel (among them the self-consciously cute \\"Let's Play Kings, \\" which at 90 pages goes on for much too long, and the blatantly nationalistic \\" Kidnaped Memorial.\\") Such is understandable, given their publication in magazines such as the \\"Saturday Evening Post \\"and the original \\"Cosmopolitan \\". Further, the stories have a provincial focus, because Lewis chose not to deal with the great events of the day -- there is no mention of the Great Depression or the growing international tensions of the 1930s, and the First World War is mentioned in only one story. Lewis was neither a Steinbeck nor a Hemingway, and he portrayed what he knew best -- life in the small mid-western towns and cities with which he was familiar from his youth.In this reviewer's opinion, among the most memorable stories of this collection are the following: \\"Things \\" (an ironic portrayal of the pretensions of materialism and newfound wealth), \\"Land \\" (that shows a father and son torn between an agricultural past and entrepreneurial future), and \\" Go East Young Man \\" (that like his novels \\"Main Street \\" and \\"Babbitt\\") show the tension between small - city capitalism and a yearning for bourgeois values of \\"art\\" and \\"music.\\")The stories in this collection certainly do not rank in quality with Sinclair Lewis' great novels, works for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. But they clearly emanated from the same pen. Read them to become absorbed into a portrayal of a mythical past when life could be seen as simpler, and possibilities less limited."},{"Title":"Selected short stories of Sinclair Lewis","review":"Sorry, I didn't enjoy of these stories.

Apparently when they edited and &quot;simplified&quot; the textbook nobody bothered to update the workbook. As a result, the workbook references incorrect page numbers in the textbook, and asks you to know words that no longer appear in the vocabulary lists of the text.

L. Mencken (May 1925) in his monthly \\"The Library\\" column of the American Mercury, G. D. Eaton's BACKFURROW proved very nearly what so many of us are always groping around for, whether we know it or not, that semi-mythical forgotten or overlooked literary gem. You know, the one that will throw open the doors to another time, illuminating and animating the past while reviving our sagging spirits the way only a good novel can, and mostly make us wonder, perhaps a bit resentfully, why we hadn't been made aware of this author and his or her work long before this. Well, this isn't one of those books. Not quite.At the time BACKFURROW was published, Eaton was, according to Mencken, \\"...a young man who made a sensation at the University of Michigan, three or four years ago, by denouncing the more preposterous jackasses of the factuly, and calling upon God to save him and his fellows from their pedagogy.\\" This, I'm afraid, will have to do as a biography of Mr. Eaton, as I've had a hard go trying to find much else out about him, save at least one other article (American Mercury, Vol. X, No. 40, 1927) and the odd internet reference, usually concerning turn-of-the-century Midwestern farming life. Which brings us to the work in question: BACKFURROW relates the many trials and tribulations of a young Michigan farmer, one Ralph Dutton. Dutton, the bastard progeny of a very poor dirt farmer's wayward daughter, is a man just clever enough to be at war with himself. He recognizes the Sisyphean existence of his grandparents (who become the only parents he ever knows) and nearly all of the other farmers he comes to know. Very few of them make enough money to keep them in old age, and most die early and horribly. One comes to feel almost as pained for the poor country doctor who travels great distances through all kinds of weather to care for these folk, usually without hope of payment, so that his fate is nearly as bad. Dutton's psychical condition is further traumatized by a failed attempt to live in the big city, Detroit, a place he feels he very much belongs to. When things do not work out and he is forced back to the uncertain, nearly vagabond life of a hired farmhand, he spends the rest of his life measuring every decision against the best road back to the city.With World War I as a distant backdrop, the work on the farms is relentless and unforgiving. The reader quickly comes to sense that Dutton, who is a bit slight for the labor and slow to mature, will not survive it. The descriptions of the often herculean tasks are endlessly noted and in such perfect detail that one cannot escape sharing the bleak tragedy of being caught in such a loop. This is where Eaton succeeds most triumphantly in making, as Mencken tells it, \\"...Dutton's weariness contagious; one feels it as one feels the hot glow of the sun that scorches him. Wrecked in the end, he passes out only half a man, and his wife and children shoulder his burdens.\\"Where, I think, Eaton goes most wrong (aside from the horrendous, nearly unreadable first chapter and an annoying penchant for wrapping common enough words and phrases in quotation marks) is when, near the end, and after painstakingly constructing a trust of some dependable (if not always admirable) character in this simple but steady Ralph Dutton, Eaton has his man stupidly betray his wife and family for a woman we would earlier have felt sworn he would never have considered for such an affair. What part of Dutton the rejection of this country Jezabel does not destroy is left to the ravages of a complete physical and mental breakdown. Aside from that first chapter, Eaton's handling of the affair is easily the clumsiest part of this often very moving work. To be fair, though, it does seem a shame that a book like this should be so long forgotten, but the joys in finding tiny treasures like BACKFURROW makes the hunt worth all the while."},{"Title":"Platinum Vignettes: Pediatrics: Ultra-High Yield Clinical Case Scenarios For USMLE Step 2, 1e","review":"As a future peds resident, I wanted to do well on the peds boards questions and this book was a big help.

Definitely check this series out."},{"Title":"The Myth of Adolescence: Raising Responsible Children in an Irresponsible Society","review":"We live in a world consumed by youth, and the idea of extending youth as long as possible into a person's life. As one writer has pointed out, if we take youth to the extreme limit of 26 years old, and then retirement to the extreme limit of 55 years old, the \\"ideal\\" life supports some 56 years of living on income from 29 years of work --clearly an untenable proposition.Dr. Black takes aim at the lower of these two bounds, showing that not only shouldn't the concept of \\"youth\\" not stretch from birth to 26, it shouldn't even stretch to 18. To reach this conclusion, Dr. Black starts by stating the life of Christ should be our model, and then examining the life of Christ to see what the Scriptures say about the stages God, himself, went through. In the second chapter, the author discusses the invention of the \\"stage,\\" of adolescence, showing how it is based on a view of human life that is founded on a lie.The third chapter considers the letters of John, the Apostle, and how the life of a human is treated in these letters. He shows that John only sees three stages of life: childhood, young adulthood, and adulthood. Along the way he does make some statements that modern readers are going to have trouble accepting; for instance, that marriage at an early age, as young as 14 or 15, really works to control a lot of the sexual promiscuity issues we currently face.In the second part of the book, Dr. Black deals with parenting principles as gleaned from the Scriptures. Here he deals with home schooling, stating that there were no schools int he time of Christ, and how important it is for parents to teach their children, rather than sending them off to a slate of experts hired by the state for their training. He then discusses the \\"age 12 transition\\" as described in the Scriptures specifically, recommending that parents find a way to celebrate the 13th birthday as a movement into adulthood. In the sixth chapter, he discussed the age 30 transition, and it's importance in life --the movement from the exploring years of young adulthood into the full maturity of life well lived. Dr. Black does not advocate a lack of exploration, only that we don't mistake permissiveness for exploration; that exploration does not mean, \\"kids will be kids, so just let them do whatever.\\"In the final section, Dr. Black discusses how you, as a parent, can expect your child to be responsible, and how to work within the confines of our culture to come as close to the Biblical ideal as possible. he wraps up by discussing the issues of courtship and dating; he decries dating as false start that only results in emotional problems, taking on each excuse for allowing children to date and dismantling every one.A well argued look at the stages of life and raising children, although I didn't agree with all the conclusions or statements."},{"Title":"Financial Handbook","review":"Imagine someone without a Harvard education and becoming an attorney via night school co founding Cooper, Lybrand and Ross and then becoming a full professor, coming up with this book.

Seeing the interiors of actual Southwest homes is a huge inspiration when decorating. Filled with many informative photos."},{"Title":"ADOBE! Homes and Interiors: of Taos, Santa Fe and the Southwest","review":"Any architect or serious interior decorator exploring, or deeply into, the southwestern style will not be disappointed with this book. It is filled with hundreds of photos of interior and exterior features, including wide-angle views encompassing entire rooms, showing southwest fine art and artifacts in a domestic context. Don't be surprised that most of the photos are black and white--although there are dozens of color photos too. Instead, appreciate the play of light and shadow that finely crafted adobe structures have at their command. Black and white photos show this in high contrast. But don't let the photos overshadow the text that will provide an education to adobe architects of all levels. Anyone iiving in a true adobe, and wants to follow a classic southwest theme, will find lots of inspiration--and then the hunt will be on to find the kind of indigenous southwest decor seen here."},{"Title":"ADOBE!

Homes and Interiors: of Taos, Santa Fe and the Southwest","review":"I'm in the initial stages of building an adobe house, and this book is the best I've come across so far. The book breaks down into various chapters ranging from fireplaces, to floors, to ceilings, to bathrooms, to living rooms, etc.What really appealed to me is that you can see how different people (including Georgia O'Keefe) incorporated some of these ideas into their homes. The illustrations aren't simply House Beautiful-type photos created by showhouse designers. They illustrate the reality rather than only the ideal.I had so many ideas to convey to my architect that he decided to order it too."},{"Title":"ADOBE! Homes and Interiors: of Taos, Santa Fe and the Southwest","review":"I was expecting a pretty coffee table book about the design styles common to the South West style and what I got was so very much more.The authors cover both the culture and history of the indigenous people who first developed what we now know as the South West style as well as the development and evolution of the style overall. The go into the techniques used in the designing and building and provide detailed descriptions and diagrams showing things such as fireplace designs, tile designs, everything that goes into these buildings. For all the technical details given the book never felt bogged down or in fact overly technical and you can easily go back and forth through out the book to pick out some new detail you missed before without loosing track of where you are in the book.And I loved their use of photographs, most of them are in black and white but that is no detraction since most of them are depicting older houses and designs showing both how the style has evolved and yet have also stayed the same and are just beautiful and fascinating to look at both artistically and from a historical perspective.This is a beautiful and fascinating book that gave me a new appreciation for this style of building and the climate and people who developed it."},{"Title":"ADOBE! Homes and Interiors: of Taos, Santa Fe and the Southwest","review":"This is really a wonderful book.It is more of a history and anatomy of adobe buildings, rather than a coffee-table book full of glossy color photos. There are loads of pictures of course, it's just not that generic coffee-table style.The focus on each aspect of the architecture was especially wonderful, with chapters focusing on windows and shutters, flooring, chimneys, doors, etc... That's why I say this is a book on the anatomy of adobe buildings.I would recommend this title both to long-time adobe aficionados, and to those just beginning to have an interest in this beautiful style."},{"Title":"ADOBE!

It's not as glamorous as many others but it is loaded with detail and design and ideas. Some might make it a coffee table book, but it is really more of a reference work for design ideas when you are working on specifics, like design and style of fireplace. It also surprises the reader with many historic pictures of, almost always, women doing the mud plaster or other aspects of construction. My favorite is the section with specific instructions on how to build one of the typical rounded fireplaces. An excellent book."},{"Title":"ADOBE!

The novel contains a range of human experiences which are woven with beautiful language and keen insight. The reader is reminded of Dickens as the foibles, cruelty, ambition and nobility of the players in the story are developed. The rich writing and examination of issues still of foremost concern (human cruelty, racism, bravery, sacrifice) will entrance the reader of literary fiction, the rich detail and authentic depictions will be of great interest to the armchair historian. While other &quot;modern&quot; books slide into irrelavence in their striving for hip cynacism, this novel boldly looks at the issues that should engaged thinking readers."},{"Title":"The Wolf Pit.","review":"The narrative progresses slowly, Biblical and intense, replenishing itself with great gulps of history and panorama. Youmans writes like the child of Allan Gurganus and Toni Morrison, with Morrison's gift for sentences that carry theme and incident in their sheer craft. And, the use of the \\"ancient tale\\" structure is inspired. Youmans subtitles each chapter as if it were an age-old ballad: \\"Concerning wolves and wolf pits And a fight in the burning wilderness,\\" or \\"Two narrative of loss, Comprising a picnic on the last careless day And a pilgrimage to harvest wands.\\" It's oracular, touching deep wells-springs of storytelling.The Wolf Pit resembles Cold Mountain in its use of landscape to shade its motifs and its occasionally complex &eacute;clat. You may read it for its dark tale and, at the same time, savor its rich prose."},{"Title":"The Wolf Pit.","review":"This is what I would call a 'Dark, dark story of two lives that actually never meet. I would not place it in a \\"historical novel\\" category as the actual historical value was very meager. The story of Robin, the soldier and Agate, the slave girl are actually two diffirent stories altogether and the book never brings them together as I expected. The reason I call it a 'dark' read is simply that despair,tragedy,and total lack of hope fills the pages from beginning to end. The flow between the two main characters is clumsy at best. Mix all that in with mythical characters in and out of the story and you are left thinking that maybe YOU have fallen into a Wolf Pit.The only reason I give this work even three stars is because of the poetic style of the author, not for its' contents."},{"Title":"The Wolf Pit.","review":"\\"The Wolf Pit\\", by Marly Youmans is a beautifully rendered, passionate and poetic account of primarily two individuals and their lives during this country's civil war. One is a mulatto slave woman, the other a soldier for the Confederate Army. Through these two people the author recounts a wide range of familiar events and cruelties that were a part of this conflict. The two never meet with the exception of an intermediary that knows both individuals, the latter are either somewhat aware, or ignorant of the other's existence. Whether you enjoy this novel will largely turn upon how much you enjoy the style of the writing and the presentation.I had trouble engaging this book. Events take place in the past, present, and are recalled through a diary and memories that you will either enjoy or you will not. The principle characters embody every conviction and contradiction the war produced, from the visually apparent mixed parentage of Agate, to the Confederate Soldier Robin who questions the war as he fights it, and as he endures a graphically horrific time both on ship, and as a prisoner of war in Elmira New York. The author lets neither side claim virtue nor purity of motive. Whether events takes place in Virginia or New York, the condemnation of both sides is clear.There are portions of the book that were brilliantly written, a passage about a marble statue and its placement struck me as particularly poignant. However in general the book was a bit too poetic, reflective, and almost mild even as the most horrific acts were described. There is no question the author is a talented writer, the issue is one of her style and how well it works for you."},{"Title":"The Wolf Pit.","review":"This book has 1) lyrical prose, 2) a good rendering of time and place, 3)believeable characters, and 4) obtuse reflections. It does not have a strong narrative thrust. There is no plot as such. Because the last civil war book I read was &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; I was expecting something equally engaging. It didn't happen. The poignancy of wolves and green children was elusive."},{"Title":"Baptism: Its Purpose, Practice and Power","review":"Michael Green offers a cogent, simply explained overview of Christian baptism that includes perspectives from the Catholic, protestant and pentecostal views. This book provides what are the basic underpinnings of the act of water baptism and what pentecostals call the baptism of the Spirit.Green looks at the differing points of view and provides pros and cons for each of them while always supplying the Biblical and traditional applications. Most importantly, Green emphasizes the meaning of baptism--mainly that it is an act indicative of God's act of providing for forgiveness of sins and salvation for people. It recognizes the work of Jesus on the cross on behalf of people and not peoples' work on behalf of Jesus.His objective explanations of differing doctrines are helpful and instructive. He also includes his beliefs regarding baptism. He includes an in-depth discussion on infant baptism and the arguments for and against it. He discusses the idea of being baptized in the Holy Spirit in addition to water baptism and also at the idea of being re-baptized as an adult.As he offers opposing view points, the book is thoughtful and objective. It ultimately provides all of the basics regarding baptism. It is instructive for parents, pastors and any Christians wanting to learn more about baptism for personal reflection or teaching. If you are wanting to make a decision about infant baptism or re-baptism, this is an excellent resource.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Baptism: Its Purpose, Practice and Power","review":"_Baptism: Its Purpose, Practice, and Power_ (1987) is written by British theologian and Anglican priest, Michael Green. The book weighs in at 141 pages and is a very accessible (well written and easily understood at lower literacy levels) introductory text on baptism.Green is inclusive as to his understanding of the meaning of baptism. He summarizes the various meanings that have been applied to baptism throughout church history under three headings or \\"strands:\\" the Catholic strand views baptism as the doorway into the faith community, the church. The Protestant (Baptist) strand views baptism as the witness of the Christian's repentance and faith. The Pentecostal strand views baptism primarily in terms of the experience of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life (pp. 13-14).Though none of these three understandings of baptism is sufficient on its own, together they flesh out the meaning of Christian baptism. Says Green, \\"There is the human side, repentance and faith. There is the churchly side, baptism into the visible family of Christian people. And there is the divine side, forgiveness of sins and reception of the Holy Spirit. All three belong together.\\" (p. 20)Coming from a Reformed perspective, Green understands baptism to be the New Testament analogue to the Old Testament rite of circumcision. Circumcision was the initiation rite whereby persons were admitted to the Old Testament church. Baptism is the initiation rite whereby persons are admitted to the New Testament church. In both eras, circumcision and baptism are the physical marks of belonging to their respective covenants (pp. 25-26; 45). Green relies on Colossians 2.11-12 for this continuity between the two initiation rites.Green asserts that baptism speaks of many different things. It speaks of new birth (John 3.5), of washing (1 Corinthians 6.11), of justification (Romans 6.3), of putting on new clothes (Galatians 3.27), of escape from the dangers of the flood (1 Peter 3.20), of incorporation into Christ (Galatians 3.27), and of a union with Christ in his death and resurrection (Romans 6.3-4). Green concludes, \\"All of this underlines how important baptism is. It cannot be thought of as an optional extra, which is how some modern Christians seem to treat it; nor can it be repudiated altogether, as the Quakers and Salvation Army do.\\" (pp. 48-49)Green rightly points out that what baptism means is quite different from what it does (p. 54). Roman Catholics believe that baptism effects what it signifies. Many Protestants believe that baptism is merely symbolic and does not do anything at all. Green takes a middle-of-the-road approach: baptism does do something, but not necessarily so. He continues:\\"[Baptism] is rather like the marriage service where, after the exchange of vows, the minister pronounces the couple man and wife. That is fair enough, because he knows that the signing of the register will follow in a few minutes, and consummation later on. But if either of these two conditions is missing the couple are not married even though liturgically they have been said to be!...And if, for some reason, such as sudden illness, the consummation does not take place for some time, their marriage could be null and void. But what they would need to do is not to go through the ceremony all over again, but to supply the missing part, consummation!\\"Baptism is very similar. It offers us a wedding certificate to the Lord Jesus Christ, or, if you prefer, an adoption certificate into the Father's household. It can properly therefore be spoken of an effecting what is symbolizes. But it does not do so automatically or unconditionally. We have to repent and believe. And we have to make room in our lives for the Holy Spirit. (pp. 55-56)\\"In addition to the questions of what baptism means and does, there is the question of who it is for. Green presents a cumulative case for the baptism of believers and their children:1. Children were admitted into the Old Testament church.2. The whole family was baptized when proselytes came over into Judaism.3. Whole families were baptized in New Testament days (Acts 11.14; 16.15; 16.33; 1 Corinthians 1.16).4. Jesus accepted and blessed children too young to respond (Mark 10.2-16).5. The church down its history has baptized children.6. Infant baptism stresses the objectivity of the gospel.7. Infant baptism stresses the initiative of God in salvation (pp. 64-77).The final chapters of _Baptism: Its Purpose, Practice, and Power_ are occupied with common objections to infant baptism, the place of confirmation in the church, the issue of re-baptism, and baptism in the Holy Spirit.The baptism debate is a controversial one and Green's book will not bring any finality to the disagreement. It is, however, worth the read, particularly for evangelicals who may have doubts about the common view of baptism as merely symbolic. Green takes a middle-of-the-road approach by ascribing efficacy to Christian baptism but stops short of ascribing an automatic and unconditional efficacy to baptism.A reading of Green's book will give the reader an adequate overview of what's at stake in the baptism debate."},{"Title":"Baptism: Its Purpose, Practice and Power","review":"This book takes a very good, simple look at not only the history of baptism before Christ, but also the practice of it after Christ. It's written from the three main viewpoints of how baptism is used in the various churches, and gives an honest look at the reasons why each view is right and wrong in their ideas of what baptism is. It's an easy read and very informative, and I liked it very much. I am not a person who likes to read non-fiction, but I found this easy to read and follow, and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it no matter what you might or might not believe about baptism."},{"Title":"Brown Paper School book: Book of Think : Or How to Solve a Problem Twice Yo","review":"I just pulled out my copies of this book and The I Hate Mathematics Book! to show to someone.

Some of the exercises are quite simple, some a bit more complex, but all of them make readers consider things from a different point of view, a skill that all too many people in 2008 have utterly lost.After explaining briefly that people often get roadblocks in their brains, or \\"build your own mental walls,\\" and keep bumping into them, this book first sets about proving the point, and then proposes several samples of mental gymnastics to get one's brain \\"unstuck.\\"The second, entitled \\"Looking at what you usually see,\\" challenges ten pretty basic assumptions. It asks readers to try a ten-question quiz, answering each item \\"true\\" or \\"false.\\" Then readers are asked how many answers they were absolutely certain of and how many they guessed. After a week, they're asked to try the same quiz over again. In many more instances than one would imagine, readers answer wrong, and a week later, still get a lot of questions wrong.Similarly, the book instructs readers to \\"watch out for mental blinders,\\" which prevent problem solving just as much as physical blinders prevent peripheral vision for horses. Drawing a line through nine dots in only four strokes, for example, is possible without lifting the pencil off the page---only if one thinks \\"outside the box.\\"Newspapers today are as guilty as school children (and too often, teachers) of insisting that reports may be told only one way. Any news falling outside the lines of \\"acceptability\\" essentially get blocked out. This is the boxiest means---that is to say, the stupidest possible---to cover national and international events in a supposed democracy.By not admitting information from \\"outside their box\\" news media are contributing mightily to the downfall of free thinking.Fortunately, readers still have The Book of Think, and the Internet, to help them evade all those dumb, artificial boundaries."},{"Title":"Brown Paper School book: Book of Think : Or How to Solve a Problem Twice Yo","review":"I still own my old, brown battered copy of this book.

While this may sound like common sense, in the world of ontology and metaphysics, it is not as simple as one might think. This logical proposition, according to Grossmann, works whether one sees existence as a property or attribute, or as the 'ultimate substratum' (this phrase always reminded me of Tillich's 'ground of being' idea). This idea of Grossmann's comes at the end of the book, in the final section 'About the Nature of Existence'.Grossmann was my first metaphysics professor, and I had a course with him the year he was putting the finishing touches on this book with the publisher. The course followed the book fairly closely, so I had the benefit both of reading the text as well as hearing Grossmann's lectures on the subject.The first part of the book is introductory, setting the stage by exploring the nature of ontology and being, the debates between realism vs. idealism (in favour of realism), and a defense of empiricism. While Platonism serves as the root of rationalism, Grossmann's empiricism doesn't allow for universals that are unexemplified -- while he admits that he cannot prove that there are no unexemplified universals, he also states that the case in favour of such is unconvincing.The heart of the book is the section section, on Categories. (This section is 340 of the book's 420 pages.) This Grossmann sees as a contemporary update and continuation of Aristotelian categories. Individuals as entities, properties and their natures, relations, classes, wholes, numbers, and facts are the primary divisions here. Not only does Grossmann explain the metaphysical use of such terms and topics, but also he surveys the field of ontology over the past few generations. Bradley, Russell, Frege, Brentano, Cantor, Husserl and Wittgenstein are just a few of the names drawn into the study.The final section argues strongly about the nature of existence, that it is not just an 'empty sound' applied, but that existence is not merely a property or attribute, either. Even so, 'existence' has an undefinable side; also, there are objects of thought that do not exist, and fictional characters do not exist, according to Grossmann's structure.This is an interesting path through metaphysics and ontology, a subject that once held centre-stage in philosophy, but is now a little off the stage in favour of other topics. Metaphysics remains a valuable study, and Grossmann's work is a good survey."},{"Title":"Relationships: An Open and Honest Guide to Making Bad Relationships Better and Good Relationships Great","review":"Whether you are interested in buidling better friendships, wanting to improve your &quot;Love IQ,&quot; or wanting to know how to break up and stay in one piece, this book will show you how.

This book is the last of 3 in the series. A fun book. I have read it twice."},{"Title":"Bubble Thing (Colors may vary)","review":"The bubble thing promises bubbles the size of a bus. But much depends on the weather and humidity. There is a learning curve to use the the bubble thing. We worked for an hour with kids before showing any good bubbles. None were giant size. But we were at an altitude in the Andes Mountains in very dry air. The directions were clear and would likely have worked in a setting closer to the expectations of the manufacturer. Good product. Patience needed. May not produce the size of bubble hoped for, but still fun."},{"Title":"Bubble Thing (Colors may vary)","review":"So I love blowing bubbles with the kids. I have been looking for a replacement for one that was amazing at blowing huge bubbles that wound up broken last year. This one sort of fits the bill. I can get it to work really well, but my significant other couldn't get it to work for him. Of course my almost two year old wants to try but it is way to big for him.The bubble recipe that comes on the packaging works really well, it is 16 cups water, 2 cups dawn dish soap, and 2 tablespoons Baking POWDER.It is straight forward with instructions on the package, and for 10 bucks worth a shot. Not good for days when there is any wind. But still has a good wow factor when you get the hang of it!"},{"Title":"Bubble Thing (Colors may vary)","review":"On a cloudy day when bubble-blowing is best, I often use this thing. I used to use it even when my kids weren't home, just because such huge bubbles make people happy. Now that I'm a grandma and bought one for my grandchildren, I really enjoy it and so do any adults watching (as do the grandkids, though they are too little to make the bubbles themselves). You can make your own; there are directions on the internet, but this is a really nice toy to have if you love gigantic bubbles. I make my own bubble stuff with Dawn and a bit of glycerin or follow the directions on the product. Their recipe is better than mine, but I lost the package so I'm back to the forementioned."},{"Title":"Bubble Thing (Colors may vary)","review":"I'm over 50 years old and, while visiting my Mother, I started playing with some bubble making toys she had left out for the kids. Bored, I started making some make-shift bubble wands out of coat hangers to see how big a bubble I could make. It was a lot of fun but, because of the bubble solution, I was limited to bubbles of about a foot in diameter. I went on line to try and search out some &quot;secret&quot; bubble solution formulas and was eventually directed to &quot;The Bubble Thing&quot; book. The price was right so I bought it. I did not know at the time that it came with a &quot;Bubble Thing&quot;. My God!...I was making these HUGE bubbles in my living room, four and five feet across before my wife walked in and stopped me. (She's not my boss or anything. I'm the Boss in my home, PERIOD!...I know this because she said I could be!)Anyway, everywhere I go with my &quot;Bubble Thing&quot;, I'm the undisputed center of attention. Kids and Big Kids, like me, go nuts over this thing! It's amazing and incredibly fun. I've had to order two more books so that I don't go without everytime it's &quot;borrowed&quot; by my neighbors and friends...you know, to show their kids. ;)This book is the best ten bucks you'll ever spend!

I've tried it in different wind and temperatures. And followed the directions precisely. But I'm a klutz, I guess.I can see how this will be a giant bag of fun when I learn how to do it. The bubble size potential is quite large.The biggest drawback I can stress, as other reviewers have said, is that there is some technique to this device.

It brings back a summer when my young sons, along with two nephews, explored caves and Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, and I do believe we were at this Natural Tunnel, still being called Virginia's Natural Bridge. He has spent his professional career in the coalfields of Southwest Virginia, though he did receive his degrees in geology at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. This is his first book expanded from one of the many articles he has published in years past.\\"In geologic terminology, a natural tunnel is defined as 'a cave that is nearly horizontal and that is open at both ends. Some contain streams. Natural Tunnel is notable in that, besides a stream, a working railroad passes through it [beside the stream] and a road passes over it. Tunnels are noted for their sheer cliffs, called amphitheaters. Natural Tunnel was operated as a tourist attraction from 1928 to 1967 before becoming a state park.\\" The boys and I sat in the amphitheater under umbrellas as it rained the night we stayed there to watch a marvelous light show with narration from a loud speaker, which was very moving. It is located six miles north of the Virginia/Tennessee border at Bristol.The nearest 'capital road' (US23) traces in part the Old Wilderness Road. \\"Daniel Boone and party, blazing the Wilderness Road to Kentucky in 1775, were likely the first people of European descent to see Natural Tunnel. It is possible Boone may have seen the area even sooner, having passed through as early as 1769.\\" The Blue Ridge Mountains to the southeast cover parts of Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee. Crossing these highlands, the early settlers followed the Wilderness Road to Kentucky where Big Stone Gap is located at the border. There is a spectacular 'modern' tunnel at Cumberland Gap on the Kentucky border at Harrogate, Tennessee.This author traces the history of this area and this natural wonder some 500 million years ago: \\"The rocks Natural Tunnel will form in are deposited in a shallow, warm sea. At this time, the area where the Knox Group was deposited was a great shallow sea, of warm climate, not unlike the modern Caribbean Sea.\\" The strata of Purchase Ridge are assigned to the Knox Group, named for exposure near Knoxville, Tennessee. These rocks are predominately dolostone. One million years ago, the \\"dissolution of the dolostone, concurrent with erosional lowering of the earth's surface, formed the Natural Tunnel.In 1886, this was printed in 'the Railroad Gazette,' \\"the new road, which will make a practical use of the tunnel, will run from Briston, Tenn., to Big Stone Gap, Va., on the Kentucky State Line, a distance of eighty miles about forty miles of it have been graded.\\" The first train to make it throught Natural Tunnel and to Big Stone Gap in 1890 and is pictured on the tracks in front of the white sandstone at the crest of Stone Mountain -- not the noted one in Atlanta, Georgia, where the carvings have been made in recent years. It was on May 15 of that year that the first regularly scheduled passenger train from Bristol passed through this just finished roadbed in the Tunnel. By 1894, the tunnel was an important scenic feature of that route. On May 6, 1939, the passenger train \\"The Lonesome Pine Special\\" made its last run through Natural Tunnel.In 1863, \\"saltpeter is mined in Natural Tunnel and nearby caves by members of the 25th Virginia Regiment for the Confederate war effort. \\"G. Alexander Robertson writes of his interview with General John Salling, the oldest surviving Virginia Civil War veteran (and one of only five alive at the time) in 'National Speleological Society News.' Mr. Salling tells of digging saltpeter, as Mr. Robertson eloquently states, \\"for the Confederacy at the time of the battle of Gettysburg,' in Natural Tunnel as a member of the 25th Virginia Regiment. When I saw it in a display in one of the caves, I think maybe Luray Caverns, but possibly Bowlin Cave locaced half mile from the Tunnel at Natural Bridge, I was told it had been used for gunpowder.Natural Tunnel has probably been in its permanent form for the past 10,000 years. \\"Every year Natural Tunnel gets just a little bit lower, a little bit shorter. It is most assuredly wearing away, and in a million years or so, it will have dissolved and flushed away to the Gulf of Mexico. There the calcium ions will be taken up, once again, by the little critters living there, recycled into shell and bone and then turned over again to become limy sediment, then limestone and dolostone.There are many beautiful color and black-and-white pictures, along with geological charts and maps. This is a marvelous history in words and photos of a marvelous place to see. There is a Natural Bridge off 64W to West Tennessee where a historical event took place, but is nothing compared to this wonder in Virginia."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"I thought this book was a good book. There was a lot of fighting and chasing. The setting was in space on a ship called the Anne Cannon, a planet called Patma and at the beach on Patma. Another action part is when Cody was captured. When he was captured the Skippers took him to their cave where there were more Skippers. When Cody was in the cave he wondered if anybody missed him. Also, he tried to think of a way to escape. Cody missed his mom and dad even though he did not know them very well. The reason why was because they worked all day and night so he did not get to see them very much. Cody calls his parents by their first name instead of mom and dad. Cody never left the ship until he was 12. Also, he does not live on earth. He lived on the ship and at the age of 12 he stepped on earth for the first time. on Patma before any people came there were Skippers and humans killed them and used them for experiments. Now that you know about some of the book you can read it and find out what happens after Cody leaves Patma."},{"Title":"Only Child","review":"I thought this book was a good book but in the beginning it started to drift of the subject but then get back on track. Example when Cody was being kid napped by the skippers and it would talk about his thought. One part that I thought was weird was when how he never left the ship until he was 12. I thought that was a little weird. My favorite part was when Cody got away from the creatures in the beginning. I think this because it had a lot of action in this part. Another part that I liked was when Cody tried to escape and he got no where. I would describe the skippers as big weird monsters and some did not like Cody very much but some did like Cody a lot. These are some reasons why i thought this book was a good book."},{"Title":"Time of Change","review":"Instant Analysis - what an oxymoron. This work by Roy Medvedev the semi-dissident who was ousted from his leadership role in the party, deals with the first part of the collapse of the Soviet state. The book's problems have to do with time - the author should have waited to have seen how it was going to turn out. He stopped in 1989 just as the independence movement for the various &quot;states&quot; in the USSR were gaining ascendancy.The book suffers from not enough data. The KGB files had not yet been opened and the wealth of information contained in them would be enought for 20 books. At the time of the story, the coup against Gorbachev, the rise of Yeltsin and the onslaught by the Russian Mafia had yet to occur. The author provides a lot of &quot;inside&quot; information, much of it the dreary, boring chatter interesting only to those who care about what men at the top of the ladder said.The book is not ideological at all. One gets the idea that the author prefers a Western European socialism with a touch of Russian authoritarianism. This is not a denunciation of the pathetic outcome of Socialism or praise of the market system. It is, instead, concerned with who said what, the approaching new state and its structure, a look at the horrible conditions within the country before the collapse...a lot of data that needs some structure and organization.The writing is pedantic as Stalinist architecture. This is not worth your time."},{"Title":"All my children","review":"This book was authored by a cult leader in the 70s who thought she was pioneering a new form of therapy to treat schizophrenic patients. The content of the book can be graphic, disturbing, and readers beware, these techniques are more harmful than helpful. Reparenting is practiced by some therapists today, but in different forms. If I had the option of 0 stars, that would be my rating."},{"Title":"All my children","review":"My psychotherapist, a certified Transactional Analyst, did a great deal of training with Ms Schiff, working alongside her on the treatment of psychotic patients. He reports her methodology worked wonderfully and she got many people suffering from schizophrenia cured, including two of her adopted children.She had a very humane approach called \\"reparenting\\" which was by no means purely verbal because, according to neuropsychology, folks suffering from certain mental disorders are in need of basic skin-to-skin-mother-to-child like affection, which has not been adecquately provided to them by first infancy time, so they get a chance to fulfill that blank. This, of course, is just a part of the whole therapy, which is described in more detail in the book.Very useful at a time when, highly influenced by certain industries and commercial interests, psychiatrists and other professionals are more likely to say it has no cure."},{"Title":"All my children","review":"Jaqui Schiff innovated an effective therapy that actually provided cure for what most of the medical/psychological establishment considers incurable. That alone would incite disparagement from commercial interests whose livelihood depends on treating and medicating, rather than addressing causality. I trained in the reparenting methods she innovated and can attest to their validity and effectiveness. What was her secret? she listened to what her clients were saying, responded to what was legitimately a cry for help and learned what they needed. I met and trained with Arron and found him to be not only healthier than most therapists, but quite intelligent, as well. To denegrate Schiff and her methods as cultish is pure prejudice, without any semblance of truthful information."},{"Title":"Find Me a Villain","review":"Some crime writers are just too understated for readers keen on continuous blood, gore and action - Patricia Highsmith comes to mind, a writer with whom this author has been (inaccurately) compared. This is the only Margaret Yorke book I've read, and I just don't get the purpose of it.The book centers around Nina, a passive, restrained Englishwoman of small horizons - just the kind of person who might read this book, in fact. Stunned by her husband's desertion of her for the predatory and pregnant &quot;Miss Kitty-Cat&quot;, Nina accepts a house-sitting job at an obligatorily creepy English Manor house. She gets anonymous phone calls, suspects someone of some murders that are happening at the time, discovers a family secret, sees an accidental death - and that's it.Margaret Yorke writes well, and makes us understand her characters, despite a plot so bland it just passed me by - she has written heaps of books, so maybe this one is just an aberration. There's none of the intricate detail and plotting of PD James, but if you want a gentle and genteel female self-discovery book with just a hint of murder in the background, then you might enjoy this. But if you want suspense and excitement, read elsewhere."},{"Title":"Black Diamond","review":"This is not the historical/modern romance writer Joan Wolf!

A great read, hard to put dowh until you find out how she catches the bad guy."},{"Title":"Black Diamond","review":"In Black Diamond, I found it fascinating that the author was able to show that corruption -- police and crime -- in a distant city such as Los Angeles can easily be imported to even distant semi-rural areas, and then like a cancer, begin also to grow there. And that murder, for whatever reason, knows no regional boundaries. This book shows it all."},{"Title":"The Mysterious Traveler","review":"The Mysterious Traveler had always been one of my favorite radio programs, although it was bounced around the Mutual Network continually-time and day wise. This collection of stories on tape has some of the most exciting stories--especially &quot;Behind Locked Doors&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Went Back in Time to Save Lincoln&quot;, and &quot;The Last Survivor&quot;. However, there are one or two stories that I feel were inappropriate for the Mysterious Traveler.What I like best about the series is the acting. Some of the greatest voices on radio are heard, and the atmosphere created by Maurice Tarplin, playing the title role will indeed &quot;thrill you a little and chill you a litte&quot;.I heartily recommend this collection to any old time radio buff and/or lover of good mystery and (often creepy) stories on tape."},{"Title":"No Time to Wave Goodbye","review":"Images of Guernica burning in their minds, recalling the Zeppelin and Gotha raids of World War One, the authorities in Britain in 1938 plotted the most massive transhumance of humanity ever conceived. To their credit, within 72 hours of Neville Chamberlain's announcement that the UK was at war with Germany, some three and a half million vulnerable non-combatants - mainly children under 13 years of age - were evacuated from the cities of Britain to \\"safe\\" rural locations.They came from Tyneside, from Teeside, from Merseyside, and of course from Thameside. From teeming slums, from elegant Georgian townhouses, from leafy suburbs, from upper or middle-class families, or from underemployed or unemployed working class homes.Ben Wicks chronicles this unprecedented event. Following the planning process, from as early as 1924, he narrates the steps, the fears, the analyses that led inexorably to the decision to shred whole families to pieces, to commit to the charity of strangers the care of Britain's future, Britains youth.The history of human social development is the history of the perpetual conflict between an agrarian lifestyle, and the life of city dwellers. The evacuation of more than 3,500,000 city folks to rural communities in the Great Britain of 1939 is but one more chapter in this history. But it is a poignant chapter. Three million displaced persons is a statistic; one such is a tragedy. Mr Wicks delves beneath the statistics to expose the tragedies, but also the triumphs. From interview to interview with the displaced children, we slowly piece together a picture of a Britain slowly shrugging off the class consciousness of the \`20s, gradually emerging from the prudery of Victoriana, and preparing itself to meet and overcome the ultimate challenge of Nazi Germany.If I had to make any criticism of this book it would be its brevity. Yes, the author had to pick and choose between thousands of personal accounts. Yes, some editing was essential. But the story of over two million children ripped from the bosom of their families demands to be told. Mr Wicks has exposed the tip of the iceberg. The other ninety percent remains, still, hidden."},{"Title":"No Time to Wave Goodbye","review":"Few who read the book or saw the film of Mitchard's first novel, The Deep End Of The Ocean, have forgotten it. Not only was the book a blockbuster hit and Oprah's first book selection, but the harrowing story of a kidnaped child resonated in the hearts of millions. We wept and then rejoiced when Beth Cappadora's son, Ben, was returned at the age of 12.However, the ordeal not only had a devastating effect upon the family but left Ben a bit at sea, no longer quite feeling as if he were a true Cappadora with an older brother, Vincent, and a sister, Kerry. In fact, as we learn in this eagerly awaited sequel Ben insists upon being called Sam, the name the kidnaper gave him. There have been recriminations in the family, tensions, of course, yet all seems to be well now that the children are grown. Ben is married and has a baby daughter, Stella; Vincent is an aspiring film maker; Kerry studies to be an opera singer.Vincent does succeed in having a film produced, not only produced but it is nominated for an Academy Award. The subject of the film, five families who suffer from never knowing what has happened to their abducted children, has affected Beth most deeply as she continues to feel guilty for not taking better care of Ben on the day he was taken. Nonetheless, the family comes together to go to the Academy Awards ceremony, happy for Vincent's success. Their joy is short lived when Ben's baby girl is abducted, a heinous crime its horror is increased by memories of the past.One often wonders if sequels are a good idea, especially when following an over the top success. For this reader/listener Mitchard more than stepped up to the challenge.Film and television actress Susan Denaker delivers an able reading as she voices characters who are by turns tentative, quarrelsome, loving, angst ridden, hopeful.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"D. Newell Williams was a professor of church history at my seminary prior to heading off to Brite Divinity School to assume the leadership there. That academic administrators are failed scholars is not a charge that could be leveled against Williams, and this book is primary evidence to that. Williams is a scholar of insight and precision, developing his subject thoroughly, carefully, and with great clarity.Barton Stone is a figure of great importance in the history of Christianity in America (a subject of great importance in the history of America, one that tends to get lost in the early education of many students in the public school systems who still shy away from incorporating anything that smacks of religiosity for fear of violating the church/state split). It is remarkable that volumes on Stone are few and far between. The influence of the early Presbyterians and the off-shoots on the overall religious ethos of America can be seen across many denominations never directly in communion or administrative relationship with them.Stone and his ministerial colleagues looked to a great revival, something that often inspires dread in established denominational hierarchies. Dissolving formal alliances with the Presbyterians and avoiding any descriptive terms save \`Christian', Stone's path eventually led to a community with the followers of Alexander Campbell, becoming by the time of the Civil War the fifth largest Christian group in America. Inspired both by the greater spirit of liberty developing out of the aftermath of a successful war for independence and the expansion into new territories in the West, and the experience at Cane Ridge, America's Pentecost. Stone rejected the doctrine of predestination (which in many ways violated the sense of freedom so present in the young American republic), and yet Williams' main thesis is that there was no influence greater in Stone's development than his Presbyterian spirituality.The development of the book follows the general pattern of Barton Stone's life. In the first part, Williams explores the family and social background of Stone, as well as his training and call to be a minister. Williams points out that Stone was not an untrained minister (as has been reported by other historians), but rather had significant training and education that included the standard ministerial training in biblical languages and topics. Williams gives an interesting account of Stone's pre-ordination struggles with reconciling himself to the doctrines of the Confession of Faith, including his search through scriptures and reason for consistency, and Stone's eventual qualified response when asked at his ordination if he could receive and adopt the Confession of Faith: \`I do, as far as I see it consistent with the word of God.'The second part gives attention to the Great Revival in considerable detail. Stone's experience led to conflicts and eventual separation, but this was not without great struggle and conversation. Stone's respect for many who were opposing him (David Rice, whose arguments that any departure from a fairly strict Calvinism would eventually lead to atheism which did not ultimately persuade Stone, is one such example) is apparent in Stone's own writing. Williams' explanation of the proceedings gives good insight into the way church organisations worked (and, in many ways, continue to work) in American society.The three final sections all deal with the growth of the Christian church, first into an informal formality, then in union with the Campbellite Disciples as well as other groups such as the Separate Baptists, and finally as a group at action in the world for social progress. Part of the discussion for union took place in a way reminiscent of modern wrangling between nations without formal diplomatic relations - articles in periodicals, often penned by people other than the major players, made statements and set tone for the process of union. The formal denominational structure of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) did not take place until much later in the 1960s - until then, they remained a movement; before and after there remains a part of the spirit that wishes to \`sink into union with the Body of Christ at large'.Williams' writing is clear, engaging, interesting and informative. This is a good text for students of religious history, for seminarians of any denominational stamp, and for general readers who wish for insights into early American personalities."},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"In Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography, Newell Williams (Christian Theological Seminary) takes great pains to paint a coherent well-balanced biographical picture of Barton Stone, one of the founders of the movement that would come to be called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Williams opens this book with the statement, \\"...genuine Christian faith could only be the result of a miraculous or extraordinary experience of the Holy Spirit.\\" It is very much through the filter of this experience that we learn about Barton Stone. Williams presents us with a Stone that is a vigorous advocate of Christian Unity; in 1832 he worked to unite the Christians with Alexander Campbell's followers known as the Reformers or Disciples. By 1860, this group numbering nearly 200,000 became the fifth largest religious group in the United States; they did not, however, organize as a denomination until the 1960's. On the issue of unity some of the difficulties of Stone's theology come through. His ideas on this issue (and many others) are puzzling. Williams works a great deal to clarify these aspects of Stone's theology and weave them into an easy to understand tapestry. In addition to focusing on Stones deep spirituality and proclivity for Christian unity, Williams shows his humanity in pointing out his frustration at the churches of his time because their apathy on the issue of unity and another issue that was central to Stone's theology, emancipation. The author spends a great deal of time focusing on this issue. Stone believed that slavery had no place in the Christian church and that it was a hindrance to both unity and the Second Coming of Christ. He wrote and preached a great deal on this issue and supported a colonization scheme for moving former slaves to offshore colonies; later he supported immediate abolition. While the author speaks of his subject's many contributions Christianity in America, he speaks little of the work of Alexander Campbell other than to mention in passing on a number of occasions some difficulties he had with Stone's theology. The author also fails to paint an accurate picture of the true unification process between Christians and Disciples. As I understand it, this union happened in local towns one congregation at a time. Stone and Campbell themselves never really seem to have united on all issues. In focusing on the spirituality of Stone, we learn little of his large ego; a trait that many scholars have attributed to both he and Campbell. Many have also sited this trait as one of the hindrances of unification. In conclusion, little has been written on Stone for the past forty years; this much needed updated biography gives us what in my opinion it yet the best balanced view of its subject. Stone is painted as a complex reformer, alive during the last great Christian revival, dedicated to unity, and integrity within Christ's church. While this book is academic in nature, it is also well written enough that even the casual reader will enjoy it. Students of the Stone-Campbellite movement will also be well served by this balanced historical resource."},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"&quot;In Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography, Newell Williams has given us the most thorough and clearly articulated description of Stone's theology ever produced. Williams provides a coherent overview of Stone's beliefs, placing his sometimes puzzling theological ideas into a context that makes sense. While highlighting Stone's deep spirituality with his focus on Christian union and practical Christianity, the author shows Stone's humanity in his frustration with the churches for their apathy toward emancipation and Christian unity. Douglas A. Foster, Abilene Christian University &quot;Williams gives us the first critical analysis of Barton Stone's contribution to the Stone-Campbell movement. We find that Stone took his theological reasoning very seriously. More important is the way Williams demonstrates how Stone combined consistent reasoning with a thorough understanding of the importance of the experience of God. Through the lens of Stone's struggle with the meaning of salvation, Williams offers a story about the spirituality of early Disciples. Through this spiritual biography of Stone, we are reminded anew that Christ changed how human beings relate to God, not how God relates to human beings.&quot; Mark G. Toulouse, Brite Divinity School&quot;This updated biography of Barton Stone (the first in over forty years) displays the full breadth and depth of the 'faith seeking understanding' that animated this early nineteenth-century reformer. Stone emerges here as a complex personality on a lifelong quest to discern and articulate the meaning of the Christian gospel amid the social, cultural, and theological turmoil of his times. Of special interest to ministers and laity will be Stone's conviction that faithfulness unites spiritual vitality, intellectual integrity, and moral commitment. James O. Duke, Brite Divinity School"},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"D. Newell Williams takes a fresh, compassionate look at the contributions of Barton Stone to the first generation of the American Restoration movement. This movement was born and bred on the first new American Frontier of Kentucky,Ohio,Indiana and Illinois in the years that followed the birth of the U.S.A.The biography looks at Barton Stone's spiritual journey and struggle to unify the new American church into a coherent and practical theology. I pleasantly responded to Williams search for the spirituality of one of the great frontier evangelists.This book is worth a read from anyone seeking to understand the history of the protestant faith and its impact on the frontier mind."},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"A great read in Stone-Campbell history. It charted the conflict and confusion that the restoration leaders went through in discovering truth. Sometimes, I think that people in the church believe that thousands of people simply read the Bible a few times and agreed on every point of doctrine. This is certainly not the truth. The search for truth is difficult, taxing, and rewarding. There was significant debate concerning baptism, atonement of Christ, and even the divinity of Jesus. This book helps us to never forget that conflict and disagreement will accompany the pursuit of truth."},{"Title":"Barton Stone: A Spiritual Biography","review":"I read this book a few days ago just because I thought it would be interisting.

According to the sleeve, the British Medical Journal says \\"This book has now reached an ideal length for the psychiatrist in training or in hospital practice. It is likely to be the accepted textbook in this country for some time to come.\\" Sargant was popular in America too. The American Digest of Neurology and Psychiatry states that \\"This book continues to be a superior, up-to-date guide and undoubtedly the most practical one available.\\"Brief mention is made of the electric wire brush and the faradic battery. However, Sargant doesn't seem to have been a fan of these. He goes for electric shock therapy, insulin coma treatment, barbiturates, tranquillizers and the lobotomy.The lobotomy sounds like a wonderful, multi-purpose treatment. Sargant recommends it for anorexia, asthma, high blood pressure and also as treatment for housewives, as illustrated from this extract on page 105: \\"A depressed woman may owe her illness to a psychopathic husband who cannot change and will not accept treatment. We have seen patients enabled by a leucotomy (Sargant's word for lobotomy) to return to the difficult environment and cope with it in a way which would hitherto have been impossible.\\" The drugs such as chlorpromazine that Sargant imposed on his patients had unpleasant side-effects which Sargant makes no mention of. Some patients weren't happy to take them, but Sargant had the answer for this: \\"Polonio has pointed out that one of the great uses of leucotomy in such patients is the change in attitude towards co-operativeness which it brings. After operation these paranoid patients are much more amenable to taking maintenance drug therapy, and are much more willing to continue under follow-up care, so that for the first time they can be kept under control outside hospital.\\"Given the remarkable success of the lobotomy I was surprised that Sargant bothered with insulin coma treatment, especially as a side effect from this was death. He states that he had only killed five people with this treatment and that they had died from bowel disorders.At one point he switches from psychiatrist to 'spychiatrist' when discussing sodium amytal. He says it works by damping down patient resistance. But, he says, the patient should be given reassurance in order for him to provide \\"further disclosures. It is unlikely the patient will reveal vital secrets unless he is prepared to do so. 'Beating up' the patient will defeat its own ends.\\"Sargant devotes a chapter to treatment of mental illness in children and teenagers. He recommends intravenous Valium for \\"acutely anxiophobic adolescents\\". For the \\"hypokinetic\\" kids it's 5mg doses of amphetamine sulphate.Treatment for homosexuality is also covered. However, a warning is issued with regard to lobotomies in this area: \\"The man with homosexual tendencies, held under control by associated feelings of guilt and anxiety, may be freed of these safeguards without losing his innate homosexual tendencies.\\" This book was published in 1972, by the way. Reflecting on the changing times, Sargant says: \\"Our society is more permissive than it used to be to deviants and rebels. And, for example, as homosexuality becomes a socially acceptable sexual orientation, the need for treatment can be expected to grow less.\\" Sargant's treatment was upto 15mg a day of an endocrine, Stilboestrol, to destroy the homosexual's libido.Sargant seems to have got his inspiration from the experiments of Pavlov, e.g. his researches into the effects of castration of dogs. \\"Careful experiments on animals showed significant emotional changes can be produced with little adverse alteration on other aspects of behaviour.\\" He cites the 1937 research of James Papez: \\"In monkeys it was found that electrical stimulation of anterior area 24 led to pupilliary, respiratory and cardio-vascular responses; and lesions in this region produced tamer, less fearful and less aggressive animals.\\" Sargant doesn't question why a wild animal might become fearful and aggressive when placed in a laboratory cage.His other inspiration seems to have been the bible. Page 246: \\"The old psychiatric and religious literature is full of reports of success from purges, starvation and other debilitating procedures.\\" Page 288: \\"Religious teaching and inspiration have transformed many neurotics and psychopaths from burdens on their families into benefactors of mankind.\\" He also refers, in the chapter on barbiturates, to the \\"naive savage\\" who believes in \\"primitive religions\\".Sargant seems very excited about the developments in psychiatry; \\"Up to recent times, some psychiatrists appeared to believe that they needed only two weapons in their armamentarium, psychotherapy and the electric shock box.\\" He dismisses psychotherapy as being only of merit for \\"normal people, or for those who are only mildly ill.\\" He states that physical treatment should be given without delay as failure to do so causes scarring on the brain. If the slate is wiped clean then the patient is left in a more impressionable state than before, and lobotomy should not be delayed to the point where \\"disintegration of the personality has set in\\". In the old days, women were burnt at the stake, but in the 20th century, for \\"hysterical, middle aged women\\" the modern inquisition, as prescribed by Sargant, calls for \\"long courses of modified narcosis, electoconvulsive therapy and anti-depressants\\" for such women. At the end of the book, Sargant states that \\"We are not the sole arbiters on the designing of a brave new world. It is our function as doctors to provide the health with which it may be fought for and enjoyed when won.\\"The bibliography contains research papers such as \\"Changes in the brain after electrically induced convulsion in cats\\", \\"Hemispherectomy in the treatment of infantile hemiplegia\\", \\"Measurement of anxiety by forearm blood flow\\" and \\"A follow-up study of patients treated by thalamotomy and by combined frontal and thalamic lesions\\".Sargant's idea of a brave new world is one where people know their place. \\"No-one can become more intelligent than his genetic equipment allows ... Heredity sets an upper limit to our powers and achievements ... One may doubt whether the best directed education could make a child who was naturally thick-skinned and cold-blooded into a sensitive and warm-hearted man, and the practical aim should be to induce him to modify the actual expression of his selfish impulses.\\"On the basis of this book, it seems that Sargant's \\"genetic equipment\\" was very poor. It's a shame that no-one modified his apparent \\"cold blooded selfish impulses\\"."},{"Title":"Southern Garden Advisor","review":"When I was struggling to select plants for my garden in my new home, this book helped me to understand plants appropriate for my area, times to plant them, and many other helpful hints.

A bright yellow row of jonquils blooms against a beautiful sage background. The name of the book, GUTSY LITTLE FLOWERS, is based on Cathy's admiration of these hardy plants, which burst into color even while the season of winter remains.Cathy writes, \\"Beneath the frozen ground the sleeping bulb stirs, bursts open, and a tiny green shoot fights its way toward the surface of the cold earth...This brave little flower stands as a precious reminder of spring amid a world weary of the gloom of winter.\\"The book is composed of over two dozen stories that delight the soul. Cathy's gift of writing shows in her knack for discovering deep, spiritual truths in seemingly ordinary events. You'll laugh out loud reading \\"Attack of the Killer Flypaper\\" and \\"One Hairy Dog and Two Crispy Biscuits.\\" And if you or anyone you know has been through a harrowing mammogram experience, you won't want to miss the author's descriptive account.I'd recommend this book as a wonderful gift to anyone on your list who loves good storytelling. I must add that Cathy Lee Phillips is also a warm and inspiring speaker. She spoke at our church, as well as my sister's, and gave completely different talks that had everybody laughing. She's so funny! Yet, she knows how to share truth that cuts right to the heart.You'll want to add her first book, SILVER IN THE SLOP, to your reading list as well.

It starts from the growth of civilization and ends into the 1990's. It charts the rise and decline of major civilizations and focuses on major conflicts of world history. The actual maps are well illustrated and generally easy to understand. The paperback version is easy to handle with only around a 100 pages. There is a good index at the back and the contents are also clear. A few of the maps are complicated and require quite a bit of concentration to grasp. Another thing lacking is explanatory notes which would have really increased the usefulness of the map. Despite these, I believe the atlas should be part of the library of any school/college history deparment and any individual with an interest in world history."},{"Title":"Soul Flame","review":"There is never a dull moment in \\"Soul Flame,\\" the story of Selene, adopted daughter of a healer woman who herself becomes a healer and dedicates herself to furthering the healing arts. Selene is also dedicated to unravelling the mystery of her true identity and discovering her destiny. At sixteen, she falls in love with the handsome Greek physician Andreas but... well that would be telling. This book ranges across many of the key locations of early civilization, and Ms. Wood's prodigious research serves the reader well. In addition to lore on early medicine and herbal cures we are treated to glimpses of exotic early cultures. Leanly written, densely plotted and full of fascinating characters, \\"Soul Flame\\" never disappoints. If you are like me, you will be hungering for a sequel when you reach the last page. Let's get this book back into print, and -- Ms. Wood, are you listening? -- let's get started on the sequel. A terrific read!"},{"Title":"Soul Flame","review":"The 400+ page saga of Barbara Wood's heroine, Selene, begins with a mysterious birth in the ancient city of Antioch durng the time of the first Caesars of the Roman Empire. Two fugitives, a well-to-do Roman and his in-labor wife, appear on the doorstep of the healing woman, Mera who performs a hasty midwifery minutes before Roman soldiers appear, kill the new father and haul away his wife and baby son. Unbeknownst to them, Mera, hidden in a grain container, has saved the baby daughter and at the bequest of the dying Roman, rears the child, Selene, as her own, teaching her the art of healing while keeping the Roman's ring and the key to Selene's true heritage secreted within an alabaster rose pendant.As Selene grows into a lovely young woman, Mera's training brings to fruition a competent compassionate healer with a special gift for the medical arts and a curiosity to discover and gather the medical lores and practices of many cultures both familiar and foreign. Her natural inquisitiveness is piqued during a freak accident in the Antioch streets: a donkey driver, hit by the legs of a kicking animal, lies with a head wound in the street. When Selene compels a Greek doctor, Andreas, to treat the wound, she falls helplessly in love with him and together they decide to pool their learning and dedicate their lives to promoting the ancient art of healing while simultaneously alieviating the suffering of the sick. But as such stories usually go, fate intervenes and Selene and Andreas are separated by misunderstanding fueled by outside factors. And as Selene attempts to be reunited with her beloved and find out the secret of her ancestry, she undergoes trials and tribulations that promote her understanding of herself and the human condition.As with many of her other novels, Barbara Wood uses her own medical knowledge to augment an already interesting story of a young girls advent into womanhood and her quest for self identity. An ample sprinkling of word derivations, herb lore and little known facts about the Roman Empire and its customs which have have germinated into today's traditions, keeps the reader turning the pages intent on discovery Selene's next path and garnering enough information about the ancient world to win the next Trivial Pursuit match.Many of the turns the novel takes regarding Selene's medical development are predictable. Selene's singlemindedness does not endow her character with much motivation other than to create a clean hospital environment for her future patients. In fact, much of the character motivation is merely brushed upon, relying on a few paragraphs of information to provide emotional background for characters about which I would have prefered drawing conclusions based on actions rather than narration.The quest for Selene's parentage however is not only predictable---not in terms of whom her parents turn out to be---but in the convenient way the author presents the denouement to this aspect of the novel and Selene's rather immature reaction. Even Selene, as dedicated to her vocation as she was, could not have been this naive as a grown woman. More disappointing was Selene's &quot;reunion&quot; with her twin brother--a rushed scene that sadly takes place within the last 20 pages of a novel that could have afforded at least 100 pages on this very important secondary plot idea. Most horrendous was the incompete tale of Selene's daughter, who leaves Rome to find her own heritage and to whose end, the reader is left without a clue.The pace of the story hurtles like a snowball gathering momentum downhill. At first, it is just right, but as the novel nears its end, the revelations and happenstances fly by like scenery observed from the window of a high-speed train.That being said, I still award the story 4 stars for its immense ability to entertain on a very readable level. The reader is never bogged down with excrutiating detail, however I will admit to skipping passages of the character's self-musing simply because I had already gotten the point and didn't need to read every nuance of Selene's painstaking thought development. Recommended to anyone who wants to be entertained by a master storyteller."},{"Title":"Soul Flame","review":"I have fallen away from reading over the past several years, and I picked up a copy of this book in a bin at the supermarket... and sitting down to read it had no idea what to expect.

I never knew the Egyptians were the first to have a surgery for cataracts and diabetes or that Hecates Cure, used in small doses in tea, was used in the reduction of fever. I never knew that the upper classes had lead poisoning from the pipes where they got their water, which made it difficult to bear children. I liked the historical tie linking Selene and her brother Pindar to the Emperor Claudius and his family through Caesar and Cleopatra's son Cesarion, her father. Being a healer woman made it easier for her in captivity. It surprised me that the Grand Vizier let Selene and Wulf escape when he had planned to make her his wife. The scene where Selene and Wulf had made love was tastefully done too. I would definitely read this book again.

I picked it up since I was teaching on running away. Before I read the book a mere week before the retreat I had formed a conclusion based on study that the way to stop running away from God, problems, people, was to learn to walk by faith and then to stand (Ephesian 6). But Watchman Nee's brilliant little (only 67 pages) book on Ephesians had me adding in sitting as the critical foundation of it all.For those of you not familiar with Nee (1903-1972), he is one of the leaders of the indigenous church in China independent of foreign misionary organizations. He was also a prolific writer. He was arrested in 1952 and imprisoned for his faith until his death in 1972.Two excerpts to whet your appetite:\\"Only those who can sit can stand. Our power for standing, as for walking, lies first in our having first been made to sit together with Christ. The Christian's walk and warfare alike derive their strength from his position there. If he is not sitting before God he cannot hope to stand before the enemy.\\" (pg. 44)\\"God never asks us to do anything we can do. He asks us to live a life which we can never live and to do a work which we can never do. Yet, by his grace, we are living it and doing it. The life we life is the life of Christ lived in the power of God, and the work we do isteh work of Christ carried on through us by his Spirit whom we obey.\\" (pg. 58)You'll be able top read this book in one sitting...but you'll want to savor it."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"I am impressed with the depth of Mr. Nee's insight into the Christian life, warfare and in his breaking down of scripture into both deep and easily understood.

Before, most of us can accomplish the first step of \\"Sit\\", as he discusses it, we must first spend significant time seeking the truth in knowledge and wisdom, both spiritual and human. Otherwise, we would be in danger of becoming another idiot utterly convinced of their worldview when it is built on the Food Network, attending Church on holidays, and the Twilight series as literature. If I am already a well-read, learned and pious person, then this book is useful. If I am the average person, it offers me a construction project that is missing most of the building materials."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Sit, Walk, Stand is based on the three key words which divide the book of Ephesians into its basic sections. Our position in Christ is one of sitting, our life in the world is one of walking and our attitude toward Satan is one of standing. The Christian's entire life is to be founded and lived out from the finished work of Jesus. In it's 78 pages the book concisely sums up a massive amount of Biblical theology and applies it to the believer's every day life. Watchman Nee takes the grand theological treatise of Ephesians and breaks it down into simple, memorable and practical statements. \\"Christianity begins not with the big DO, but with a big DONE\\" (pg. 14). \\"The all important rule is not to \\"try\\" but to \\"trust,\\" not to depend upon our own strength but upon His\\" (pg. 38). \\"Our task is one of holding, not of attacking. We do not fight for victory, we fight from victory\\" (pg. 55). This is only a sampling of many profound statements, which have launched hundreds of sermons. The spiritual truths outlined in Sit, Walk, Stand are simple but profound, critical but often forgotten. The book is a great source for reminding us of these truths. Most of the works of Watchman Nee are wonderful. I recommend the novice to his writings start with this one. It is easy and quick to read yet covers the key understandings further explained in his larger volumes."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This book is great! The more you read the more information you attain. Watchmen Nee does and excellent job defining the threefold division of Ephesians. He emphasizes that first we must sit and find out just where we are with Christ. Next he explains that we must then walk with the integrity of our Lord. Finally Mr. Nee discusses the importance of standing your ground against the wiles of Satan. This book is a must have; It's easy to read, pocket-sized and it abounds with spiritual treasures essential to your relationship with Christ."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Watchman Nee has been inspiring Christians all over the world for many decades. His Asian worldview informs his Christianity in such a way that he brings a completely different understanding that is refreshing to Western readers able to follow what he writes.In &quot;Sit, Walk, Stand,&quot; Nee tackles the book of Ephesians discussing the Christian's placement in Christ. First, he notes how a Christian must start his journey with Christ by sitting--resting alongside the Savior who has done all the work. And because Christ has done all the work, the Christian is given the peace of knowing there is nothing he or she can add. Walking comes from being seated as the Christian merely lives out the Christian life by claiming his place seated alongside Christ. Our ministry comes via the finished work. And lastly, in standing, the Christian holds the territory Christ has taken from Satan by calling on the name of Jesus and living out Christ's triumph.As with all Nee works, the outright simplicity and wisdom of his writing cuts to the soul and spirit. For those who struggle in their Christian journey, the author's words come as a joyful balm since he shows how we can stop trying to do it all by ourselves and let Christ rule.With so much packed into such a short book, this is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to find peace in Christ while living out a more vital existence. A must read and truly worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This book has changed my life entirely. It is very thorough, and is entirely supported by scriptural reference. It allows one to enjoy the mercy of God, and rest in the salvation, bought for us, by Jesus Christ. This book makes one desire to reconstruct the personal methods of dealing with everyday life. It gives step by step instructions on how to live an easier, happier Christian life. It also, at the same time, gives inner peace, confidence and strength, through the teachings in the Bible. It is a great resource for those interested in personal spiritual growth. Watchman Nee was a prolific writer and led a inspirational life. He has a truly unique writing style. His work is both thorough and easy to understand. It is truly a book for the new and experienced Christian alike. This book is rather short, and rather cheap. It is a definite must-have!"},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Ever since I was a child, I'd heard about Watchman Nee and his wonderful writings. It wasn't until my adult years that I finally ordered three of his books - and I haven't been disappointed. Sit, Walk, Stand is a very simple, yet deeply profound explanation of the Book of Ephesians. The book is an easy read and short - only 78 pages long - but don't let that fool you - Sit, Walk, Stand has more packed into these 78 pages than most books over 300 pages (and it takes 1/10 the time to read!).If you want a book that will give you a wonderful explanation of the Christian life - that will bring to life the Book of Ephesians - then get this simple and profound book. Every college student should have one of these in their backpack, it makes a great gift to a friend - you can even mail this little booklet to a friend far away.My version is published by Tyndale House Publishers and I ordered it online for $5.00. I would think that a mature junior high student would be able to read and understand this book. On a difficulty scale from 1 - 10, Sit, Walk, Stand is about a 3 or 4. Simple...yet profound."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"A hidden gem. Within fewer than 80 pages, Nee lays out in simple terms some of the most profound truths of the Christian life from the book of Ephesians. It will inspire and challenge both new and mature believer alike."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Such a beautiful book! Essentially a study in Ephesians, Nee transforms three of the most common words in any language into a powerful encapsulation of the believer's experience in Christ Jesus. It's all grace, from beginning to end. Our salvation, our ministry, our spiritual warfare - all rest on Christ's finished work on the cross. One reading is enough to utterly convince, and change your perspective forever, but you'll not read it just once. You'll never look at Ephesians the same way again, either! Nee's little book will have you turning to Ephesians the rest of your life as your first stop in times of spiritual turmoil. Sit, walk, stand - but never stop sitting!"},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Wow, this book really opened my eyes to not only understanding the book of Ephesians, but in understanding our relationship with Jesus and practicality of walking with our Lord.

His obsession with Jesus in the context of his commentary is especially encouraging."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Nee offers a basic formula for Christian living: sit with Christ on His throne as He rules the creation given Him as under His authority (Matt. 28); walk in God's will; and stand against the onslaughts of the enemy and his puppets who embrace his kingdom and will as their pathetic lives slip away."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Watchman Nee's Sit Walk Stand is a great book for today's Christian. What a committed Christian who provides his wisdom with us."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"I have heard of Watchman Nee and was eager to read some of his books. however, I just couldn't get into his style of writing, probably due to the era he is from, it wasn't easy for me to connect with."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"Sit, Walk, Stand is a short book which aims to treat the progression in Ephesians from our relationship to the completed work of Christ, the nature of our growth and action in the world, to the spiritual warfare in which we make use of the authority we possess in the name of Christ. Each step in this progression makes use of a single word to cement the concept:1. Sit describes our position of dependence on the complete work of Jesus, which provides foundation for the remaining steps.2. Walk describes the action of conforming ourselves to Christ's image, living with the full understanding that our old self is dead and buried in Christ; that we are new, with the power based on our position to respond to God's voice.3. And finally, Stand declares our position of victory and the need to recognize that spiritual warfare is executed from that position of victory - an act of holding the ground Christ has already won, not allowing Satan to gain territory in our lives, and approaching prayer with faith based on our understanding of God's will and our conformity to it.Nee's text is easy to read, and his wording well-matched to the topic. With his insight into the work of Christ, he is able to bring a number of metaphors and images together into a complete package. Though the book is quite short, in just a few words Nee is able to explain our life in Christ better than most other more \\"wordy\\" books on discipleship and spiritual growth. And the pastoral experience of calling believers into a deeper commitment to Christ seeps into the pages calling for practical response to the Bible and the word of God. This is not a heady or theoretical treatise on discipleship or the Church. It is a directed infusion of spiritual energy into the bloodstream of the church.I am overwhelmingly impressed by his use of illustrations in this book. In many cases, illustrations intent on shedding light on Biblical truth lack the power to move texts forward. Too many authors offer illustrations that share too much detail, causing the reader to lose the simple truth needing to be expressed. And too many illustrations are simply too complex to really do justice, or have lost something in transmission from source to page. Nee's illustrations are powerhouses, concise little motors that propel the reader on to understanding. One example that was particularly striking is on page 21:\\"A brother in South China had a rice field in the middle of the hill. In time of drought he used a waterwheel, worked by a treadmill, to lift water from the irrigation stream into his field. His neighbors had two fields below his, and, one night, made a breach in the dividing bank and drained off all his water. When the brother repaired the breach and pumped in more water his neighbor did the same thing again, and this was repeated three or four times. So he consulted his brethren. \\"I have tried be patient and not to retaliate,\\" he said, \\"but is it right?\\" After they had prayed together about it, one of them replied, \\"If we only try to do the right thing, surely we are very poor Christians. We have to do something more than what is right.\\" The brother was much impressed. Next morning he pumped water for the two fields below, and in the afternoon pumped water for his own field. After that the water stayed in his field. His neighbor was so amazed at his action that he began to inquire the reason, and in course of time he, too, became a Christian.\\"With such a compelling image he was able to show the difference between seeking what is right or just, and seeking Christ himself. Such a walk that puts Christ as our guide, rather than rules, requirements, expectations of justice and fairness won't be met by all with approval, but I think is a compelling response to a worldview that clings to its \\"rights\\" and exalts in the special status of being a \\"victim\\".And while this book was written in shortly after World War II, I was struck in a number of places by the ease with which Nee's text could be translated to the world today. Written in a time of greater openness to the gospel in China, before the political upheavals that pushed the church underground, there is much that finds proximity with our own time and place:\\"Too many of us are caught acting like Christians. The life of many Christians today is largely a pretense. They live in a \\"spiritual\\" life, talk a \\"spiritual\\" language, adopt \\"spiritual\\" attitudes, but they are doing the whole thing themselves. It is the effort involved that should reveal to them that something is wrong...\\" (p. 27)Nee brings Ephesians home, illustrating vividly our position in Christ, our call in Christ, and our victory in Christ."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This study on Ephesians was apparently based on a series of lectures Nee gave in Europe during a trip there. Unlike the later, plain cover books written in his name during recent years, this book is authentic Nee. His teaching is clear, balanced, practical, and DEEP. But unlike the spurious Nee books of recent years, the teaching is also balanced and biblical. Gone are the super-spiritual speculations. This is pure grace lived out in radical obedience. The last chapter tells a story so cool it makes the whole book worthwhile. Great book to read with young Christians.- Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This is an excellent and insightful little book based on Ephesians. It shows how a Christian is called to accomplish all by trust and rest in Jesus' already completed work on the cross. When we know how to sit (in heavenly places) we will be able to stand before the enemy also. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"While I agree with the other 5-star reviewers, perhaps a different perspective would be helpful.Nee shows that in Ephesians Paul presents the basis for our Christian life, is for us simply to ACCEPT that through Jesus, God has ALREADY \\"seated us with Christ in the heavenlies.\\"Nee shares this RADICAL understanding: once we have accepted that God has already given us our identity, we are released from the need to strive to be \\"better\\" Christians: our Christianity flows naturally from our new identity with Christ.Nee goes on to say that once we accept that we \\"sit\\" with Christ, our life (the \\"walk\\") in the world will be the Christian life. Then, Nee shows from Ephesians, we will be prepared to \\"stand\\" -- that is to resist Satan.What this requires of us is FAITH -- the belief in things not yet seen.Sometimes when I taught adult Sunday school, I would place a five or ten dollar bill in front of the class, and tell them that it was a gift to anyone who would pick it up. Sometimes no one would take it. A couple of times the recipient wanted to return it. This was an object lesson, whose point is that a gift is utterly useless to us if we do not pick it up and use it. God's gifts are just like that. When he seats us in heavenly realms with Christ, this does us little good until we accept that this really is our position in Christ. We did not earn it. We cannot earn it. But it is the gift God wants us to have and live in.After reading Nee and Ephesians, it became clear that the New Testament used several images to convey the same reality of being seated with Christ. Jesus' images of the vine and the branches. \\"We have the mind of Christ.\\" \\"We are dead to sin.\\" \\"You must be born again.\\" Etc., etc. They all describe the same reality -- the reality Jesus prayed for in John 17, that we be one with him and with each other.Most of us, never having read Nee, would agree that Jesus has done all the work; but then almost all of strive to be \\"better.\\" No striving needed: just a big dose of the faith which is the victory that overcomes the world."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"You can hardly go wrong with Watchman Nee. This book changed my life when I read it a few years ago. I have reread it since because it is good to review. Based on Ephesians, this book clarifies some misconceptions a lot of Christians have about the Christian life. It is not what we do for God but what he has already done for us. Sit: as believers we must see ourselves as seated with Christ in heavenly places. Walk: we walk by faith just like we were saved by faith--no striving involved. Stand: we stand in faith, not looking for victory but as already possessing it because Christ has obtained it."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This book is very small, but it packs a heck of a message for the limited amount of space it uses. All that this book does is pick apart the book of Ephesians from the Bible. It divies it into three sections; hence \\"Sit, Walk, Stand.\\" If you don't have time to read a long book, actually, scratch that, you need to read this book!

I promise you, you will need to read this book a few times to really digest what Nee is saying; and you will want to!"},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"This is awesome and deep.My friends tend to keep or \\"lose\\" the copythey have borrowed from me.It's a must for healthy, Christian growth."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"I really enjoy this book.

This work is such a nice balance between an exegetical verse by verse analysis of Ephesians and truly devotional fleshing out the implications of that study in a very applicable way. He has real insight into how we must first understand our position in Christ and how we rest in His salvation in order to work it out in our lives. I think he really nails what Paul is getting at, and yet leaves you with his own deep understanding of the implications of that worked out in our lives. I wish we had more modern day Christian thinkers like him, who expressed themselves so well. His work is truly theological but does not come off a dry or purely rational work. It is a real example of how our reflections should lead to our obedience."},{"Title":"Sit, walk, stand","review":"While the book is only 78 pages long, the content is deep and the principles are life changing. It's amazing that such a small book can hold so many \\"Big Ideas\\" about living as a Christian. This is not your typical Christian book, that sounds great, but leaves you wondering how to actually apply its principles in every day life. This is not your typical author who takes their time getting to the point. He's to the point and every point is profound from page to page. Nee's discussion of this expression, these three little words, provides a great framework to live by - Sit, Walk, Stand. I'll leave it to you to read and see exactly what that phrase means and how it might be applicable to your life.

That is what this book is, it is a small book but it is very profound. In a nutshell, Mr. Nee is saying, FOCUS ON THE SAVIOR AND NOT THE BEHAVIOR. He is saying to stay focused on Jesus by sitting at His feet(staying in His presence), then walk with Jesus through obedience and outreach, and stand on the Truth (Jesus) in order to stand against the wiles of the devil and our sinful propensities.The first part: sitting is resting in Jesus and we absolutely MUST rest in Jesus and focus on Jesus and seek to dwell in His presence. Many Christians fail in this area and it is the first and foremost place that a Christian must achieve.True Christian work which most people strike out on their own and do what they want and call the work, the will of God but Mr. Nee emphasizes that True christian work focuses on:1. The true revelation to our heart of the eternal purpose of God.2. All divine work/purpose must be conceived by God3. \\"All work to be effective must depend for its continuance upon the power of God alone.\\"4.

Then toward the middle the plot got more convoluted which is the way I like it. Archer is a fairly good writer, and obviously has enough experience within this diplomatic community to know or be able to get information on what is going on. It was a surprise to me to find out Archer is British, and writing about American groups. Occasionally I wonder if these groups such as the CIA, FBI, and England's own similar groups are as morally ambiguous as Archer and people like Tom Clancy indicate they are. If so, maybe the media and public ought to get more involved in policing these groups. However, this was an enjoyable and quick read. I plan to read more of his work in the future.

Not every single detail can be explained in every single line of text. After reading this novel, I sought out other Archer books, settling on Kane and Abel. This was an excellent book, which none of the Eleventh Commandment naysayers would find any fault with. However, several inexplicable outcomes in this book were the same as any other book.

I was not disappointed. This novel is up to the standard of all of his previous books in my opinion.Read it. You will like it!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This is a fairly decent book it is well thought out and one tends to have sympathy for the charecters. Some very good plot twists make up for \\"Huh\\" moments any of us might suffer from.I do have some issues with this book1. it takes a damn long time to get anywhere, once it does it manages to clip along fairly well and the reader tends to get interested but for the first 5 chapters it is just as slow as frozen molasses in winter time. (that's a regional expression we have in the south)2. Characters are built up and then discarded with no explanation as to where exactly it was that they went or in some cases just killed off conveniently almost as if the author got bored with them.3. The ending (particularly the very end) is worthless and severed no point at all why I had to struggle to reach the end and find out the ansewer to a question I already knew is totally beyond me.I did like the story I'm not saying that, its just that parts of it do have their flaws1. I liked the supporting characters Chris Jackson and Sergi in particular the back and forth between these two is priceless.2. The author does have a good ear for what he is talking about as far as the technical stuff is concerned I like that.Overall-Good book but not perfect you should still consider if you are a newcomer, would be a nice introduction to this author."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Jeffrey Archer is a competent story teller so you expect nothing but the best when you buy one of his novels. 'The Eleventh Commandment' doesn't quite meet that criteria. Whilst the story is fine (outrageous, but fine nonetheless) the author could have spent just a little more time on research since some of the errors were glaringly obvious. I have to say, though, that these errors did not spoil my enjoyment of the book, even though some of the events were predicated on chance rather than on the logical sequence of events. It is still a fast-paced political thriller that draws you quickly into the story and holds you there to the end.Archer has made a name out of political thrillers, probably because he has the inside knowledge to match. A businessman, high-ranking politician and public speaker with the ability to whip up a crowd, Jeffrey Archer has also been involved in the seedier side of life, having been imprisoned for perverting the course of justice. When he outlines a plot involving politicians, you can be sure that, whilst it may be far-fetched, it is based on his insider knowledge. Maybe it's this that gives him an edge over his contemporaries.The one point you may find annoying with all Archer novels (The Eleventh Commandment is no exception), is that he has a habit of writing double adjectives... the tall, angry man... the short, smiling lady... the pale, sensitive boy. For me, it detracts from the story and makes me cringe every time he does it. Maybe I'm being super-critical, because The Eleventh Commandment is still an excellent read that I can happily recommend."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"After his last two disappointing books, Archer returns with a fast-paced, highly entertaining political thriller. The plot has some interesting and surprising twists, and is written in a style that makes you want to keep turning the pages to find out what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"What the hell is going on here??? This book is complete rubbish. It was so bad I dumped it in an hotel room; being unable to finsh it. All the characters are cardboard cutouts. Take the woman who is head of the CIA. The reader does not know what she looks like, how old she is, nothing! The we come to the plot. Dreadful! Really pathetic stuff. Somehow we have to be sympathetic with a cold-blooded CIA hit-man who has a dumber than dumb wife who hasn't a clue as to what he's being doing for the last twenty eight years despite the fact he disappears for weeks on end so he can kill people. Did Archer really write this or was it ghosted by a threee year-old? Pathetic."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Although &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot; remains Archer's nadir, &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot; comes close, as did its predecessor, &quot;The Fourth Estate.&quot; As with the execrable &quot;Honor Among Thieves,&quot; Archer settles for the international intrigue path of cliches and stereotypes. The villains in &quot;Commandment&quot; are as two-dimensional as bad comic book villains and the protagonist has a better shot of veneration than the late Mother Theresa. At its best, the language manages not to offend; most of the time, it is dull. For a &quot;suspense thriller,&quot; the book makes a serious mistake by revealing the protagonist's intended target just pages after the Archer manages to set up some suspense over this detail (the CIA director wonders if he will kill the Russian or American president; two or three pages later -- with about 70 left in the book -- Archer tells the reader).As for Archer's use of the University of Notre Dame as an incidental setting (it's where the protagonist went to college, starring, of course, as the football team's greatest quarterback in a quarter century), some more research would have helped. For one thing, he gets the name wrong, putting &quot;University&quot; after &quot;Dame.&quot; It's a minor detail, but it casts doubt on all his other setting details.So, why two stars? Partially for the opening scenes, which tease the reading into expecting more from the novel, and partially for the author, whose &quot;Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less,&quot; &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot; have long been among my favorite popular novels. Readers unfamiliar with Archer should start with those novels."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"A jeffrey Archer story is always one which makes you travel with his research.Taut and never slackening in pace"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Book was in very good condition; pages darkened by age.

A little far fetched, but enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Jeffrey Archer's novels and short story collections. Some have clearly been better than others, and most of the later efforts have been relatively disappointing. He tends to sandwich shorter, faster moving novels like this between his more &quot;serious&quot; efforts (e.g., Kane &amp; Abel, As the Crow Flies). Some of these &quot;filler&quot; novels didn't make the grade. This one, however, was different. It was just plain fun to read. Nobody tells a story quite like Jeffrey Archer. He can even make us idolize a professional killer! Of course, it also helped that the President of the United States was from Wisconsin and a lifelong Green Bay Packers fan!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"When a novel opens with the precision and suspense of The Eleventh Commandment, you know that you're in for an exciting read. And if an exciting read is what you're looking for, this book delivers. I had a hard time putting it down. The Eleventh Commandment includes car chases, detailed murder schemes, escapes, government conspiracies, great characters and a timely story line. Unlike The Fourth Estate, it also has a hero in Connor Fitzgerald that you can really root for - an underdog trying to beat the system.Unfortunately, if you are a Jeffrey Archer fan, you have read better novels. This book just doesn't stack up to Honor Among Thieves, First Among Equals or Kane and Abel. There were two scenes that bothered me.The first is midway through the novel, when Fitzgerald's family is kidnapped. Archer is intentionally vague about who is doing the kidnapping until the very end of the chapter. I know he was trying to mislead the readers, but I found the whole thing confusing and irritating. Mislead me for a page or two, but don't make me keep track of characters without names for 10 pages.The second scene is at the end, and I think most readers know where Archer is going when the last chapter starts. Again, he takes forever to get there, and it's just annoying. He gets to the red herring quicker at a gallows scene, and that worked for me.Those two things aside, it's really hard to overstate Jeffrey Archer's talent as a writer. His characters are vivid and rich rather than cardboard plot-drivers. The story moves quickly and is gripping. Finally, he doesn't tie up everything neatly at the end. Fitzgerald does not solve all of the world's (or even the country's) problems by the end of the book, and that's OK. Or at least that's realistic."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"As with all of his works, Archer makes no attempt to do anything except entertain the reader. His in-accuracy's in referring to the Remington 700 rifle, as a break-action (it's really a bolt-action), his choice of a hollow point round, notoriously inaccurate , and being able to identify a boattail slug from seeing the full round, can all be forgiven as long as he keeps writing great fiction."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Right from the first paragraph he had me.

The plot is hackneyed, there is no originality. Some of the loopholes has been mentioned in other reviews, but there are many more glaring ones. For Archer fans( a category to which I also belong) I would advise better not to read the novel, and remember his thriller writing skills based on &quot;Shall we tell the President\\" and \\" A matter of honour\\"."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"How much you enjoy this book will depend on how much of a stickler you are for realistic plot resolutions. Many of the ways the author comes up with the plot twists are absolutely absurd. Case in point: the President's Chief of Staff must have had some incredible mind-reading training, because he sure as hell wasn't reaching conclusions grounded in any form of logical deduction or analysis with which I am familiar. Still, the pace is pretty quick and the characters are interesting enough to hold your attention for the long plane ride it will take to read the entire book. This is no &quot;cracking good read&quot; but it is better than being stuck in a center seat watching &quot;Waterboy,&quot; that's for sure..."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This book neither flows nor entertains. Parts of it are so poorly written that any attempt to understand the plot, or to try and visualise the characters are pointless. The characters are one dimensional, and scant in description.

Good value for money."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Forget the implausibility of the \\"youngest Notre Dame quarterback ever\\" and a medal of Honor receipient becoming an undercover operative. Or the fact that Connor Fitzgerald has a strict, old-fashioned moral code...after all, he won't shoot a political candidate in cold blood until the President of the US tells him it's OK. (Slight spoilers follow.)No, the guy is just dumb. He's worked for the CIA for 28 years, and when he's forced to quit, he can't figure out why a great job offer from a private corporation is suddenly withdrawn. Of course, this makes it convenient for him to be called back for a \\"last job\\". Then, he can't tell the difference between the real, live President and a computer-generated phone call...even when the secretary points out that the President didn't call him by his first name, as he is known to do. Then he's given all the supporting documentation for his assignment and is told, for the first time in 28 years, \\"Hey, you don't have to sign for it this time.

Although not as good as some of his others still a good read."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I read this book in three days and could hardly put it down. I have become interested lately in CIA and spy novels, and this book did not disappoint me in any way, in spite of what a couple reviewers below have said about it. What I loved MOST about this book is that you don't expect a CIA assassin to be a truly honorable man, as was this main character. It was really interesting how the author immediately pulls you into the assasin's mind and gets you right on his side.The reviewers below comment on the plot being implausible--that the CIA would not go around like this assasinating world leaders. I don't think this comment is important. In any novel, we must &quot;suspend our disbelief,&quot; and this novel is no different. The more pertinent question in this novel is &quot;What if?&quot; I personally thought it was one of the best plots I have ever read, and I really enjoyed how the characters were one-upping each other. I was really surprised by the twists and turns of the plot as it progressed. And I liked being surprised. An EXCELLENT read."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Like most authors of this genre, Archer starts out at a high intensity but with fairly plausible characters and plot lines for the first hundred pages, but to maintain the ever-increasing tension, the characters and the plot have to move off into never-never land. By the time you get to the last fifty pages, he's off the charts. But long before that, you're hooked on the adreneline rush and you stick with it until the end. Not a great book, but a pleasant way to kill a rainy weekend at the beach or wait out a blizzard on the ski slopes. I wouldn't buy it, but I'll read a few more of Archer's books from the library to see if they are better or worse than this one."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I have read many of Archers books. And I must say I am a devoted reader, even though some of his pieces had already disappointed me. But this one is a hit. It starts quite slowly, by the first third of the book, you wonder whether it is going to be tricky and thrilling at all. But through the rest of the book you just fly through without a break. There are some really good points (f.e. the execution part, for those who have read..:o))). I loved this book. And thanks to the slow start, I would recommend this also to the Archers first readers. You will have time to make yourself comfortable with characters and pace of his story. And it IS a REALLY GOOD ONE with professional background and obvious knowledge of the problematics."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"The Eleventh Commandment was my first Archer book, and it wowwed me from start to finish. I liked Archer's style of setting up characters throughout the book, resisting the temptation of telling you the characters' entire life story in the first chapter you meet them. I found myself thinking I knew how the story would end -- and revising my thoughts several times. A quick, but challenging read for anyone who loves government-oriented plots."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I loved this book. I bought it for the train ride to and from work (1 hr each way) and finished it in 2 days.

I was relieved to find that Archer's work moved at a pace much faster than the ordinary Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn. Rather than wasting pages on trivial bureaucratic details, Archer keeps the characters on a steady sequence of events whose progress rivals the best works of Robert Ludlum.The one drawback of the story is the lack of character development, especially with the protagonist. Archer does give us adequate information on the background of Connor Fitzgerald but does little to endear us to him. While Fitzgerald is likeable, he doesn't have the panache that most literary spies regale the reader with. I suppose this is done intentionally considering most real CIA operatives/assassins are probably less demonstrative than the ones we're used to reading about.All things considered, Archer's book is uniquely entertaining. With a plot that's unusually thoughtful and clever, the author forces us to recognize and appreciate the precarious situations of each character. Towards the end, you'll find yourself pulling tremendously for the main character."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I am an avid reader. I am always looking for an new author.

Archer's short stories, The Eleventh Commandment is my first novel. Hence, I do not have any basis of comparison vs. his past novels, which most readers say are a lot better. Regardless of that observation, I have found this book very enjoyable. The opening scene has caught my attention & the subsequent events are definite page-turners. I agree that the story takes you for a (roller coaster) ride from one country to another & the events may be quite surreal. But what is specifically there which is not believable? For someone who has not worked with the secret service, much more with the NCOs, Connor's every movement is livid & brings us closer to feeling his dilemma. My only negative comment though is on how Mr. Archer portrayed Connor's character...a seemingly flawless person.

Instead, he gives us a poorly written, inadequately researched and contrived thriller.The opening paragraph of Chapter 35 goes as follows: &quot;The snow was falling heavily as Zerimski climbed the steps to the waiting Ilyushin 62, creating a thick white carpet around its wheels.&quot; Where was the editor?As for research, JA acknowledges the help of every current and former national security bigwig but William Casey. Impressive, yes, but he might have employed a few less prestigious types to check his facts. For example, the Spanish phrases he uses are often awkward if not wrong. Also, Helen Dexter becomes CIA director after leaving a NYC law firm after &quot;a dispute with the board&quot; over the lack of female partners. Of course, US law firms don't have boards of directors--they are partnerships.As to the plot being contrived, the idea that the CIA director! would unilaterally order assassinations of world leaders, then try to cover it up with a string of murders at home and abroad is, well, pretty implausible.

The first assault on credibility is the fact that the main character, Connor Fitzgerald, an assassin for the CIA, is a regular boy-scout kind of guy much admired for the content of his character as well as his chillingly efficient professional skill. Give me a break! Nice, normal guys, I don't think, go around murdering people in cold blood as a profession.The author is clever at setting a good scene with authentic details and he might have sold me on the notion that nice guys can be assassins - but he couldn't sell me a wholesale lot of plot twists and turns which add up to implausibility. Connor is so smart and has so many friends that leap into the story to help him out at critical points that he outwits everyone - the CIA, the Russians, the Russian Mafya (yes, it's spelled that way) -- evading capture and execution and effortlessly finding opportunities to stalk heavily-guarded world leaders. Thus, about half-way through the book, I began to lose interest in the story and from then on I just turned pages quickly to get to the end."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This is the first book I read from Jeffrey Archer. After hearing good things about him, I thought I should try one of his books, and opted for this one. It was a mistake.While some of the characters are interesting, the plot is insanly stupid and absurd. It is so far-fetched and not believable, that I ended up reading it through without much interest. The story has the hero, Connor, who is a CIA agent, on a mission in Russia where he is just abandoned by the Agency. And from there on, it is just blah, blah, and blah, and blah, blah blah. Numerous times, I could hear myself say &quot;Ah come on! Give me a break!&quot;. It is that ridiculous.On the other hand, Jeffrey Archer is a very popular authour, so he must do something right? A lot of people will tell you how great a story-teller this authour is, and I will have to agree. This book is like a movie and it is fast paced. So this is a positive aspect of 'The Eleventh Commandment'. That it is short is another one.With that said, I would not recommend this book unless you are a loyal Jeffrey Archer fan. I will probably try another book from him one of these days, because I'm sure it is not his best. And if, like me, you are new to Jeffrey Archer, then skip this one!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I was a little surprised with this book , I expected a lot more from Archer , but this book is full of non believable characters like Helen Dexter and some others.It tells the story of a secret CIA agent who does a lot of non ofcial work , he was about to retire when a last job was asked to him , kill Zerimski , a russian presidential candidate but he didn't knew this was a trap for him to get caught and for the CIA to get hands clean on the murder of a colombian presidential candidate.This book is fast and easy reading but most of it is non believable , it's like a movie , short and with a lot of plot holes.I recommend this book only for Archer fans , I like his work in general , but I didn't like this one that much , it's not that bad but like I said , most of it is non believable.If you want to read a short an easy reading book maybe you'll like it , but in my case I didn't."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Jeffry Archer's book &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot; was written ten years too late. The plot of the novel is tired and has been done before and since the collapse of communism in Russsia, a lot. The plot has to do with our hero being set up by his boss to kill the Russian President so the CIA won't have to face anymore budget cuts. Also, they want our hero out of the way so he can't squeal to the president about covert operations. If you have not read Jeffry Archer before, do not start with this novel. Almost anything else he has written is better."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I have not yet read this book, but find that paying 11 dollars for a book 200 pages long deplorable, especially when the print version is going for less than half that. Where is the justification. Both publishers and authors are taking liberties in the new digital age, because consumers no longer physically hold books in their hands they seldom see when they are getting ripped off."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"The Eleventh Commandment belongs in Archer's head, not on paperback. It's poorly written with a washy protagonist, and an incredible villian. The plot is threadbare.For first time readers of Archer: Please don't judge him on this appalling work, he is better than this."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Archer has never been one of my favorites - but with The Eleventh Commandment he pulls off a humdinger. Having spent much time in the &quot;old days&quot; in the Soviet Union, with so many &quot;interviews&quot; and &quot;conversations&quot; with the KGB, and weeks in &quot;Leningrad,&quot; I can judge the superiority of his research. His portrayal of the Russian Mafia is tight and true. I knew some of them when they had the courage to defy the old regime at a time when hiding was difficult, individual and group resistance very tricky. Actually, some of them helped me - or their parents did - at some cost. It does not surprise me that they have shifted to the new &quot;underworld,&quot; their view of humans and their &quot;black&quot; skills that helped some of us (views and skills nurtured, demanded by the old regime - if one wanted to carve out any personal freedom or &quot;excitment&quot;). The depiction of current Russia is not far from the mark. It will make! a great movie."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I good read, my type book, and the best thriller I've read since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE. Archer is a true master of his genre."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Yes, this book is rather interesting, although quite political. The storyline is strong enough, and it just manages to hook you to read through the entire book (I finished it in around 6-8 hours over three days). However, it is not what I expect from Jeffrey Archer, and it is a little too heavy (reading) for my comfort."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Archer does it again with the Eleventh Commandment. This book is a page turner for anyone who likes suspense novels. The charactors are interesting, the settings varied and appropriate. I LOVED it!!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Eleventh Commandment is one of the easiest reads I have had in a long time. It packs all of the thrills of a Clancy into 400 pages. Just when you think you understand what is going on and can anticipate the next event**BAM**. If you like Clancy, Cussler, Koontz, or Grishom, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Read this story in one sitting, a rainy day at the beach--couldn't stop--exciting characters, masterful plot, wonderful ending, and one box of chocolates! I saw J. Archer interviewed on the Today show by Matt Lauer. It was interesting and he projected something that made me want to go out and buy his book. I did! I'll read others, and look for more and continue to be a fan."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"After reading all of Archer's other books, expectations were set high. But this book disappoints. The pace does not pick up, the ending is rather lame (and quite predicable), and the various settings not grand enough."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"While I was engrossed reading the book could not understand why JA permitted the head of the CIA become a Senator after the President got rid of her and allowher to go unpunished. Another thing I could not understand was how she was able to keep the President &quot;under her thumb with threats&quot;The redeeming feature of the book was the surprise ending."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Not as good as Kane and Abel but a good quick read,a day in fact. I felt the book was fairly well researched and comming from South Africa it was interesting to see was said with Mandala gone, Not a bad observation!!."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This latest offering is a disappointment when compared to Archer's other books, but still a quick and interesting read. Surprisingly, and disappointingly, given that the author is Jeffrey Archer, the twists and turns of the plot are predictable. Also, being from the Washington DC area, where some of the action of the book takes place, I wished Archer had done a better job with his research. This book screams WAIT TO YOU SEE THE MOVIE! Maybe Archer is falling into the regrettable habit of many of the more popular writers of writing a book to a movie?"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Its Funny to think a person such as Jerrery Archer who has written books as Kane and Abel {which is almost a legend} to write a very mediocre book such as The 11th commandment ... The book starts off well but then it starts to the stuck in the same place for long moments and this is very frustrating and boring ...in short after i finished this book i felt very dissatisfied at the story and the very predictable ending that this book has...ahhh thats one more point the book is extremly predictable all the way .... I will not recommend this book .... look for another book from JA or many other good fiction authors ,i am not going to write a list here."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"There is nothing remotely new about the premise of this spy thriller - hero becomes outcast, must defeat powerful CIA head and nationalist neo-communist Russian head of state to save life and country. It is a quick read (large print and few pages) but ultimately has a very routine ending made unsatisfying by numerous plot errors.First of all, the idea that a war hero who was awarded the Medal of Honor before the whole nation could become a top clandestine agent of a super secret section of the CIA is just absurd: such fame and notoriety would be an unacceptable characteristic for an intelligence agent. Next, the book did not seem like it was well researched, but, (as was the case) appeared to have been written by a non-American. A CIA director who couldn't be removed by the president - again, how absurd. CIA agents given the choice of retirement or transfer to the Cleveland or Milwaukee offices - Archer has his American intelligence agencies confused and is perhaps thinking of the FBI; the CIA does not maintain stations throughout the country, as it is prohibited by law from operating domestically.The plot involving the junior Romanov (don't all spy thrillers involving Russia try to introduce a character who is a descendant of the czars?) colluding with the Russian president, then trying to betray the president, was just implausible. Ditto with the forced resignation of the rogue CIA director - certainly she would have been prosecuted,not sent free to run for the Senate. Finally, why was Fitzgerald using as a new identity the name of his wife's ex-college boyfriend (who was presumably still alive)? I wonder how large publishers can employ such obtuse editors who cannot even recognize and remedy such obvious flaws in a book.There are dozens of late 1990's spy thrillers out there that have the same plot revolving around an ultranationalist coming to power in Russia and this one is just a stereotype of this genre. It makes fast reading, but this book is more of a 300 page cliche than a respectable work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read. While not up there as my favorite Archer book (Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less), it had all the elements to keep me interested. With the fall of the Soviet Union, I worry that there might not be enough bad guys for today's fiction, but fear not, we learn of the Soviet mafia and one CIA agents loyalty to his president."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading 12 Red Hearrings and this was even better. There was enought turns to keep even the best CIA readers behind the wheel. I did have one big fear through the book, could this be how it really is in the real world? If so I would rather have my President chase skirts. Great book"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"the latest from Archer is not his best nor does it show his interest.the thrill of Kane and Abel,the determination of Prodigal daughter,the well researching of The fist among equals are all missing.Archer should not have written in haste. The book could have taken an interesting turn if Connor had successfully assasinated in his first attempt and we would have seen a nuclear stanoff."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Having read virtually every Archer book, The 11th Commandment fell short of all expectations. Its a far cry from Kane &amp; Abel (my all time fav. Archer book). A simple plot and preditable ending. I do hope the next book will get better."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This was my first Jeffrey Archer novel. I will certainly read others. This was fast paced with several unexpected twists."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"As usual reading books written by Jeffrey Archer are always exciting. You never quite know what is coming next. I can recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This commandment may not be the actual one, but The Eleventh Commandment, written by Jeffrey Archer, is a riveting, thrilling novel. The nonstop pace of this book makes it a winner, along with the witty set of characters, such as 28-year veteran of the CIA and holder of the Medal of Honor, Connor Fitzgerald. As the CIA's most deadly weapon, Fitzgerald is assigned by the hard-nosed, stringent Director, Helen Dexter, to assassinate a Russian presidential candidate. When the CIA turns against him, Fitzgerald ends up struggling to survive in the conflict he is in between the Russian Mafia, the President of the United States, his family, and the institution that he devoted much of his life to. With a series of backstabbing and deceiving tricks, the President and his long-lost best friend attempt saving his life.The unexpected always occurs in this spine-tingling book, and each page is better than the last. The fast pace and trickery throughout makes it nearly impossible to predict what will happen next, with each chapter ending as a cliffhanger. Eager to find out what will happen to Fitzgerald next, it is impossible to not root for him, whether it be in the Washington, St. Petersburg, or Australia. Because of the many conflicts within conflicts, the story never slows down, and the plot is always thickening. Although the constant change in point of view is a bit confusing, it makes it even more enjoyable for any reader. The Eleventh Commandment would appeal to anyone, male or female, young or old, who has the least bit of interest in either mystery, thrillers, suspense, or action. Starting this book would be agreeing to follow the commandment, \\"Thou Shalt Not Put This Book Down.\\""},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"If you like action/suspense novels, this is the one for you! The Eleventh Commandment reminds me of John Grishman's earlier novels. They share elements of suspense as well as convoluted plots and characters who miraculously straighten out in the end. This was my first book by Archer, but it has definately inspired me to read more!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I'm a 16 year old Australian reader and this being the first Jeffery Archer book that I have read I found it totally entertaining.

It will keep you in suspense from the word go. I read this book in one afternoon while relaxing with my kids by the pool.This book is a must read. If you havn't read anything by Mr. Archer (This was my first), let me recommend this title as your first.If you like authors such as Tom Clancy, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"It was a very good story that kept my attention right up to the end. Unfortunately, the ending was a big disappointment. The bad guys didn't get the punishment they deserved and justice was not served. Not what I expected at all."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Okay, why take everything seriously. Some of the people who wrote reviews need to stop being such stupid pendantics. This book is great fun, and had a very sad, touching moment. Although a lot is far-fetched and crazy, its still quick, interesting and engrossing."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I will have to admit that it is a very good book although it didn't meet up with my expectations. It's too short, too fast, and the plot is utterly rediculous. Netherless, it's a joy and would make a definitely good lunch."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This book on tape was our companion driving through the deserts of the southwest. The book shared some similarities with the desert, every now and then there was a peak, then long, flat, dry stretches. Actually the story was not bad,it just got a little absurd in spots. The main characters and the premise was interesting and I found myself rewriting it for the screen and casting the movie, so I guess it couldn't have been too absurd. It was a good summer read - a great time killer on a southwestern trek."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This book has its high points, but in general it is much too obvious. Mr. Archer builds characters and dialogue fairly well but lost me with the confusion of his plot lines and obviousness; and the ending was just too silly to believe. However, this is a vast improvement from his prior book, 'Kane and Able' which I would give only a single * to.vGe"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I don't like all of Jeffrey Archer's book but I really like this one. It is second only to Kane and Abel on his list. It is filled with heros villains and many plot twists. Trust noone and you just might survive."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"I was totally engulffed when reading this book. This is my first Archer book and he did a generally great job. I liked the depth of the characters and their reactions to situations. I found myself making audible remarks to the way Connor's wife reacted. I also like the idea of the politics in Washington being leaded by the CIA. All of the political conspiracies really intrigued me. The only downfall was some predictability. Archer set up many surprises and I figured out the gimic a good majority of the time which is a rarity for me. I am a person that doesn't figure anything out ahead of time so this was a little predictible. Overall, a well written book."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Archer seems to be improving with age, or so this latest novel would have us believe. His plot had the usual twists and turns, even killing off the hero twice, then dropping him out of the sky again, to our relief. His characters are so real and fully developed I felt at a loss when it came to it's suspense filled ending. Look forward to the next one Mr Archer!!"},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Jeffrey Archer created great characterization and the reading public will admire and sympathize with the hero and his family, while steadfastly dispising the antagonist and her cohorts. All the characters were believable. The feeling that developed in my gut reminded me of my fear of heights, boarding a plane or waiting up for my daughters when they were late arriving home from a date. I recommend The Eleventh Commandment to everyone who loves reading thrillers and suspense. You won't be disappointed. For those of you who don't enjoy thrillers, just try this one and you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"Spend some time in your reading spot to enjoy this book by Jeffrey Archer.

There are plot twists throughout the book, especially at the end. A great insight into the undercover world of a CIA operative."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"This book might be a bit implausible, but nonethess it was a great novel.

On the brink of retirement, Fitzgerald finds himself in a dilemna: following orders, he murders a Colombian drug lord, but putting a bind on the director of the CIA, he finds himself taking the fall for a phoney assassination.Archer has long established himself a master of thrillers and storytelling, and this one is no exception. The characters were well developed and the story was a page turner. The plot had enough loops and twists to be interesting and original. If you like political thrillers or a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, I definitely recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Eleventh Commandment: A Novel","review":"REMINDS ME OF A MATTER OF HONOR.

Both of these publications are 8-1/4\\" x 10-1/2\\" (87 square inches), or about the same size as the original magazines. For some totally inexplicable reason, the aptly self-named \\"Idiots\\" at Mad decided to downsize Mad About The Fifties to 6-1/4\\" x 7-3/4\\" (48 square inches), a little over half the size of the original magazine. The print is much smaller, as are the drawings. In reducing the size of the drawings, much of the original detail is lost. This is particularly noticeable with artists such as Jack Davis, where exquisite detail is one of the hallmarks of his craft. The \\"Idiots\\" dropped the ball on this one."},{"Title":"Mad About the Fifties","review":"I don't rank this book higher because of the size. I don't know why the publishers made it again.

I accidentally happened to browse Amazon on my friends id and discovered a whole lot of compilations and as of now have most of them, except those which have not already been delivered. Must say that reading and re-reading the compilations and sharing and discussing them with friends is a silver lining to an otherwise long and tiring day.Waiting impatiently for the delivery of Mad Archives and the Don Martin Special.Just go ahead and BUY this and all the other mads and die laughing.Its a worthwhile investment for good health and of course fights with friends ( Do make it a point to print your name in INDELIBLE ink on EACH page )its your copy and your investment of course."},{"Title":"Mad About the Fifties","review":"Does not translate well to the kindle.

Soon after her arrival and through the spring of 1773, Anna kept a diary of her daily life, advances in sewing and writing and dancing, and social engagements. It's not scintillating, but it is a nice look at the everyday life of a young girl at the birth of the American Revolution. You will learn a lot about the lives of the 18th century well-bred women. Parts of it are unintentionally funny as the Puritan Anna, despite the religious imprecations to modesty, is just as fashion-conscious as any modern teenager.At barely more than 100 pages, Diary of Anna Green Winslow, A Boston School Girl of 1771 is definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Christmas in Germany","review":"This is a good resource for understanding the traditional and cultural aspects of German Christmas customs. It details the historical significance of the Christmas tree, decorations, and Father Christmas, identifies how the holiday is celebrated in today's Germany, and even includes recipes and music and lyrics to some popular German carols. The photographs are good and there are step-by-step instructions for building a gingerbread house. This book was listed in the Germany-Travel Section and I expected a more definitive work on traditional arts and crafts such as toy and ornament making. Unfortunately only 4 pages were devoted to this with vague desricptions of where manufacturing occurs.

This story has mass murder, characters poisoning one another, agencies of the United States government conspiring against one another, all pretty dark themes. Sadly, the story is also dark, as in muddy and incomprehensible. Characters aspire to become one dimensional, and in the end are placeholders, flat scenery, making expository speeches which seem to exist only to explain their point of view. At one point in the book, when Jake Grafton and Rita Tarkington (an American female naval aviator) take off in Russian jets from a base inside Russia to track down the bad guys, the Russian mechanics sabotage the planes in manner calculated to kill the pilots - this only rates an aside in the book. If you're looking for a Coonts book which carries off themes like these well, please let me reccomend Coonts' &quot;Minotaur&quot;. It's also pretty grim, but done much better, and is one of the best &quot;spy novels&quot; that I've read."},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"These are great books.

I can't wait until I read The Intruders"},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"Whatta joke! I struggled to finish this mind-boggling farce thinking it might finally get better. Nope. Coonts not only avoids any serious character development in this made-for-TV gag, but also blissfully skips over any research into the nature of the people in the jobs he writes about. This lends nothing but a total lack of credibility in what these characters can accomplish, given their backgrounds and their government positions. But that's ok with the author-- his bureaucratic James Bonds just go right ahead and pull off the most outlandish bizarre stunts anyway. You won't have any trouble putting it down. I just did."},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"Former jet jock, Rear Adm.

A British journalist is dead and it all is tied together somehow. The Cold War is in progress and someone in the Soviet Union and the C.I.A. are working together to transport warheads to the Middle East. Jake Grafton and Toad Tarkington are sent on a mission to find the warheads. C.I.A. agents visited both their houses and tell them not to go to Russia. Jake is now a target for terrorists everywhere. Apparently someone in the Middle East wants to have nuclear weapons. Jake thinks if the missiles are obtained by unfriendly Middle Eastern countries they would launch them towards America. Toad and Jake went to Russia on a mission to find the missing Warheads. They hire a hacker to assist them in locating the warheads. Meanwhile an American journalist named Jack Yocke is already in Russia and saw some Russians with machine guns gunned down a whole bunch of people. The weird thing was no police or any other agency responded after the shooting was over. Jack told Jake about the incident as soon as he arrived in Russia. Jake then told a Russian officer and he said he didn't know why the police didn't take action. Jake and Toad already thought Herb Tenney was behind the massacre and suggested to the police to arrest him. They went with the police to search Tenney's place. The search revealed strange tablets that may have made Jake sick at the party the other day. After Tenney is released he dusted his house for fingerprints and finds matches for Toad and Jake. Jake then learns Herb is up to something and it is related to the warheads. Jake finally learns the tactics of how to be a navy seal. He also learns how to skydive and most importantly fly a jet aircraft. His skills would later be put to the test when he gets in a dogfight with four Russian jets. He surprisingly makes it through without being killed. Jake finally finds the nuclear warheads. He figures out Saddam Hussein was behind all of it. I recommend this book to people who like techno-thrillers and mysteries. I also recommend it to people who are interested in the armed forces. This is a really great book and I enjoyed it a lot.The best reason I liked this book was because of the non-stop action. In the beginning some C.I.A. agents went into Jake's and Toad's house. Jake fought back but the two C.I.A. agents overpowered him and threatened him. Toad was threatened but then Jake got his gun and scared them away. There was when the journalist saw the terrorist shooting and lived to tell the tale. The journalist even inspected the dead bodies without anybody noticing. Finally the best part in the whole book was the dogfight. I don't know how a person who just learned how to fly a jet can shoot down four planes all by himself but Jake managed to pull it off. It was unrealistic but it was very exciting to read in specific detail how Jake shot them down.The second would have to be a lot of the events were explained in explicit detail. When Jake was first learning how to become a navy seal it told you how they drilled through the training and how perfectly he did it when he actually had to. The author told how unstable Jake's first flights were and how he struggled with getting it off the runway because he would either give too little power or too much. On his first flight I thought he was going to crash because in flight he couldn't stabilize the plane properly.Last was when Jake was solving the mystery. It made it seem like you were the character in the book trying to figure out the mystery. The start of the mystery was very confusing because it had a whole bunch of names and sometimes I forgot some of them. Later in the problem it started to get very interesting because you could sense Jake getting closer because of all the events like General Brown dying, the shooting, etc.Last was the book was unpredictable. When the journalist's body turned up in the ocean without any signs of drowning is one example of this. He probably wasn't drunk and records clarified that there were C.I.A. agents aboard. There was also a time when people Jake knew kept dying and you thought he was going to be next. For instance General Brown died of a heart attack because of the tablet with poison that Tenney gave him. That is how the British journalist died and even General Shmarov died all of a heart attack. For some reason Jake managed not to get poisoned which really surprised me. I would have never figured that Saddam was behind the entire problem. I thought it was going to be some random terrorist but it was a well known terrorist.This book is for people in the armed forces and for people who like mystery/thriller books. Jake developed in many ways as a character. The book was unpredictable, had lots of detail, and lots of action. I really liked this book and this is one of the best books I read. Jake would have never survived without Toad by his side giving him advice. Toad didn't have to come to Russia but he did anyway to keep him company. The details made it seem as if you were the main character not Jake. The fight was explained in detail, the training, almost everything was explained in a lot of detail. The book was also like there was action on every single page and I never wanted to put the book down. The dogfight was too interesting for me to go and do something other than read.By: D.Bennett"},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"This is a good book to read, the plot is ok, the thing that i dont like is that Jake Grafton in this book is almost like a superman, he can fly planes, well ok, but jumping with seals without like he was one for years is not very much real, and handle a squad of SU 27 Flankers with a single Su-25 frogfoot is almost impossible to happen .. i think this is the major faults in the book, the rest is ok .. one of the most improved chracters in this book is Jack Yocke, overall this book is very good to read and the history is well written"},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"The high point of \\"The Red Horseman\\" is the aerial dogfight between Jake Grafton (flying a Russian Su-25 \\"Frogfoot\\") and four Russian Su-27 \\"Flankers\\", with most of the action taking place below 200 ft. altitude! Stephen Coonts is very good at writing about this kind of combat, and you really feel that you're right there in the cockpit with Jake.This book is the fifth or sixth (depending on how you number them) book in the Jake Grafton series. By now Stephen Coonts had established himself as a worthy competitor to Tom Clancy, and in my opinion his books are better than Clancy's. In particular, the characters in a Stephen Coonts book are real people, and people you enjoy learning more and more about.In the first two-thirds of \\"The Red Horseman\\" the story unfolds slowly, but satisfactorily, as an international political thriller. Jake, now a Rear Admiral in the American Defense Intelligence Agency, is sent to Moscow to help monitor the Russian dismantling of their nuclear warheads. The CIA is also involved, but not in the way we would expect, and of course some warheads go missing.The last third of the book becomes a techno-thriller. The hunt is on to retrieve the missing warheads and to ensure that no more will be stolen. In addition to the great dogfight mentioned above there is a very detailed description of how a major military operation to secure an enemy airfield would be done nowadays.I found this last section of the book to be the most interesting and exciting part. The whole thing is rather unrealistic, but the reader is willing to ignore that because it's so exciting. Unfortunately, I thought that the ending was a bit too far out, and this is part of the reason for the lack of the fifth star.Also on the negative side, I found Stephen Coonts opinion of post-glasnost Russia overly derogatory. He has his characters saying \\"nothing works here\\" and \\"Russia is on its way to the stone age\\" so many times it becomes silly. This is especially true with the hindsight we have now that Russia did survive the Yeltsin era and is slowly but surely becoming a developed country by western standards.A very interesting sub-plot in \\"The Red Horseman\\" involves the death of a British newspaper mogul named Nigel Keren. Stephen Coonts has very clearly modeled Nigel Keren on the real-life Robert Maxwell. Even their dates of death are identical!In conclusion, a very good techno-thriller, up to the usual Stephen Coonts standards. If you like military techno-thrillers with lots of political skullduggery, then this is for you.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"I can't believe I made it through the book, this is the first book in a long time that I have been tempted to drop in the middle. The plot is very interesting and at times kept my attention. It also got more and more improbable as the plot grinded its gears through the book. Jake Grafton is apparently some kind of god and can do anything and go anywhere apparently without authority from anyone else but himself. The book would have been alright if these were its only flaws, after all it is a novel and I expected to put my disbelief on hold while I read (not everyone can write like Clancy).The major problem with the book is the writing. All the characters are extremely one dimensional except maybe Jack Yocke. The dialogue is awfully written and can't Coonts think of any other word for helicopter besides &quot;machine&quot;!? There were numerous plot holes, but I will concede that Coonts made an effort to fix them though somewhat lamely.This book may be OK for people who have read the other books in the series and have already gotten used to the characters, but if this is going to be the only Coonts book you read, steer clear because it could be your last."},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"In &quot;The Red Horsemen&quot;, Admiral Jake Grafton travels to post-Soviet Russia to monitor the dismantling of that country's nuclear arsenal. Stephen Coonts, Grafton's creator, brews up a tale of crooked Russians, homocidal CIA agents and black market nukes being sold amid the disintegration of Russia. Unfortunately, the story bogs down quickly when Grafton gets to Russia - mostly because the plot becomes overly complicated, but also due to the sheer implausibility that Coonts inserts into the story - like Grafton's single-handed destruction of a formation of highly agile Su-27 fighters while himslef flying only a hoggish Su-25; the novel's climax has the hero meet Saddam Hussein face-to-face and exact a measure of justice in an ending that seems incredibly pat for Coonts. Even that ending would seem worse had it not capped off a book full of plot twists that don't come together. Coonts' original &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; was a great book because it resisted the temptation to become the sort of technothriller that &quot;Horseman&quot; is. Instead, take out &quot;Cuba&quot; in which Coonts returns to form."},{"Title":"The Red Horseman (Jake Grafton, Book 5)","review":"Jack Yocke wants to make his name big in the Washington Post as a top reporter.

A well-researched, fast-paced and easy-to-read thriller which deals with the story of a nuclear power plant explosion, caused by a renegade general intent on using the disaster to gain him access to a tactical nuclear weapons storage depot, to sell them to Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, members of the CIA are dropping down like flies in a binary poisoning plot which claims the life of a British newspaper tycoon(a thinly fictionalised Robert Maxwell) and could have been lifted from THE X-FILES. The flying sequences are as ever, as brilliant as Dale Brown with all the autheticity and fully-explained technics you could want, and it's interesting to see Jake Grafton handle Russian fighters for a change! The final scenes in Saudi Arabia and Iraq provide an excellent backdrop to the mission to retrieve the stolen warheads, and the Moscow scenes are also authentic and well-researched. Once again, like Tom Clancy's CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN, it brought back memories of my visit there.

He has progressed from the plain men-in-war type thriller(Flight of the Intruder) to the true techno-thriller. This book ranks up there with books like Larry Bond's Red Phoenix and Tom Clancy's The Sum of All Fears. I usually don't like novels with real people in them(Boris Yeltsin and Saddam Hussein), but the Red Horseman does not exploit these people like some others(David Hagberg's Kilo Option, for example). This book kept me awake at night because it's so realistic. I'm glad Mr. Coonts has gone on to write other techno-thrillers as well(Fortunes of War). Congratulations, Mr. Coonts!

While I recommend reading both books, I was actually pleasantly surprised to find that this book turned out to be the more enjoyable read. I think the reason is because the information (1) flowed smoother, (2) was better organized, and (3) was described in simpler language.This book covers a lot of topics, most of which were fascinating. I read the Kindle edition, which included long \\"lists\\" of illustrations. However, it appears that the printed book has the actual illustrations, because there were not any in the Kindle edition. I am sure that I would have enjoyed the book even more, had I been able to see the illustrations. However, in spite of this one flaw, the book is still worthwhile reading. So, don't be put off by this one issue.This book serves as a good starting point if you want to learn some basic information about medieval customs, dress, food, manners, etc. It is great for novices like me who want to know more about medival lifestyles but who don't have an extensive background already on medieval \\"things. The problem, I felt, with the \\"Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England\\" was that the text sometimes became bogged down in medieval jargan and historical referrences. While this book might not offer much in terms of new information for long-time Middle-Age scholars and experts, it does give some good, solid information in an enjoyable and easy-to-understand format.Also, please note that the book is an English translation from French, so it reads a bit awkward in places. Another downside was the large number of typographical errors that were annoying, such as \\"receipt\\" for \\"recipe\\".

If many respected publications did not make sure we knew, than John Stossel surely did. We \\"learned\\" that she was awarded $2.9 million. According to the author Stephanie Mencimer, those who favor \\"tort reform\\" (limiting personal injury and suffering) made sure we knew, but didn't make sure that we knew the whole story. The author elaborates.It seems this retired retail sales clerk and life-long Republican had never sued anyone a day in her life. Having stopped for coffee with her grandson, she attempted to negotiate the cream or sugar to the coffee between her legs as her grandson's car lacked cup holders. It spilled and she was scolded in her groin and thighs.A few years and several operations later she appeals to McDonalds asking them if they could help her pay the $20,000 in medical expenses. Mickey D blew her off with a check for $800. That's when she retained a lawyer who offered to settle at $300,000, but McDonalds wouldn't touch it with a straw. They wanted to be taken to court.That's when the jury, skeptical of Liebeck's claim at first, heard that McDonald's had more than 900 complaints of their coffee being too hot, that their executives knew that their coffee was served at 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit, that Mickey D's Big Cheeses knew all along such temperatures could burn flesh off bone in seven seconds, and that a Cincinnati burn center had treated numerous people for coffee burns from McD.The outraged jury awarded her $160,000 for pain and suffering and $2.7 million in punitive damages, which the judge, although sympathetic, knocked down to $486,000. Liebeck has since settled for less. (Had she received the 2.9, it would have cost the company one day of coffee sales.)That's the part of this story we don't hear about. And this isn't even the author's icebreaker!Stephanie Mencimer brings several things to light:1) A civil trial by jury to redress wrongs is a constitutional right that is being eroded through tort reform, which now protects business more than the consumer or citizen.2) Lawsuits are almost always the only way that corporate negligence ever receives public attention.3) The companies that are being sued are the ones that require the most oversight, get the least, and are the most deserving of being sued.4) Many of these corporations such as tobacco, asbestos, drug and auto companies are pouring billions of dollars into legislation that will cap awards, limit product liabillity, and limit lawyer fees making it nearly impossible for citizens to go to trial for their negligence or crimes.5) Most of the outrageous cases we hear about never really existed e.g. a 400 lb. man who sued a ladder company when it fell apart, or the man who supposedly tried to trim his hedges with his lawn mower. All made up!6) Lawsuits have actually decreased over the years as well as awards.7) This is the real topper. The tort reform campaign has been hugely successful in getting Americans to vote in favor of legislation that will restrict or end their rights if criminal or negligent executives harm them. This massive lobbying effort has gotten mostly everyone to believe that it will not affect their day in court, when in fact they are voting their own rights away.8) Guess which politician is one of the most industry and tort reform friendly. I won't say his name, but he's President of the United States.9) There's always been a check on frivolous lawsuits. It's called a judge.Thanks to lawsuits, we can now enjoy a company's coffee at 140-150 degrees. (After all, you deserve a break today!) We learned that certain drugs were dangerous, and that we now have auto recalls. Do you think any of these changes would have happened had there been limited liability?There's one other very profound observation found in this book. How is it we can trust many un- or ill-informed Americans to vote in national and local elections, but want to restrict twelve fairly well-informed Americans from voting in a jury box?Don't we trust our fellow Americans?Please read this book. Make sure you don't get burned."},{"Title":"Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and Its Corporate Allies Are Taking Away Your Right to Sue","review":"This important book should have received more attention when it was published. Presumably, \\"tort reform\\" is just not a sexy enough topic, and even the bright yellow cover and the (presumably intentional) absence of the word \\"tort\\" from the title were insufficient.Avoiding legalese almost completely, Mencimer gives an in-depth account of the lobbying and litigation wars over the civil justice system in the past two decades or so. Unlike other commentators, I didn't find this book an unquestioning brief for the trial lawyers. Mencimer makes clear that some trial lawyers can become extraordinarily wealthy and that some baseless and even frivolous suits are filed. Her real point is that some major companies have tried to achieve in the halls of Congress and the state legislatures and in the ballot box what they could not achieve in court.The story of the McDonald's coffee lawsuit has been told elsewhere, but Mencimer goes well beyond this to point out other distortions of the truth that have been made by lobbyists for insurance and other industries."},{"Title":"Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and Its Corporate Allies Are Taking Away Your Right to Sue","review":"For the most part, I agree with the premise of this book: That what republicans are billing as tort reform is a bad idea. One that will cost the average American dearly and reap hefty profits for big business. Corporations, now able to determine their exposure to litigation, can be free to market any product, no matter how dangerous, knowing that there will be a cap on their punitive damages. The American public becomes a guinea pig to corporate irresponsibility. Not a good picture!That said, as I read this book, I found myself going from unabashed contempt at the behavior of some big business defendants in their attempts to discredit their plaintiff's cases and obtain a 'free break' from liability to incredulity at some of what she was calling 'legitimate lawsuits'. Much of my problem with this book was what I felt I wasn't being told. A woman was abducted from a Wal-Mart parking lot and subsequently raped. She sues Wal-Mart for not having sufficient security to prevent the incident. We are never told if Wal-Mart had any security in effect at the time nor what the legal requirements on the retailer were for providing such security. Don't you think that is relevant to the legitimacy of her case?A man goes to a doctor's office to have a mole removed. The doctor performs the procedure and leaves him in the room for a period of time said to be 'long'. He falls off the table he was laying on and breaks his neck. He sues the doctor for his injury. How long was he left to wait? Might that be important? I believe that when doctor's aren't in the room with you they are doing this thing we call 'seeing other patients'. In fact, when they are in the room with you, there are actually other patients in other rooms left waiting. Do we have any information that the doctor was indeed negligent in this incident? Was he off playing video games or talking to his golf buddy while his patients were left in limbo? I guess we are supposed to assume so but are never really told such details.Even when she was on the money, as in the AHP marketing of the fen-phen diet supplement, we see huge punitive awards given to a relatively small number of litigants while we are informed that around 6 million people were affected by this drug. What happens to them? I actually know the answer to this one because I happen to personally know one of them. She got a $15,000 settlement from a class action suit against AHP, which, after the lawyers took their part, came out to just around $10,000. So a half-dozen people got to live in mansions and drive fancy cars while 6 million either went without recompense or got a pittance if they were lucky enough to join the class-action suit! Sounds fair to me!And here is a great statistical quote from page 255 of the book: \\"The Rand study found that only one out of every ten Americans injured in accidents pursue compensation for it, and of those, only two actually file a lawsuit.\\" So only 2 of those 1 out of 10 go to court! Interesting! In the end, the author does reveal her true motives. That is, a European style governance complete with universal health benefits and disability to 'take the big money out of personal injury'. Well why didn't she just say that in the first place?At different points reading this book I wanted to give it 5 stars, and, at others, 1 star. The trouble I had was that I felt it did more to legitimize 'tort reform' than to attack it because the cases presented could equally be taken in the other direction and any intelligent reader would be able to see that. True tort reform, in my opinion, would involve working toward a more consistent way of interpreting the law and assessing damages. I gave it 2 stars because I felt that there was a reasonable amount of valuable information about the corporate influence on the republican party. I would recommend reading it for that reason alone. Just be wary of the information you are not being told."},{"Title":"Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and Its Corporate Allies Are Taking Away Your Right to Sue","review":"Excellent, well researched and entertaining (in the sense that a horrifying automobile accident fascinates...).

Meanwhile, the media and politicians also bring stories of medical cost escalation, and product/service withdrawal due to high liability costs. Something has to be done!Fortunately, \\"Blocking the Courthouse Door\\" was written to provide important missing details. Mencimer reviews each of the \\"outrageous cases,\\" showing how key details had been omitted - eg. the extent of harm, the frequency with which it had occurred previously, how the award had been scaled back, etc. Suddenly the cases are no longer outrageous!Then the book moves on to aggregate data and reveals that, contrary to popular opinion, the frequency and size of suits have been declining; meanwhile, media coverage has increased.Why the \\"litigation crisis\\" myth? The movement is an alliance of insurance companies, corporate interests (eg. tobacco and asbestos companies), and political operatives. (The latter group is mostly Republicans, seeing the issue as an opportunity to increase donations from physicians and the involved industries, as well as to squeeze attorneys - a large source of Democratic donations.) Not only are industries concerned about potential lawsuit awards, but also the bad publicity - eg. the public learning how Ford had callously evaluated the cost/benefit of a $5 investment/car to reduce Pinto gas-tank fires.We also learn that issue-ads on the topic are not only intended to sway voters, but jurors as well.

On my book cover there is a full and detailed image of Kal Kr&uacute;h, the terrible creature in the story.As I'm in the process of translating this into an audio drama, I shoudl say some things. Merrit comes from a far earlier age, closer to HG Wells, for instance, than Asimov, and this is rather apparent in the voice of the dialogue. It comes a litle too fast in the book to begin with, though there is a way of making the material slightly re-ordered in time to fit modern tastes. Far, far better is his descriptive imagery, and here Merrit easily equals any of the contemporary fantasy authors. Given that he could probably not afford the long drawn out creative proces per book as such, he could no doubt have drawn even larger illustrations of his post 1st world war world of unexplored paradises and mysteries. We probably have enough, though. In this book, Leif, a young adventurer with an Indian companion, goes north after a family dispute to hunt for a while. Finds some strange geography and a confrontation with a single bizarre incident from his own past, something he only dreams about. Read on if you can get the book. Contact me if you can't.

In this terrific novel, Merritt revisits many of the themes and uses many of the ingredients that made his first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; such an impressive success. Like that early work, &quot;Dwellers&quot; features a lost civilization (of the type grandfathered by the great H. Rider Haggard), battling priestesses, civil wars, and otherdimensional creatures (in the earlier book, a light creature; in &quot;Dwellers,&quot; an octopuslike nasty named Khalk'ru that dissolves whatever life-form it touches). In this marvelous fantasy, we meet Leif Langdon, who is hiking through the foothills of the Endicott Mountains in northern Alaska with his Native American buddy. Years before, Leif had witnessed an arcane religious ritual in Mongolia, and been told by the Uighur tribesmen there that he was a descendant of Dwayanu, an ancient Mongolian king. Leif and his buddy discover a hidden valley covered by a freak Alaskan mirage, and meet the golden-skinned pygmy peoples and the Mongolian descendants that reside therein. Before long, in an instance of extreme atavism, Dwayanu takes over Leif's mind and personality, and aids him in his upcoming trials. Leif must eventually encounter a civil war between the valley's inhabitants; the storming of the fugitive city of Sirk; the charms of a witch woman with the most appropriate name of Lur; giant leeches; AND the aforementioned Khalk'ru. The book is just brimming with marvelous imagination and endless wonder, and the reader will never guess what outrageous incidents will pop up next. Merritt was truly at the top of his form with &quot;Dwellers,&quot; and threw in great detail to keep the whole conceit afloat. There are amusing side characters, interesting species of flora and fauna, some historical and metaphysical speculations, and bits of unusual anthropology. The tale proceeds with great drive and purpose, and concludes most satisfactorily, indeed. &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's excellent overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and I can well understand why. It is a tale that Haggard himself may well have enjoyed, and if you knew me, you'd know that this is high praise, indeed!

Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft.

Back in 1969 during a parade I ran into a boy of 14 in the crowd and we somehow got on the subject of Merritt. He was an enthusiastic fan and told me that his friends shared the same tastes. He said that there was a paperback bookstore near his school where the kids hung out, and that was the place to find Merritt books. It would appear that in the 42 years since then, this fondness of boys for Merritt has somehow evaporated completely. It is their loss! The style of this book is taut, sparse, no-nonsense. Merritt comes right to the point. The action never lets up. There are two different endings to this novel, one forced on Merritt by his editor, and one by Merritt himself. I read the 1962 paperback and fear that this has the editor's ending, but in any case I liked it. I have no idea what the alternate ending is like. This title was included in Moorcock's list of the 100 best fantasy novels, and it deserves to be there. People whose idea of literature is realistic novels would find this book silly, childish and low-brow, a pulp thriller for teenagers.

The hero, Lief Langdon, is handsome, athletic, intelligent and fully versed in survival skills. Regrettable he has a split personality; sometimes he is the reincarnation of the ancient cult leader Dwayanu and sometimes the fearless soldier of fortune Lief. Complicating matters is that Dwayanu has the unfortunate ability to conjure from another dimension a kraken-like being called Khalk're that has a taste for human sacrifice.Lief/Dwayanu is summoned to the land of the Mirage and becomes a troublesome focus point in the conflict of two totally different cultures; one of warrior women led by an exotic witch and the other a race pygmies and their revered human queen. Somehow the author has Lief/Dwayanu become the lover of both ladies!On the surface this story has all the elements of a lurid, dated piece of hackwork. Rest assured Abraham Merritt[1884-1943] was no hack. He was intelligent and knowledgeable of his subject matter but did not neglect the desires of his audience. Certainly this book was written as an entertainment and a grand one it is.Merritt, through the use of introspective asides, ruminates on the issues of scientific explanations for apparent occult manifestations, a familiar theme if your have read any of his other novels particularly \\"The Moon Pool\\".This novel was first published in 1932 and last reprinted in paperback in 1991. It is regrettable that Merritt's novels has not been re-printed and re-popularized like those from Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft.

All of the writers mentioned above benefited from Ralph Waldo's money. And support. In a sense, the modern environmental movement, feminism (from Margaret Fuller) and the creation of the \\"memoir\\" were made possible by Emerson's sharing of wealth.Think about it: The Scarlet Letter, Little Women and Walden all came about because of friendship with Emerson.

I nearly gave up on it in the beginning but figured I checked it out of the library so I might as well finish it. There were several factual errors that were disturbing and there were completely ridiculous chapters such as the one entitled \\"Sex.\\" She spent so much time on Margaret Fuller's love life with Hawthorne and Emerson (both of which were never consummated) that I kept asking, \\"What did Fuller contribute to the creative genius that was Concord in the mid 19th century?\\"But then Cheever would turn to Thoreau (an obvious favorite) and get brilliant. She obviously appreciates the outdoors (as I do) and I found her descriptions of nature so lovely. I love Thoreau and I loved him more after reading this book.

He was more complicated than he appeared, and she did a good job there.Cheever is at her best writing about death - the accounts of Fuller and her family drowning in a shipwreck, Emerson slowly fading away due to Alzheimer's (or dementia), Thoreau's passing, and Alcott's time as a Civil War nurse were very moving.I also thought she nailed it in her analysis of Little Women (at least nailed it as to why I loved that book).I liked her occasional personal references; this is what attracted me to her writing in the first place.American Bloomsbury gave me what I wanted - an overview.

Her journey to Concord began when she was asked to write the Introduction to a new edition of Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN, one of her favorite childhood books. She immersed herself in mid-19th century Concord, penned the Introduction and \\"kept on writing.\\"During the course of her research, she realized that she had found the topic for her next book: the salacious side of the lives of the luminaries who once called Concord home. According to Cheever, the author of several novels and nonfiction books, this was no staid group of bookish types. Along with writing some of the greatest works in the pantheon of American literature and forming many of the ideals that became the basis of modern social thought and education, Emerson and company were involved in love triangles, feuds, misunderstandings and tragedies.An intriguing aspect of AMERICAN BLOOMSBURY is the light Cheever sheds on the least famous of the subjects covered in the book: magazine editor and foreign correspondent Margaret Fuller, a bright, determined woman ahead of her time who captured the fancy of both Emerson and Hawthorne. (Fuller is the model for Hester Prynne in THE SCARLET LETTER.) Another lesser known detail is the support Emerson, Bronson Alcott and others in their circle --- who abhorred slavery and supported the abolitionist movement --- gave to John Brown in spite of the fact that Brown cold-bloodedly called five proslavery men from their homes and executed them.The Concord set endured their share of misfortune along with fame. Emerson lost his nine-year-old son, Henry David Thoreau's brother contracted tetanus after cutting himself while shaving, and Elizabeth Alcott (the inspiration for Beth in LITTLE WOMEN) died at the age of 23 from the lingering effects of scarlet fever. And perhaps most tragically, Margaret Fuller, her Italian husband and their infant son drowned when the steamer on which they sailed from Europe went off course and struck a sandbar near the coast of Fire Island, New York.We know these writers primarily through the works they left behind --- LITTLE WOMEN, WALDEN and THE SCARLET LETTER among them.

The book is not profound but makes for good bedtime reading.The less than 300 page book focuses on the literary geniuses who lived in Concord west of Boston in the mid-nineteenth century:1. Ralph Waldo Emerson was the father of the transcendentalist movement in America. Emerson (1803-1882) left he Unitarian pulpit due to his unorthodox views even for that liberal denomination. He was a great essayists and orator who travled widely in America and abroad. His great friend Thoreau may have been in love with Emerson's wife Lidian. Emerson died with alzheimer's disease. He was a relatively wealthy man who aided many of his poorer transcendentalists. He believed in Nature and the divine in each human being as preferable to belief in the God of the Bible. His work was influenced by such writers as Thomas Carlyle and philosophers such as Immanuel Kant who believed in the moral imperative.Emerson was sometimes called the \\"American Plato\\".2. Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) is famous for \\"Walden\\" reporting on his life near Walden Pond in a cabin owned by his friend Emerson. Thoreau was a Harvard graduate, a naturalist and an opponent of slavery. He was friendly with the mad abolitionist John Brown. Throreau was jailed for failure to pay his taxes. He condemned the Mexican War as a land grab which would add slave states to the Union. Thoreau never married; he and his older brother John were in love with the same woman who dumped both of them! He died of TB at a young age.3. Margaret Fuller died at age 50 being drowned in a shipwreck near Fire Island. She had returned to America with her Italian lover and her baby. Margaret was an early feminist who may have had affairs with both Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Her book on the life of women in the nineteenth century has become a classic. She was the probable model for the character of Hester Prynne in the Hawthorne classic \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\"She was brilliant, beautiful and a woman living before her time!4. Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864)was born in Salem site of the infamous witchcraft trials of the seventeenth century.Hawthorne married Sophie Peabody one of the famed women rights and abolitionists sisters. In his early married life he lived in the Old Manse owned by Emerson. He was involved in politics supporting his Bowdoin college friend Franklin Pierce. After Democratic candidate Pierce was sworn in as the 14th president his friend Hawthorne was appointed as US Consul in Liverpool. Hawthorne had a happy marriage and loved his two children. he did have an amorous interest in the fetching Margaret Fuller.Hawthorne is best known for his novels \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\"; \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" and \\"The Marble Faun.\\" His novel \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" is a roman a clef based on the months he lived at the utopian experimental Brook Farm. The character of \\"Zenobia\\" in that work is also a picture of Margaret Fuller. Hawthorne could be cold and reclusive but is one of our first great authors. Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" is dedicated to Hawthorne in token of their friendship.5. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was the tomboy daughter of the eccentric Bronson Alcott who established the utopian community of \\"Fruitlands.\\" Alcott grew up in a poor family which was often supported by friends most notably Ralph Waldon Emerson. Louisa May served as a nurse in the Civil War writing \\"Hospital Sketches\\" of her time in New York nursing Union wounded. She contracted mercury poisoning and died a few days after her father in 1888. She is best known for the immortal \\"Little Women.\\"Cheever reports on her love for the transcendentalists and their friends. She tells us how she enjoys their work and relates stories of the visits she and her family have made to Concord.This book is not a scholarly dissection of the works of these New England intellectuals. It is one woman's loving account of the personal lives of these New England geniuses."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"If we could chose our Heaven, my version might be Concord, Massachusetts, when it was home to Emerson, Thoreau and company.So, it was with delight I looked forward to reading Susan Cheever's \\"American Bloomsbury.\\" While some have pointed out minor errors that might offend scholars, for the most part, I enjoyed this opportunity to rub shoulders (in my imagination, at least) once more with my heroes and heroines.There's much in this book that's familiar, but that did not distract from my enjoyment. Cheever takes us back to the real Concord, allowing us to ignore the modern ugliness which has usurped its glory.She reminds us how one man (Emerson) formed a community which resulted in the majority of the American literary masterpieces of the 19th century. Together these men and women--Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott, Margaret Fuller and others--spawned a revolution that glorified nature, the physical world and all that's best in the human heart.True, they were not always nice and sometimes--as in the case of their support of John Brown--nave. They were geniuses and eccentrics and human and, as such, capable of error like the rest of us. Cheever revels in their achievements but does not hesitate to point out when they display feet of clay."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I purchased this book mainly because an ancestor is mentioned in it.

A quiet and unexceptional, rather quaint New England town on the outside; but inside, behind the doors of the cottages and mansions and farmhouses of Concord, a roiling river of new thought, bold ideas, and superb creative talent.How could it be otherwise when no less illustrious Americans than Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne lived there, pretty much all at the same time? And those are just the biggest names; there were many less famous but equally exciting personalities such as Margaret Fuller, an early practitioner of liberated womanhood ,whose lives also intersected, often passionately, with the Concord luminaries.American Bloomsbury, by Susan Cheever, is aptly named. Taking its title from the Bloomsbury neighborhood in early twentieth Century London that nurtured such creative talents as Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, and Vita Sackville-West, American Bloomsbury demonstrates that Concord, Massachusetts, from 1840 to 1868 contributed its own astonding galaxy of writers and philosophers.First there was Emerson, philosopher and writer, gentleman, and in many ways, the support both emotionally and financially for the other writers of Concord. It was Emerson who helped Thoreau find a place to live, whether in the Emerson house or later in a little one room shack at the edge of a pond that Thoreau would later immortalize. It was Emerson who helped the young Hawthornes get themselves established and Emerson who time and again came to the aid of the impulsive and impecunious Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa May. Through all this generosity, Emerson somehow avoided the curse of the generous; he never seems to have aroused the jealousy of the friends he so kindly and tirelessly assisted.Thoreau enjoyed Emerson's friendship. He also maintained a very warm friendship with Emerson's wife Lidian and at times seems to have stolen the affection of Emerson's wife and children. Thoreau also captured the heart of the young Louisa May Alcott, who when she wasn't mooning over Henry seems also to have developed a passion for Emerson as well. Emerson meanwhile seemed to have been strongly attracted to the writer/feminist Margaret Fuller, and she in turn seemed quite giddy about the handsome Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose delicate semi-invalid wife seems to have been his second choice, rather than his heart's original desire.Woven in with the personal conflicts between the Concord residents are many interesting struggles on the social and political scene that thinking Americans would have had to grapple with in the nineteenth century. The slavery question, the rights of women, the rights of individuals vs. the government, the rights of states vs. the nation, individual freedom and community responsibilities, the education of children ...all of these powerful and perplexing questions were grist for the minds of the Concord writers and thinkers."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Good Grief! Heavens to Betsy! There are some errors of fact in this wonderful book, American Bloomsbury! This revelation is part of the new national game of \\"Gotcha\\" and not to be viewed with any real seriousness. The blame rests not with Cheever but with the fact checkers at her publishers, who were clearly out to lunch. I am currently reading American Bloomsbury, and finding it to be an utterly absorbing description of the lives, loves and strong beliefs of the Transcendentalists. Having read these authors from my childhood throughout my life, I have been enthralled by the author's relaxed depiction of their varying backgrounds; of the context in which they wrote their great works, and of the ways in which they interacted with and affected one-another. This is a treasure of a book; don't miss it."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"As a \\"common reader\\" without special knowledge of the historical period covered by American Bloomsbury, I can't comment on its closeness to historical fact.But, while I sympathize with the reviewer who said \\"_American Bloomsbury_ [is] rife with factual errors,\\" I think it is intellectually lazy and even dishonest to simply tell us that a book is full of errors but not show us any. (Did Susan pull your hair in school?)There is certainly a place for fictionalized history. After all, Gore Vidal made his reputation writing it and a generation ago some lesser lights such as James Michener made fortunes doing it.Cheever says, about \\"Little Women\\", \\"[It], as many great books do, hovers in the gap between art and life--just alive enough so that we can recognize ourselves in its pages, just artistic enough so that we can find the lives we read about completely satisfying.\\" That is clearly where Cheever's book \\"hovers.\\"The last sentence of the book reads, \\"This book is taken from that imagined landscape, the landscape of a Concord where five people tangled with each other and the world and wrote the books that still inspire us. It is my hope that this story will serve as a introduction to that landscape and that the reader will come to love it as I have.\\"Most people who have had the pleasure and opportunity to become experts in any area of history, don't like historical fiction about their special fields of study: it seems to them like a skein of badly woven prejudices and hopeless projections. But Cheever didn't write for them. For the rest of us, the intuitions of a lover of the literature and history of this period, and of the daughter of a famous American author, combined with an admirable literary style, are sufficient."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was interesting to see the \\"pond\\" effect that Emerson's life had on the other writers. I loved Cheever's unusual choice of short chapters in her discussion of the many characters. It gave her discussion an immediacy--as in \\"Meanwhile, while so and so was...\\" I thought that to be great fun. This book is a fascinating introduction, and I found myself taking notes on what other areas I would like to explore about this period in American Literature. I LOVED the fact she referred to her family connection to the Salem Witch Trials. I am a descendant of Judge Hawthorne, the Silsbee family, the Proctors and the Porters, all prominent in Salem at the time. It is a fact that if you can get yourself back there in Salem, your ancestors were all in the thick of things. Salem was a small town--and the trials had a long term impact on the American psyche. This is one of the best books I've read all year."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Ah! This was a delightful book with historical significance! I had no idea of the literary talent concentrated in Concord, MA during an important time in our nation's history--the 1840-60's+.

Literally! It was 1AM and I really should have been sleeping, but I had to finish the book. My suggestion would be to read this together with \\"February House\\", the wonderful book by Sherrill Tippins about another community of artists, about 100 years later in Brooklyn, NY (including W.H. Auden, Carson McCullers, Gypsy Rose Lee, among others). The community in \\"American Bloomsbury\\" of course lived a more circumspect life, in keeping with the morals of the age, but there was plenty of life and love and spice anyway. Not being a specialist in this area of history and literature, I had no previous knowledge of the many interconnections between Emerson, Thoreau, the Alcotts, Hawthorn et al. And Margaret Fuller, my goodness! Now I'm looking for a biography of her. I am puzzled by some of the negative reviews here--this is one of my favorite reads so far this year!"},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Ms. Cheever makes you want to read...or perhaps reread and understand for the first time...the works of writers who shaped American thought and history."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"What a peculiar book! American Bloomsbury is easy to dislike for allthe reasons given in a number of the editorial and customer reviews:the factual errors riddling the book beginning right on page 1 (littleWaldo Emerson was 5 when he died, not 9; Emily Dickinson and other\\"neighbors\\" were not neighbors to the Concordians; the Emersons werenot married in 1838; and on and on and on), the jarring colloquialisms(Emerson as sugar daddy, Thoreau as moocher, Hawthorne as rat), thesweeping and totally unfounded assertions, and the sporadicreal-clunker sentences.Such factors as these contribute to making a bad book, but what makesthis book peculiar is that the author shows herself capable, on anumber of pages, of producing compelling, factual, graceful prose, butjust as you are lulled into the story and willing to forgive andforget the clunkers and errors just passed, she pulls you up shortwith some sensationalistic or speculative doozy that utterly breaksthe spell. In the worst cases, these sojourns into fantasy make oneangry because they are so clearly untrue -- and purposeless except asmeans to stoke the potboiler theme of the book: unconsummated lust,cerebral adultery (and maybe more!), jealousy, seethingresentment.The best example of this is her depiction of Hawthorne,whose complex moral and intellectual flaws receive no attention at allbecause Cheever chooses instead to focus one glaring spotlight on himas \\"a rat with women.\\" She quotes him out of context referring to hiswedding as an \\"execution,\\" says by marrying Sophia he traded \\"passionfor stability,\\" and has him panting after Margaret Fuller to theextent that poor equally misrepresented and maligned Sophia isdepicted as almost \\"gloating\\" over the horrific death by drowning ofMargaret Fuller, her husband, and their baby. Cheever's depiction is acolossal miscarriage of historical justice because in truth we admireHawthorne the man (as opposed to Hawthorne the author) perhaps mostfor his gloriously happy and, yes, very passionate marriage and hisfaithfulness and devotion year after year to Sophia. Cheever's versionis ridiculous, especially given that her bibliography is peppered withbiographies and other critical works that provide no foundation forher story and in fact, if read, reveal just the opposite.And yet, there are thoughtful pages on Thoreau and dozens of pagesthat cleave to the truth and show a faithful grasp of events andinfluences. There are lovely paragraphs describing nature. There arepassages that show sensitivity to the new thinking of that time, therebellious ferment,the originality and energy of this complicatedgroup of convention-busting freethinkers. But each time you begin tofloat happily along, basking in the rich glow of a glorious Americanrenaissance, you strike an iceberg like the following paragraph:\\"But the middle of the nineteenth century was a time when sexualenergy was pent up in this country, and all these people werehigh-minded prudes, usually too wrapped up in Goethe to be thinkingabout the carnal aspects of love. Even Walt Whitman had joined thepopular antimasturbation movement. None of them drank. Perhaps theabsence of actual physical intercourse, with its groping with theendless skirts of the time, made the affairs of Emerson and Hawthornewith Fuller even more intense than they might have been otherwise. Theonly thing more powerful than lust is lust denied.\\"This paragraph's problems go beyond its numerous factual errors. Buteven those factual errors are inexcusable. Emerson loved wine,Nathaniel and Sophia loved their bed, and Nathaniel perhaps drank toomuch. And that \\"popular antimasturbation movement?\\" Who knows. Thedozens of books I've read on this period have never mentioned it.So, who actually wrote this book? A split personality? A committee? Abunch of Bennington grad students with occasional oversight by theauthor? A ghostwriter? A dabbler who spread her keyboard sessions toofar apart? It's almost hard to believe it to be the work of onecoherent person. But perhaps this is no harder to believe than thatthe virtual army of \\"inestimable\\" and \\"brilliant\\" literary lights,musicians, photographers, editors, agents, and educationalinstitutions acknowledged at the back of the book were unable to helpCheever with the countless boo-boos, fibs, hyperbolic fits, and verbalinfelicities that fatally mar this book.-----------------------------------------Postscript: Does the truth matter anymore?I've just read all of the currently posted reviews, which shoot from one end of the spectrum (\\"fabulous\\" & \\"a treasure\\") to the other (\\"shoddy\\" & \\"shameful\\"). The positive reviews appear to be written largely by people with little knowledge of the book's subject matter before reading, who were entertained by its content. The negative reviews appear to be written primarily by people knowledgeable about the American Renaissance and upset by the book's many errors, conjectures, and untruths, which, for them, precluded any entertainment value.So I guess potential readers have to ask themselves: Do I place a higher value on entertainment or truth? Our current political situation and the best-seller status of fabricated works like James Frey's A Million Little Pieces would certainly indicate that as a culture we're not very concerned with the truth anymore.My recommendation then boils down to this: if you are a person who loves and values truth, do not buy this book. If you are seeking entertainment and are indifferent as to the truthfulness of what you read, you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I did not expect a great book on this subject by Susan Cheever, but I expected a fun and readable book. This is neither fun nor interesting nor particularly readable. Not only is _American Bloomsbury_ rife with factual errors -- an inexcusable breach considering the subject matter, upon which so much ink has been spilled that there is no excuse for shoddy research -- it is written in a bizarrely disjointed, juvenile tone and is the most poorly edited book I've seen in years. The interpretation of personalities and events are embarrassingly shallow, and the author can't decide if this is a personal reflection or a historical literary overview. Why, for instance, should we care about Cheever's revelation on p. 43 that \\"my ancestor Ezekiel Cheever was part of the [Salem witch] trials\\"? Ah, nepotism! Ms. Cheever must assume that her great literary name will interest readers of this book. Is there any other reason to skip into first person in the eleventh chapter of a book about the Transcendentalists?I'm such a huge fan of the Transcendentalists that I'll read *anything* on them, but slogging through the rest of this stilted mess is going to take a LOT of commitment.If you haven't purchased it yet, do yourself a favor and get the eminently superior _Emerson Among the Eccentrics_ by Carlos Baker. Read anything by David Robinson. Read _Daughter of Boston: The Extraordinary Diary of A Nineteenth-Century Woman Caroline Healey Dall_ by Helen Deese. Read Megan Marshall's marvelous contribution, _The Peabody Sisters_, read Phyllis Cole's absolutely brilliant _Mary Moody Emerson And the Origins of Transcendentalism_.There is such a wealth of wonderful books out there on this subject, there's no reason to support this shoddy effort."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"The premise seems interesting enough: use a light-hearted approach to detail the lives of the major Concord authors (Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau) and their sometimes steamy interpersonal relationships. To that end, Ms. Cheever does a decent job here. The nearly endless combinations indeed weave a transcendental web: Louisa-Henry, Louisa-Waldo, Henry-Lidian, Waldo-Margaret, Nathaniel-Margaret. And that's not even mentioning Ellen, Sophia or Count Ossoli. Thus does \\"American Bloomsbury\\" provide an overview of the lives of the originators of truly American literature.And yet, nonfiction readers deserve accuracy. And the Concord writers deserve to be remembered honestly. This book is fraught with factual errors. And we're not talking about infinitesimal, esoteric, or subjective ones. We're not even talking about interpretations. These are mistakes that could have, nay, SHOULD have been corrected by consulting the very books listed in the bibliography on pages 211-214.To Ms. Cheever's credit: she at least knew that the North Bridge wasn't standing in the mid-1800s. That's the most common mistake that writers make about this time period. But what about something as basic as the natural environment? Thoreau wouldn't have pointed out deer tracks or beaver dams to his students because both animals were rare in New England back then. He didn't see cardinals either, for they were \\"Dixie invaders\\" that didn't come north until decades later. OK, you might say. Those don't sound like big deals. We could overlook those assumptions. Fine.Concord devotees will find here more than a dozen inaccuracies regarding Thoreau alone. Some of the most egregious ones appear on page 168, where the author states that Henry died in \\"the family house he helped build on Texas Street -- now named Thoreau Street.\\" Well, that statement has multiple problems. First of all, the Thoreau family did indeed once inhabit a house built by Henry and his father. It was located on what was then Texas Street but is now Belknap Street in Concord. That house no longer exists. Secondly, there is a Thoreau Street, but the Thoreaus never lived along it. Third, Henry died in \\"The Yellow House,\\" now referred to as the Thoreau-Alcott House, which sits on Main Street. He lived there for the last 12 years of his life and died in its living room in 1862. Members of the Alcott family lived in this same house after the Thoreaus were gone. Given that the author deliberately looked for path-crossings of the Concordians, it's a wonder she didn't mention that coincidence or even that house, for that matter. And the ultimate irony is that an old photograph of the Thoreau-Alcott house graces the cover of Cheever's book! But casual readers won't know that because the photo isn't identified anywhere on the jacket or otherwise in the text.Though Cheever did a nice job with the end notes and bibliography, I'm shocked to see no credits given for the eight pages of photos. (I'll bet the suppliers of those photos are shocked as well.) That's certainly a research no-no. And even the brief photo captions are not without a glitch. The image of Thoreau is identified as having been taken \\"ten years after the publication of _Walden_.\\" What a ghoulish trick that would have been, since the book was released in 1854, and he died in 1862. No, that daguerreotype dates from 1856. Perhaps we can give the author the benefit of the doubt. Maybe her original notes read \\"two years\\" instead of \\"ten years,\\" and the printer got it wrong.Ms. Cheever is obviously passionate about her subject matter, and her research isn't all bad. But when even basic facts are misrepresented, a shadow is cast over the entire work. Remember the movie \\"Runaway Bride\\"? The USA TODAY editor told columnist Ike Graham, \\"Journalism Lesson Number One: If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.\\" I continue to be mystified by (a) how this inaccurate book got published, (b) why it continues to sell to members of an unsuspecting public, and (c) why descendants of Emerson and Hawthorne aren't lining up to file libel lawsuits. Readers of \\"American Bloomsbury,\\" beware.AFTERWORD: This review was written about the FIRST edition of this book. As of April 2007, I hear that a new edition is available which corrects the errors. I have not yet seen it to compare for myself. But readers and purchasers should be aware that multiple versions are out on the market."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Having just completed a course on the literature of the Transcendentalists, I was looking forward to learning more about their lives in American Bloomsbury. I shouldn't have. It was apparent from the beginning that this is not a sophisticated academic work--the writing is sloppy (the cliches are painful), the facts are wrong (some things are purely made up), and the tone is offensively casual for such a brilliant group of writers and thinkers. First, in her introduction, Cheever explains her attempt to present each thinker's individual perspective. She explains that some events will appear multiple times as she attempts to convey Thoreau's, Hawthorne's, Alcott's, or Emerson's interpretation of incidents they experienced together. However, Cheever never succeeds in telling more than the same 3-sentence stories over and over again in the third person. She offers little more than a tangled mess of events hopelessly lacking any sense of organization, chronology, or significance. Second, Cheever fails to acknowledge the main reason the Transcendentalists are known today: their elegant writing and intricate ideas. In her effort to describe Hawthorne's, Thoreau's, Alcott's, and Emerson's lives, she haphazardly separates the author's from their work, the people from their thoughts. She does little to connect the characters to their words or actions beyond her own whimsical conjectures about their lives. Finally, every once in awhile, Cheever lets her voice surface through her narrative. Yanking the reader from the world of Transcendentalism, she veers onto irrelevant tangents about sweltering summer roadtrips with 3 kids and a golden retriever and her reasons for visiting Plymouth Hospital 3 times (remind me again what a scratched cornea, a stomach ache, and a skinned knee has to do with Louisa May Alcott). The only reason I finished this book was to move on and get on with my life. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I've never written a review before, but I'm compelled in this case. I expected better, and not just because the name of Cheever sets a high standard. Two big problems: 1) Susan hasn't done her homework. 2) The quality of the writing is poor. I've actually only gotten to page 48 in two weeks because I'm so disspirited - and the whole Concord scene is one of my favorite topics. I live in Massachusetts, and have taken the standard tours of the Old Manse and Alcott's house, and Emerson's house a number of times. The docents on the tours have different information than Susan does. Here's an example. Emerson's favorite excuse for being late to church was that he had mislaid his gloves. It was for that reason that Thoreau built a special glove drawer for him. It was not for Lidian, as Susan stated on page 39. Did Susan not visit Emerson's house? Susan also mentions several times that Emerson changed his second wife's name from Lydia to Lidian. It seems odd that, since she thinks it important enough to mention several times, she doesn't say why he did that. Again, the tour docents, as part of their normal spiel, say that it's because the two vowels coming together (end of Lydia, beginning of Emerson) was awkward to pronounce. Simple. Why hold that back? Also, Plymouth is not on Cape Cod (page 23). It's on the mainland. It IS on the shore of Cape Cod BAY, however, but that's different. Check out MapQuest, Susan. To my second point above: I'm having to read many sentences over and over again to figure out what Susan means. There are many characters to keep straight, so there's a need for the author to be very clear whenever she uses \\"he\\" and \\"she.\\" And Susan doesn't. It's just infuriating. She'll refer to both Emerson and Thoreau in a sentence, for instance, and then start the next sentence with \\"He.\\" Arghhhh. Here's an example of confusion (page 21).\\"There had been many boarders at the Thoreaus' house over the years, but Lucy Brown's aloneness in the world with her son and daughter had captivated him (whom? What preceeds this is a poem.). She (Lucy, I presume) was a literary woman of a certain age on a protracted visit to her sister Lidian, who had married the local sage, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and moved (who moved - Lucy or Lidian?) into a big square white house (shouldn't there be commas somewhere in there? ) with him (whom? Thoreau? Emerson?) on the other side of town.\\" What a mess.I'm also puzzled by the organization of the book. In the introductory note to the reader, she explains the structure, but I find it just a mish-mash. Sorry I can't be more positive. Susan needs to go back to writing school. Or to start going."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"At first I was impressed with Susan Cheever's apt writing, and excited at the prospect of reading about some of my favorite writers. But reading this book is a little like listening to a friend who enjoys malicious gossip -- embarassing, distasteful, and finally just boring. I get the feeling that some parts are whomped up; she's trying to raise questions that the facts don't justify raising. But mostly there's an edge of bitter glee here -- as if she's enjoying anything negative she can dig up. This isn't the kind of writer with whom I enjoy spending time."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"This book has a lot to recommend it as an introduction to several brilliant individuals whose lives crossed paths in Concord, Massachusetts between about 1840 and 1870. It is an enjoyable, easy read -- with very short chapters that are organized around themes and encounters rather than strict chronology. The book brings these characters to life, reading between the lines of letters, books and journals to capture their unspoken thoughts and feelings for each other. It shows how the lives and thoughts of these thinkers, who rarely mention one another or acknowledge their debts to each other in their published works, are deeply intertwined. It also makes a serious effort to take them out of \\"ancient\\" history and show how their concerns and conceptions are not so far away from our own.It is this concern, however, to show the relevance of the lives of people like Thoreau, Emerson, Fuller, Hawthorne, Bronson and Louisa Alcott, that also accounts for several of the major weaknesses of the book. Ms. Cheever tries so hard to show that these individuals are just like us that the book reads almost like tabloid journalism -- especially in the first several chapters. I was reminded several times as I read the book of Goethe's maxim that \\"no one is a hero to his valet\\" -- that from a certain perspective even the most distinctive individuals look like ordinary folk who have passions and drives and needs and just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Only rarely does the book give a hint at what makes these individuals remarkable -- although the author is obviously fascinated by them, her descriptions of them make them seem just like peculiar and idiosyncratic folk with a sense of grandeur and peculiar ideas that made them stand out against the norm but not much more. I never got a clear sense from the book of how the ideas of these thinkers connect with their lives, and the book never gives a clear sense of what their ideas were beyond very superficial descriptions. The account of Emerson suggests again and again that apart from being charismatic and a clever writer, his most important contribution was to have inherited enough money from his first marriage to enable him to be generous with the others and create a community around him. I never saw any indication that Cheever had any idea how powerful and radical Emerson's thought really was. (Her suggestion that Thoreau and the rest of the transcendentalists were leeches on Emerson is one of many examples where Cheever chooses which of the many existing rumors to believe and report as if it were fact rather than making sure it is -- at least in the case of Thoreau, this rumor is clearly false -- as Walter Harding has shown in his excellent biography, Thoreau was very careful not to owe anything and worked hard in his father's pencil factory or later in life at surveying or even manual labor to take care of his needs, and even made sure to pay rent when he was living in his parents' house as a boarder, and had agreed with Emerson to do work around the house in exchange for room and board when he lived with him).Part of the problem is that Ms. Cheever can't seem to decide whether she wants to write a tabloid style expose of the love lives of the Concord geniuses, or a popular history, or a personal account of her own fascination with that history. In the last half of the book Ms. Cheever figures more and more prominently in the book -- her personal feelings and responses to the history begin to overwhelm that history. For example, she can have no sympathy whatsoever for (and no clear understanding of) the Concord thinkers' admiration for John Brown -- because she cannot understand why they would have seen him as anything else than what she sees him to be: a cold-hearted murderer, whose passionate ideals led to outrageous and insane actions. In the end, I think that the best way to describe this book is not as a genuine history, but as an imaginative attempt to tell the story of these characters that Ms. Cheever had come to love in a way that made sense of them to her. While there is value in such an approach, it should not be mistaken for an accurate history. As other reviewers note, she invents a great deal and reads a great deal into things that may not be there (e.g. Alcott's admiration for Thoreau and Emerson is read as her having fallen in love with her teacher and her father's friend). The book is also in need of some serious editing -- there are several parenthetical points or asides or statements of fact irrelevant to the paragraphs or chapters in which they are included. Several words are misused consistently throughout (\\"insure\\" is used when she means \\"ensure,\\" for example).I did enjoy reading this book quite a bit -- I'd read Emerson and Thoreau and read biographies of both, but had never read an account of all the remarkable people whose lives connected in Concord. It is a quick and easy read -- and gives a valuable shorthand version of the period that I will definitely want to flesh out by reading some of the other biographies and history that she relied upon and mentions in her notes at the end. Ms. Cheever obviously cares about the people she writes about -- and it would be hard to walk away from this volume without likewise caring."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"As I read \\"American Bloomsbury,\\" I found I lost confidence in it.

The writing reminds me of student essays shoddily constructed out of poor Internet research. Beyond the factual errors other reviewers have mentioned, the narrative is sloppy and needs a good edit. At times she leaves out critical information, referring to characters she has yet to introduce. She must not have thought anyone would read it to leave it in such a state."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"It is true that the authors lived and loved, bled and cried, but some of the 'facts' presented in this book are skewed or downright wrong.She says that Thoreau was the model for Laurie from Little Women. Louisa clearly states in a letter to Alfred Whitman, a young man from Concord who helped the Alcott girls with their plays, on January 6, 1869, \\"'Laurie' is you & my Polish boy 'jintly'[jointly].\\" The \\"Polish boy\\" she is refering to is a boy she met while in Switzerland five years earlier, Ladislas Wisniewski.Anyone who has ever toured the Old Manse, where Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne lived in the three years following their marriage, knows that Emerson didn't own the house his grandfather built. It was owned by his step-cousin, Samuel Ripley, and the reason the Hawthornes were asked to leave was not because Emerson was jealous of Hawthorne's (in reality, purely friendly) relationship with Margaret Fuller, but because of a combination of Hawthorne's inability to pay the rent he owed, and Ripley's desire to retire to his family home.Reading the letters Nathaniel wrote to Sophia and the few that remain of the letters she wrote back, particularly right after their marriage, one finds it impossible to believe this idea that he had any romantic feelings towards another woman.Ralph Waldo Emerson also had just married his (second) wife, Lidian when Emerson is supposed to have had this romantic infatuation with Fuller. And for those of you who have read Mr. Emerson's Wife, no, she did not have an afair with Thoreau. Nathaniel, Sophia, Waldo, and Lidian all respected Margaret's genius at conversation and welcomed her as a friend, but there was no cause for jealousy in the group.I have spent the past 7 years working in and around Concord at the museums in the area and researching the families and their interactions with eachother. I have grown to love the authors through the records they and thier children have left behind and am sadened to see how modern authors mistreat and distort the facts to create a supposedly more interesting story than what already exsists.Concord was an attractive place for these families because of the history already there. It was the spot of the first battle of the American Revolution. Emerson was drawn to the place where his grandfather had made a home and where he spent several happy years as a boy. Intellectuals of the time were drawn to Emerson's new ideas which he published in his book, Nature, after his dissatisfaction as a minister. Hawthorne moved back to Concord in 1852 to a house he called the Wayside which he purchaced from the Alcotts (a house which now is in dire need of repair because of the Park Service's tragic lack of respect for the first literary home it ever aquired)and enjoyed many years of conversation with Emerson and Alcott and Thoreau.There is a lot more that I could say about this book and the real history of Concord, but time runs short. If you want to know about Concord, read the letters and journals of the authors who lived there and visit the museums, like the Wayside, that still (for the time being) are open to the public for its edification."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I couldn't resist buying American Bloomsbury by Susan Cheever because the subject matter fascinated me. It's about the lives of several renowned American writers in Concord MA in the 1840's, including Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. While the historical facts were indeed fascinating, I found Cheever's writing style to be more like a term paper than what could have been an inspiring and involved account of an amazing intellectual group of individuals who came together and influenced the literary history of our country. Even worse, as I pushed myself through the book, the time line and relationships were presented in a very confusing way, jumping back and forth over the course of a few years. I was glad to read about these incredible writers' lives, but I wish it had been in a more engaging and organized format."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I agree with all of the previous reviews in stating that a lot of the facts are wrong.

Her heart goes out to the 5 men executed by John Brown in Kansas, but not a word for those who died in the middle passage or more directly as a result of the 'peculiar institution.' She finds it difficult to understand why the Transcendentalists could have been so mislead. They weren't.

Halfway through the book, all I could think was that this book is the most irresponsible example of history I've read. Cheever seems to be infatuated with Concordians to the point that she is fantasized her own melodramatic and creepy love story to tie all of the famous transcendentals together, based purely on myth that most historians flatly refute. Not only was I upset with the history she is propagating, but then to think that a team of editors approved this work that seems to ignore research. Cheever seems like a groupie who knows some basic facts and then creates the rest of her own. As an educator who tries to help my students separate fact from fiction and get past the famous myths of history, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this book now, because I don't want it on my bookshelf and I can't give it away to anyone or donate it, because then I am also dissemanating poor information."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"In a way, I liked this book. There was something about it that kept me reading it. Some of it was disbelief over what was being said in comparison/contrast to previous things I had read and known about some of these people.

The Margaret Fuller and Alexander Von Humboldt books being masterworks by authors as great as their subjects. The Thoreau so you can see how his life was not one of antisocial leisure, but a guidepost towards how society might organize itself were we to all consider our own roles in it first, were we all to take responsibility for our own shaping of the world in which we live.In comparison to those three books, this is a book in which it feels like everyone, while being memorialized, is given short-shrift, or even ridiculed to a degree."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Do NOT buy the Kindle edition of this book!

The three stars won out because it's a great idea for a book but misses in execution. One of the reviews refers to People magazine, which is unfair. I would describe it as something like a series of pretty good articles in Vanity Fair or The New Yorker. These are fascinating subjects - the beautiful people of their day - and the treatment here is somewhat superficial. It's a little like showing up at a party expecting real food only to discover a skimpy selection of hors d'oeuvres set out on the coffee table: it isn't that the offering isn't tasty, it's that there isn't enough and the presentation is uninspired. And in the same way I might leave the party craving a meal, I left this book desperate for something more substantial. (In my case, a rereading of Thoreau and The Peabody Sisters by Megan Marshall.)This book has been touted as a \\"group biography\\" which is, I suppose, a reasonable description. What this book gets right is pulling together the players and places associated with the Transcendental Movement of the 19th century. Where the book misses is in providing some context - historical, cultural, economic, social - that would have explained how and why these people and events were set apart. There are a few hints, but I found myself often going to the internet to flesh out the details. I also ended up putting together my own timeline to keep straight the comings and going, the relative ages of the people described, and to figure out what other writers and thinkers of the period may have been doing at the time. I fear that some of the confusion may have been intentional. For instance, Louisa May Alcott may have had a schoolgirl crush on Thoreau but since she was around 9 years old when her family arrived in Concord, \\"Louisa in Love...Henry David Thoreau\\" does seem a bit like a tabloid come-on.I found the weirdly elastic treatment of time in the book very confusing. At one point, Margaret Fuller is dead, then a discussion of her relationship with Emerson and she is alive again without a clear explanation of when in time the events occurred. Sometimes, the author's own life and experiences researching and writing the book are included. I liked hearing about the impression of seeing these homes for the first time and yet the passages are often jarring, removing me from the story with irrelevant, occasionally annoying, details. (Really, what New Englander doesn't know the tourist zoo Concord has become?) And while we're on the topic of geography, a map of the Concord site would have been extremely helpful.And yet I liked this book. I like the idea of this book. The story is compelling, even if the telling is less so. Our book group generally liked the book, too, and it was interesting enough for everyone, no matter how familiar they were with the lives and literary contributions of the subjects. For some readers, this book will provide just enough information about the Transcendentalists. The rest will appreciate the jump-start on exploring the topic for themselves."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Such a long title for such a slim work. Yes, back in the mid-nineteenth century, American Transcendentalism flourished in Concord, Massachusetts, primarily because of the ideas and pocketbook of Emerson. All of the titular writers lived in Concord (at least off and on), inspired each others' fiction and non-fiction, and intermingled in (for some) chastely passionate ways. I liked some of the information here, but felt the book was too sketchy and simply cannot claim to cover, except in a cursory way, \`their work' in any complete sense. Hawthorne's passion for Fuller is definitely echoed in The Scarlet Letter, Thoreau's experiences on Walden Pond are an accurate reflection of his thoughts and his \`simplified' personality and outlook in Walden, and Louisa May Alcott's family and circumstances are the basis for Little Women; however, Fuller and Emerson do not get the literary discussion the title seems to promise. Enjoyable, but not a complete work on Cheever's part."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"AMERICAN BLOOMSBURY is a study of the \\"genius cluster\\" centered in Concord, Massachusetts, 1835 - 1888, beginning with the arrival of Ralph Waldo Emerson and ending with the death of the last of the neighborhood's classic writers in the neighborhood. With the inheritance from a short-lived first wife from a wealthy family, Emerson largely supported friends like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, the Alcott family and Margaret Fuller as they launched their careers. They shared Transcendentalism and a passion for intellectual pursuit. As in most close-knit communities, they had their intrigues, jealousies and fall-outs. The hope and beauty of a New England spring day is reflected in their early ambitions and again in their salutes to one another at the end of their lives. The themes they drew on, the events they witnessed at home and abroad, and the impact of the Civil War articulate the greater American experience of the 19th century.Though I'm very familiar with the writers' works, I hadn't studied their lives closely and this was a good general introduction, often full of surprises. Cheever vividly evokes the personages and setting with a storyteller's skill. I did not realize how fully she developed them until I felt the pang of loss as their mortality set in. This is by no means exhaustive biography or history; in fact, Cheever moves through it rather breathlessly. Her style is intended for a very general audience, not an academic one.The book is not perfect. Although she moves from 1835 to the last death, of Louisa May Alcott who is only a child at the outset, Cheever chooses to order her information around themes or events in their lives, which do not necessarily flow chronologically. She kind of swirls around and around as she moves through the 19th century. In one chapter, even one paragraph, she may bounce back and forth between several years. The coming of the railroad is experienced more than once, though from slightly different perspectives. Poor Margaret Fuller drowns at least 3 times. Sometimes you are left asking, now when exactly is this happening? Her chapters are quite short, 3 - 5 pages, which makes for a rather breakneck pace through the facts. She provides a time line, plenty of research notes and citations and an extensive bibliography at the back of the book that help answer questions that may arise."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"This book repeats a lot of inaccurate cliches about these writers that haven't been taken seriously for a generation or two. A number of reviewers here have pointed out its factual errors. But what really surprised me was the old-school Confederate apologia that creeps in throughout the first three quarters and grows into an ugly rant when Cheever gets to the Transcendentalists' support for John Brown.At the start of her discussion of John Brown, Cheever mentions about as briefly and vaguely as possible the sustained violence of the pro-slavery side before the war (though not really of slavery, which remains curiously abstract for her here, as elsewhere). But she describes the violence of Brown's raids in the goriest details she can imagine -- the sound of knife on bone, the smell of guts and vomit. It's the most vivid description in the book. In a familiar pattern, the constant, ubiquitous violence of slavery and its supporters gets barely an acknowledgement, but any violence by its opponents is recounted in lavish, horrified detail.It never occurs to Cheever that anyone could have opposed slavery enough to feel violenct resistance was justified. Brown is just a religious lunatic to her, or a \\"con man.\\" And suddenly she has contempt for the subjects of her book, the same people who brilliance and importance she describes in rapturous superlatives everywhere else. She dismisses Thoreau and Alcott as \\"immature boys who had never been able to support themselves\\" (as if their poverty invalidated their politics) and Emerson -- who, as the \\"eminently practical father figure for those feckless boys,\\" should have known better -- as an effete intellectual perhaps \\"too caught up in translations of Goethe and Pindar\\" to understand the reality of what he supported.In fact, the whole Civil War seems misguided and unnecessary to her. She approvingly cites Robert Penn Warren's portrait of the war as the needless result of Northern zealotry: \\"Brown was a 'higher law man.' ... Unhappily, a corollary of this divine revelation was to make the South pay, and pay again. The disagreement might conceivably have been settled under terms of law, but ... there is only one way to conclude a theological argument: bayonets and bullets.\\" I'm sure the people being exploited, beaten, raped, and murdered by their slave-drivers would have loved to see the \\"disagreement\\" settled amicably, if it only hadn't been for those irrational Northern theologians and their war of aggression.Much of Cheever's perspective in this discussion comes from Warren, and she quotes him extensively. What she doesn't mention is that she's quoting from Warren's first book from 1929, back in his pro-segregation days as the de facto leader of the reactionary \\"Southern Agrarian\\" movement. He repudiated these earlier views in the 1950s when he became an advocate for the Civil Rights Movement. Cheever exploits Warren's moral and intellectual authority without ever acknowledging that he recanted the attitudes on which the book she cites was based.And to top it all off, at the end of this ugly chapter, Cheever tries to suggest that the Transcendentalists were justly punished, though whether for their support of Brown or of the war itself is unclear: \\"The Civil War, when it came, would destroy Concord.... By the time it was over, both Hawthorne and Thoreau would be dead, Emerson would be on the path to the severe Alzheimer's disease that crippled him so completely that at the end of his life he couldn't spell Concord, and Louisa May Alcott would have changed from a dreaming girl into an angry, sick, and very practical middle-aged spinster. Were they the victims of a greedy, warmongering South? Or did they help bring on the catastrophe with their own willful innocence and self-righteousness?\\" This is nuts. Thoreau's and Hawthorne's deaths had nothing to do with the Civil War, and neither did Emerson's Alzheimer's more than a decade later. Only the description of Alcott has anything to do with the war, though that too leaves so much out of the story, as Cheever should know. But applying the sexist caricature of the bitter old maid to Alcott at all is snide and inappropriate, as is the gratuitous and sadistic detail about Emerson's dementia. Emerson's dementia is clearly not gratuitous to Cheever, though. a crucial point in this discussion for Cheever, though. She centers her whole, incredibly vapid conclusion to this chapter on a description of an 1880 Emerson lecture \\"patched together by his daughter and his secretary because he was too far gone to write his own lectures and almost too far gone to deliver them\\" and then imagines his audience getting bored and staring out the window. Take that, Northern Aggressor!A lot of what Cheever wants to do in this book is dish about how various famous people were in love with one another. Usually, she's wrong. It's like middle school gossip -- \\"I know who Nathaniel likes!\\" -- interspersed with purple passages about \\"the madness that envelops lovers on hot summer nights.\\" The title should have suggested how trite and and superficial the book would be. I should have read the reviews and spared myself. But I had no idea I was in for such old-school pro-Confederate bias. It's unpleasant."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne loved Concord. Cheever contends that Louisa May Alcott loved Thoreau and Emerson and that Thoreau was the model for Laurie in LITTLE WOMEN. Emerson, Thoreau, the Alcotts, Hawthorne, and Margaret Fuller were connected to each other at Concord. They were Transcendentalists.It is possible that Transcendentalism was part of a wave of liberalism. It was a case of synergy. The mood was exuberant. There was new energy. Influenced by Kant, they believed in the power of intuition.Emerson prized Thoreau's honesty. The friendship of the two men lasted for twenty-five years. They were both learned and unconventional. Emerson supported the Alcotts directly and Hawthorne indirectly with money derived from his first wife's share of her family fortune.Hawthorne's grandfather had been one of the judges at the Salem Witch Trials. Ezekial Cheever, Susan Cheever's ancestor, had played a part at the trials. The troubles in the community may have been a disguise for a land grab or a result of hysteria. Hawthorne and Emerson never really liked each other. Alcott combined pretension and charismatic idealism. The Fruitlands experience took place in 1843. Louisa referred to it later as 'Apple Slump'. The Alcott family had returned to Concord by 1845.The shack Thoreau built near Walden Pond is gone. Walden Pond is one of the ponds created by the uneven melting of glacial ice. WALDEN was intense, brilliant. Thoreau transformed his raw journals into a masterpiece. Margaret Fuller was a model for Hawthorne's character, Zenobia, in THE BLITHEDALE ROMANCE. After Fuller's death Henry James dubbed her the Margaret Ghost. Hawthorne's real career as a writer began after THE SCARLET LETTER was published.When the Hawthornes moved to the Berkshires Hawthorne encountered Melville and Holmes. Melville's MOBY DICK evidences Hawthorne's intensity. At Walden Pond Thoreau wrote A WEEK ON THE CONCORD AND MERRIMACK RIVERS. WALDEN was written later. It was brought out in 1854. Neither book was popular. Thoreau invented nature writing. He left Walden in 1847.The Hawthornes spent four years in Liverpool during the Franklin Pierce presidency. When Buchanan was elected in 1856 Hawthorne lost his post. The family moved to Italy. Thoreau died in 1862. Somewhat later Hawthorne died. Louisa May Alcott wrote LITTLE WOMEN in 1868. Emerson's health and energy declined. Members of the group are buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetary.In general, the book is delightful. It celebrates the sustained gathering of geniuses."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I was hooked on this gem of a book from page one.

Thank goodness I didn't buy it! A 'nice early review' quoted on Cheever's website (without a source) described the book as a \\"dishy romp\\" with the \\"Concord gang\\" and, indeed, Cheever has managed to turn one of the richest, most fascinating periods of American life and letters into a cheesy bodice-ripper. And it's so poorly written!

Devoid of reference notes, one is left having to accept author Cheever's recreations of the personalities and relationships of the participants. The book has value to the degree she has fleshed this out accurately. It is certainly a more engaging read than an academic study and it is tempting to believe that she has channeled reality. Whether she has drawn too many conclusions or drawn conclusions accurately is something the lay reader will not know. But there is a much more serious problem with this book. It is the creation of a small-minded, conservative, 21st century copperhead. She sneers at the Brook Farm community; contemns the abolitionist movement for pushing the country into civil war by not giving politics and compromise a chance, in jaw-dropping ignorance of history; despises John Brown and condemns the Concord circle for supporting him and thus betraying their former nature-loving pacifism. Actually, it is of course much to their credit that in the refining fire of this second American revolution they were completely committed to the right side (by and large -- Hawthorne was a waffler), unlike the author who is apparently trying singlehandedly to bring back copperheadism after 145 years. Thoreau's greatest political work is not the essay that has come down to us as \\"Civil Disobedience\\", an immature scribbling author Cheever (and M.L. King and Mahatma Gandhi) is apparently fond of. The mature Thoreau was no pacifist. \\"In Defense of Captain John Brown\\" was nothing less than a call to arms. Cheever much prefers the naive youthful pacifist Thoreau.On parsing the lives of the Concord transcendentalists and the authors that wrote in the wake of that movement, this book is engaging -- if one can accept a \\"popularizing\\" (read \\"dumbing down\\") style of writing. In its popularization though, it could seem to some that it might be appropriate for a youthful audience. But I wouldn't recommend it to them. Lacking historical knowledge and respecting authorial opinion, they'll come away from it wondering if fighting against slavery was a mistake."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"This is really more of an historical novel; it reveals more about the sad state of the author's mind than it does the lives of any of the literary giants associated with Concord.

It was interesting to read biographical details, especially of Thoreau and Hawthorne, but I felt that she was just scratching the surface and not really delving into her subjects' lives or works. She also has the annoying habit of adding uninteresting tidbits about her visits to the authors' homes or towns which don't really add anything to the narrative.

This is the second of two current books focusing upon that creative beehive (or as the author terms it a \\"genius cluster\\") of the 19th Century, Concord, Massachusetts. The other book is Samuel A. Schreiner, Jr., \\"The Concord Quartet.\\" The author focuses upon the Alcotts (Bronson and Louisa May), Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne and \\"Their Lives, Thier Loves, Their Work.\\" The question of whether having a number of creative types in close proximity to one another enhances their ability to produce outstanding work is a very interesting one. The Scottish Enlightenment is another instance of where this synergy likely occurred. The book discusses the central individuals in sufficient depth that the reader gets a solid grasp on each one and their individual situations. What the book does not do, and probably was not meant to do, was explore what they created in any depth. For example, there is hardly a reference to Transcendentalism in the entire book, and the important books the subjects wrote are hardly discussed at all. But clearly the author believes that how these folks interacted and influenced each other is the focal point of her story--and that she does very well. The book runs 200 or so pages, with many very short chapters, and includes helpful illustrations, some notes and a bibliography. I found the author's style quite engaging, and I recommend the book as a quick overview of these central characters in American intellectual history."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I am not overly-knowledgeable about the \\"Concordians,\\" but am reasonably literate. I'm much more familiar with the London Bloomsburians, and love literary biography. I am not qualified to speak to the alleged plethora of inaccuracies in the book, but even without that, it's a very disappointing book. Yes, it's readable and somewhat entertaining, but I'm learning very little about the thought and inner lives of the Transcendentalists. The book also moves confusingly between what would charitably be called analysis, and chronology. I suppose this is a fault of editing, but it makes the book less coherent. The only positive to having bought this is that I now plan to read some of the good books recommended by other disappointed reviewers."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"This book reads like a series of front page stories from a trash tabloid. It is gossipy in tone with very little substance or thought. It is as if the author did a skimming summary of other works and through this book together in order to meet a deadline. \\"Chapters\\" are often 3-4 pages long. At times the leap between topics between chapters leaves one puzzled and confused.She would have done better to created a pot boiler of a 19th century soap opera graphic novel - that would have been worth seeing and would have put the book in the proper context."},{"Title":"American Bloomsbury: Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives, Their Loves, Their Work","review":"I'm still scratching my head over this one. One the surface, its concept is fascinating: some of the greatest thinkers and strongest personalities of the 19th century presented in an engaging narrative format. Even so, it's hard to tell how much of this book is \\"story\\" and how much is \\"fact\\". Cheevers's attempts at presenting a linear narrative are also not so successful. I think it is this \\"fiction-like\\" presentation that confused me... Each scene had me questioning its authenticity or factual accuracy (even if it was true, it's hard to read it as such)."},{"Title":"Anthropology as Cultural Critique: An Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences","review":"This classic work by Marcus and Fischer is still important to an understanding of changing global and local conditions in postmodernity and how we, as ethnographers, might proceed. This text was very helpful in the researching and writing of my ethnography (now a book: Native Americans in the Carolina Borderlands: A Critical Ethnography, Carolinas Press, 2000). I needed help in conceptualizing hybrid cultural forms and found it in Marcus's and Fisher's text. I also found the text useful for helping me think through the popular cultural critique that needed to be articulated from the everyday discourses of my participants. If you are interested in critical ethnography, this is a must read. Anthropologists, Sociologists, and folks in Cultural Studies and Communications will want to have this text in their reference libraries."},{"Title":"Perfume: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Finest Fragrances","review":"This book is an invaluable handbook for anyone interested in the components of different fragrances, what the exact scents used were, and to get a feel for the &quot;personality&quot; of a perfume without having to go out and try on every single one.It is especially a treasure trove for me, oddly enough because I have a very poor sense of smell due to a skull fracture. But I am utterly fascinated by scents, and I just got tired of asking other people to choose a perfume for me. Who knew what I was getting? This gives me a wonderful sense of whether a perfume is something I would feel comfortable in, and now I get a great many compliments!!Well written, with good descriptions of the various perfume ingredients, and even the mood they are apt to evoke. Plus an interesting bit of history on each of the major houses, and where they appear to be headed. It's my bible, and a fascinating peek into the finest fragrances of our time."},{"Title":"Perfume: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Finest Fragrances","review":"For perfume connoisseurs 'The Perfume Companion' by Nigel Groom is the book to read. Nigel has lived and worked in South Arabia, which had previously been the centre of the incense trade; frankincense being a staple of ancient perfume. It is a book for amateurs and professionals alike. The book contains a highly regarded 'Perfume Directory', which is a r&eacute;sum&eacute; about 97 major perfume houses. Read about grand old French perfume houses such as Coty, Houbigant and D'Orsay; the perfumes of couture houses such as Chanel, Christian Dior and Givenchy and the big American names such as Est&eacute;e Lauder, Elizabeth Arden and Donna Karan. The book also describes the history of perfume, principal ingredients, classifications as well as the leading perfumers and perfume manufacturers of today."},{"Title":"Perfume: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Finest Fragrances","review":"This is an excellent book that not only gives information about the perfume itself but also about the Designer/Company that produces it. It also gives recent info what happened to the Company/Designer, who maybe bought the label etc. It also lists other perfumes of that company/Designer although that could be a bit more extensive. What I like about the book is that the standart info about development of perfume/perfume bottles, manufacturing process etc. is relatively short because just about every book about perfume covers that. This book is more about recent information and new Perfumes and Designers without missing mentioning a lot of the older ones as well. It is excellent value for money."},{"Title":"Perfume: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Finest Fragrances","review":"Charming COFFEE TABLE BOOK, and NO more. &quot;Ultimate&quot; nothing. Book has no voluptous descriptions, and WHERE is the part that tells you how to choose? I didn't find it in the book.

Goes into details and boring history on the HOUSES, NOT the scents themselves. Dissappointing."},{"Title":"Perfume: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Finest Fragrances","review":"I absolutely adore this book. It gives the basic profiles of many well known fragrances. No, it does not give exactrecipes, but just having a starting point from some fragrances that you have loved, and knowing some of the things to avoid from some fragrances that you have detested makes this an invaluable volume! (Avoid those costly errors!)

This book represents a modern treatment of Brown's work, written in 1952, in that the illustrations pull the reader farther into the story than the text does, which was considered verboten then. This helps make this simple book of rhyme more engaging for young readers. While it would work as a classroom read-aloud, it's a better bedtime book, one that would be a wonderful gift for a new grandma, too"},{"Title":"The HORSE IN THE ATTIC","review":"Contrary to what you might expect, this short book is not a fantasy; rather, it offers the popular theme of the Country Cure, as well as the rewards of historical research. Readers will receive an easy instruction in the skills of art restortion and the thrill of an auction. Related in the first person, thisstory tells how Caroline became horse crazy at age 11 and whyher family ultimately moved out to the country--where she would more easily afford riding lessons.During the renovation of the century-old house which they bought, Caroline discovers a locked trap door into an unknown attic, where she finds severaldusty paintings--long stored and forgotten. She falls in love with one of a black race horse and eventually hangs it/her in her room, where she fantasizes about having her own horse. This family offers a refreshing change from the usual dysfunctional dynamics one encounters in YA literature. I particluarly enjoyed the relationship between Caroline and her father; they shared a unique bond, as the country helped their outlooks on life bloom. Clymer also provides a gentle introduction into archival methods and art appreciation. Reads as swiftly as Dark Lady herself!"},{"Title":"The HORSE IN THE ATTIC","review":"I simply adored this fictional story of a girl who finds and grows to love the painting of a long ago racehorse in the attic of her family's new home.The love that the young girl felt for the painting and the horse in it really appealed to me and the search to discover the idenity of the artist was interesting.There is just a feeling about this book that I really enjoyed."},{"Title":"Pit Bulls For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"It is so-so.

This is ridiculous, the clowns running Denver are wrong for having these great dogs destroyed. To those of us who own them we view them as trusted members of our family and these dogs are just as loving as any other breed if not more.

I now have three. My entire family has come to love my dogs as members of our family and the dogs return the love as well.What breed are you going to ban in Denver next? Rottweilers? Dobermans?

Though I don't have any creditials like a \\"doctorate in Vet Medicine\\" or \\"Canine Behavorial Sciences degree\\". I can say from my experience of owning a pit bull and being on side of the ignorant stereotyper who thought they were some vicious breed before I owned one that I will say this book gives an ok view oon these dogs. Owning a dog is more than reading a book or going to pet classes at some pet retail store. You have to understand the genetic dispositon and behaviors you want to encourage and discourage before even having the dog in the house. Most people don't know that. These are high maintenence dogs to some people. And obviously they're not that vicious if I'm here writing this to you and obviously cars kill more people than dogs but I don't see ban on those or deer.

By no means should this be the only book anyone considering bringing an American Pit Bull Terrier home should read ~ because of the modern controversy and circumstances surrounding these courageous, loyal, and amazing dogs, any potential responsible owner should read every book on the subject he/she can get his/her hands on.I find it unfortunate that the lawyer from Denver, CO, who ~ to my knowledge ~ was never educated in any form of animal behavioral science or canine anatomy, wishes to use this particular forum to spread his own ill-informed political agenda.

However, this author is the same one who has written several other 'Breed for Dummies' books, and apparently hasn't had a lot of experience with all of them. This book would've been much better had it been written by someone with a lot of experience in the breed, like Stratton or Jessup. The training section with simplistic and very biased, the author didn't even mention alternate training methods, and gave no suggestions for what to do if this method doesn't work.

While I have owned dogs before, I appreciated the sections on basic care because it brought me up to date on the latest thinking and it eliminated the need for me to buy another book on general dog care that I probably would not have.

What made the pits fight like they do is mixing in TERRIER BLOOD !!! Terriers are bred to hunt down little animals, rats, mice, etc. that is what they mixed with pit bulls to make them PIT BULL TERRIERS!!! I have a pit who lives with two other dogs, a cat, and a number of small rodents and birds that are our pets, and children; he is a therapy pet, a service dog, and a wonderful companion. I think you people in denver are not addressing the situation properly. Its not the breed you should be attacking, but the horrible owners who abuse them into thinking that they should attack. All the people in Denver are going to do is find another dog to use. There are plenty of other types of dogs that are much more aggresive then pits, pits are just cheaper. What about Presas or Cane Corsoes, bet you didnt check them, they are much bigger and more dangerous than pits.(Nothing aginst Presa or Corso folks, im just making a point.)Anyone who wants a breed banned is missing the big picture, the people who are training these anamails ! The people who are training them to fight are NOT the USA's finest to say the least, THEY ARE YOUR TRUE PROBLEM ! You could make a golden or a lab attack to kill of you try hard enough!

To sum up quickly, anyone who would consider themselves a &quot;dummy&quot; on American Pit Bull Terriers, or other Bully breeds, should not even consider owning one.The book itself does its part to combat the myths and incorrect stereo-types surrounding Pit Bull Terriers and other Bully breeds, but a good deal of the information is incorrect. Its clear the author has not had much direct experience with Pit Bull Terriers. There are references made to certain characteristics of the breed that have nothing to do with the quality of the line as the author would have you believe. Plus, the author lumps other breeds (such as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Bull Terriers) as being Pit Bulls, despite the different lineages and standards between them. The only dog that can properly be referred to with the term &quot;pitbull&quot; is the American Pit Bull Terrier and none of the other Bully breeds. If you are writing a book on a subject you should understand your subject matter.It was obvious the author was familiar with other breeds and how to relate to them, but treating an APBT in the same manner as you would a Golden Retriever will get you one disobediant APBT. The book does state that Bully breeds may not be for everyone and require a certain type of owner, but I think that the author's lack of work with Pit Bulls and the Bully breeds mentioned shows in the writing. These dogs are remarkably headstrong when they want to be. Being stubborn is almost second nature and this turns many would-be owners into giving up their Pit Bulls to shelters. They require determined, consistent owners who can not only be firm when dealing with the dog but deal with the ignorance of others in regards to their new friend.The book was not all bad. The author was correct in showing the warm personalities of Pit Bulls and other Bully breeds. I think for PR purposes the book did a great job in trying to clear up some of the nonsense surrounding Pit Bulls. And as most of those holding to the ignorant rhetoric and outrageous &quot;facts&quot; about these dogs could be summed up as &quot;dummies,&quot; maybe the book will do good in reaching that part of the population.As having dealt with American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and Bulldogs for the good portion of my life I can tell you with experience how truly wonderful these breeds are and can be. Though if you are interested in any Bully breed it is important you do your homework! Know what you are getting into by reading books from experienced authors and actually going to speak with breeders and fanciers. Do not read only one book and do not visit only one breeder.

Melville's \\"White Jacket\\" is a book that Goffman often referred to in order to illustrate different aspects of life within the total institution.The introductory essay to this book discusses White Jacket in relationship to the growing bro-ha-ha over slavery, but I thought the book was much more interesting then that.What was most suprising to me, having never read Melville before, was how funny some of the chapters were. Episodes involving Surgeon Cuticle amputating the leg of an unwilling seaman recall the funniest moments of television shows like Monty Python or the Simpsons.Melville's accurate portrayal of life within the \\"T.I.\\", reminded me of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". There, the setting is an insane asylum, here it is a Man O' Wear, but both books deal with the tactics and strategies an individual might employ when faced with an oppressive living environment.Although I am not sure when, or if, I might try to tackle author's masterpiece 'Moby Dick', I did come away from this book with a profound respect for Melville's capabilities as a writer. I will no longer take for granted his status among the pantheon of American writers."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"The title, \\"White Jacket\\", serves as a double entendre by the author, Herman Melville. He actually sews up a hand-stitched jacket made from white sail cloth and other material, but it is ill-fitting, continually wet, ineffective against the cold, and actually the source of trouble between himself and the crew. So, the white jacket is a suit of his own making that very well brings about his own downfall. In the end, he discards it when he sees himself about to drown. And so, Melville uses this theme to serve as a metaphor for white superiority and the threatening danger of civil war over slavery.Indeed, Melville experiences effective slavery during his voyage aboard the USS United States (USS Neversink in the book) during its run from the Pacific back to the Atlantic. And like so many black slaves, he and his crewmates suffer the ever-present threat of public lashings for even minor infractions. So, Melville also uses his book as an indictment against a hypocritical system, whereby officers are never wrong and never experience corporal punishment but the enlisted crew remain in perpetual danger of arousing the slightest displeasure of any officer with the ultimate result of a humiliating public lashing. However, no military organization could function effectively if it were a democratic institution; who would ever risk their life in such a case? (Even the early Communists quickly abandoned that principle.)But the vast majority of the book focuses on the minute details of life aboard a frigate during the age of sail. Several hundred (500?) souls are packed into the space of a single wooden vessel for months on end. How the ship is organized and the rituals of life aboard ship are the mainstay of the book. Melville describes in factual detail the actual work (trimming sails, cleaning decks, etc.), the daily routines (meals on deck, standing watches, playing cards in secret, sleeping in the crew's quarters), the professions (sailor, waistman, quartermaster, boatswain, carpenter, surgeon, captain, commodore, purser, midshipmen, chaplain, pharmacist, cook, cockswain, gunner, and yeoman), the less usual events (floggings, making a port of call, receiving official dignitaries aboard ship, rounding Cape Horn, the order of Neptune initiation rites, rumors of war), and all the underlying social structure and tensions ever-present.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in life aboard naval ships in the days of sail. With the rise of modern wireless communication, captains no longer enjoy such an absolute despotism as in times previous, but he still remains the unchallenged master aboard US navy vessels. While much of life aboard ship has changed, probably half of the book would still be quite familiar to modern-day sailors."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"I wanted to celebrate the Fourth of July by reading a classic work of American literature and decided to reread Melville's \\"White-Jacket\\", alternatively titled \\"The World in a Man-of-War\\". The book was Melville's fifth novel, written just before \\"Moby-Dick\\". It proved appropriate to July 4 for many reasons as, in his study of Melville, Andrew Delblanco aptly describes \\"White-Jacket\\" as a \\"paean on behalf of democracy.\\"Melville: His World and WorkIt is that and more.Written in 1850, \\"White-Jacket\\" purports to describe Melville's own experiences when he shipped in 1843 as an \\"ordinary seaman on board of a United States frigate,then lying in a harbor of the Pacific Ocean.\\" Melville's voyage as a sailor lasted about 14 months as the ship sailed south around Cape Horn and then north in the Atlantic until ultimately reaching the United States where Melville was discharged. Melville calls the ship the \\"Neversink\\". It was a large sailing vessel, a man-of war, consisting of over 500 sailors and commanded by a captain, Captain Claret. There is also a Commodore on board the \\"Neversink\\" who commands a fleet. (At the time of the voyage, there were no admirals in the United States Navy.) Melville wrote \\"White Jacket\\" quickly and claimed he did not think highly of the book. In that judgment he seems to me mistaken.This is a lengthy book consisting of 90 short chapters written in a large, expansive almost bravura style. It does not have a continuous developed plot but rather is episodic in form. Melville describes in great detail life onboard the Neversink, and the people on board. He makes great use of the telling anecdote. \\"White Jacket\\" is also full of long passages of reflection about navy life and the ambiguities of human nature. In many places, the book becomes almost more a long essay than a novel.The book tells the story about an individual and about a world and microcosm. The book is narrated by \\"White-Jacket\\", and the reader never learns his name. The baggy white jacket the narrator wears and that give him his nickname frames many of his adventures as the jacket, together with the narrator's introspective, \\"meditative\\" disposition, separate him from most of his fellow sailors. As the book progresses, the white jacket subjects the narrator to ridicule at various times and, near the end of the book, almost becomes his shroud which leads to his death. After falling overboard from the mast, the narrator is able to cut off the old jacket to be rescued by the crew and return to a common humanity.Besides this individual component of the story, Melville uses the ship as a metaphor for diversity and for American life and democracy where good and evil and people of all backgrounds and positions are intermixed. There is a degree of cameraderie and freedom from the restraints of a 9 to 5 life (or its 1850 equivalent) onboard the Neversink. There are acts of heroism and strong, noble individuals, including particularly Jack Chase, Melville's superior on the mast whose praises are sung throughout the book. Melville dedicated his late final novel \\"Billy Budd\\" to Jack Chase.The strongest impression left by the book, however, is its criticism of excesses and cruelties in the Navy. In particular, \\"White Jacket\\" includes many passages and chapters about the punishment of flogging which was widely practiced on the Neversink under Captain Claret, an individual who is also shown as having good qualties. Melville offers graphic and repeated descriptions of flogging, including a description of how White Jacket himself fortunately and narrowly missed a severe flogging and of how an aged, revered sailor named Ushant received a flogging for disobeying an order of the Captain to trim his beard. Melville's book may have been a factor in an Act of Congress which outlawed flogging in the navy.Melville also describes the large degree of stratification in the Navy between the seamen, or \\"people\\" and the officer crew, from the Commodore and Captain,through the Lieutenants and the young dictatorial Midshipmen. The book recognizes the need for discipline and organization on a military vessel at sea. But Melville writes sharply about petty tyrannies of one person over another,about rigid social distinctions, and about unnecessary excessive, and harsh discipline. The backdrop to the book is American democracy with its many people and freedoms, but also its excesses and injustices, including the institution of slavery. Melville also is critical of many of his fellow sailors, with their ignorance, profligacy, smugglings and thefts, and violence. At the end of the book, Melville writes:\\"Oh, ahipmates and world-mates all round! we the people suffer many abuses. Our gun-deck is full of complaints. In vain from Lieutenants do we appeal to the Captain; in vain-- while on board our world-frigate-- to the indefinite Navy Commissioners, so far out of sight aloft. Yet the worst of our evils we blindly inflict upon ourselves; our officers can not remove them, even if they would. From the last ills no being can save another; therein each man must be his own saviour.\\"Besides constituting a \\"paean on behalf of democracy\\", \\"White-Jacket\\" has a more immediate relationship to the Fourth of July. Several chapters in the book describe the celebration of the holiday on board the Neversink. When the ship ran out of grog before the holiday, the ship's officers allowed the sailors to celebrate the day by performing a play or \\"theatrical\\". The men decked themselves in costumes and wrote, rehearsed, and performed their own drama called \\"The Old Wagon Paid Off!\\" starring none other than Jack Chase. During the July 4 performance, ship discipline was relaxed. With the exception of the Commodore and the Captain, the ship's officers attended the performance, and shared a spirit of brotherhood and fellowship. White-Jacket said \\"the unwonted spectacle of the row of gun-room oficers mingling with 'the people' in applauding a mere seaman like Jack Chase, filled me at the time with the most pleasurable emotions.\\" White Jacket continued:\\"Nor was it without similar pleasurable feelings that I witnessed the temporary rupture of the ship's stern discipline, consequent upon the tumult of the theatricals. I thought to myself, this now is as it should be. It is good to shake off, now and then, this iron yoke round our necks. And after having once permitted us sailors to be a little noisy, in a harmless way -- somewhat merrily turbulent -- the officers can not, with any good grace, be so excessively stern and unyielding as before.\\"Alas, rigourous discipline soon returned to the ship.In the story of the individual narrator, of life on the Neversink, and of the freedom and cameraderie of the theatrical on July 4, \\"White-Jacket\\" reminded me of the ideals celebrated in the United States on Independence Day.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"In this early title from the great Melville, we get an episodic account of the author's service aboard the USS United States, sister ship of \\"Old Ironsides.\\" To avoid prosecution under the Articles of War, the name of the ship (called in the book the \\"Neversink\\") and his fellow crew members have been changed, but the stories retain their often startlingly candid detail. From the ritual floggings at the masthead to a critical grog shortage, Melville gives us a seaman's eye view of life of the 400-man crew of an American man-of-war marooned uncomfortably in a time of peace.Each chapter is a commentary on some facet of life aboard the ship. Some are laden with irony and dry humor, others express thinly veiled outrage at an institution that completely deprives men of any form of liberty and justice as they work to protect the freedom of their country. In these chapters, you will also see the seeds of the themes and images that appeared in Melville's later works.\\"A blog,\\" you ask? That is exactly what this book is. There are many characters, no plot to speak of, but an incredibly rich garden of facts, opinions ideas and observations. It does little to flatter the U.S. Navy of the mid-1800's but provides a richly detailed and distinctly un-romanticized view of the lives of those who served. If you're a fan of Melville or just like books about sailing the seas, White Jacket is a must-read."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"Reading this book made me realize how much I have in common with the sailors of old in our illustrious Navy. We all hate general quarters. This book is a good read for anyone looking for a more indepth look at what naval life was/is like. Underways are long, port visits are short ( and more restricted than ever), and you never feel at home no matter where you go. Naval life is great but it isn't a adventurous as some writers tend to make it appear. To have adventures you must go it alone or pick a liberty buddy with similar ideas."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"It's often said that, in 'Huckleberry Finn', \\"life is a river\\". 'White-Jacket', Herman Melville's fifth novel, may be his take on this: \\"the world is a ship\\". In fact, the subtitle of 'White-Jacket' is 'The World in a Man-of-War'. This is an interesting idea for an allegory and, in many ways, Melville suceeds. Using the events on the man-of-war Neversink, Melville draws many parallels to society in general and human justice in particular. Further, in the final chapter, Melville provides a moral to tie his allegory together.However, despite these successes, 'White-Jacket' pretty much fails as a novel. The main problem is that Melville exercises no control over his allegory. 'White-Jacket' contains far too much content that doesn't add to the allegory, and some of it clearly is not even meant to. While every word and chapter does not necessarily have to drive an allegory (unless you're Dante and writing something genius like 'The Divine Comedy'), the narrative that does not propel the allegory should have some point. Unfortunately, that is not the case here and it makes 'White-Jacket' pretty tedious.The excess material is especially frustrating because 'White-Jacket' quite simply tells no story. There is no plot, no character development, no conflict, nothing other than the allegory. So if a chapter doesn't fit in with the allegory, it really serves no purpose whatsoever! And, quite frankly, if Melville had honed his allegory the way he should have, his final chapter - which is terribly prosaic - would not have been required.Oddly, it seems to me that in writing his fourth, fifth, and sixth novels, Melville repeats the path he took with 'Typee', 'Omoo', and 'Mardi' (his first three). His fourth book ('Redburn') was like 'Typee', even though 'Typee' was more romantic and 'Redburn' darker. Both are quite successful works, tell a great story, and have clear themes communicated by those stories. 'Omoo' suffered from a directionless narrative that never came together as a story, very much like what we have with 'White-Jacket'. In his third book, Melville made an ambitious attempt at something deeper and, since his sixth book is 'Moby-Dick', the parallel seems to hold.I also found myself thinking of 'Redburn' and 'White-Jacket' as two halves of the whole that would become 'Moby-Dick'. 'Redburn' focuses on the story, and 'White-Jacket' focuses on an all-encompassing theme. In 'Moby-Dick', Melville would attempt both in a single novel. In addition, 'Moby-Dick''s theme of the microcosm echoes the 'world in a man-of-war' theme in 'White-Jacket'.Okay, all that said, is this a book worth reading? The answer is 'no', unless you're interested in delving into Melville's development as a writer or have an urge to learn in great detail what it was like to serve on a man-of-war in the 1800s. Bottom-line, in 'White-Jacket', Melville was overtly trying to write another 'tale of the sea' to earn money and regain the attention of his readers, while creating a deeper work 'under the radar'. However, the lack of plot means the book fails dismally as the former and the lack of control by Melville undermines the latter. 'White-Jacket' could have been much better, but Melville clearly needed more time, effort, and craft on this novel to realize this potential."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"White-Jacket: Or, The World in a Man-of-War (Worlds Classics)","review":"I feel quite strange presuming to give a numerical rating to a book by one of American literature's greatest authors.It's important for readers to realize that White-Jacket is not what would, in the modern day, be considered a novel. There is essentially no plot structure. It's a melange of events, descriptive passages and polemic, narrated by the eponymous White-Jacket, whom I suspect of being Melville himself. At times the book is entertainingly humorous - as when the narrator tries to get rid of his famous jacket. And much of the description of life aboard a man-of-war is fascinating -- the book would make a helpful companion for people reading modern novels such as O'Brian's series. (And, of course, White-Jacket probably was one of the sources used by O'Brian and other aquatic novelists.) The polemic -- Melville's rants against flogging and his pacifist pleas -- I found tiresome, as I always find polemic, regardless of its aims."},{"Title":"Hiccups For Elephant (level 2) (Hello Reader)","review":"Early readers will relate to this childhood problem.

Glimpses of the Moon was his first novel for decades, and I believe his last, and is amongst the funniest and best written books of the genre. Crispin at his very best."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"The Glimpses of the Moon is Edmund Crispin's last novel. He died in 1978 a year after it was published. \\"Glimpses\\" is also the final appearance of the Professor Gervase Fen character. It is a long work that proceeds at a leisurely pace for approximately 118,000 words and stands as a creditable swan song after a gap of twenty-four years from the publication of the collection of short stories Beware of the Trains (1953) and in 1952 Crispin's second-last novel The Long Divorce. The Glimpses of the Moon is leisurely in another sense. It was written over a period of about twenty years.It can be argued that Ellis the tortoise is a metaphor for the novel in its slow pacing and an apparent circularity that never quite reaches a dead-end but finally attains closure. Similarly, Ellis finds freedom on the open road where the protestor's van blocks the progress of a motorcycle club (among others) and the chemist Dodd (leader of the protestors against the hunt) trips over a tortoise that much later Fen vaguely remembers as having seen somewhere. Extending the metaphor, The Glimpses of the Moon has a \\"spiral\\" structure in which characters and events are revisited over again so as to stretch out the plot unhurriedly. Even the faster chase scenes have an easy aspect because they are long-drawn out and introduce one by one elements that help tie the plot together (the police chase after Luckraft, the discomfiture of the man from Sweb, the Pisser, Fen and the Major as interested observers from the branches of a tree, even Ellis the tortoise).I suspect Crispin enjoyed writing this novel, which reads as a relaxed ramble among an assortment of eccentric characters in the village of Glazebridge. The tranquillity and eccentricity does not end with the occurrence of mysterious deaths but continues as a sort of mise en sc&egrave;ne to the investigations of the crime. The novel might just as easily have been written as a quirky comedy of manners with no murders and detection, although the element of conflict no doubt would be introduced in another way. The novel's improbabilities tend to flow over the reader in that well-known suspension of disbelief. It merits a re-reading and is overdue for re-publication. Appropriately, in this new edition by Felony & Mayhem the cover photograph from the digital artist Drew Medina is that of a tortoise.The Glimpses of the Moon opens in the local pub with a discussion of the murder of a farmer named Routh by one of his employees, an Australian named Hagberd. The group includes the Major, Padmore a writer, and Professor Gervase Fen. The event is gruesome enough with the dismemberment of the body. Routh fits the stereotype in these English garden village mysteries that murder victims are generally not likeable and do not overly excite the reader's sympathy. Hagberd is a fond stereotype of the coarse colonial with a shady past, Australians being well known to become bushrangers at the drop of a cork-brimmed hat.The most characteristic element in The Glimpses of the Moon, as in other novels by Crispin, is his satirical treatment of social institutions and life's chances that are often founded upon self-reflection. One of the funniest of these is the depiction of the music composer Broderick Thouless, drawn from Montgomery's own experiences. Self-parody permeates the novel. Trade secrets are revealed. Literary criticism is an obvious target. So too is detective fiction. Crispin slips in wry references to his own and to others' work.Serious crime solving and horrific events in The Glimpses of the Moon would not be out of place in a novel by John Dickson Carr, to whom Crispin pays tribute. Carr mixes horror and the supernatural with humour but Crispin has a lighter touch that is never far removed from farce. At first this appears not the case. In \\"Glimpses\\" Routh's corpse is dismembered, its wrapped head passed from person to person in a series of both intentional and accidental swapping to be replaced at times by that of a pig on some occasions or the bust of a statue. But the gruesomeness of dismemberment quickly shifts to very like that of bedroom farce where different characters come and go in hiding from one another, except in this case it is the heads of unfortunate victims.Most of our attention is taken up with the quirky situations. The chase scene near the end, obligatory with Crispin, includes the man from Sweb carrying a mysterious box that some pursuers think might contain the missing head. Slapstick ensues, over-indulged some might think in the climactic chapter as though Crispin is trying to outdo himself. The chase is attenuated, in which motor cars, horses, cows and an assortment of villagers participate in gridlock within a narrow road. Bruce Montgomery was fond of mayhem all his life, see the orchestral melt-down in the 1961 film Raising the Wind made sixteen years earlier, for which Montgomery wrote the score and in which he played a cameo part. This ml&eacute;e takes place in the penultimate chapter.In the succeeding and final chapter the d&eacute;nouement is in traditional fashion over dinner in the kitchen of Fen's rented cottage. The serious tenor of the summing-up is interrupted throughout by ridiculous but sometimes witty dialogue. The last words of The Glimpses of the Moon return to humour through both literary parody and a double pun in Fen's proposed novel that might very well remain unfinished unless he can get down to its subject matter, the detail in the tale.Bruce ShawJuly 2012.Bruce is writing a modest book on Humour in Crime Fiction of the Golden Age."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"I re-visited this little gem from Edmund Crispin after a couple of decades and was delighted to find it every bit as good as I remembered. Of course, I had forgotten the plot but that only enhanced the re-read.It's a wonderfully wacky mystery set in an improbably eccentric English village with as daft a raft of characters as you're likely to find. It's as if P.G. Wodehouse had decided to write a murder mystery. The writing is erudite but never pompous (the use of obscure words adding to the flavour), the names are delightfully distinctive and the plot has enough twists and turns to satisfy the most jaded reader. There is a fairly grisly element to the whole proceedings, comprising as they do of dismembered corpses and missing heads and arms, but the tone is genteel and never sensationalist. James Cain, this is not.And solving the intellectual puzzle of how a corpse's arm is smuggled out of a tent in full view of many bystanders ranks right up there with any locked room puzzle solution.Highly recommended if you're a fan of the good old-fashioned English murder mystery, and of great writing."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"&quot;The Glimpses of the Moon&quot; (1978) was published twenty-six years after Crispin's penultimate Fen novel, &quot;The Long Divorce&quot; (1952). It is sandwiched between two collections of short stories: &quot;Beware of the Trains&quot; (1953) and &quot;Fen Country&quot; (1979- published posthumously.)In this novel, Professor Fen is on sabbatical in the Devon countryside. He is house-sitting for a couple of friends, writing a book that critiques the post-modern novel (this is funnier than it sounds), and pre-masticating pansy petals for his friends' finicky, gourmand tortoise. Since this is another of Crispin's fine pastorals, there are also a variety of pigs (living and dead), cows, a sex-crazed tomcat, a narcoleptic horse, and a cocker spaniel that plays a minor role in the murder mystery.In fact the mystery of who killed whom is almost buried under the goings-on of the livestock, the rural electric board, and the church fete. Fen concerns himself not so much with the identity of the murderer, as he does with the identity of the person who kept sneaking into a tent at the rector's annual fete and cutting bits off of the concealed corpse.One might even classify &quot;The Glimpses of the Moon&quot; as a 'locked tent' mystery.Fen seems to have lost a great deal of energy since &quot;The Long Divorce,&quot; twenty-six years past. He does not detect so much as get detected upon by his friends, the Rector, the Major, and the Horror-film Composer. There are huge digressions that are interesting, but have nothing to do with the plot. For instance, the bumblings of the South Western Electricity Board (Sweb) and the fox-hunt protesters get more page time than the murders. There is also a great deal of satirical commentary on the &quot;over-developed sensibilities of under-developed nations&quot; by a foreign correspondent who is rusticating in Devon, after getting kicked out of yet another African country (some readers might find this offensive).However, a Fen is a Fen and this is his last novel. First-time readers might want to begin at the beginning of the series with &quot;The Case of the Gilded Fly.&quot; My own favorite Fen is &quot;Love Lies Bleeding,&quot; followed very closely by &quot;The Long Divorce.&quot; &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; is the most-published of Crispin's mysteries, and probably the easiest to locate. And don't neglect &quot;Frequent Hearses,&quot; which features a maze scene that is frighteningly reminiscent of M.R. James (in fact the woman who is lost in the maze quotes M.R. James at length---a very Crispian characteristic.)Crispin's short stories featuring his remarkable detective-professor were originally published in a newspaper, to be read (and solved) on the train home from work. They are fiendishly clever intellectual exercises but lack the depth of characterization and the sparkling, erudite conversation of his novels."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"Thanks, Starmoth for a really complete and informative review!

It is sandwiched between two collections of short stories: \\"Beware of the Trains\\" (1953) and \\"Fen Country\\" (1979- published posthumously.)In this novel, Professor Fen is on sabbatical in the Devon countryside. He is house-sitting for a couple of friends, writing a book that critiques the post-modern novel (this is funnier than it sounds), and pre-masticating pansy petals for his friends' finicky, gourmand tortoise. Since this is another of Crispin's fine pastorals, there are also a variety of pigs (living and dead), cows, a sex-crazed tomcat, a narcoleptic horse, and a cocker spaniel that plays a minor role in the murder mystery.In fact the mystery of who killed whom is almost buried under the goings-on of the livestock, the rural electric board, and the church fete. Fen concerns himself not so much with the identity of the murderer, as he does with the identity of the person who kept sneaking into a tent at the rector's annual fete and cutting bits off of the concealed corpse.One might even classify \\"The Glimpses of the Moon\\" as a \`locked tent' mystery.Fen seems to have lost a great deal of energy since \\"The Long Divorce,\\" twenty-six years past. He does not detect so much as get detected upon by his friends, the Rector, the Major, and the Horror-film Composer. There are huge digressions that are interesting, but have nothing to do with the plot. For instance, the bumblings of the South Western Electricity Board (Sweb) and the fox-hunt protesters get more page time than the murders. There is also a great deal of satirical commentary on the \\"over-developed sensibilities of under-developed nations\\" by a foreign correspondent who is rusticating in Devon, after getting kicked out of yet another African country (some readers might find this offensive).However, a Fen is a Fen and this is his last novel. First-time readers might want to begin at the beginning of the series with \\"The Case of the Gilded Fly.\\" My own favorite Fen is \\"Love Lies Bleeding,\\" followed very closely by \\"The Long Divorce.\\" \\"The Moving Toyshop\\" is the most-published of Crispin's mysteries, and probably the easiest to locate.

James at length---a very Crispian characteristic.)Crispin's short stories featuring his remarkable detective-professor were originally published in a newspaper, to be read (and solved) on the train home from work.

At times, the author's sense of humor and cynicism just makes me laugh out loud. Gervase Fen is surely one of the more noxious, but lovable, detectives in the literature, and Crispin writes with a sure, erudite hand."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"An absolutely wonderful book. The most amazing characters spring forth - the cavalry Major (you must always have a Major) whose happiest day was when they replaced horses with tanks, the inspector who has to baby his pipe so much he can hardly finish a sentence, the spinster sisters who own a horrendous painting they insist is a Botticelli, which they sell tickets to at the annual church fair. They share a hearing aid, and must pass it back and forth during an interrogation. There is also a musician who earns his living writing movie scores (as did Crispin), and must write 12 seconds of music to accompany the monster eating the children. The tavern owner who never gets out of bed, the hunt saboteur who mouths left-wind idiocies. It goes on and on."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"I think Edmund Crispin's books are among the most brilliantly funny mystery novels ever conceived -- he was one-of-a-kind and combined a truly polished and even impressive prose style with compelling wit and lively characterisations.That being said, this novel (published very late in his life) is not remotely in the same league as all his early work. He seems dissipated, strident and awkward. The story and plot make little sense, and the humor all seems forced, with none of the natural flow of subtlety that characterizes all of Crispin's earlier work.If you've never read an Edmund Crispin book before, for God's sake skip this one and read any of the rest of them. He was a master of humor and mystery-writing, but this book written in his waning years is no way to experience him at his peak. I'd avoid this one totally, to be honest."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"\\"The Glimpses of the Moon\\" (1978) was published twenty-six years after Crispin's penultimate Fen novel, \\"The Long Divorce\\" (1952).

The village had been the scene of a murder a few weeks before Fen's arrival but for once he isn't that interested in it until he starts to hear a bit more about it. Then he starts to wonder whether the right person has been convicted. Fen himself is carrying around a pig's head from which he is going to make brawn which adds a certain surreal element to the story.During the village fete - which features a doubtfully genuine painting by Botticelli and the Rector doing the fortune telling - another murder is committed and the head of the victim removed in a disturbing reference to the earlier murder. The police are baffled and find themselves looking singularly stupid at times because of circumstances completely beyond their control. I found this book a bit too long and had some difficulty reconciling the final solution with the story I'd read - though I could have missed some clues along the way.What I did love was the way that the sack Fen is carrying runs like a red thread through the whole story. What made the book for me was the absolutely priceless scene which involves Fen and another character sitting in a tree, three hunt saboteurs, three members of the hunt, three people from the electricity generating board trying to work out why a pylon makes strange noises and a helicopter from the same organisation, not to speak of a herd of cows, a burglar disguised as something else and a collection of policemen who have just realised who they need to arrest and are rushing to do so. This scene together with the sack makes the whole of the book worthwhile in my opinion.As ever the book is well written with many literary references and use of words which the average reader may find obscure. The characters are interesting and well-drawn and the asides about twentieth century novels are amusing. If you want a light read on which you do not have to concentrate too much then this may not be the book for you but in my opinion this is one Edmund Crispin's best books."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"I recently re-discovered Edmund Crispin and downloaded four of his works. They were all good reads: crisp, clever and to the point. This one was so bad I deleted it after a couple of chapters. It's arch and pretentious.

There's a repulsive sub-plot about cruelty to animals.It was a most unfortunate end to an admirable writing career."},{"Title":"Glimpses of the Moon","review":"Very good fun.

The very first comic I turned to was of a car driving down the highway, with two kids in the backseat, looking hopefully at the car they were passing. Mom and Dad were in the front driving, and the kids had a sign hanging out the back window that said (roughly paraphrased), \\"Please help. Our dad won't stop and ask for directions!\\"This small book is stuffed full of comics in a similar vein. All of the comics are from the hilarious, slightly Far Side-esque but much less eccentric (but just as funny) Close to Home. The book is probably 98% comics and 2% quotations. Various quotations, also usually fun, about Dads and Children are sprinkled through the book.It's just a cute, fun book.

Speaking in a matter-of-fact way, the villagers tell us what happened in the waves of political campaigns. As with other puritanical movements of world history, we see the force and appeal of extreme self-righteousness. We see what happens when idealism means zero tolerance for self-interest, and zealots lose almost all restraint in condemning other people's selfishness.

The authors are particularly concerned with rebutting a naive Malthusian view of Chinese society as governed by unlimited fertility checked only by subsistence crises. As the authors point out also, Malthus' actual analysis was more sophisticated than this simplified version but the naive view has been endorsed by quite a few subsequent scholars. Lee and Wang argue for complex and distinctive Chinese regulation of demographic variables. Embedded within a deeply patriarchal and patrilineal culture, Lee and Wang suggest that poor and elite Chinese families used a combination of female infanticide (and its corollary, favoring male older children), practices that promoted relatively low marital fertility, and production of a relatively high rate of non-reproducing males. These complex and interacting practices, combined with other features such as fictive kinship that allowed families to overcome lack of offspring via adoptions, allowed Chinese families to tailor reproduction to economic circumstances. They assign a relatively small role for famine per se in population control, and emphasis that Chinese population growth has been driven by phenomena observed also in the Western world, including an 18th century population boom perhaps secondary to increased agricultural productivity and expanded farmlands, the application of public health measures in the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the more recent application of modern medical care.Lee and Wang also suggest that China underwent a distinctive path to demographic transition, the fall in fertility associated with modernization. In Western societies, they emphasize increasing emphasis of personal choice and voluntary drop in fertility. In China, the remarkably rapid demographic transition has been driven by communal and coercive restraints generated by the state and the Party. They argue as well that the transition, however, was facilitated by the Chinese tradition of fertility restraint via communal mechanisms. Some of the detailed discussion of these issues is particularly interesting, especially the description of the baby boom that followed collectization. They also have a very interesting discussion of how these communal restraints on fertility are an example, perhaps the best example, of a real difference in Chinese and Western society.This book has some unavoidable limitations of which readers should be aware. It was published initially about 10 years ago and parts are a bit dated. Included, for example, is an old prediction that China's population would peak at 1.6 billion at mid-century. A more recent prediction (US Census International Database) is that 2050 will see a Chinese population of about 1.3 billion and be on the decline. Lee and Wang mention that the most prosperous regions of late 18th century China had comparable living standards to prosperous regions of Western Europe. I believe that this has been a controversial point in the scholarly literature related to the origins of the Industrial Revolution and that some economic historians think this incorrect. It also appears that Chinese prosperity was accomplished by labor intensification and agricultural involution, a somewhat different path than 18th century Britain or Holland. Probably because of data limitations, there is relatively little discussion of diachronic differences in pre-modern China. It may be that the 18th century was somewhat different from the 19th century, certainly the latter was characterized by slower Chinese population growth and a number of enormous catastrophes, including the Tai Ping rebellion and the late century famines chronicled by Mike Davis in his Late Victorian Holocausts. While the naive Malthusian view is clearly wrong, it may be that 18th century population growth and environmental degradation produced some semi-Malthusian effects that reduced the safety margin for many regions of China."},{"Title":"Becoming a World Changing Family: Fun and Innovative Ways to Spread the Good News","review":"This book has fun excellent ways to raise Great Commission kids.

From the short poems to the long, I think they're all great and among the best things ever printed in English.If you're looking for a scholarly edition of Blake, this might be the edition for you. Blake created a complex mythology filled with gods and worlds of his own invention, and that Alicia Ostriker's notes actually help make sense of that mythology is a true feat of scholarship.But if you're like most readers of Penguin Classics, you're looking for something you can read for enjoyment, and some of the editor's decisions have made enjoyment difficult.Though beloved shorter poems like the Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience are just fine, many pages of the longer poems like \\"America\\" are marred by extra text in italics and brackets which are supposed to be variants from different versions of the poems. I could see putting these sorts of things in footnotes or endnotes, but they are actually right there in the text itself! You'll be given a stanza of a poem, and then the same stanza in brackets or italics with only minor variations. Here's an example from the beginning of \\"Four Zoas\\":\\"Lost! Lost! Lost! are my Emanations Enion [come forth]O Enion[I am] We are become a Victim to the Living [I] Wehide in secretI have hidden [thee Enion in Jealous Despair] Jerusalemin Silent Contrition\\" etc.This leaves you wondering which lines you should be reading and which you should be skipping, which occasionally detracts from the poetic experience, or at the very least forces your eye to be darting all over the page. I've never seen this in another Penguin book; I think it was a poor choice here.Finally, thank you so much to James M. Rawley and Chris for their reasonable and helpful objections to the previous wording of my review. The internet really can be a place for respectful, productive conversation."},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"Though I firmly support the general consensus that Shakespeare is our greatest poet--the more one reads, the more this becomes apparent--I am equally firm in stating that there has been no greater visionary poet than Blake, not even Milton.William Blake lived and wrote almost entirely ignored during his time, regarded, if at all, as an eccentric painter. This speaks not to the quality of his works; it speaks to how ahead of his time he was. Nobody knew what to make of him, and I must confess that even now it is difficult to cement his place.One can say for certain, however, that he is one of the greatest poets; aside from the Bard, Keats (whom I adore), and Milton, he has no companions in this uppermost echelon. Reading Blake is sometimes overwhelming. The power of his vision and the vivacity of his language sometimes overpower the faculties, and makes one nearly break down into tears. His poetry is beautiful; it is complex; it is at times incomparably deep and more powerful in force of language than perhaps any other, even Shakespeare's.Many restrict their reading of Blake to his accessible and delightful lyrics SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE (which must be read side-by-side to fully appreciate what he is doing!), but to do so is to bind oneself in a nutshell. Read THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL, as an introduction into his vast vision. Go on to read THE BOOK OF URIZEN, MILTON, JERUSALEM, etc., but take it slowly. Blake is one of the most difficult poets; he is infinitely complex. He creates his own, metamorphosing mythology, which parallels Biblical mythology and that of Milton, and expounds it throughout his poems. To fully appreciate them, one must not only read, but also study his works. I highly recommend doing so--William Blake is infinitely rewarding.A note: The Penguin edition reviewed here is good, but, if possible, try to acquire an illustrated copy of Blake's work. Blake wrote most of his great poems in the style of illuminated manuscripts (he is actually the precursor of the graphic novel genre), and his illustrations are profound and beautiful. It seems to be increasingly difficult to acquire his illustrations in book form, so if you cannot, at least view them at blakearchive.org. They are magnificent!"},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"I don't know upon what planet this poet was born, but it certainly wasn't earth. Blake is the ultimate Gnostic, the ascendent correspondent, the bringer of truth from regions we have no knowledge of. The core of his philosophy can be summed up in his assertion in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell:&quot; Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast...Isaiah answer'd. I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing, and as I was then perswaded, &amp; remain confirm'd; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God.&quot;Blake is the poet of true revolution, true Romanticism and true spirit. This is the definitive volume of his life-work, without, it is true, the illustrations that augmented his genius. Yet there is no real necessity for etchings here, as the genius of his poetry will etch its own image in your mind if you are receptive to his universal symbolism. Blake was the first truly modern poet, prefiguring Mallarme, D.H. Lawrence, Baudelaire, in particular. He was also a great mythologyzer, the precursor of Campbell, Frazier, and even Alan Watts in many respects. The Penguin Edition is not illustrated, it's true, but there is so much to be mined here that one can easily lose oneself in the labyrinth of Blake's excavations.Recommended without reservations. A truly paradigm shifting poet and artist. Seek out his illustrative, divinely inspired watercolors, as well. A true visionary, if there ever was one!!BEK"},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"It is the shorter poetry of Blake, that of the 'Songs of Innocence' and 'The Songs of Experience' that lives for me, and I suspect for most others. Though Northrop Frye the master literary critic saw in Blake's longer poems a key to reading the whole universe of Literature, I strongly suspect those long- lined abstraction filled 'visions'are outside the interest and staying power of most readers.Blake was one of the great aphoristic poets, and along with the mystical visionary lines, there came lines like lightning sudden flashes of the mind which strike us strongly and remain with us.Here is one of the most well- known Blakean lyrics:And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England's mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England's pleasant pastures seen?And did the Countenance DivineShine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded hereAmong these dark satanic mills?Bring me my bow of burning gold!Bring me my arrows of desire!Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!Bring me my chariot of fire!I will not cease from mental fight,Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,Till we have built JerusalemIn England's green and pleasant land.Blake was the lunatic lover one of the great madmen of poetry who according to his wife gave her little time as he most of the time was 'in Paradise'.Each reader will going through the Collected Poems stop and select what they find congenial for themselves.In the Collected Poems of Blake there is very much to stop for, including many of the most memorable lyrics and lines Poetry in English has given the world.\\" Little Lamb who made thee, Dost thou know who made thee?\\"\\"Tiger, Tiger, burning bright in the forest of the night/ What immortal hand or eye/ Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?/"},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"There are some formatting issues especially where the line numbers are concerned and with the e-Edition they should have included colour plates because of all the tablets out there now...or just B/W plates if they're thinking of the Kindle devices...but the Fire will be out soon so....The poems are, of course, brilliant but this is just another formatting flub I've a number of times from reputable publishers who've rushed their ebook versions into press without proper editing."},{"Title":"Complete Poems","review":"Horrendous binding: too much glue on the back; on the top of that sheets too thick.

No other Blake collection gives so much, or so useful, help. In fact, there's nothing else like this Blake out there for helping the reader.Other reviewers have complained that Penguin lacks color plates. True enough, and some of the far more expensive color plate editions have good notes, but nothing like as good as Penguin's.Blake writes in a dreamlike style, and it is impossible to make total sense of him, but more than a century of scholarship has gone into clarifying his work, and he needs every annotation he gets here.

Simpson trial, Million Man March and U.S. presidential elections.However, black journalists and NABJ still face significant challenges, not the least of which is NABJ's effort to growits organization in the face of declining membership, attackson media diversity and a certain apathy among many blacks inthe profession.Dawkins examines these challenges in Rugged Waterswhile providing plenty of salient points to ponder."},{"Title":"Rugged Waters: Black Journalists Swim the Mainstream","review":"\\"Rugged Waters\\" is a stanza of history of the National Association of Black Journalists from 1989 to 2002. Author Wayne Dawkins states in the preface that the book highlights the annual conventions. The essence of the book is the challenge of the leadership in the organization to create and maintain fiscal stability and membership. The president and the board has potential conflicts of interests in dealing with policies within their own news organizations and convention event sponsors. Should black staff members in newsrooms be the same percentage as the population being covered? Can NABJ accept alcohol and tobacco sponsorship if these products indirectly kill African Americans at alarming percentages? Dawkins shows how NABJ addresses these issues. Running for president in NABJ has often been an uncontested event. \\"Rugged Waters\\" does not hightlight the fact that a viable presidential candidate needs endorsements from familiar industry leaders and the old guard journalists. Neophytes in journalism are not considered because they have to pay their dues. Dawkins quotes veteran journalist, Roy Johnson, who states NABJ is not a \\"must join organization.\\" \\"Rugged Waters\\" should be read by every new and seasoned journalist of color. The history of the news organization, NABJ, had its creation through affirmative action. The future is held in the balance by the adage of, not appealing to the youth."},{"Title":"Rugged Waters: Black Journalists Swim the Mainstream","review":"If you want to get an inside look at the workings of the organization representing minority journalists you should read this book. It takes you inside the the National Association of Black Journalists, and by extension, inside the newsrooms of some of the nation's top news organizations. The book details not just the trials,tribulations, and growing pains of NABJ, but also the aspirations,frustrations, triumphs, and failures of some of the minority journalists working in the media. Rugged Waters also looks at some of the major media stories of the past decade and explores how race does or does not impact decisions about coverage of stories. It's a good read and a significant addition to the discussion of media and its impact on the way we view the world in which we live."},{"Title":"Rugged Waters: Black Journalists Swim the Mainstream","review":"This is a very detailed account of the NABJ and of black journalists as a whole in the United States. It's not a leisurely read; rather it's a call to action for black journalists to step out of their comfort zones and press on to build a stronger organization than what was left in the aftermath of the 1990's.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"The first thing we learn about Dominika Dery is that she appeared to her mother in a dream before she was born. It was in a garden and she came running through the trees to say hello. As soon as her mother, Jana, began trying to have a baby, the girl disappeared from her dreams. When finally Jana became pregnant, she and her husband Jarda were joyful. Although they did not have a lot of money for a second child, Dominika was welcomed and had a loving childhood.Growing up in Prague in the 1970s and early 1980s, Dominika did not know her grandparents because, as members of the Party elite, they disowned her mother. She tried multiple times to meet her grandmother and grandfather, and invited them to ballet performances that she was in, but to no avail. Instead, she forged relationships with elderly members of the community.While the family was not wealthy, Dominika enjoyed many treats in life and spending time with her parents. After seeing \\"Swan Lake\\" with her family, she was determined to become a ballerina, even though she was young and small. Throughout the reading of this memoir, you learn that Dominika was not an average little girl, and that when she set her mind to do something, she did it.Dominika's father worked as a taxi driver because his political beliefs made it almost impossible to get another job. As a result, many of the children who were Dominika's age were not allowed to play with her. She spent hours with the older women in the neighborhood, who told her stories of their youth and baked cakes for her.Dominika dealt with much disappointment before even completing her first decade of life. She became a dedicated and talented ballerina, but she was so small and young that it was hard to obtain roles in performances. When she did receive them, the costumes were too large or she would run into orchestra conductors who did not appreciate it when little girls sang along to the music. She began going to church and had quite a scare when she learned that, because she had taken communion at church without having been baptized, she must be baptized or she would be sent to hell.The small town of Cernosice was full of gossips, and Dominika's parents were forever warning her not to say anything, because no one could be sure whether a neighbor was an informant or not. In one of her childhood memories captured here, she shares a time when her father outsmarted three informants by putting them to work in his backyard.Our last glimpse into Prague's communist era is when Dominika and her parents, not accompanied by her sister, traveled to Poland for a vacation. Through hardships and disappointments, Dominika still managed to make friends, keep smiling, and put her mother and father into good spirits once again.Dominika's good nature puts readers in good moods as well. THE TWELVE LITTLE CAKES is a touching, sweet story, and it will remind you of your childhood days, when you were as loved as you wanted to be, and anything was possible.--- Reviewed by Hannah G&oacute;mez (gingermulatta@kiwibox.com)"},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"I would call this a gentle book harking back to childhood with loving parents who are dissidents of a strange political system named Communisim in an Eastern European country named Czechoslovakia from 1974 to about 1985. You discover that Communisim is a disastrous joke and wonder how it lasted as long as it did...and does in a few countries still. The author does a masterful job of writing about her life as it was from age 5 to 10 and conveys to the reader the innocence and excitement and concern of what is important to a young child. The big sister is in her story who adds to her troubles at times and the fact that her father is fired from many many jobs due to his resistance of the political regime, yet is able to always be optimistic and find other ways to get work has an important part also. This is a feel good book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"This is an autobiographical novel that covers the author's childhood in a village outside of Prague, in what was then Czechoslovakia, in the late seventies and early eighties. The country was a Soviet bloc state, a fact which ruled over most aspects of life, and the author makes this very clear. She also makes clear her feelings about communism and the Soviet occupation, but what makes this a good read is that she also explains why. She uses facts and her own (many) personal experiences, and those of her parents, who rebelled against communism.The author/narrator Dominika, as a little girl, is fun to read. She is extroverted, confident, and loves to talk loudly and in exclamations. Yet she is not perfect, and does not fully understand the political and economic situation around her. The author does not tell her story only from a little girl's eyes, but fills in with information that she had learned or realized later. This is both from a child's point of view and an older, informed, and quite intelligent point of view.This was an easy read, as I finished it in half the time I normally take to read a book this size. The book covers her various adventures and acquaintances: an old Austrian caretaker, three kind old women who bake cakes, the neighbor children who are not allowed to play with the dissidents' daughter, ballet school and performances, Communist spies and informants who kept an eye on her parents and who her father played tricks on, Dominika's mother's parents (who have disowned her despite the father's reluctance), the family dog famous from Czech movies, the beautiful sister, the Easter when Dominika disguised herself as a boy so she could collect eggs from the women (until the other boys then stole her basket as well), and a somewhat stressful vacation in Poland.Indeed, there are many other stories in this novel, complete with references to Czech culture and holidays. There are so many events that it's never a problem if I get to one that's rather boring -- it is soon over and another story is begun.The Czech names weren't too hard to keep up with: the characters are introduced very gradually. Only, I found it maybe a little annoying that some characters had English words for last names (such as \\"German\\" or \\"Backyard\\") and I get the impression that she is translating Czech words into English, and leaves untranslated the names that aren't words. I would much prefer to see the original names.The story ends around 1985, when Gorbachev came into power and Dominika's father was (correctly) hopeful that the Soviet occupation and Iron Curtain days would be over soon. I was a little disappointed because I wished to see what happened with the family when their hopes finally came true. Still, Dominika ends the story on the note that even if they continued to live under Communism, they would survive because they had each other.I recommend this book to anyone interested in life in Soviet satellite countries (it didn't vary too greatly from country to country), or simply interested in a book filled with rich and exciting detail on a life that is both ordinary and unusual (especially to people from the West)."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"Reading this book was like going home.

The anecdotes of Dominika Dery's early life as a precocious, sometimes naive girl growing up during the mid-seventies to mid-eighties in Cernosice, Czechoslovakia are refreshingly told. Initially, the family lives in a house renovated into a triplex, but after they prevent Dominika's maternal grandmother from confiscating their home through the courts (in an attempt to disinherit Dominika's mom) remodeling of the house, and its associated stories, begins. The author's mother, Jana, \\"the granddaughter of a founding member of the prewar Communist Party,\\" was a writer (of books) at the State Economic Institute which \\"her Communist bosses took credit for.\\" Her father, Jarda, \\"bewilderingly positive\\" in light of \\"having lived a terrible life\\" worked odd jobs, primarily as a taxi driver, having been \\"blacklisted by the Russians after the 1968 invasion\\" after briefly working for the Czech government as an engineer. Dery writes of the political situation under communism, \\"By the mid-eighties, communism was like an old dragon that would occasionally crawl out from its cave and eat someone for dinner. As long as it wasn't you the dragon was eating, you could live with the sound of screams in the distance.\\" Her parents were both expelled from the party for refusing to sign a political document that went against their beliefs and so lived under the watchful eye of a never-ending stream of informers (including the couple in a neighboring apartment) throughout the story. The real story, however, is of a family's ability to survive, and often thrive through the toughest of times. Everyday childhood happenings; a carp in the bathtub, an encounter with a famous ballet dancer, the amusing behavior of boys vying for her large-bosomed sister's attention, the antics of their large, former movie star dog, a bout of dysentery, and a misfortune-filled vacation to Poland, are skillfully brought to life in Dery's memoir. The stories in The Twelve Little Cakes are sure to raise your spirits and warm your heart."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"Everyone who loves memoirs must read this one.

Woven into the story is plenty of Czech history and culture, which made the setting come that much more alive. The characters in the book were also conveyed wonderfully.

It is nothing like reading a history book, and you get a very personal experience. This autobiography is heartwarming, relatable, sympathy-evoking, and even slightly whimsical. I wish this was a movie!"},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"When I first began reading The Twelve Little Cakes, I didn't realize that it was a true story. (I check this information along with the reviews on Amazon before buying a book, but by the time I get around to reading it I have long forgotten.) I realized that it was real when she mentioned Bohousek, her famous dog -- I remember my mom pointing him out in films when I was young. From that point on, it made the story a completely different experience for me and I was even more eager to read ahead.There were many other similarities I shared with Dominika, but the most important one was our romantic view of Czechoslovakia as children. When we're young, we don't care about any differences. We just want to go play. I remember my mom explaining why certain neighbors didn't like each other and how everyone gossiped. The urge people had to snitch on someone for no reason and make their life miserable is something I definitely understood in this book, though I never understood it as a child (and even now, really) -- Can't we all get along?As a Czech-American, I relate to this story very well, and perhaps this is partly responsible for my 5-star review as this story transported me back a few years and allowed me to relive some of my own cherished memories. I have spent half of my life living in each place, and my Czech childhood was quite similar to Dominika's.The Czech Republic is a stunning place and there are so many amazing people. This book did hit the nail on the head, though, as far as the problems in Czech society.It was an absolute pleasure to read this book. I truly admire Dominika's parents for sticking it out together and for the incredible love they shared within their family. It will warm your heart!"},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"I will hold my thumbs for the sequel to Twelve Little Cakes, but with talent such as this, the author hardly needs me to cross my fingers Czech-style. The spirit of the Czechs is captured by Dominika in her first English work. Her spirit is that of The Little Prince: observant, sparked with life, and wise beyond her years. Dekuji. The hours you spend with Dominika in this work will connect you with her soul, and the soul of a beautiful country full of beautiful women. It is a holiday to remember."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, I admit it was right up my alley in content and it seemed like it got good reviews. I have to admit I was surprised by how much I just enjoyed the book. The perspective and stories are engaging and I found that the book ended much too soon for me- but just right for the story line.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"You wouldn't think that a novel about being the daughter of dissidents in Communist Czechoslovakia would be funny, but this novel is hilarious. I shared my copy with several persons and purchased others as Christmas gifts (2006). I'm dubious whether Dominika could so accurately recall conversations as a young child as detailed in the book, but you will fall in love with her in this autobiography. Her refreshing honesty and childish innocence opened some of the hardest hearts in a difficult time when adults were fearful whom to trust and honest conversation had to be guarded. It's an insider's look into hard times under a Communist regime without being preachy. And their family vacation to Poland makes you understand why the Poles were the first to throw aside the iron curtain. I cannot recommend this book more highly, particularly to our newest generations (X and Y) who did not grow up in the Cold War."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"I love, love, love this memoir of growing up in Communist Czechoslovakia. It's both funny and thoughtful, full of humor, and information, too. The author, Dominika Dery, grew up in the 1970's and 80's in a Communist-controlled Czechoslovakia. This is the story of her childhood, filled with funny anecdotes. Communism \\"was like an old dragon that would occasionally crawl out from its cave and eat someone for dinner. As long as it wasn't you the dragon was eating, you could live with the sound of screams in the distance.\\" Her dog, Barry, was famous and was on television. Her mother was the disowned daughter of wealthy Communist elitists, one of whom was the \\"Red Countess\\". Her father semi-illegally drove a taxi. But everything was semi-illegal; you just had to have a combination of the right connections and money, and then you could get away with it. And her sister Klara was very popular with the boys.Yet despite the dictatorship, dignity and love survived; in fact, flourished. And overall, Dominika had a happy childhood, marred only by a few tragedies. The reason that I love memoirs are that they both read like fiction, and (hopefully) teach you something about history. The Twelve Little Cakes is both of these things, and it does both very skillfully. Though some of the stories are a bit too absurd to be true, the form of memoir allows that. It allows you to twist the facts, fictionalize a bit, whereas (correct me if I'm wrong), an autobiography is basically a truthful account of your life. Though obviously, nothing can ever be completely truthful, and you're bound to be biased about your own life.The title refers to these little pastries that the author loved as a child, and that she would buy at the bakery. It was a good title, and kind of summed up the essence of her childhood. Each of the chapters is named after a different kind of cake.My favorite anecdote from this book was probably when Dominika's family is having their house renovated, and these so-called workers (who are actually government informers) show up. It was hilarious, because even though the family knew they were spies, Dominika's father took advantage of the situation and worked them really hard. In the end, all of them quit. My least favorite anecdote was about her time in the hospital, not because it was poorly written or anything, but because it was scary, and not at all fun to read. However, it did provide a stark portrayal of the root of what's wrong with Communism. It may sound all right in principle, but it never works (in my opinion).At any rate, I would highly recommend this excellent memoir, and it's a shame that it's out of stock on Amazon. Someone needs to do a reissue.All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Twelve Little Cakes","review":"Born in 1975, Ms Dery relates life in the Czech republic under Communism through the voiceof a child. But the book is anything but childlike.

This is a vivid story of communism portrayed in the eyes of a child. Very well written and an interesting story as well. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Language Test Construction and Evaluation (Cambridge Language Teaching Library)","review":"This book isn't for the teacher who'd like to make a weekly quiz for their class. This is intended for those who are interested in large scale institutional testing, like TOEFL. It doesn't give much information on writing test items, but covers how to write testing guidelines in great detail. It also covers how to evaluate items and tests, and it goes into detail about reliability and validity without getting to deep into statistics. In general, I found the style of this book to be very easy to read since it is written with test administrators in mind rather than test writting techies. If you're interested in the process of making large scale institutional tests, then this is a good book, but if you're looking for a book to help you write test items, then you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Language Test Construction and Evaluation (Cambridge Language Teaching Library)","review":"After readingLanguage Testing (Oxford Introduction to Language Series), \\"Language Test Construction\\" formed a good further step into the theory that underlies various tests and considerations that go into construction.As mentioned by a previous reviewer, this book is really not written for teachers who have to administer the tests themselves, (though some may be interested in having some knowledge of it anyway). It is more aimed at those who will be involved in the construction, testing and modifying of the tests themselves.The book covers a lot of territory, though it does not get into overwhelming amounts of mind-boggling information. It draws some definite lines and sticks to brief overviews. However, should one wish to have some more boggling of the mind, the authors make suggestions aplenty about where to get it.The topics that are covered in book include such things as exam testing, (reliability, validity and so on), statistical analysis of tests and results, the monitoring of test administrators, develop specfications and so on. While not overwhelming, some parts require some concentration, (well, they did with me), and may not really be all that light on the brain.All things considered, I found this book a valuable read and an interesting insight into the murky world of language testing. It is well-organised, well-explained and realistic in what it attempts to achieve. I think it is a valuable resource for people wanting to get into the field of language testing, or wish to take their own testing to the next level."},{"Title":"Experiences in groups: And other papers","review":"Reader beware! Bion did something great here. In a detailed analysis of people's behavior in groups, he shows us that some strange and often unsettling subterranean processes are at work within groups. While these processes (and the events that follow them) may defy the understanding and description of most, Bion offers insights that are at once straightforward, bizarre and sublime. In the end, his ideas provide the reader with simple, psychodynamic explanations of group behavior.Bion points out that much of psychic human life occurs inside groups. Bion shows us that each group has a specific and directed goal to accomplish (i.e., a corporation seeks to make money and a family seeks to raise their children and provide support for the members within it). He then provides a fascinating and detailed account of the ways that these groups are often subverted from their main purpose. Bion focuses on the \\"basic assumptions\\" that lead people in groups to function in unusual ways that are frequently, if not always, outside of their awareness.Bion suggests that there are \\"basic assumptions\\" which take over in a group. Some of these assumptions are that of \\"Fight/Flight\\" or \\"Pairing\\". Bion suggests that at times, a group will abandon their work in order to unite for either fighting or fleeing. He suggests that humans are \`herding' at these times-we find ourselves in a group and we think we either need to get ready for a war or to run for the hills. This unconscious assumption, based solely on being together in a group, can severely detract from the work the group was originally brought together to accomplish. Think of those peewee football leagues gone awry. We thought they were supposed to be fun for the kids but they turn out to be an education about winning by all means necessary.In contrast to the fight/flight assumption is the pairing assumption in which the group mobilizes its resources to pick two people in the group to bring together. With much hope the members try to play matchmaker and work at uniting the should-be-lovers. The unconscious purpose here is a wish to provide the group with a special child, or savior, whom the group believes, will bring them much greater successes than they have already achieved. In both of the assumptions I have mentioned, there are interesting dynamic reactions to the group's leader; will the leader be competent to lead the attack or does she/he need to be usurped in order to make way for the special new child? In this way, Bion helps the reader develop a finer appreciation for the psychodynamics that group members express toward authority figures.In each assumption, the members in the group start to replicate earlier patterns of group behavior. This repetition has a sociobiological flavor; Bion suggests that it was once quite advantageous for people to be preparing for either war or escape when they were in a group. Today, however, this behavior is not so appropriate and it always interferes with the work the group was brought together to complete.The nifty thing about these points is that they are supported by current research findings. Scientists in the area of social cognition show us that people often act in ways that are outside of their awareness and quite difficult to explain. One only need to be somewhat familiar with the easily observed in-group out-group biases (a.k.a. prejudice) to realize that there are powerful forces at work around which people organize their perception about group membership and the treatment of outsiders.And we do not need to go to research to see these processes at work. Bion's greatest success comes from calling attention to the behavior that we all have noticed, organizing our ideas about it and making it acceptable to consider. In this way, we finish the book changed. We now will be more sensitive to and ready to challenge the subtle flirtations or overt preparations for conflict that we see in the groups to which we belong.The one drawback to this piece comes in the end of the book. Bion starts to focus on the meaning of money. As he tries to talk about the influence of this human creation, his sharp thinking softens and his writing becomes tangential, difficult to follow and at times absurd. You want to put the book down at this point. Despite this, I still recommend this book wholeheartedly. It is a short read but it will change your experience of groups. I think it is essential for anyone working in groups as a clinician."},{"Title":"Experiences in groups: And other papers","review":"This book is so filled with information that I can only read a small amount at a time, then I have to put it down so that I can absorb the content. It is written in plain English, but the ideas expressed require a great deal of thought. It explains exactly how groups function. It is a revelation to someone such as me. No wonder it is considered a classic. I consider it on a par with Jung's Memories Dreams and reflections."},{"Title":"Experiences in groups: And other papers","review":"Being familiar with W. R. Bion from a recent workshop, I needed this book to add to my collection on group theory.

While equations are non existant, the working relationships that mathematics oriented macroeconomics attempt to derive are explicately stated and supported. For those who are either working with developing nations as they become industrialized, or with former Soviet bloc nations as they transition to free market, democraticly oriented economies, Professor Weede offers several nuggets to chew on intellectually. A brief summary of the chapters, in Professor Weede's words: Chapter 2: Discusses the economic model of human behavior, summarizes some of the most powerful criticism of it, and then endorses it.The market is an imperfect substitute for altruism, but a substitute it is. By contrast, group decisions, such as done by a government, are likely to be deeply flawedChapter 3 addresses how public goods encourage freeriding and discourage cooperation in the use of such goods: often governments become a tool for special interest groups, and act against the interest of the groups they are supposedly protecting.Chapter 4 addresses how and why the West outperformed the East in the last millinium, and comments on China's emerging sociocapitalism.Chapter 5 addresses why some people continue to remain poor in the era of mass consumption and open markets; Chapter 7 suggests a coming decline of the West as the East flexes its economic muscles. Chapter 8 exaamines the positive results of war and wars, and how the almost constant turmoil in the West led to the establishment of law, order, property rights and other characteristics those in the West take for granted; some of these characteristics are only slowly coming into existance in the East. Chapter 10 Concludes with a summary, and some comments on emerging geoploitical coalitions, and how this may affect peace and trade.In my opinion, anyone who understands the issues that macroeconomics addresses would have significant food for thought after reading this book."},{"Title":"GREAT UNTOLD STORIES OF FANTASY AND HORROR: A Study of Destiny; The Mysterious Card; An Unnatural Feud; Jungli Admi; The Messenger; Monster Maker; Mother of Turquoise; Black Statue; Dreams in the Witch House; Man Overboard; Seal of Solomon the Great","review":"Very pleased with my purchase....book that was sent was exactly as dealer stated, I would buy again from this dealer..."},{"Title":"Conan The Adventurer","review":"Darker than the other novelettes, and more uniquely Howard.

The original paperback edition had cover art by Frank Frazetta. The book contains 4 stories:People of the Black Circle (REH)The Slithering Shadow (REH)The Drums of Tombalku (DeCamp, REH)The Pool of the Black One (REH)Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) created the premiere sword-and-sorcery character Conan the barbarian for the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the early 1930's. L. Sprague De Camp, an academic and literary fantasist, edited the stories for re-publication in the 1960's. He also obtained outlines for never-completed Conan tales from Howard's literary agent, Glenn Lord, and used them to produce pastiches in the Howard manner. &quot;The Drums of Tombalku&quot; is one of these stories; although REH is listed as co-author the story is really assembled from such adventures as &quot;Jewels of Gwahlur&quot; and &quot;The Slithering Shadow&quot;. Oddly Conan plays an incidental role; it is Almuric the Aquilonian adventurer who discovers the lost, decaying city of a dying race who are preyed upon by a supernatural monster, and rescues the damsel in distress. Conan is tacked on at the end in a bit of mercenary intrigue that appears to be included only to give him a role in the story - as a fairy Godfather?Of the real Howard stories, &quot;People of the Black Circle&quot; is the best, a neat mixture of sorcery, intrigue and action. &quot;The Slithering Shadow&quot; is a formulaic lost-city- decayed-race- monster-threatens-the-ingenue story, and &quot;Pool of the Black One&quot; is only a minor variation on the theme."},{"Title":"Conan The Adventurer","review":"I bought this as a gift for my dad since he had one growing up and had lost it over the years.

(surprisingly not among the three)--and also has written the most famous one-act ever, THE ZOO STORY. A DELICATE BALANCE is one of the Pulitzer winners; anyone who cares about theatre will love this. In performance an electrifying evening, it is also a darn good read--again and again. A tragedy at times hilarious, the stylized piece is an examination of friendship contrasted with family, in which the playwright creates six delicous characters--roles actors especially love and often perform brilliantly. Katherine Hepburn's filmed version comes to mind--a near perfect expression of the matriarch Agnes, who has several problems: her alcoholic sister is drinking in the living room, her daughter is coming home after a failed 4th marriage, and her friends Edna and Harry have decided to move in because they are &quot;afraid&quot; of something. Agnes's husband Tobias is polite, detached, and reasonable. Against bristling tension, the author uses drunken Claire as comic counterpoint to brilliant effect, giving her an accordion (of all things) as prop with which to accent and poke fun. (There's a wonderful sight gag near the end where this character, who isn't supposed to have one drink, is discovered holding two.) We also smile when mousy Edna tries to re-decorate Agnes's home and speaks to the divorcing Julia as if she were her own daughter. (How easily shyness moves to assertiveness, then imperceptibly to cruelty.) So we laugh to keep from crying--but laugh we do! And although Agnes is unforgettable, nevertheless it is Tobias who gets the climactic &quot;aria,&quot; an attempt to put his house in order. The dramatist calls our bluff on what we mean by &quot;friends,&quot; fusing big ideas in three elegant acts, crystallizing mysterious beauty from carefully chosen words. The result is a theatrical touchstone, one of Edward Albee's many masterpieces, a magnificent gem of a play."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"Albee, the playwright who invented one of the more complicated and vivid relationships ever in a play in ZOO STORY, has again demonstrated his intimate knowledge of the deeper motives behind human interaction. Every interaction between characters in this play -- from long monologues to short snippets of conversation -- has behind it some manner of conflict.Everybody in this play needs change, and can only reach it through the destruction of others; Tobias and Agnes who simply want to be left alone, but whose house has been invaded; Julia, the daughter who is betrayed by the fact that her parents gave away her room; Claire, who wants only to excercise her right to a good time; Edna and Harry who aren't quite sure what they need, and subsequently frustrate everyone else.This is a very heavy play, but written in a such a way that is has the guise of being a comedy. A must-read for anybody that loves drama."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"Agnes open the play with a monologue in which she contemplates the possibility that one day, unexpectedly, she might turn mad. She says she contemplates it with astonishment, but she does not sound very astonished at all, she is more... fashinated by the idea. Her husband is listening, but not listening at all as if he could not hear Agnes, or her talking about the possibility of becoming mad was perfectly normal, or she has been mad a long time and he discounts her.I won't spoil the play, but (for me) it is an interesting investigation in what it means to be mad. Indeed it is not clear who is mad, probably all of them, possibly none. The bounderies of madness are not clearly drawn and characters seem to shift in and out of it on a continuous basis. Rules of the polite society are called into question. Is it mad to break them or to upkeep them?The play is enjoyable to read, but not overly so, it is above everything else, enjoyable to think about."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"I am writing ANOTHER review because I CANNOT EXPRESS to you how wonderful this play is. I just read it for the second time. It is one of the three best plays I have every read in my life, and believe me, I have read all the plays worth reading. This is almost as good as &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; Once again, I love love love love love this play and all the characters. There is a movie. Don't see it. The play is better. Read the play. There are many great moments: Tobias' &quot;cat speech,&quot; Tobias' memorable four-page closing speech, all of Act Two Scene Two, all of Act Three, Claire's disturbing interpretation of what it's like to be an alcoholic...they go on and on. This is my theory of what the play is about essentially: this is the story of a family who does nothing all day but sit and drink and b*tch about how terrible their lives are. They have lots of money. They have good friends and a good family. But they have let their lives go to waste. They've let life pass them by. Now they are old and sit back and realize how much they've missed. But not before much turmoil and anger are let out. There are a husband and wife in the play who sleep in separate beds, until one night, for lack of room, they are forced to sleep together and they realize: THEY LIKE IT.

Like most of Albee's plays, it only has a limited number of characters (six), much booze, crumbling marriages and long nights filled with hurtful remarks. A complicated and compelling story of an aging couple, the wife's brash sister, the couple's dissatisfied daughter, and two friends who drop in unexpectedly one night. Worth a look."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"I read the book days before attending a flawless production of the play. I thoroughly appreciated Albee's amazing writing, his wit, his sarcasm, and his uncanny ability to display emotions. We witness regret, desperation, loss, and alienation. Change - can we accept it? Do we want to accept it? Why cannot everything remain the same? Through all of this, Agnes is trying to 'maintain a delicate balance'. Albee's dialog brings you inside each character and then you can see interaction. Then, if you are fortunate, you see it come alive on stage. For example, you can anticipate Claire saying, &#34;Here is your orange juice, Julie&#34;, as she pours it on the carpet! A joy to read. A bonus is all of the additional information, props, stage settings, original casts, etc."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"Edward Albee's \\"A Delicate Balance\\" has only a few of the theatrical fireworks that animate his more renowned, first full-length play, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" There are no bottles smashed, no attempts at strangulation, no seduction scenes. There is one brief episode with a gun, but it is somewhat less shocking than the gun episode in \\"Who's Afraid\\". Nevertheless, both plays are based on the results of Albee's scrutinizing of the nature of our fears and the dangers of our complacencies. In \\"A Delicate Balance\\", Agnes and Tobias, each in his/her own way, try to keep the social and psychological balance that has nourished their notions of friendship, parenthood, love of sibling, and material comfort. When friends Harry and Edna invade their space; when Agnes' sister's alcoholism surfaces; when daughter Julia's fourth impending divorce crosses their threshhold, the balance begins to tip and their lives seem at the point of capsizing completely. All of these situations and states are handled beautifully through Albee's brilliant use of language and structure. One finishes the play with an urge to re-examine the abstract notions that keep us ALL balanced."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"I liked reading it, funny interesting play.

I am always satisfied with Amazon."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"Edward Albee is best-known for his play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a Broadway classic that was made into a film starring a young Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. However, this play, A Delicate Balance, is my favorite out of Albee's plays, and I've read nearly all of them. It won Albee the first of his 3 Pulitzer Prizes, and was made into a film starring Katherine Hepburn.The story focuses on an aging WASP couple, Agnes and Tobias. Agnes' alcoholic sister, Claire, lives with the couple. Then events, or rather people, intrude into this carefully ordered household. First, two old friends, Harry and Edna, arrive without warning and ask to stay for an indeterminate time. Then Julia, the daughter of Agnes and Tobias, also asks for refuge. Cracks form in the veneer of control and peace that Agnes has cultivated. The character of Claire (a delightful drunk if there ever was one) steals the show as she alternately mocks the situation and tries to help the people involved.As in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the characters occupy intensely charged domestic landscapes, inner spaces of anxiety and dread, and the climaxes of both plays are punctuated by speeches from the main characters. These monologues roll out with a cathartic force equivalent to operatic arias. True to its title, though, the play as a whole feels restrained and delicate, its turmoil gurgling underneath.Since Albee is a playwright who is extremely sensitive to the musical, rhythmic aspect of drama, his plays can unfold in a reader's mind as easily, and perhaps more perfectly than if they were realized on a stage. Albee himself has compared playwrights' scripts to musical scores. Like a musician who can read music and then \\"hear\\" it in his mind, those readers who are comfortable reading dramatic dialogue and stage directions can easily experience A Delicate Balance in the privacy of their rooms."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" will be the play that is revived again and again over years, like Hellman's \\"Little Foxes,\\" because middle-aged stars will be asked what they'd like to do and, inevitably, this is the play of choice, but like Hellman's lesser-known \\"Another Part of the Forest,\\" this play by Albee is his best. It is less flashy, less loud, less dramatic, but it is deeper and more moving. It 'plays' to the women in the audience, I suppose, because Agnes is more interesting of the characters, more so than Tobias. The Harry and Edna characters are mere shadows of the lead couple, in fact one can see them as alter-egos of the two leads, their lesser or better halves, depending on how one sees it. Anyway, Harry and Edna come to visit one night and then want to stay. Their intrusion or invasion, if you like, sets the house afire, and Albee has a field day working out what in the end is a reasonably challenging moral dilemma: let them stay or throw them out? Of course, there are cultures for which this would not be such a crisis, but for WASPS issues of 'sharing' and of 'giving' get to the heart of what love is, and Albee suggests these people might not have any love to give."},{"Title":"A Delicate Balance: A Play (Pocket Books)","review":"This is the first of Edward Albee's plays to garner the Pulitzer Prize in 1967. The other two were Seascape and Three Tall Women. Probably his most popular is Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf.A Delicate Balance is comprised of brilliant dialogue, mostly short snippets, and some very meaningful longer dialogue. It is dialogue that offers sarcastic humor and provides a continuity of mystery that provokes thought. There are not excessive stage directions or character descriptions, it is all in the dialogue.To view this onstage would take a great stage direction and better castmembers who can pull it off with intense theatrical skill as Albee intended.Tobias and Agnes are a well-to-do middle-age couple's questionable balance in life is disrupted when \\"hangers on\\" invade their space. At home is Agnes' alcoholic, witty younger sister Claire (mid 30's) and their four times married daughter Julia is coming back home, routinely. Harry and Edna, dear friends of Tobias and Agnes come to stay because they are fearful and we are kept wondering what has them so scared that they need to leave their own home.Things get heated when Julia arrives, again, and Harry and Edna take up her room and she retaliates furiously, openly and child-like. We learn that Tobias had an affair, they had a son who died young, and they have not slept together for years.This is a great play that focuses on the truth and illusion in marriage, a popular theme of Albee's. The first performance in New York Sept. 1966 starred Hume Cronyn and his wife, Jessica Tandy, two of the best in theatre. That would have been a great performance. .....Rizzo"},{"Title":"Pearl Inlay: An instruction manual for inlaying abalone and mother-of-pearl","review":"The bible of pearl embellishment, this book has been the inspiration for generations of inlay artists.

His investigative technique seemed very clever and realistic.The conclusion of the book was not forshadowed and hits you like a locomotive.The story paints a very raw reality of life and the human spirit that keeps you thinking and even having dreams long after you finish.In some ways the story is a great tragedy, but it is also very touching to see the love and self sacrifice characters in the book show to a very wounded soul."},{"Title":"Secrets of Harry Bright","review":"Wambaugh has the ability to create books that are humourous and worth reading if you need a dose of black comedy and he does it again in this novel. Although I must admit that the majority of the book is cookie-cutter stuff as the author goes over the same ground as in a number of his previous books with stories of the police officers.The end of the book is worth the price of the book though and is thought-provoking as we find out the Secret of Harry Bright....."},{"Title":"Secrets of Harry Bright","review":"I have not read much fiction in my lifetime.

The introductions to each of the characters are often hilarous as we see various \\"clowns\\" hired into the Mineral Springs PD by the title character. However, one might become a bit impatient since you need to get well into the book before you have a true sense of where the story is going. Buried under the many anecdotal type scenes, but ultimately rising into prominance is the common bond linkng the title character, the main investigative officer, and the millionaire who hires the latter, and it's this theme that gives the entire book meaning and rewards the patient reader."},{"Title":"Secrets of Harry Bright","review":"Wambaugh formula--middle-aged cops who eat & drink too much, who've seen too much & lost too much, and are so burned out that they're looking for another life, if they're lucky enough to reach retirement. And a mystery to be solved, from the thinnest of clues, with a bent ending & no resolution. And all wrapped in stories cops tell each other--with great dialogue, well developed male characters, and one-dimensional females. Ah, the job, the job! Starting each of the early chapters off with point-of-view that shifts with each character was irksome to me, but, otherwise, a good read, overlong for its novella content. Here's its irony: Wambaugh is trapped in the world that his characters are trying to escape, even as he writes about it. Experience makes cynics of us all, and cops get cynical fast, including those who write about what they learned."},{"Title":"Secrets of Harry Bright","review":"I've read all of Wambaugh's books and impatiently wait for each new one. &quot;The Secrets Of Harry Bright&quot; is probably the least known of his books, but it's the one that keeps haunting me.

Derie - Civil War News - Prolific Confederate naval historian R. Thomas Campbell has turned his efforts to writing about the torpedo boats of the Confederate States Navy (and Army). These evolved when the South attempted to find ways to use torpedoes&amp;#61630;which we would call mines today&amp;#61630;as an offensive weapon. Originally the torpedoes were kegs or casks, waterproofed, and either secured to the bot-tom or buoyed, filled with explosives and armed with a fuse set to explode when a ship's hull brushed against it. An attempt to use them offensively was made by securing two torpedoes to-gether with a piece of line about 200 feet long, then rowing to a point some distance above an enemy vessel and releasing the two torpedoes to drift with the current. The idea was for the line between the torpedoes to be snagged by the vessel and for one or both of the torpedoes to swing against the hull. This was tried against Union warships in Hampton Roads in October 1861, without success. Captain Francis D. Lee, a Confederate Army engineer working on chemical fuses for tor-pedoes in Charleston, thought that the best way to use the torpedo offensively would be to mount it on a spar forward of the bow of a boat and deliver it by ramming it into the side of its target. This vessel would obviously be a torpedo ram or torpedo boat. He convinced General Beaure-gard this was the type of quick, easy to build weapon the Confederates needed to defend Charleston Harbor against the vastly superior federal fleet and the Confederate torpedo boat pro-gram was bom. The initial type of torpedo boat was a rowboat or launch. Later, specially designed mod-els were developed, powered by steam, either with an open deck (CSS Squib class) or partially covered with wood or iron (CSS Torch class), and designed to ride low in the water to make them hard to detect. The other type was the David, a semi-submersible, with a cylindrical hull that was bal-lasted by iron or by water (via pumps) enabling them to ride low in the water. These came in a number of models with various sized torpedoes. Most were about five feet in diameter and about 48 feet long with a 14 foot long spar for the torpedo. However, one captured at the end of the war was 160 feet long and 11.5 feet in diameter. Davids were generally powered by steam but a few were powered by oars or a screw turned by the crew. The latter was also the propul-sion system of a fully submersible torpedo boat, the Hunley, which is not part of this story. Confederate successes with torpedo boats were few. The USS New Ironsides was se-verely damaged and had to be dry-docked by an attack from the original David. Unfortunately, the torpedo struck right at the bulkhead, which prevented the ship from sinking. The CSS Squib slightly damaged the USS Minnesota. Ironically, the most successful and famous torpedo boat attack was Commander William B. Cushing's destruction of the CSS Albemarle. The torpedo boats' prime contribution to the Confederate war effort was the fear they struck in the Union Navy, and the actions taken to guard against such attacks. In an appendix there is a wonderful statement by Commander William T. Glassell, the commander of the CSS David the night it damaged the USS New Ironsides. Writing after the war he described &quot;the ironclad vessels of that fleet enveloped like women in hoopskirt petticoats of netting, to lay in idle admiration of themselves for many months.&quot; The book is very well illustrated with drawings and many pictures of torpedo boats and spar torpedoes. It is highly recommended for those with an interest in the Confederate Navy and general readers will also find it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hunters of the Night: Confederate Torpedo Boats in the War Between the States","review":"As used during the War Between the States, the term \\"torpedo\\" meant any underwater explosive device. Torpedo boats were any and all of the various designs employed to deliver the devices to the side of enemy vessels. This is the history of the design, manufacture and utilization of such boats. Unfortunately, the Confederate leadership failed to recognize the real value of this new weapon. Although the building of these boats was authorized early in the war, the actual building of them was often hindered by officials who failed to recognize their potential value. However, when available, these relatively speedy boats proved that by operating within the cover of darkness they could bring fear and destruction to a strategically overpowering and more numerous foe. They caused many a Union sailor to lie awake wondering if the bump he had just heard was a log hitting his ship or a torpedo that would blow him away. Rather than the destruction of great numbers of enemy ships, the greatest contribution made by these boats was the deterrent factor they became to the Union invaders. Vast quantities of seamen, materials, and ships had to be allocated to guard against their expected attacks. Union offensive plans were often swayed by consideration of their use against the attackers. Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard paid tribute to the torpedo boats when he commented that future Southerners would ask \\"how it was that with such a great discovery, offering such magnificent results, we never applied it to any useful purpose in this contest for our homes and independence.\\" This is a welcome addition to available information on Confederate naval activity."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Analysis and Integration Theory (The Intext Series in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"There is no shortage of excellent Analysis Texts available.

Fortunately for us, historical novels buffs, some volumes pertain to this genre, allowing us to access a very inexpensive and high quality product.This is the story of two members of the Cole family: Rob Sr. & Rob Jr.The story, situated in the period around 1830-1870, starts following Rob Sr.'s life since his forced emigration from Scotland to America and is reconstructed thru his personal diary as discovered and read, after his death, by his son Rob Jr.Rob Sr. initiates his medical practice at Boston's Irish ghetto and meets Oliver Wendell Holmes, precursor of medical prophylaxis.Later he continues his migration going into Illinois and stopping at Holden's Crossing where he starts a new life as rural physician.There he builds his home, start his relationship with the Sauk Native Americans people, fall in love, heal & marry Sarah, have a child who will contract scarlatina and lose his hearing.At this point Rob's Jr. life is the second main thread of the narration, following his education and fervent desire to be a physician as his father.Both threads will conflux at the Civil War period.Historical reconstruction is paramount, showing domestic every day details, political issues, educational issues, medical issues and cultural issues with deepness and commitment. This aspect of the novel is by far better than the period reconstruction done by Mr. Gordon in \\"The Physician\\".A much recommended read for those interested in historical subjects, daily life period reconstruction and medical practice.

Three stars.&quot;Songhouse,&quot; by distinguished SF writer Orson Scott Card, is so lavish with a sense of the epic: without (the institution called the Songhouse, the galactic emperor), and within (personal journey of discovery and the development of a child prodigy). It is different from most SF you'll read. Four stars.&quot;Ker-Plop&quot; was described by Mr. Carr as succumbing to the &quot;my alien artifact is bigger than your alien artifact&quot; syndrome.

Clay Morgan paints a very evocative picture that ultimately speaks about religion, theology, and the worthlessness of thinking too much about life."},{"Title":"Santiago and the Drinking Party","review":"I pretty much agree with the Kirkus review. It does provide an interesting view of how another culture sees things such as illness vs how we would see them.It is somewhat disappointing from a character and relationship development point of view.It does make one wish they could see Angelina!"},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"Even in the great 'Celtic revival' of the past generation, where the cultures of the Celtic fringes of Britain and continental Europe have re-exerted themselves in various political and non-political ways, the Welsh revival has been late in coming, and a little less forceful in affect and event.Perhaps history is to blame here -- the Welsh have been only marginally protected by geography; the mountainous area was difficult terrain to conquer, but the supply lines to those mountains were relatively easy to maintain and sustain, unlike the trek to the northern reaches of Scotland or crossing the sea into Ireland, areas that (however much English history might want to contradict this statement) never were completely conquered and subdued, remaining under the hegemony but outside the total control of Londinium/London from Roman times to the recent past. Wales was never so fortunate. Indeed, it is a miracle that the Welsh survive. The Scots lost land, language and independence, but retained administrative and legal systems separations that preserved many aspects of nationhood. The Irish never completely lost independence. The Welsh, however, lost everything of nationhood, and barely sustained an independent culture. Thus, when the 'nations' of the British Isles began to re-exert their independent interpretations of history, the Welsh were among the last.However, sometimes the last shall be first. In terms of quality of writing and interpretation, the volume by John Davies, \`A History of Wales', is indeed in a class of its own in terms of Welsh history. Dafydd Elis Thomas read into the \`Hansard' (the British Parliamentary equivalent of the \`Congressional Record') that this is 'the greatest of book of Welsh history ever written'.It was, in fact, originally published in Welsh, under the title of \`Haynes Cymru' in 1990. From the Ice Age to the 1980s miners strikes and efforts to reassert a national identity, Davies traces in some detail a history of Wales from a Welsh perspective, inextricably tangled with English and continental history, but nonetheless deserving of its own perspective as one of the last major surviving Celtic groups.\`A number of factors, the increasing prominence of the European dimension in particular, have caused the devolution issue to return to the political agenda.... From 1911 to 1981 the number of Welsh speakers declined census by census. In 1991, however, those claiming a knowledge of the language were marginally more numerous than had been the case in 1981, and the increase among the younger age groups was especially remarkable.'Davies confesses that he contemplated writing a different book in English, as this was meant to be a Welsh book, and he would have envisioned a different book had his first thought been in English. However, given the demand of non-Welsh readers to read the same history treatment as those who do read Welsh, Davies consented to a translation rather than a re-write.The time frames are not the same as those of standard British histories, which tend to follow the broad sweep of royal affairs. While there is some parallel of necessity, the time factors and dates here have far more interest to the direct concerns of Wales than to the rest of Britain.The reader should also be prepared for an array of names, of both persons and places, that are very confusing to the average reader of English -- Gwydir, Llangeitho, Aberffraw, Catraeth, Llantwit, Penmynydd and Llyn Cerrig Bach. However, it is worth the effort to learn these names and places. Particularly in America, where so many people have Welsh ancestry (the Jones now outnumber the Smiths in America as the greatest number of people by last name, and Jones is a Welsh name by and large), this is part of the collective history of America, too.Well written, well researched (Davies was educated in Wales and at Cambridge, taught Welsh history at University College in Wales), this is perhaps the currently-accepted definitive history of Wales available today."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"Over the years, several English kings and numerous politicans had a disliking for the Welsh and refused to allow any representation of Wales on the British &quot;Union Flag&quot;. Instead of disappearing, Wales has survived and is now fighting for recognition, both as the first nation of Britain and as a modern European region.To understand Welsh history takes time and nobody acts a better personal guide than John Davies. This insightful book goes a long way to explain the curious juxtapostion of Welsh sympathy and antipathy to its domineering neighbours in England and the reasons for the demise of its language and culture, particularly during the last century. Although his writing is factual and unsentimental the book enables the reader to get a real flavour for Wales.'A History of Wales' addresses the failure over many centuries to allow Wales its rightful place within British history. The text is thorough and comprehensive, yet never difficult to digest.As Wales revives its national identity and political future, it's culture will gain increasing recognition worldwide over the next ten years, much as Ireland did in the eighties and nineties. Those who wish to know more about this fascinating nation should read this book."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"John Davies book does an excellent job tracing the path of Welch civilization from the dawn of time to the Thatcherisim of the late 1980's. The book coveres with an exceptional clarity the issues, consequences and decisions of the Major Historical eras of Welch history. By focusing not only on Welch power, but on the people in their darkest hours, Davies provides a balanced, well thought out work that is indepth enough to be a survey text, yet researched extensivly to be a companion to the research of Wales' history. I strongly recommend this work to any who wish to see the legend of King Arthor's homeland in a balanced, explained historical light."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"The back of this book's cover has quotes from several authorities who praise the book and its author, and I found no reason to take issue with their evaluations. This book seems to be a definitive work on the history of Wales and has clear value to people who are interested in understanding their heritage, although it was written for the serious historian (which I am not) as well. Perhaps in keeping with this audience, the book is not an easy read -- it is packed with facts, interpretations, and ideas that really need careful study to appreciate and understand fully. It has many maps, but I found myself wanting better ones, and sometimes thinking that the author assumed the reader would be more familiar with Britain's geography and history than myself. The author writes well and the book is often engaging, reflecting Davies's concern with his own cultural affiliations. Roughly 700 pages in a typical Penguin paperback make for a considerable time investment."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"While Scotland and the medieval periods is my area of history, I often have need to know what is going on in England, Ireland and Wales, to fully understand what is going on in the 'big picture'. The history of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland did not happen individual vacuums, you so need to know all their histories to fully comprehend external pressures as well as the inner problems of each nation. So I have found this a wonderful work for reference on Wales.It covers the history of the country from the dawn of time to 20th Century. So if you wish to know about Ffynnon Beuno or the Rebecca Wars, this is your book.Excellent reference for Historical writers."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"John Davies covers a lot of territory (in terms of time, if not in space) in his &quot;A History of Wales&quot;, originally published (1990) in Welsh as &quot;Hanes Cymru&quot;. This will probably stand as the definitive general history of this fascinating country for years to come.Beginning with the earliest evidence for human occupation of Wales, Davies brings us up to the end of the 1980s. Each of his ten chapters covers a particular time period, and each chapter title features three place names that represent, and figure into, the theme of that chapter/period. Davies touches on nearly every aspect of Welsh history--the political, the social, and the cultural. If some themes garner less attention than others, that is to be expected in a survey of this kind. One theme, of course, dominates this volume (as it should), and that is the relationship between the Welsh and their much more populous English neighbors to the east. That the Welsh were able to resist English domination for so long is miraculous; despite eventual English hegemony, the Welsh have managed to preserve their language, while over the past century there has been a revival of Welsh culture.The writing is clear and concise, a testament to Davies' skill as both writer and translator. Davies has included a wealth of maps and graphs to illustrate many of his themes. If I have one complaint about &quot;A History of Wales&quot; it is the complete absence of photographs and other illustrations that would have benefited Davies' narrative immensely. That being said, however, this is a fine introduction to a part of the British Isles that we in the US hear very little about. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"This is one of the worst general history books I have ever read. The writing is endlessly drudging, consistently focused on the least interesting aspects of every topic. If you would like to know the exact number of people working in the Welsh minefields in 1921 versus 1931, or how many seats the Conservatives won in the 1984 election, this is the book for you. If you would like something that instead conveys an over-arching, well-thought-out, and interesting grasp of the history of Wales, read something else.I sought this book out because I will soon be moving to Wales, and wanted to learn about the region's history. Well, this was the wrong choice. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are already very knowledgeable about Wales. Davies consistently makes allusions to myths, people, or events without explaining them; for instance, during the chapters on the Middle Ages, he often mentioned that a certain person was the ancestor of \\"the famous X\\". Who were these famous descendants? I have no idea, since they were never people the average American has heard of, and Davies did not bother to explain himself. I'm sure that this would not be a problem for people more familiar with Wales, but for someone seeking to learn, it was a major stumbling block. The most egregious example of this is the fact that this book has dozens of maps, showing the population in areas of Wales, different industries in Wales, distributions of religions in Wales, etc. However, there is a not a single map included with the major rivers and geographic areas labeled, so that a reader unfamiliar with the region could orient themselves.In addition, Davies consistently focused on the most irrelevant, boring, and mind-numbing aspects of history. He almost seems to deliberately avoid interesting details. For instance, he often mentions poets famous for their lyricism. Does the book feature even one quote of that beautiful poetry? No. He mentions powerful, compelling novelists, without telling us what they wrote their novels on. He describes preachers famous for their sermons, but does not tell us what they said. He alludes to beautiful paintings, architecture, sculpture, and other arts, but does not include a single photo. The entire book instead focuses on numbers and dates. Let me quote an example for you. During an investigation of working conditions in the minefields, Davies writes that the investigator was \\"horrified by the inhuman attitude of some of the owners and by the arrogance of landlords such as the duke of Northumberland and Baron Tredegar, men who had profited greatly from the royalties paid upon the coal mined beneath their estates\\" (page 516). That sounds interesting, right? What did they say that was so horrifying and arrogant? Too bad if you wanted to know, because Davies never says. However, he does have plenty of space, in the previous paragraph, to write that \\"By 15 April the miners had agreed by 693,684 votes to 76,992 to accept the Sankey proposals\\" (page 515). Because the average reader really *needs* to know the exact number of votes cast on every issue. Don't worry, Davies will give you those exact numbers for every political election.Like I said, Wales isn't my specialty. However, I do study pre-history, and I have to say that Davies got a few facts wrong in that chapter (he doesn't seem to understand the distinctions between Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, and Cro-Magnons, and in addition got a date wrong). Clearly prehistory isn't his focus, so he probably had fewer mistakes in the rest of the book, but it did make me wonder."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"To be called, by Westminster, the most complete volume on the principality of Wales is perhaps the highest honor for Davies's _A History of Wales_. The work gives insight into the workings of Welsh society, and its interaction with its English neighbor. As the nation modernized, Wales experienced difficulty in keeping its Celtic roots, and staving off the encroaching Angliciztion that had toppled the south Wales industrial area. Davies does justice to the events and people that have shaped modern Wales; and it's a good read to boot."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"IF YOU WANT AN IN DEPTH HISTORY OF WALES THIS IS IT.

It is an exhaustive history that will not exhaust you. I am reading it for general interest and find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"I'm afraid I don't share the opinion of most of the other reviewers. I found this book tedious, rambling and poorly organized. I am half Welsh and have visited the areas in the southeastern coalfields where my grandparents came from several times which happen to be featured often in this work. Indeed that background was the only thing that kept me reading. Perhaps a better title would be \\"The Political History of the Southeastern Wales Coalfields\\" because that is where he spends about 80% of his time. With chapters of sometimes 100 or more pages with no sub-titles gives a glimpse of just how hard it was to figure out where he was going with his discussions. You have to be a hard core Welshaholic to appreciate this one."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"Just over seven-hundred pages in paperback, this updated narrative spans it all, from prehistory to devolution. Its bulk belies its often remarkable readability. Translated in 1993 by the author from the 1990 Welsh-language edition, with an eleventh chapter added to the 2007 revision, Davies' coverage keeps energy and verve despite an inevitable recital of lots of names, dates, statistics, and data.This makes it a challenge, naturally, to read straight through-- if with many breaks! Still, as a reference, my copy's filled with notations now. While the lack of footnotes or a bibliography (due to the length of the body of the text already) may discourage researchers slightly, the value of a one-volume, thorough, and accessible work remains inestimable to scholars and a wider audience both.Davies keeps a winningly low-key presence. As a skilled interpreter, he presents heaps of evidence through which he's sifted the wheat from the chaff. The labor must have been immense. He gives you material, and then steps back to sum it up in a striking phrase now and then, as an experienced lecturer may do. \\"The nation of the Welsh was conceived on the death-bed of the Roman Empire; it was born in the excitement of the 'Age of Saints' but its infancy was meagre and lonely. Yet, as shall be seen, it would have an exhilarating adolescence.\\" (77) So ends the chapter on the early medieval period-- one of the most difficult to explain based on the least evidence, but a section I found captivating.Although Davies never explains this directly, he organizes each chapter around the rhetorical device of a triad-- commonly used in old Welsh as a memory aid for bards. While this remains rather subtle, it's a clever nod to the past legacy that sustains the present exploration of what it means to be Welsh, always defined as both the oldest British and, as the terms warp, a \\"foreigner\\" in one's own homeland. This challenge remains. The last chapter looks at incomers and how they've transformed \\"y Gymru Gymraeg\\"-- the formerly Welsh-speaking heartland. \\"Pont,\\" a \\"bridge\\" program aimed at newcomers to teach them about local culture, rests on a shaky metaphor: \\"the essence of a bridge is that the piers on either side are of equal strength; that was hardly true of the pier of Englishness and the pier of Welshness.\\" (689)Speaking of architecture, many tourists today, along with the \\"heritage industry,\\" romanticize old fortifications. Davies, typically, balances his judgment. \\"The castles can be considered to be shameful memorials to the subjugation of the Welsh-- 'the magnificent badges of our subjection' as Thomas Pennant put it. Yet, when it is considered that the medieval military architect's science and art at the height of their development were necessary to ensure that subjection, the castles may be seen as a tribute to the tenacity of the resistance of the Welsh, as eloquent testimony to the immensity of the task of uprooting from Wales the rule of the Welsh.\\" (167)This exemplifies the depth of this study. Davies cites a telling phrase from a venerable scholar two hundred years previous to him. He acknowledges its truth, while circling around it for a fresh perspective that confirms its necessity while directing our attention to its opposite, or complimentary in more peaceful times, corollary. And, he strives for fair-mindedness rather than jingoism or revisionism.For such legends and identities last long in Wales. Treating a period of tranquility within an often fractious later medieval period of increasingly English-inflicted domination, Davies notes how myths played a dual role in exacerbating wrath and reconciling defeat. Myths \\"were a cry against the extinction of identity and against the tyranny of fact.\\" (180)Later, Davies relates the gradual capitulation to imperial rule, and the often enthusiastic participation by the Welsh in the colonial enterprises at home and abroad. Imbued with Non-Conformist and even pacifist Christian tendencies, the Welsh proved rather an anomaly in more recent centuries. Their literacy rates soared as the Bible was translated into the people's native tongue, and this education prepared them better than other Celts, perhaps, to face the assaults of modernity and industrialization that kept many Welsh at home rather than forcing them to emigrate. So many that at one point about half of all the workers in Wales directly or indirectly depended on King Coal. He sums up the change: \\"In Merthyr, even a labourer owned a watch.\\" (340)The century of mining domination is introduced by a particularly masterful seventh chapter that ties together dozens of threads into a rich tapestry of rebellion, technology, language, worship, and politics in the early 1800s. While I found myself a bit glazed by the subsequent treatment of Gladstone and Liberals-- the book here as in sections closer to our times does get heavily weighed down by parliamentarian election results and inter-party contentions-- I was roused by the chapter on the early 20th century. Davies seems to revive and his pace quickens.Radicalism and Christian values contended and co-existed in complex fashions in modern times. Conservatism influenced the nature of the language movement, as advocates sometimes argued that Cymraeg shielded its speakers from harmful foreign ideas. Others urged anglicization as a remedy for poverty and a charm for wealth. Unlike Ireland, the factions for independence by violent means were few, and generally the Welsh have accepted their position, Davies charts, within a kingdom as a principality, rather than as a polity demanding separation by language or ideology. Here, Davies seems to align with Gwyn A. Williams, whose \\"When Was Wales?\\" (1983; reviewed by me on Amazon last month) sets out a similar understanding.Of course, whereas Williams concluded in the first term of Thatcher, Davies continues the saga through the collapse of mining, the rise to nearly half (as of 2003) of all births being out of wedlock, and the increasing visibility of Welsh-language media and English-language usage. He contrasts in the last chapter many ramifications of the narrow decision to accept in 1997 a degree of limited self-rule that was trounced in 1979. He leaves us with a survey of a more diverse, less Welsh-Wales-centered constituency in this region. One where the areas nearest the borders hold most of its people, often in defiance of stereotypes peddled by the Welsh themselves, it's an intriguingly perplexing realm. It's the oldest remaining bastion of Britishness, one marginalized, determined, and always, it seems, somehow declining while reviving."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"The title of this review may sound like a law firm but it is sadly the truth about this book.I did not buy this expecting a light ,easy read but Lordy! it is a chore [I gave up around two thirds of the way through,unwilling to be bored rigid any longer].As a textbook or source for a thesis or for someone who wanted to write an interesting book about Wales,it would be useful.If these are not your inentions give ita big miss."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"THE HISTORY OF WALES was a notably well-written book.

Highly recommnded."},{"Title":"A History of Wales","review":"I've always felt a bit sorry for the Welsh as their proximity to England has put them at a disadvantage to the other Celtic nations - Ireland separated by the sea and Scotland separated by sparsely-inhabited northern England.Wales has three large English cities within driving distance - Liverpool, Bristol and Birmingham - and has been legally and administratively annexed to England for over 400 years.It has also attracted English immigrants in a way that Scotland never has thereby diluting the ethnic composition in many areas. Figures from this book show that Welsh-born people make up 1% of the population of England while English-born people make up 20% of the population of Wales.As a result, many Welsh people themselves developed inferiority complexes and felt they were incapable of running their own affairs.The same was true in Scotland for much of the 20th century but fortunately all this has changed and Scotland is now heading towards independence and, hopefully, encouraging the Welsh to see that it is possible to emerge from under the English shadow.Welsh nationalism has been held back by a number of factors such as the feeling by some non-Welsh speakers that Plaid Cymru was against their interests or the Labour Party belief that nationalism went against international socialism.The Welsh have not only provided leaders at UK level, i.e. Lloyd George, Ernest Bevan and Neil Kinnock but have elected English-born MPs like Michael Foot and Jim Callaghan to represent them in London.This is a fascinating book and shows that Welshness has remained a living force despite the centuries of oppression and neglect by London-based governments.The Welsh have maintained many aspects of their culture - particularly their language - to a greater extent than the Irish and Scots.It might be asking too much to expect someone who is not Welsh to read 700 pages of the country's history which, at times, is a bit heavy going. However, at a time when relations among all the countries in the British Isles are changing, it is worth the effort to learn about the country that is least known* even though it was home to the original Britons.*That is unless you regard Cornwall as a separate country too."},{"Title":"Fairy-Tales From France","review":"This edition is worth having for your fairy-tale lovers.

I wish modern fairy story books were done so beautifully."},{"Title":"Dreams of Dreams and the Last Three Days of Fernando Pessoa","review":"This book is a collection of short stories of dreams of various major artists or influences on the arts - from Daedalus to Freud. It is a book that makes me wish to be more broadly educated in European literature - for when I was familiar with the biography and works of the individual, the matching of the imagined dream to the individual was more clear. For example, the dream of Federico Garcia Lorca picks up on his work regarding deepsong. Lorca is on stage singing a Gypsy song &quot;a song about duels and orange groses, passion and death&quot; ... A small black dog leads him towards his death as a traitor ... The dream is a wonderful mix of clarity and chaotic jumps, as are real dreams.Tabucchi writes in his normal taut prose - with wonderful lines to mull over: &quot;Life is indecipherable, answered Pessoa. Never ask and never believe. Everything is hidden.&quot;But this book, unlike his other works requires significant knowledge of his reader. If you've never read Tabucchi, I would suggest that you begin with any of his other books. If you are a Tabucchi fan, this new book will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Dreams of Dreams and the Last Three Days of Fernando Pessoa","review":"I was very disappointed by the Tabucchi's Dreams. The author attempts to recreate the dreams of twenty or so canonical figures from Western civilization. I felt that author made no effort to penetrate the psyche of these great human beings. The dreams were recreated by an obviously shallow reading of bio-sketches. If you want to know what I mean, select one of the characters you know very well and read his dream. I am familiar with Debussy's music and have no qualms about suggesting that Debussy's dream is a mediocre parody of his \\"Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun\\".The same problems persist in the Last Three Days of Fernando Pessoa. This short work offended me more than the Dreams. I adore Pessoa and his poetry. It was heartbreaking to see all his heteronyms turn into colorless characters that stroll through this story. I consider Ricardo Reis to be the heteronym closest to Pessoa's personality. Unfortunately Reis comes back to the dying Pessoa to tell him that he didn't leave Portugal. Am I missing something here?? In short, any average reader of Pessoa can write a better book on the confrontations of the heteronyms with their creator."},{"Title":"Thy Father's Son: A Novel","review":"This completely different take on the standard Mafia genre has alot going for it.

His search ultimately leads him to find those roots, but only by getting deeper into the &quot;Life&quot;.

With the streets of New York City as a background, this terrific book could become a great movie."},{"Title":"Thy Father's Son: A Novel","review":"Thy Father's Son is old-fashioned in the best sense: it's set in early 60s New York on the brink of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and centers around the Five Families of the Mafia and their struggle for power. But the novel isn't just about the Italian mafia; it also links back (via the novel's central character, a boxer called Davey Rossi who is the adopted son of a Don), to the... mobsters of the 20s and 30s and their war with the newly-arrived gangsters from Sicily for control of the city. That's what makes it different from The Godfather and, for that matter, The Sopranos (with which it has almost nothing in common). And there's a stylish quality to the book, with the suits and hats and nightclubs and hideaways all described faithfully by someone who clearly knows New York as it was. But maybe the best stuff in the book is the boxing; if you like reading about the fights, this novel has two or three of the most visceral boxing sequences ever put on paper, it's like you are ringside with the blood and sweat hitting you in the face.

Hughes thrillers reprinted by FEMINIST PRESS. The other, IN A LONELY PLACE, is a classic of historical significance in the crime genre: beautifully written, well-characterized, and chilling.THE BLACKBIRDER, by contrast, is your bog-standard women's suspense: More interesting, historically, than some, but only barely entertaining, and with the same old obligatory plot \\"twists\\" you can see coming from chapter one. FEMINIST PRESS would have done better by Hughes' reputation to have re-printed RIDE THE PINK HORSE or THE EXPENDABLE MAN instead. And THE DAVIDIAN REPORT made a far better potboiler.This does have some good stuff in it, though. The heroine is a French WWII refugee who has illegally taken shelter in the USA, and who is seeking out a \\"blackbirder\\" to smuggle her fiance into the country. Meanwhile, of course, US agents are looking for the blackbirder to shut him down - since such men are also the means by which enemy spies enter the country. It is an interesting premise, and Hughes descriptive abilities bring the various locations - particularly in New Mexico - to life. The heroine is not a complete idiot, but her competence doesn't do her much good, as she is straight-jacketed by the conventions of the genre.The book throws a little light on some aspects of the refugee experience, and in that sense wasn't a complete waste of my time.

Flashbacks describe Julie's even more terrifying ordeal when she escaped from Occupied France to Cuba, and then, illegally, to the USA. Fleeing Paris from her guardian Uncle Paul, whom she has discovered is a Nazi collaborator with nefarious plans for her hefty inheritance, she hopes to find the love of her life, Paul, and the mysterious \\"Blackbirder,\\"known to provide assistance to refugees who want to enter, or leave, America.

Populated with people involved in clandestine resistance movements as well as those suspected of German \\"fifth column\\"operations in America, The Blackbirder represents a classic spy thriller of the period with its plot of wartime espionage and the struggles of people seeking freedom from fascist rule. The lengthy Afterword does a top knot job describing the book's backstory, Nazi occupied France, as well as a well deserved portrait of Hughes' writing style and place in American literature.The Blackbirder is part of Feminist Press's \\"FemmesFatales: Women Write Pulp\\" series which has restored to print the \\"best of women's writing in the classic pulp genres, originally published in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.\\""},{"Title":"The Blackbirder (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Give the women mystery writers a chance! A great page turner. I can just imagine Hitchcock doing a job on this one. It's a no-frills mystery. If you enjoy WWII era movies (black and white) you'll love this thriller. Sit back and enjoy. I read it on the beach and lost all track of time."},{"Title":"The Blackbirder (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"This novel is missing any characterization of the main female character. It starts out with the woman, a refugee from Nazi-occupied France, in New York City, quickly on the run because she fears the Nazis are after her in New York City. No reason given, nothing to make us care about her as a character. On and on it goes, with the heroine's stratagems to dodge pursuit from New York City to Santa Fe, New Mexico, suspicious of a \\"gray man\\" on the train. Apparently written during World War II, seemingly as a propaganda piece, Hughes must have felt no context was necessary, that we would root for the heroine simply because she ran from the Nazis. Her goal was a 'blackbirder' who would fly her and her beloved Fran [a man she hopes to be reunited with] over the Mexican border to safety--as if the Nazis couldn't easily follow into Mexico. There she encounters more hugger-mugger in a village outside Santa Fe. Hughes handles the escape passages decently, but that's all there is. Nada else. Words which make no sense often appear in sentences, likely because the original text was scanned, creating these mistakes. Since the book was published in the 1940s, Hughes probably is no longer alive to correct the text; but someone should have. A very disappointing read, missing the essential elements that make reading a novel worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Blackbirder (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"Dorothy B. Hughes was a literary critic as well as a writer. She writes like someone who knows about good writing but can't quite do it herself. Still, an interesting, if dated, read. I'm still trying to imagine what a \\"voice like a wet twig\\" sounds like though. I'll give Expendable Man a try when it becomes available for Kindle."},{"Title":"The Blackbirder (Femmes Fatales : Women Write Pulp)","review":"The Blackbirder is about a woman who illegally enters the United States and has to travel across the US to find a 'blackbirder', someone who can help her with little problems about border crossings. It's told from the woman's point of view, and the action takes place in WWII America. The scenes of America, especially headed west on trains are great.The constant strain of not knowing who can help and who wants to hurt you brings a palpable presence to the feel of the novel. I especially like the grittiness of the heroine. Although often discouraged, she does not give up, and it isn't because she is some cardboard character. Hughes is a master of psychological rendering and although this isn't quite In a Lonely Place or Ride the Pale Horse, it's a damn find read from one of our more neglected authors. Hughes really does belong up there with Cain, Chandlet, and Hammett.As an added plus, there is some great color about what life is like for Hispanics in the West at this time, and although this is just one of many scenes, the detail and realism Hughes imparts about these people will not be soon forgotten.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"OK, this story was sweet but what in the world happened to the editing? I am sorry but when I have to pick up a pen and make grammatical corrections, I get ticked off. I was amazed at how great the story is but how poorly it was written. I strongly suggest use of an editor. An editor is the authors best friend when it comes to their writing. I am still not sure if I understand how this book was published without it being edited. For such a great story-I am sure the book will need to be edited before it goes any further. I suggest editing it right away!"},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"A good storyline but it could have been more grammatically correct. All of the characters showed depth and projected the real emotional situations that most college students deal with. Its focus on the importance of higher education is commendable. Camille overcame obstacles that would have discouraged most, yet they only forced her to strive harder. Its setting: on a college campus with all the studying, mentoring, forging of friendships, organizations, love interests and partying, created a reminiscing effect for those that had the opportunity to partake of the college experience. All and all Strivers Row is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"Strivers Row is a good, different story that encompasses a little bit of everything--family, frendships, romance, academics and nostaglia for those who want to return to those college days. Grandmother Mary was something else; she did somewhat redeem herself, but Aunt Phyl saved the day. Strivers Row is about setting goals, working hard, realizing your dream and reaching back to help others. Add this delightful debut novel to your reading collection."},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"Definitely a must read, especially for the new and upcoming college freshman.Camille's childhood loss of her mother and the separation from her siblings brings insightful challenges and welcomed peace as she continues to set and achieve goals for herself and for her immediate family.You will suddenly find yourself back in your college days where life was just beginning and some of the relationships and decisions you made had lifetime affects. As you follow Camille's life in this book you can't wait to see what happens next.Thank you April Coley for an uplifting and wonderful story of drive and determination against all odds."},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Strivers Row. I recommend to everyone. Although Camille was an inspiration to her peers as not to be deterred from her goals of college and what she believed a college education would do for her and her family, anyone can take that same determination and apply it toward their next goal. Camille was not swayed nor did she allow anyone or anything to get in her way or cause her to lose focus on what she was doing. I loved her sense of family and how she wanted to do whatever it took to keep them together. I am delighted to have a personally signed copy of Strivers Row! Congratulations, April. A job well done!"},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"I would advise everyone to try this book. I am a former employee who had the pleasure to work under April Coley for three years. I have sinced moved on, but still communicate with her for advice and guidance. I feel sure everyone will be able to relate to this book."},{"Title":"Strivers Row","review":"Strivers Row made me reflect upon my own college days and the struggles of reaching adulthood. I read this book in 24 hours, while crying and laughing. Camille is a very inspiring and down to earth young woman who is detertmine to succeed. I learned a great deal from Camille. April Smith Coley has excellent writing style. I would highly recommend this book, and look forward eagarly to more from the authur."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"Williams has taken us into the mind and soul of a slave and recreated Dessa's experience with a searing feeling of authenticity. This is a notable piece of fiction; it should be part of history courses studying slavery."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"I recently picked up an old copy of Dessa Rose and began to read. Although I found it slow in the very beginning, it became one of the few books I can truely say I couldn't put down. Anyone that is interested in slavery should read this book. It is an eye opener for sure."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"I purchased Dessa Rose as resource for my Thesis work. I was told that it was a fictional account of a meeting between a real slave woman and white abolitionist. It was one of many resources, but it was the most surprising. I did not know what to expect. In the end, I was pleased. I recommended that the book be added to the syllabi for our Black Women Writer's Course next Fall."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"I loved it. Especially the way it starts off. It grabs you right away. The men in the story were Real men. I did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"This was a great purchase! I needed the book for school, and it shipped quickly so that I jad it in time for class. Quality was everything I expected, and service was excellant."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"I got this book after I saw the musical. I wasn't disappointed. Great story, gripping tale."},{"Title":"DESSA ROSE.","review":"This book is mistitled, it should be Days of Our Slaves because Dessa and the slave have no choice but to give into their istresses sexual and emotional demands. An inequality of power through one human being actually being the possession of another cannot broker to a \\"love story\\". Though touched on as an issue. Thsi book decides to take the cheating/easy way out and equate this power imbalance to \\"love\\". Deplorable. I studied/worked on this book in a high level college class that related Slave Narratives and Sadomasochism. This book does play around that area, as does the Black Book by Mapplethorpe and Langston Hughes travel books. THe Slaves Narratives/Incidents in teh Life of a Slave Girl is a stronger book though I have issues with that as well.Don't get me wrong I appreciate the strength fo the writing AS writing. However I have studied and taught African American literature so I have a keen understanding as to the problems, one of which is that if it is African American pablum is tllerable within the genre now. The freedom of mass publication and right to produce literature has been reduced to normalized American pablum. Therefore this kind of literature has availed itself to the destructive consequences, which is thorough criticism and dissection."},{"Title":"CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY","review":"When she was in the third grade my older sister bought a little book of christmas stories with the nickles she had saved by not having milk at break time. &quot;Christmas Every Day&quot; is our favorite story from this carefully preserved little book. Our mother still reads &quot;Christmas Every Day&quot; every year for her grandchildren. Though we are all grown we still enjoy the story too. Even my oldest sister's hyper-active 7 year old sit's quietly for his grandma's reading of &quot;Christmas Every Day.&quot;It was a great relief for me to find that Amazon.com had &quot;Christmas Every Day&quot; because the little book my sister brought home in the early 1960's is quickly becoming too fragile to handle.
